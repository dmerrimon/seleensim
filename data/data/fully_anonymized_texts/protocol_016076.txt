Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, outpatient study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of 2  doses of dasotraline (4 and 6 mg/day)  versus placebo over a 
12-week treatment period  in adults with BED. Subjects will be randomized to 3 treatment groups in a 
1:1:1 ratio (4  mg/day dasotraline, 6 mg/day dasotraline, and placebo). 
Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo for the duration of the treatment period. 
Subjects randomized to 4 mg/day dasotraline will receive 4  mg/day for the du ration of the treatment 
period. Subjects randomized to 6 mg/day dasotraline will be dosed with 4  mg/day dasotraline for the first 
2 weeks of the treatment period and will be increased to 6 mg/day at Week  2. 
If, in the judgment of the Investigator , the subject does not tolerate the assigned dose, he or she will be 
discontinued from the study. 
The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 3 weeks), 12 -weeks of treatment, and  a 3-week 
study drug withdrawal period. Subjects who complete the 12-week double-blind treatment period in 
this study may be eligible to enroll and continue treatment for an additional 12 mont hs in an open- label 
extension study (Study SEP360 -322; see Figure 1). Subjects who do not enter the extension study will 
complete the study drug withdr awal period in this study.  
Efficacy will be evaluated at each visit using the subject binge eating diary and a clinician interview to 
assess the frequency of binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_708472], defined as days with at least one 
binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Addi tional assessments will include BE-CGI-S, Y-BOCS -BE, MADRS, HAM -A, SDS , 
and EDE- Q modified. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_708517], ECGs, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, C-SSRS, body 
weight, and BMI will be calcula ted. Subjects who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon 
completion of the C-SSRS at any time during the study must be referred to the Investigator  for follow -
up evaluation. Assessment of potentia l withdrawal effects will be conducted via administration of the 
CSSA, DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS at the end of treatment and during the 3- week study medication 
withdrawal period.  
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics ( PK) and biomarkers associated with eating disorders (to be 
determined) will be collected. Blood samples collected for PK assessment will be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of dasotraline. The relationship between dasotraline plasma concentration and the 
primary and selected secondary clinical outcome measures will be evaluated . The relationship between 
biomarkers associated with eating disorders in relationship to the severity of BED and response to dasotraline will be evaluated  at a later date in the development program . Plasma samples collected for 
PK and biomarker concentration analysis may also be used for the additional characterization of and/or 
bioanalytical method development for dasotraline. 
A blood sample will be collected from subjects who provide separate informed consent for pharmacoge nomics (PGx) analysis for potential evaluation of associations between genetic 
polymorphisms such as, but not limited to Taq1DRD2, OPRM1, and DRD4 -7R, and the severity of 
Protocol SEP360-321 Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Proprietary 6  17 Nov 2017 BED, the clinical response to dasotraline, in addition to the safety, efficacy, and P K profiles of 
dasotraline to be conducted at a later date in the development program. Separate consent is required for 
collection of this specific blood sample and will be obtained at Screening for subjects who agree to provide this sample (note: this sepa rate consent is not required for participation in the study, it is 
required only for subjects who will provide this sample). 
A comprehensive Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP) for dasotraline designed to detect potential 
abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor AEs consistent with the known pharmacology for dasotraline will be implemented.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data at regular 
intervals.  
Screening Period (Days -22 to - 2): Informed consent will  be obtained from each subject before any 
study procedures are performed for this study. Study eligibility criteria will be assessed during this 
period, and subjects will be required to have discontinued from any protocol prohibited medications within [ADDRESS_963007]’s eligibility assessment will be reviewed by [CONTACT_448797]’s (CRO) oversight quality team along with the sponsor based on protocol specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The sponsor will participate in the eligibility review process 
with the CRO to ascertain the subject’s eligibility and will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_708473]. In the event the CRO/sponsor and site do not agree on a subject’s eligibility then 
the subject will not be enrolled. Subjects may be rescreened once for out of range clinical laboratory  
results including urine drug screen (UDS) or ECG results following authorization of the medical 
monitor . During the screening visit, subjects will be trained to complete  the daily binge eating diary 
and then complete the diary at home for at least 14 consecutive days immediately prior to the Baseline visit and starting no sooner than the day after the screening visit. 
Baseline Visit (Day  -1): Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria at Screening will return to the study site 
on Day - 1 for confirmation of screening evaluations as well as completion of predose assessments and 
procedures including clinician review of the daily binge eating diary. Any lapse in diary completion 
during the 14 day period (eg, 1 or more days are skipped) will be discussed with the subject. If [ADDRESS_963008] will be ineligible. Subjects will also be ineligible for randomization if there are more than 2 missed diary days in 1  week. Eligible subjects (based on confirmation of study entry 
criteria)  will be randomized and dispensed study drug at Day  -1. 
Treatment Period (Day  1 [Week  0] through Day  84 [Week  12]): Subjects will self -administer the 
study drug on an outpatient basis once a day with or without food beginning on Day 1, the day after the Baseline visit, and continue for [ADDRESS_963009] month, then one clinic visit every 2 weeks thereafter. In order to facilitate scheduling of clinic visits, a 
window of ±  2 days will be allowed for each weekly clinic visit and a window of ± 3 days will be 
allowed for each biweekly clinic visit.  
Subjects who complete the 12 -week Treatment Period may be eligible for participation in the open 
label extension study (S EP360-322). For subjects enrolling in the open label extension study, Week [ADDRESS_963010] visit for this study.  
Study Medication Withdrawal Period (Day  85 through Day 105 [Week  15]): Subjects who do not 
enroll in the extension study for whatever reason, eg, less than [ADDRESS_963011] in the extension study, or failure to  meet all eligibility criteria for the extension study will 
return to the clinic at Weeks 13, 14, and 15, to assess safety and potential study medication withdrawal 
effects during the study medication withdrawal period. Subjects who discontinue from study drug 
Protocol SEP360-321 Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Proprietary 7  17 Nov 2017 before completion of the 12 -week treatment period will be asked to return to t he clinic and complete 
the End of Treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible following discontinuation of study drug and 
complete the 3  week withdrawal period. In addition, subjects will continue to complete the binge eating 
diary during this period. 
Assessment of potential withdrawal effects will be conducted via administration of the CSSA, DESS, 
HAM -A, and MADRS at Week  12 (End of Treatment), then again at Weeks 13, 14, and [ADDRESS_963012] dose of study drug, unless a clinic visit is scheduled for that day (up to [ADDRESS_963013] 2  attempts). Clinical site staff will record the responses in the subject’s source information and

Pharmacokinetic Endpoint:   
Relationship between dasotraline plasma concentration and the pr imary endpoint in addition to selected 
secondary efficacy and safety endpoints  
Statistical Methods:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
The primary efficacy analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint (the change from baseline in the 
number of binge days per week at Week  12) will be performed using a likelihood-based mixed model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) model on the Intent- to-Treat ( ITT) population. The response 
(dependent) variable is the change from baseline in the number of binge days per week assessed at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Specifically, the MMRM model includes fixed effects terms for 
treatment, visit (as a categorical  variable), pooled center , baseline binge days category (stratification 
factor ; refer to Section  7.2.1 for categories), the number of binge days per week at baseline, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation method will be applied using 
an unstructured covar iance model. The Kenward Roger approximation will be used to estimate 
denominator degrees of freedom. In case of a failure of convergence with the unstructured covariance, the following structures will be assessed in a sequential order: heterogeneous Toepl itz, Toeplitz, spatial 
exponential covariance pattern model. Of the above [ADDRESS_963017] 
squares ( LS) mean treatment differences (each dasotraline group minus placebo) of change from 
baseline at Week  12, their 2- sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the associated p -values will be 
calculated based on this model. The model assumptions underlying the primary analysis will be 
assessed.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the Per Protocol (PP) population to examine the impact of premature dropouts and/or protocol deviat ions. 
The primary efficacy endpoint also will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, as a supportive analysis. The model 
will include terms for treatment, pooled center , baseline  binge days category (stratification factor), and 
Protocol SEP360-321 Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Proprietary 11  17 Nov 2017 the number of binge days per week at baseline as covariates.  
To address early dropouts under the assumption of missing not at random (MNAR), a pattern-mixture 
model using a placebo- based multiple imputation  method and a pattern mixture model using multiple 
imputations with penalties (ie, deflating the individually estimated treatment effect size by [CONTACT_708520]) will be performed as sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the MMRM results for 
the primary analysis. In case of a deviation from the assumptions required for the primary analysis, to 
confirm the robustness of the primary analysis result, 2 additional sensitivity analyses will be 
performed: (1) permutation test: fit a large number of data sets based on a same MMRM for the primary 
analysis with randomly assigning pseudo-treatment group designations; (2) generalized linear mixed 
model (GLMM) analysis: fit count data over time (ie, number of binge days among number of assessed 
days at each per iod) based on a binomial distribution. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Continuous key secondary variables (ie, change in BE-CGI-S score and Y -BOCS -BE total score) will 
be analyzed with an MMRM model similar to the primary efficacy analysis (adjust ed with the 
corresponding baseline). The LS mean treatment differences (each dasotraline group minus placebo) of 
change from baseline at Week  12, their 2- sided 95% CIs, and the associated p -values will be calculated 
based on the model. C ategorical key secondary efficacy endpoints (ie, percent of subjects with a 
4-week cessation from binge eating) will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment, 
baseline binge days category (stratification factor), and baseline number of binge days per week  as 
covariates using a LOCF approach based on the ITT population. The odds ratios, their 2-sided 95% CIs, and the associated p -values for each dasotraline group over the placebo group will be derived 
from the model. Additional supportive and sensitivity analyses may be conducted as needed for the key secondary endpoints to address early dropouts or potential deviations from the model assumption(s). 
Multiplicity Adjustment 
To control the overall type I error rate strongly at 5% for the primary and key second ary endpoints, for 
the hypotheses to be tested  (see Section  15.2 ), a sequential testing strategy will be  used. Following the 
fixed sequence closed t esting procedure provided in Figure  2, testing will only proceed conditional on 
the statistical significance of the test(s) of prior level(s) at a 2 -sided 5% significan ce level . 
Safety Analyses:  
Safety data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_708521]-blind (DB) Safety population (for data up to the end of treatment period) and Withdrawal safety population (for data collected during the 
withdrawal period), separately, as appropriate. 
Overall AEs (or SAEs) and AEs (or SAEs) leading to discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group by [CONTACT_708522].  
Descriptive statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_708523]. The change from baseline value at endpoint for selected laboratory 
parameters (eg, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fa sting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting 
HDL cholesterol, and fasting LDL cholesterol) will be evaluated using an ANCOVA model with terms 
for treatment and baseline binge days group, and corresponding baseline as covariate or nonparametric 
rank ANCOVA, as appropriate. A similar MMRM model as for the primary efficacy variable (with the 
corresponding baseline) will be applied to compare dasotraline with placebo for the following safety variables: change and percent change from baseline in body weight (kg); and change and percent 
change from baseline in BMI. Frequency and severity of suicidality using the C- SSRS will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_708524]-baseline treatment period and for the withdrawal period, separately.  
CSSA total score, DESS total score, MADRS total score, and HAM- A total score will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_708525]  12/EOT by [CONTACT_708526]360-321 Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Proprietary 12  17 Nov 2017 visit for the withdrawal period.  
All PK data will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3232]. 
Sample Size: The sample size for this study was estimated based on 2  hypotheses associated with the 
primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in number of binge days per week at Week  12). A 
fixed sequence closed testing procedure was  used  to adjust for 2  comparisons of  dasotraline doses vs 
placebo (ie, with dasotraline [ADDRESS_963018] and dasotraline 4  mg vs placebo tested after if 
the previous one is significant at the 0.05 level  ) for the sample size justification.  Based on the Study 
SEP360 -[ADDRESS_963019] deviation ( SD) of 1.75 and a mean improvement of 
0.9 (effect size 0.517) and 0.8 (effect size 0.457) over placebo for change from baseline in number of 
binge days per week at Week  12 for dasotraline 6 mg/day and 4 mg/day doses respectively, a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_963020] 85% conjunctive power to reject both null hypotheses. An upward adjustment of approximately 40% is assumed to compensate for subjects who 
are randomized but discontinue from the study, thus, a total sample of 480 subjects (160 subjects per group) will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1:1 for placebo, and dasotraline 4 mg/day and 6 mg/day. 
The sample size calculation was bas ed on Monte Carlo simulation from EAST 6.4.

a Subjects who discontinue from study drug before completion of the 12-week treatment period will be asked to return to the clinic and complete the End of Treatment visit as 
soon as possible following discontinuation of study drug and complete the 3-week withdrawal period.  
b Subjects who complete the 12-week treatment period and do not enter the extension study (Study SEP360-322) will complete the 3 -week withdrawal period.  
c For subjects who complete the 12 -week double -blind treatment period and enter the extension study (Study  SEP360 -322), Visit  [ADDRESS_963021] visit in this study. 
d  Includes family history of psychiatric disorders. 
e For the prebaseline review, sites will b e required to submit specific screening information for clinician and sponsor review, prior to proceeding to baseline. Detail s are provided 
in the Clinical Surveillance Team (CST) site manual.  
f All study  drug will be administered by [CONTACT_423], beginning  on Day  1, the day after the Baseline visit, once a day at approximately the same time each morning including on the 
days when clinic visits occur.  
g Missing data, if any, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_708528].  
h Subjects complete a daily binge eating diary to record the date, duration (total hours of binging), type of binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (meal or non- meal), amount and type of food, and number 
of binges beginning [ADDRESS_963022].  In 
addition, diaries will be sent to Bracket for central review.  
i The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for t he administration of the MADRS.  
j The Structured Interview Guide for the HAM -A (SIGH -A) will be used for the administration of the HAM- A. 
k Only for subjects not entering the extension study . 
l Clinical site staff will call the subject every other day ( ± 1 day) during the study medication withdrawal period, beginning the second day after the last dose of study drug, unless 
a clinic visit is scheduled for that day, in order to collect the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) and Discontinuation -Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS). 
Clinical site staff may call up to [ADDRESS_963023] the CSSA and DESS from the missed day(s) and the current day.  
m Body mass index (BMI) at screening will be calculated by [CONTACT_708529] ( Section  27, Appendix  VIII). BMI on all other visits 
will be derived within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  
n Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or item  5 (active suicidal ideation with specific 
plan and intent) on the C -SSRS assessment at Screening (in the past month) must be referred to the Investigator for follow up evaluation.  
o Untoward medical occurrences that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be collected as pre -treatment events.  
p Subjects must be fasting for at least 8  hours (may have water  and study drug ) prior to the indicated laboratory tests. Visits should be scheduled in the morning.

4.1. Background  
Binge eating disorder (BED) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(on average at least once per week for 3  months) of excess ive food consumption during a limited 
time period, accompanied by [CONTACT_708530] (BN) ( Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition [DSM -5]). BED is the most common eating disorder in 
the [LOCATION_002] and Western Europe, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.5% in adults 
(~3.5% in adult women, 2.0% in adult men, and 1.6% in adolescents) and a mean age of onset of 
25.4 ± 1.2 years (McElroy -2012, Kessler -2013, Hudson-2007 ). Binge eating  disorder is defined 
in DSM -5 as: 
• Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_708482]:  
− Eating an amount of food larger than what most people would eat, in a discrete period of time (eg, 2 hours) 
− Sense of lack of control over eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 
• Binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_446182] ≥ 3: 
− Eating much more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_340186]  
− Eating until uncomfortably full 
− Eating large amounts when not feeling hungry 
− Eating  alone because of embarrassment  
− Feeling disgusted with oneself, guilty afterward  
• Marked distress regarding binge eating is present  
• Binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3  months 
• Not associated with recurrent use of compensatory behavior (eg, bulimia nervosa). 
Patients with BED show significantly higher prevalence or risk for a range of comorbid 
psychiatric and medical disorders when compared to healthy individuals. The majority of 
patients fulfill Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition ( DSM -IV) 
criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and phobias. BED 
patients also have a 2 -3 fold greater risk for physical ailments, including obesity, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain. Taken togeth er, these findings signify that BED presents a 
major public health problem with significant social and economic consequences (Kessler-2013). Considering the severity of clinical symptomology, the negative impact on quality of life and 
physical measures of health, there is a significant need for safe and efficacious treatments for 
adults with BED.  
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.[ADDRESS_963033] circui t in the pathogenesis of eating and addictive disorders, including 
binge eating disorder ( Murray -2014, Gold- 2013, Smith-2013, Hoebel-1989). In particular, 
disturbances in dopamine and the dopamine D 2/[ADDRESS_963034] circuit (Murray -2014, 
Ikemoto -1997, Carlezon -1995 ). Rats continuously fed a cafeteria diet or a high -fat, high sugar 
meal show reduced levels of dopamine and dopamine D 2/[ADDRESS_963035] circuit ( van de Giessen -2012, van de Giessen -2013). 
Knockout of striatal dopamine D 2 receptors induces compulsive-type behavior in response to 
highly palatable food ( Johnson-2010). High -fat diets are associated with reduced dopamine 
transporter (DAT) expression and dopamine efflux ( Speed -2011). In non- clinic al studies of drug 
abuse, reduced availability of dopamine D 2 receptors in the striatum lead to increased and 
habitual drug intake, further supporting the importance of this transmitter system in addictive 
behaviors, and suggesting that BED and other impulse control disorders, such as substance 
abuse, share overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_708483] ( Trifilieff-2014, Smith -2013).  
Clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging studies of eating behaviors in humans have shown parallel disturbances in the brain reward circuit and dopamine transmission in patients with BED, 
including reduced availability of dopamine D
2 receptors in the striatum (Murray -2014, 
Smith -2013). Down regulation of dopamine D [ADDRESS_963036] circuit in BED patients comes from neuroimaging studies using 
positron emission tomography (PET). Administration of methylphenidate, an inhibitor of the 
dopamine reuptake transporter, results in greater increases in dopamine levels in the caudate 
nucleus in response to food in BED patients when compared to individuals without BED. These increases are significantly correlated with binge eating scores ( Wang -2011 ). Further in vivo 
support for the role of the dopaminergic system in regulating reward behaviors has come from PET studies in methamphetamine addicted individuals and healthy volunteers, which have shown negative correlations between impulsivity, a core personality trait in BED patients, and 
availability of dopamine D
2/3 receptors in the striatum and midbrain ( Lee-2009, 
Buckholtz-2010).  
Similar to findings from the PET studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies 
show a dysregulated and hyper-responsive reward circuit in response to food in BED patients. 
Exposure to high- calorie or highly palatable food stimuli elicits greater activation in reward 
areas, such as the nucleus accumbens and orbital frontal cortex in BED patients compared to 
controls, which directly correlates with the severity of binge eating symptoms ( Schienle-2009, 
Filbey -2012). Together results from these studies show that dysregulation of the dopaminergic 
driven reward circuit is associated with BED an d suggest that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_708484].

Although cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_708485], many patients do not respond ( McElroy -2012 ). Recent studies suggest that 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_708486] a critical role in its management (McElroy -2012). 
Several classes of pharmacological agents have been evaluated for the treatment of BED in 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled or open-label studies, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antiobesity agents, anticonvulsants, and stimulants (Hudson-1998, 
McElroy -2000, Arnold-2002, McElroy -2003A , Stunkard-1996, Appolinario-2003, Grilo -2005, 
McElroy -2003B , McElroy -2006, McElroy -2007, Leombruni-2006, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Lisdexamfetamine  dimesylate is a central nervous stimulant indicated for the treatment of attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) . In two 12–week, randomized, placebo-controlled 
registration studies, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate showed significant reductions in binge eating frequency ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and these results supported FDA approval of 
Vyvanse® as a treatment for adults with BED ( Shire -2015).  
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Dasotraline (also known as SEP-225289), a new chemical entity currently in clinical trials for 
BED and ADHD, blocks the pre-synaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepi[INVESTIGATOR_542675] (NET). Unlike psychostimulants such as amphetamine, which facilitate the direct release of dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ( Hutson-2014, Minzenberg-2012), dasotraline is a dual 
reuptake inhibitor (dopamine/norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331]; DNRI). Dasotraline has a long 
time to maximum concentration (t
max; approximately 10 to 12 hours after dosing) and mean 
apparent half -life (47.1 to 77.0 hours). 
A non-clinic al study was conducted to compare the acute effects of dasotraline in a rat model of 
BED with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, and its pharmacologically active metabolite, 
d-amphetamine. Rats that were allowed irregular and limited access to chocolate developed 
robust and intermittent hy perphagia that mirrored BED without any associated obesity. Binge 
eating of chocolate was markedly reduced by a single oral dose of dasotraline. The reduction in chocolate consumption was dose dependent and comparable to the effects observed with both lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and d-amphetamine in this rat BED model.  
Previous clinical stud ies support dasotraline as a potentially safe and efficacious treatment option 
for adults with ADHD. In one study, adults taking dasotraline 8 mg/day experienced a significant 
improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_708531] (ADHD- RS-IV) with adult prompts total score 
(P = .010, effect size 0.41). A trend was seen for efficacy of the dasotraline 4  mg/day dose 
compared to placebo on the ADHD- RS-IV at Week  4 study endpoint (P  = .076). Statistically 
significant improvement compared to placebo was observed in Clinical Global Impression-
Severity scale (CGI -S) scores at Week  4 for both the 4 and 8 mg/day doses. In a second study, 
the dasotraline 6  mg/day group showed numerically greater improvement relative to placebo in 
ADHD symptoms  at Week  8 study endpoint, as measured by [CONTACT_554003]- RS-IV with adult 
prompts , that was not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (least

6 mg/day group was statistically superior to placebo on the ADHD- RS-IV at the Week  4 
(P =.027), Week 6 (P  =.019), and Week 8 (P = .037) timepoints (non-adjusted p-values). 
Statistically significant improvement on the CGI -S was also observed for the 6 mg/day group at 
Weeks  4 and 6, as well as at the Week  8 study endpoint (P = .011). The dasotraline 4 mg/day 
group did not show improvement relative to placebo on the ADHD- RS-IV and CGI- S 
assessments at the Week  [ADDRESS_963037] frequent adverse events (AEs) reported in the se 
ADHD studies  were insomnia, decreased appet ite, and dry mouth. In addition, significant dose 
dependent decreases were observed in appetite and weight. Increases in mean supi[INVESTIGATOR_708487] ( HR) observed during treatment and follow- up were generally dose 
dependent. 
A recently completed 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexibly-dosed, 
study (SEP360-221) of dasotraline (4, 6, or 8 mg/day) in adults with BED showed significant 
reduction in the number of binge eating days/week compared to placebo at Week 12 (P < .0001) 
with an effect size of 0.74. S ignificant separation from placebo was observed at all weeks 
starting at Week  1 (P < .0001). In addition, dasotraline achieved significant results compared to 
placebo in the key secondary endpoints including improvement in the BE -CGI-S (P < .0001, 
effect size = 0.95); reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating ( YBOCS -BE) score ( P < .0001, effect size = 0.96); and a greater number of 
subjects achieving 4 -week cessation from binge eating (P < .0001; effect size = 0.66). The 
highest incidence of AEs  for subjects receiving dasotraline (≥ 5%) in descending order were 
insomnia, dry mouth, decreased appetite, anxiety, nausea, decreased weight , headache, dizziness, 
irritability, dyspepsia, constipation, thirst, and diarrhoea. There were no deaths in this study and 
1 serious adverse event ( SAE ) was reported (suicidal ideation). There were no clinically 
important changes in vital signs or electrocardiograms ( ECG ) observed except for a mild 
increase in pulse rate and orthostatic pulse rate, consistent with the known pharmacology of dasotraline. 
The current study is being conducted to replicate the efficacy results from Study SEP360 -221, to 
explore the dose response, and to further assess the safety and tolerability of dasotraline in the 
treatment of BED.  
4.3. Risk -Benefit Assessme nt 
Overall, in previous clinical studies dasotraline was generally safe and well tolerated. An 
overview of safety results from the recently com pleted study in adult subjects with BED is  
presented in Section  4.2. To date, over [ADDRESS_963038] received one or more doses of 
dasotraline during the clinical development programs in ADHD, BED, and major depressive 
disorder ( MDD ) in the range of 0.5 to 32 mg/day. A total of >  [ADDRESS_963039] been well characterized and are as expected 
given the DAT/NET pharmacology. The most common AEs in the BED study were similar to 
findings in studies of adult  subjects  with ADHD. 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  35 17 Nov 2017 In an effort to ma ximize tolerability, an initial dose of 4  mg/day for 2 week s will be used for the 
dasotraline 6  mg/day treatment arm in this study . 
Dasotraline was evaluated in a dedicated human abuse liability study and compared with 
methylphenidate and placebo. Unlike methylphenidate, dasotraline did not differentiate from placebo on the primary end-point of Drug Liking and was disliked at the highest dose studied 
(36 mg). Standardized queries, as well as a comprehensive Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan 
(APMP), have not detected signals of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal across clinical 
studies with dasotraline.  
The current study will be conducted in accordance with relevant regulatory guidance and law with regards to handling, distribution, storage, dispensation, accountability, and destruction of study drug. In addition the APMP will be implemented for this study ( Section  26, 
Appendix VII).  Additionally, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established 
for this study to  review safety data at regular intervals.  
An overview of efficacy results from the recently completed study in adult subjects with BED is 
presented in Section  4.2. Dasotraline was statistically superior to placebo in change from 
baseline in the numbe r of binge eating days/week at Week  12 with  highly statistically significant 
separation from placebo observed at each week starting at Week 1. The study also met all 3 key 
secondary endpoints . 
The current study is designed to optimize the balance of efficacy and tolerability of dasotraline in 
the treatment of adult subjects with BED.  
4.4. Hypothese s 
4.4.1. Primary Hypotheses  
In adults with moderate to severe BED, after 12 weeks of treatment,  
• Dasotraline 6 mg/day reduces change from baseline in the number of binge days per 
week relative to placebo  
• Dasotraline 4 mg/day reduces change from baseline in the number of binge days per 
week relative to placebo  
4.4.2. Secondary Hypotheses  
In adults with moderate to severe BED , after 12  weeks of treatment, 6  mg/day dasotraline or both 
doses of dasotraline: 
• Reduce change from baseline in BE-CGI-S score relative to placebo  
• Provide a greater proportion of subjects with a 4- week cessation from binge eating at 
Week  12 relative to placebo 
• Reduce change from baseline in Y -BOCS -BE total score relative to placebo

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, outpatient study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of 2  doses of dasotraline (4 and 6 mg/day)  versus placebo over a 12- week 
treatment period in adults with BED. This study is projected to randomize approximately 
480 subjects to 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio ( 4 mg/day dasotraline, 6 mg/day dasotraline, 
and placebo).  
Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo for the duration of the treatment period. 
Subjects randomized to 4 mg/day dasotraline will receive 4 mg/day for the duration of the 
treatment period .  
Subjects randomized to 6 mg/day dasotraline will be dosed with 4  mg/day dasotraline for the 
first 2  weeks of the treatment period and will be i ncreased to 6  mg/day at Week  2. 
If, in the judgment of the Investigator, the subject does not tolerate the assigned dose, he or she 
will be discontinued from the study. 
The study will consist of 3  periods: Screening (up to 3 weeks), 12-weeks of treatment, and a 
3-week study drug withdrawal period. Subjects who complete the 12-week double-blind 
treatment period in this study may be eligible to enroll and continue treatment for an additional 
12 months in an open- label extension study (S tudy SEP360-322). Subjects who do not enter the 
extension study will complete the study drug withdrawal period in this study. A study schematic

Blood samples for pharmacokinetics ( PK) and biomarkers associated with eating disorders (to be 
determined ) will be collected. Blood samples collected for PK assessment will be analyzed for 
plasma concentrations of dasotraline. The relationship between dasotraline plasma concentration 
and the primary and selected secondary clinical outcome measures will be evaluated. The 
relationship between biomarkers associated with eating disorders in relationship to the severity

to more closely monitor AEs consistent with the known pharmacology for dasotraline will be 
implemented (see Section  26, Appendix VII for d etails).  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data at regular intervals.  
Screening Period (Days  -22 to -2): Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before 
any study procedures are performed for this study. S tudy eligibility criteria will be assessed 
during this period, and subjects will be required to have discontinued from any protocol prohibited medications within [ADDRESS_963041]’s eligibility assessment will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_3995] r esearch organization’s (CRO) oversight quality team along with the 
sponsor based on protocol specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The sponsor will participate

copi[INVESTIGATOR_708473]. In the event the CRO/sponsor and 
site do not agree on a subject’s eligibility then the subject will not be enrolled. Subjects may be 
rescreened once for out of range clinical laboratory res ults including urine drug screen (UDS) or 
ECG results  following authorization of the medical monitor . During the screening visit, subjects 
will be trained to complete the daily binge eating diary and then complete the diary at home for at least 14  consecut ive days immediately prior to the Baseline visit and starting no sooner than 
the day after the screening visit. 
Baseline Visit (Day  -1): Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the 
study site on Day -1 for confirmation of screening evaluations as well as completion of predose 
assessments and procedures including clinician review of the daily binge eating diary. Any lapse 
in diary completion during the 14 day period (eg, 1 or more days are skipped) will be discussed 
with the subject. If [ADDRESS_963043] will be ineligible. Subjects will also be 
ineligible for randomization if there are more than 2  missed diary days in 1  week. Eligible 
subjects (based on confirmation of study entry criteria) will be randomized and dispensed study drug at Day -1. 
Treatment Period (Day  1 [Week 0] through Day 84 [Week 12]): Subjects will self -administer 
the study drug on an outpatient basis once a day with or without food beginning on Day 1, the 
day after the Baseline visit, and continue for [ADDRESS_963044] month, then one clinic visit every 2 weeks thereafter. In order to facilitate scheduling of clinic visits, a window of ±  2 days will be allowed for each weekly clinic 
visit and a window of ± 3 da ys will be allowed for each biweekly clinic visit, and a window of 
± 1 day for the end of treatment (EOT) visit and each clinic visit of the withdrawal period . 
Subjects who complete the 12- week Treatment Period may be eligible for participation in the 
open label extension study (SEP360-322). For subjects enrolling in the open label extension study, Week  [ADDRESS_963045] visit for this study.  
Study Medication Withdrawal Period (Day 85 through Day 105 [Week 15]): Subjects who 
do not enroll in the extension study for whatever reason, eg, less than [ADDRESS_963046] in the extension study, or failure to  meet all  eligibility criteria for the 
extension study will return to the clinic at Weeks  13, 14, and 15, to assess safety and potential 
study medication withdrawal effects during the study medication withdrawal period. Subjects 
who discontinue from study drug before completion of the 12- week treatment period will be 
asked to return to the clinic and complete the End of Treatment visit as soon as possible 
following discontinuation of study drug and complete the 3 week withdrawal period. In addition, 
subjects will continue to complete the binge eating diary during this period.  
Assessment of potential withdrawal effects will be conducted via administration of the CSSA, 
DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS at Week  12 (End of Treatment), then again at Weeks 13, 14, 
and [ADDRESS_963047] dose of study drug,

7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
After successfully meeting study entry criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  
• Dasotraline 4 mg/day 
• Dasotraline 6 mg/day 
• Placebo  
To avoi d potential imbalanced treatment allocation among subjects with different baseline levels 
of BED, the randomization will be balanced using permuted blocks with baseline number of 
binge eating days per week, which is defined as number of binge days/week determined from the 
2 weeks before the Baseline visit (3  – 4 binge eating days per week , > 4 binge eating days per 
week ). The stratification process will be handled by [CONTACT_309364], an integrated web- based subject 
and drug- management system.  
An IXRS will be used to manage randomization at Day - 1 and, if necessary, for emergency 
unblinding (see Section  7.2.3) of treatment assignment during the study.  
Study medi cation will be assigned by [CONTACT_708533]  -[ADDRESS_963050] will be dispensed one 10-day blister pack per scheduled visit up to and 
including Visit 5 and two 10- day blister packs per scheduled visit thereafter  through Visit 9. 
7.2.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind s tudy.  
Subjects, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations personnel, data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock (DBL) and unblinding, using the 
following methods: (1) randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of 
unblinding, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_29951] s tudy with the following 
exceptions: external bioanalytical personnel involved in the analysis of PK samples, DSMB 
members involved in regular review of safety data, external statistician and programmer who 
prepare materials for DSMB review, and Clinical Trial Materials Management personnel and 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  44 17 Nov 2017 (2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_708534], labeling, schedule of administration , and appearance.  
During the study and prior to database lock, the treatment assignments for all subjects will be 
provided to the Bioanalytical Contract Research Organization (CRO) t o facilitate plasma PK 
sample handling and analysis. No PK samples will be analyzed for placebo subjects. 
7.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
The IXRS will be used, if necessary, for emergency unblinding of treatment assignment during 
the study. The blinded dose information is to be broken only in an emergency when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions or aid in the emergency 
treatment of the subject. Every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_192141] 
(Table 1) before any unblinding of the study drug. The circumstances that lead to unblinding are 
to be promptly communicated via telephone and in writing to the CRO Medical Monitor. Any 
subject for whom the blind is broken is to be discontinued from receiving any additional study 
medication and should undergo final evaluation procedures, in accordance with the EOT Visit as described in Section  11.8.9. 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This study is being conducted in order to replicate the efficacy results from SEP 360-221 and to 
evaluate dose response to dasotraline in adult subjects with BED.  
Similar to Study SEP360 -221, the current study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasotraline over a 
12-week outpatient treatment period.  
In or der to evaluate dose response to dasotraline, this study is a fixed- dose design of 2 doses of 
dasotraline compared with placebo. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The dasotraline doses to be utilized in this study (4 mg/day and 6 mg/day) were selected based 
on the  effects of dasotraline in the initial BED study in adults, Study SEP360-221. 
In the current study, d asotraline will be administered once daily based on its pharmacokinetic 
profile . One dasotraline treatment arm will receive 4  mg/day for the duration of the treatment 
period, and the other arm randomized to 6 mg/day will receive 4  mg/day for the first 2  weeks of 
treatment.  
The 4  mg/day dose was chosen because e fficacy analys es in Study SEP360-221 at Week  2, 
where all dasotraline treated subjects were on 4  mg/day, showed a significant change from 
baseline in the number of binge days per week with an effect size 0.5. The 6  mg/day dasotraline 
dose was chosen because the results in Study SEP360-[ADDRESS_963051] that it was the modal 
dose in that study, whereas subjects on 8 mg/day were those who failed to respond to the lower doses. One-half of these subjects, however, did not respond to 8 mg/day. Together these results 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.[ADDRESS_963052] that 6  mg/day is the optimal dose with regards to benefit and risk and 4 mg/day is the 
minimum effective dose in the treatment of BED. SEP360 -[ADDRESS_963053] meet the DSM -5 criteria for a diagnosis of BED established using the eating-disorders module of the 
Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM -IV Axis I Disorders, Module H (SCID-I Module H), 
clinician  review of subject diaries, and the EDE- Q. These instruments have been extensively 
used in previous trials and show excellent reliability ( McElroy -2007, Hudson-1998, Grilo -2005). 
To optimize signal detection for the primary endpoint, enrolled subjects must have moderate to 
severe BED, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_963054] show n that patients with mild BED are 
behaviorally comparable to those who binge more frequently ( Wilson -2009). To reduce the 
potential confounding effects of comorbid disorders and certain concomitant medications on the efficacy and safety measures, subjects will be excluded who have significant or unstable 
comorbid medical disorders (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus); psychiatric disorders (eg, psychosis, bipolar disorder); and/or are taking medications used for the treatment of BED (eg, lisdexam fetamine dimesylate, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], SSRIs); or medications associated with weight 
gain or weight loss (eg, insulin, liraglutide, metformin, stimulants ). 
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The efficacy assessments and their timing are considered appropriate to assess  the efficacy of 
dasotraline in adults with BED and are consistent with those used in previous trials 
(McElroy -2007, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The symptom and  functional assessments 
were selected to address the potential effectiveness of dasotraline on these parameters. The 
standard safety assessments and their timing are appropriate to assess the safety of dasotraline in 
adults with BED.  
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study before s tudy 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented: (i) clinic visits every week for the first month, every 2 weeks for the remainder of double-blind treatment, and 
every week during the study drug withdrawal period, (ii) during the treatment period a window of ± 2 days for each weekly clinic visit , a window of ± 3 days for each biweekly clinic visit,  and 
a window of ± 1 day for the EOT visit (iii)  training the sites on the importance of continued 
follow-up and on the informed consent process, ensuring subjects understand the commitment they are making, including the intent to complete the trial, (iv)  the clinical sites will train subjects 
on appropriate binge eating diary completion at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5 and retraining wil l be 
provided throughout the study as needed, and (v) monitoring of data collection for adherence during the s tudy.

Confidential and Propr ietary  46 17 Nov 2017 8. SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
Approximately 480 total subjects will be randomized (1 60 subjects per treatment group) at 
approximately [ADDRESS_963055]’s eligibility assessment will be reviewed by [CONTACT_2024] ’s Clinical Surveillance Team 
(CST) along with the sponsor based on protocol specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
promote appropriate subject enrollment and data quality. For the prebaseline review, sites will be 
required to submit specific screening information for clinician and sponsor review, prior to 
proceeding to baseline. The sponsor will participate in the eligibility review process with the CRO to as certain the subject’s eligibility and will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_708489]. In the event the CRO/sponsor and site do not agree on a subject’s eligibility, then the subject will not be enrolled. Decisions regarding inclusion of subjects and assessment of subject safety throughout the trial primarily remain at the discretion of the Investigator; however, 
the Medical Monitor or Sponsor may request exclusion or discontinuation of a subject based on entry criteria or subject safety.  
Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria at both the Screening and 
Baseline visits unless otherwise noted under the Inclusion or Exclusion Criteria . Eligibility 
criteria involving clinical laboratory values will be based on resul ts from samples obtained at 
Screening.  
Subjects may be rescreened once for out of range clinical laboratory results including UDS or 
ECG results  following authorization of the medical monitor . Each time a subject is rescreened a 
new subject number will be assigned. Screening numbers cannot be reassigned to another subject.  
Subjects whose study participation is prematurely terminated will not be replaced.

data collected will be the same as for concomitant medications (see Section  10.3). 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  58 17 Nov 2017 Demographics collected at screening will include sex, race, ethnicity, date of birth, weight, and 
height. BMI will be calculated from weight and height.  
For medical history, only relevant/significant medical history and recurrence of any condition will be collected.  
At screening , subjects will be checked for multiple study enrollments by [CONTACT_708537](s) of subjects participating in clinical trials. Clinical site staff will be provided training 
11.2. Diagnostic Scales to Determine Study Eligibility  
11.2.1. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- IV Axis I Disorders, Module H (SCID -I 
Module H)  
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV Axis I Disorders, Module H (SCID-I Module H) 
is a primary diagnostic measure developed to establish the presence of binge eating disorder in 
adults. The SCID is often used to characterize a study population in terms of current and past psychiatric diagnoses ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] -1992, First -2007).  
11.2.2. Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE- Q)  
The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (E DE-Q) is a self -report version of the eating 
disorder examination (EDE) ( Fairburn -1994). Like the EDE, the EDE- Q measures 
eating -disorder psychopathology in the past 28 days, and over longer intervals for diagnostic 
items. The EDE -Q yields scores on the same subscales (dietary restraint, eating concern, weight 
concern, and shape concern), global score, and binge eating frequency variables as the EDE interview. Research with clinical samples of patients with BED has reported acceptable 
agreement between the EDE -Q and EDE interview ( Grilo -2001A ; Grilo -2001B ). 
11.2.3. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)  
The MINI is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed for Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Text Revised (D SM-IV-TR) and DSM -5 psychiatric 
disorders ( Sheehan -1989 ). With an administration time of approximately [ADDRESS_963082] the date, duration (total hours of binging), type of binge 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (meal or non-meal), amount and type of food, and number of binges. At each visit, the Investigator will review the completed diary with the subject and assess the number of binges for 
each day. The Investigator assessment of  number of binges for each day will be recorded in the 
diary and recorded in the CRF. M issing data, if any, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_708538]. 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  59 17 Nov 2017 11.3.2. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS was developed to assess functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social, and 
family life. The subject rates the extent to which work/school, social life, and home life have 
been impaired by [CONTACT_5657]/her symptoms on an 11-point vi sual analog scale. The 3  items can be 
summed into a single global measure of impairment that ranges from 0  (unimpaired) to 
30 (highly impaired). This anchored visual analog scale uses spatiovisual, numeric, and verbal descriptive anchors simultaneously to assess disability across 3  domains: work; social life, and 
family life. There are verbal descriptors for the points on the scale as well as numerical scores 
that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. The SDS takes approximately 
10 minutes to complete.  
11.3.3. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a widely used clinician -rated 
assessment of the subject’s level of depression. The measure contains 10  items that measure 
apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, 
lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Each item is scored in a range of 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating increased depressive sy mptoms.  
The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for the administration of the MADRS.  
11.3.4. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM- A) 
The HAM -A is a widely used and well -validated tool for measuring the severity of a patient’s 
anxiety. It should be administered by [CONTACT_289541]. The HAM-A consists of 14 items, 
each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is 
scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe.  
The Structured Interview Guide for the HAM- A (SIGH -A) will be used for the administration of 
the HAM -A. 
11.3.5. Binge-eating Clinical Global Impressions –Severity of Illness  (BE-CGI -S) 
The BE-CGI-S (based on Guy -1976) asks the clinician one question: “Considering your total 
clinical experience with this population, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7- point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects.  
This rating is based upon observed and reported BED symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7  days. Clearly, symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week; the score should reflect 
the average severity level across the 7  days.  
11.3.6. Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating 
(Y-BOCS -BE) 
The Yale Brown Obsessive Compul sive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y -BOCS -BE) is a 
clinician -rated scale that measures the obsession of binge eating, thoughts and compulsiveness of 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  60 17 Nov 2017 binge eating behaviors. The 10- item scale, is rated from 0  (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme 
symptoms). Total scores range from 0 to 40. A score of 0-7 is sub- clinical; 8 -15 is mild; 16 -23 is 
moderate; 24 -31 is severe; and 32- 40 is extreme ( Goodman-1989). The Y -BOCS -BE can be 
divided into 2 subscales: obsessions and compulsions. 
11.3.7. Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE -Q) Modified  
Convergent findings from confirmatory factor analyses of item data from the EDE-Q obtained 
from patients with BED (Grilo -2010) and patients with overweight/obesity ( Grilo -2012; 
Grilo -2013; Hrabosky-2008) as well as non-clinical groups ( Grilo -2015) support an alternative, 
brief version of the EDE-Q and EDE comprising 7 items to generate a global score and 3 subscales (dietary restraint, shape/weight overvaluation, and body dissatisfaction) referred to as 
the EDE -Q7 (Grilo-2015). In the present study, the EDE-Q7 along with [ADDRESS_963083]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Section  [ADDRESS_963084] dose of study drug will be collected as 
pre-treatment events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Tests

Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests shoul d be collected after scheduled 12 -lead ECG and 
vital signs assessments.  
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  61 17 Nov 2017 [IP_ADDRESS]. Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Clinically significant physical and neurological examination findings, as judged by [CONTACT_3786] , at screening will be recorded as medical history and after screening will be recorded 
as AEs.  
The physical examination will consist of an assessment of body systems including but not limited to head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT), cardiovascular (heart and vascular system), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (lungs  and chest), gastrointestinal (abdomen), and skin. 
Neurological examinations will include a brief assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, motor 
strength and coordination, sensory function in addition to deep tendon reflexes.

Following [ADDRESS_963085] develops symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension (light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, his or her 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_708501]. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection and performance of an EC G, whenever possible. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiograms  
All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 10  minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
before drawing blood s amples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for all 
visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core laboratory according to established quality additional information assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer to Section  20, Appendix I for additional information. 
Standard 12- lead ECG will record heart rate (HR), PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, QTc 
interval s (QTcB and QTcF) , and QRS duration. 
11.4.2. Safety Scales  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS ( Posner-2007) is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over-identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the “Baseline/Screening” 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits, the “Since Last Visit” version of the C- SSRS 
will be administered.  
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  62 17 Nov 2017 Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) on the C- SSRS assessment at Screening (in the past month) m ust be referred to the 
Investigator for follow-up evaluation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment  (CSSA)  
The CSSA ( Kampman -1998) is a clinician -administered scale designed to evaluate withdrawal 
signs and symptoms related to stimulants over the past [ADDRESS_963086] often associated with early cocaine abstinence, 
including change in appetite, depression, fatigue, anhedonia, anxiety, irritability, sleep 
disturbance, and inability to concentrate, paranoia, carbohydrate craving, bradycardia, and suicidality. The CSSA is scored as follows: cocaine craving scores are obtained by [CONTACT_708539] 24  hours using visual analog scales. All items except item 14, are scored 0 to 7 
according to instructions on the CSSA generally with 0 = no symptoms and 7 = maximum score on any individual item. Item 14 is scored 0 to 8 with 0 = no symptoms and 8 = maximum score. 
Heart rate is determined by [CONTACT_708540].  
On non- clinic days, the CSSA will be completed by [CONTACT_320376] a call to the subject.  
In order to complete the visual analog scale (VAS) portion of the CSSA on days when there are no scheduled clinic visits, subjects will be provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_708502], and will record their response at the time of scale administration.  
In order to complete the radial pulse portion of the CSSA on days when there are no scheduled clinic visits, subjects will measure their own radial pulse and provide the measurement to the site staff over the phone. 
For consistency of radial pulse measurements, subjects also will take their own radial pulse for 
the CSSA completed during in- clinic visits.

The plasma concentrations for dasotraline will be determined using a validated bioanalytical 
method. PK samples collected from placebo subjects will not be analyzed . The relationship 
between dasotraline plasma concentration and the primary and selected secondary efficacy and safety endpoints will be evaluated . 
Plasma samples collected from the study could be utilized for relevant exploratory research work 
such as further method development and metabolic profiling and identification. 
Blood samples for PK assessments should be collected at the same time as other blood samples, 
whenever possible. 
The dates and times of the previous 3 doses of study drug prior to PK blood s ample collection 
are to be recorded in the CRF.  
11.6. Collection of Blood Samples for Biomarker Analysis  
A blood sample will be collected to evaluate biomarkers associated with eating disorders to be 
determined in relationship to the severity of BED and response to dasotraline at a later date in the 
development program. 
Plasma/serum samples collected for biomarker concentration analysis may also be used for the 
additional characterization of and/or bioanalytical method development for dasotraline. 
11.7. Collection of S pecimens for Genetic Analysis  
A blood sample will be collected from subjects who provide a separate informed consent for  
pharmacogenomics (PGx) analysis for potential evaluation of associations between genetic polymorphisms such as, but not limited to Taq1DRD2, OPRM1, and DRD4-7R, and the severity 
of BED, the clinical response to dasotraline, in addition to the safety, efficacy, and PK profiles of 
dasotraline to be conducted at a later date in the development program.  
Pharmacogenetic s ampling  and s ample  handling guide lines are provided in Section  24,

Confidential and Propr ietary  73 17 Nov 2017 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the informed consent form 
(ICF) and first drug administration are pre- treatment events. Those that occur after first 
administration of study drug are considered AEs. 
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
Lack of efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as an AE unless the event is unusual in some way. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging diseas e 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following crite ria: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  74 17 Nov 2017 “serious,” whic h is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the case report form (CRF ). 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically sig nificant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as  the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign 
(eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or sy mptom (eg, abdominal pain) as 
the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with 
possibly drug- related or clinic ally relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
• Clinical Labor atory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal 
range will be flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at 
the study center. The Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not 
the value is o f clinical significance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done)  
from the samples taken during Screening  is indicated as clinically significant and is 
not covered by [CONTACT_708541]  8, the subject will not be 
allowed into the study. Additional testing during the study may be done if medically 
indicated. If a clinically significan t abnormality is found in the samples taken after 
dosing, during the study, and/or during the withdrawal period this should be recorded 
as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or 
stabilised.  
All on -site ECG tracing s and ECG over- read reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG 
tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.[ADDRESS_963100]’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the c ondition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Defi nitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
• Mild  – Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate – Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe – Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE : 
• Once – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the s tudy treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently. 
• Dose Not Changed  
• Not Applicable  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown  
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  76 17 Nov 2017 The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment:  
• Not related  
o Not related  – Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
o Unlikely  – occurred within a reasonable time frame after 
administration/discontinuation of the study medication , but there is a likely 
association of an intercurrent/underlying medical condition or other drugs.  
• Related  
o Possible  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  – occur red in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.

12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center  staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
after first administration of study drug through [ADDRESS_963102] participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to the [COMPANY_003] -PVG if consider ed at least possibly related to 
the study drug.  
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event is otherwise explained.

report SAEs.  
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) by [CONTACT_555715]. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time th at informed consent is signed through [ADDRESS_963105] will be instructed to return 
promptly/within [ADDRESS_963106] received any 
additional study medication, will be followed until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
If a pregnancy is reported for the study subject’s partner, the study subject must agree to 
complete abstinence for the duration of the study  or until resolution of the pregnancy, whichever 
comes first, or discontinue study drug and withdraw from the study. If the subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, continued abstinence is recommended for [ADDRESS_963107]

12.5. Data Monitoring Committee/Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety throughout the study (and may review blinded, partially blinded, or unblinded data). The DSMB will be independent of the 
Sponsor, CRO, and the Investigators and will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_708503]. The membership of the DSMB and its mandate will be described in a separate DSMB charter.

The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well-being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the s tudy 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study at his or her site after consultation with the 
Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will be asked to return to the site and complete 
the EOT visit assessments ( Section  11.8.9) as soon as possible after discontinuation of study

Confidential and Propr ietary  81 17 Nov 2017 15. STATISTICS  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for 
this study and will be fin alized before data base lock.  
15.1. Sample Size   
The sample size for this study was estimated based on 2 hypotheses associated with the primary 
efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in number of binge days per week at Week 12). A fixed sequence closed testing procedure was  used  to adjust for 2 comparisons of dasotraline doses vs 
placebo (ie, with dasotraline [ADDRESS_963109] and dasotraline 4 mg vs placebo tested 
after if the previous one is significant at the 0.05 level  ) for the sample size justification.  Based 
on the Study SEP360-[ADDRESS_963110] deviation ( SD) of 1.75 and a 
mean improvement of 0.9 (effect size 0.517) and 0.8 (effect size 0.457) over placebo for change 
from baseline in number of binge days per week at Week 12 for dasotraline 6 mg/day and 
4 mg/day doses, respectively, a sample size of [ADDRESS_963111] 85% conjunctive power to reject both null hypotheses. An upward adjustment of 
approximately 40% is assumed to compensate for subjects who are randomized but discontinue 
from the study, thus, a total sample of 480 subjects (160 subjects per group) will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1:1 for placebo, and dasotraline 4 mg/day and 6 mg/day, respectively. The 
sample size calculati on was based on Monte Carlo simulation from EAST 6.4. 
15.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
The hypotheses associated with the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints will be tested 
using a testing procedure in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Primary  Hypotheses  
In adults with moderate to severe BED, a fter 12  weeks of treatment,  
• Dasotraline 6 mg/day reduces change from baseline in the number of binge days per 
week relative to  placebo  
• Dasotraline 4 mg/day reduces change from baseline in the number of binge days per 
week relative to placebo   
Key Secondary  Hypotheses  
In adults with moderate to severe BED, after 12  weeks of treatment, 6  mg/day dasotraline or both 
doses of dasotral ine: 
• Reduce change from baseline in BE-CGI-S score relative to placebo  
• Provide a greater proportion of subjects with a 4- week cessation from binge eating at 
Week  12 relative to placebo 
• Reduce change from baseline in Y -BOCS -BE total score relative to placeb o

Confidential and Propr ietary  82 17 Nov 2017 15.3. Analysis Populations  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
medication and have at least [ADDRESS_963112]- baseline result in any efficacy evaluation. The ITT 
population is the primary population for efficacy analyses, ie, unless otherwise specified, all 
efficacy analyses will be based on ITT population. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: All ITT subjects who have no major protocol violations that may 
affect the interpretation of  the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The PP population will be used to assess robustness of the primary efficacy analysis. Major protocol violations and the PP population will be determined through a blinded data review 
meeting and identified prior to the database lock. 
Subjects in the ITT and PP populations will be analyzed based on the treatment to which they are 
randomized. 
Double-blind (DB) Safety Population: All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study medication.  
The DB Safety population mainly will be used for the data analyses of the safety data collected 
through Week [ADDRESS_963113] receives a treatment other than the one to which he or she is rand omized. The predominant treatment is defined as the treatment ( ie, 
placebo , dasotraline 4 mg/day, or dasotraline 6 mg/day ) to which the subject is exposed for the 
greatest duration during the treatment period. The predominant treatment will generally be th e 
same as the randomized treatment group, unless the subject takes incorrect study medication 
during the entire study. 
Withdrawal Safety Population: The Withdrawal safety population includes all randomized 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication, and either discontinue the study drug 
during the treatment period before the Week 12 visit or complete the 12-week treatment period 
but do not enter the extension study (Study SEP360-322), and ha ve at least one assessment after 
the last dose of s tudy medication for any safety or efficacy evaluation. The Withdrawal safety 
population mainly will be used to summarize the assessments collected in the withdrawal period.  
15.4. Data Analysis 
All statistical inference analyses will be performed with 2 -sided tests at a significance level of 
0.05, and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated whenever appropriate. All data will be summarized by [CONTACT_708542]. All subject data will be 
presented in data listings by [CONTACT_1130]. 
15.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessments from Binge Eating Diary  
The number of binge days per week at each assessment timepoint will be derived based on 
clinician review of the binge eating diary collected in the time intervals as follow s: 
• Baseline: binge eating diar y completed for 14 consecutive days immediately prior to 
the Baseline visit and starting no sooner than the day after the screening visit; 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.00  dasotraline 
Confidential and Propr ietary  83 17 Nov 2017 • Weeks  1, 2, 3, and 4 (ie, Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6): binge eating diary collected at each 
visit, which will span from th e previous visit to the current visit and therefore cover 
Weeks  1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; 
• Weeks  6, 8, 10 and 12 (ie, Visits  7, 8, 9, and 10): binge eating diary collected at each 
visit, which will span from the previous visit to the current visit and t herefore cover 
Weeks  5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12, respectively. 
Specifically, the number of binge eating days per week at baseline is calculated as the number of 
binge eating days in the 14 days immediately prior to the Baseline visit multiplied by 7 and 
divided by [CONTACT_708543] (ie, 14 days); the number of binge days per week in a visit that spans between 2  scheduled visits is calculated as (total number of binge 
days)  x 7 / (total number of assessed days in the visit span). If mi ssing diary entries exist during 
an assessed period for a subject, the available non -missing diaries from the subject will be used 
to derive the number of binge days per week adjusted by [CONTACT_154562]- missing diary days 
accordingly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the number of binge days per week at Week  12. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint ( the change from baseline in the 
number of binge days per week at Week  12) will be performed using a likelihood- based mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM). The response (dependent) variable is the change from baseline in the number of binge days per week assessed at Weeks  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. 
Specifically, the MMRM model includes fixed effects terms for treatment, visit (as a categorical variable), pooled center, baseline binge days category (stratification factor ; refer to Section  7.2.1 
for categories ), the number of binge days per week at baseline, and treatment- by-visit interaction. 
Restricted maximum likelihood estimation method will be applied using an unstructured 
covariance model. The Kenward Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator 
degrees of freedom. In case of a failure of convergence with the unstructured covariance, the 
following structures may be assessed in a sequential order: heterogeneous Toeplitz, Toeplitz, and 
spatial exponential covariance pattern model. Of the above [ADDRESS_963114] 
covariance structure yielding convergence in the MMRM model will be used for the MMRM 
analysis. The spatial exponential model is selected for the anal ysis of data with unequally spaced 
time points. The LS mean treatment differences (each dasotraline group minus placebo group) of 
change from baseline at Week  12, their 2-sided 95% CIs, and the associated p -values will be 
calculated based on this model.  
The normality assumption underlying the primary MMRM model will be assessed graphically. Conditional studentized and scaled residuals will be plotted against the predicted values, 
respectively, and Q -Q (quantile -quantile) plots of these residuals versus the expected quantiles of 
the standard normal distribution will be presented to provide a graphical view of similarity and 
difference in the two distributions. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the primary 
endpoint will be also provided by [CONTACT_1570].

The primary efficacy endpoint also will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (AN COVA) 
model and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, as a supportive analysis. The 
model will include terms for treatment, pooled center , baseline binge days category (stratification 
factor), and the number of binge days per week at baseli ne as covariates.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Sensitivity Analyses  
To address early dropouts under the assumption of missing not at random (MNAR), a pattern -
mixture model using a placebo- based multiple imputation method and a pattern mixture model 
using multiple imputations with penalties  (ie, deflating the individually estimated treatment 
effect size by [CONTACT_708544]) will be performed as sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the MMRM results for the primary analysis. In case of a deviation from the assumptions 
required for the primary analysis, to confirm the robustness of the primary analysis result, 
2 additional sensitivity analyses w ill be performed: (1) p ermutation test: fit a large number of 
datasets based on  a same MMRM for the primary analysis with randomly assigning pseudo-
treatment group designations; (2) generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis: fit count 
data over time ( ie, number of binge days among number of assessed days at each period) based 
on a binomial distribution.  The details of these sensitivity analyses will be outlined in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints involved in the hypothesis testing of each dasotraline dose 
(4 mg/day and 6 mg/day) versus placebo include change from baseline at Week  [ADDRESS_963116] 28 days prior to 
Week  12/EOT the subject will be counted as having no cessation. 
Continuous key secondary variables (ie, change in BE-CGI-S score and Y -BOCS -BE total score) 
will be analyzed with an MMRM model similar to the primary efficacy analysis (Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1)  adjusted  with the corresponding baseline. The LS mean treatment 
differences (each dasotraline group minus placebo) of change from baseline at Week  12, their 
2-sided 95% CIs, and the associated p- values will be  calculated based on the model.  
Categorical secondary efficacy endpoint s (ie, percent of subjects with a 4- week cessation from 
binge eating) will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment, baseline binge days category (stratification factor ; refer to Section  7.2.1 for categories ), and baseline number of 
binge days per week as covariate using a LOCF approach based on the ITT population. The odds 
ratios, their 2 -sided 95% CIs, and the associated p -values for each dasotraline group over the 
placebo group will be derived from the model. 
Additional supportive and sensitivity analyses may be conducted as needed for the key 
secondary endpoints to address early dropouts or potential deviation from the model 
assumption(s).To address early dropouts or potential deviation from the model assumption(s), supportive and sensitivity analyses similar to  those described in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_963117](s) and a pattern -mixture model using placebo -based multiple imputations, may be 
conducted as appropriate. The details will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Multiplicity Adjustment 
To control the overall type I error rate strongly at 5% for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, for the hypothese s to be tested  (see Section  15.2) , a sequential testing strategy will be  
used. Following the fixed sequence closed testing procedure in Figure  2, testing will only 
proceed conditional on the statistical significance of the test(s) of prior leve l(s) at a 2 -sided 5% 
significan ce level . See Section  15.2 for details about the definition of statistical hypotheses.

regression model and LOCF approach with factors of treatment, pooled center , baseline binge 
days category (stratification factor), and baseline number of binge epi [INVESTIGATOR_708505]. For subjects who are discontinued, binge eating responders at Week [ADDRESS_963118]- baseline time period during the treatment period that binge diary is 
assessed . To ensure that the logistic regression model is feasible, pooled center may be removed 
from  the analysis model if some pooled center has no responder either because of a small number 
of subjects in the pooled center or subjects experiencing little change. As a supportive analysis, 
the proportion of binge eating responders over time will be analyzed by [CONTACT_708545] (IPW) Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE) model. The details will be provided

continued review of the clinical research.  
The Investigator must promptly inform their IRB/IEC  of all SAEs reported by [CONTACT_708562]/CRO in accordance with  
applicable law (s) and regulation(s). 
17.3. Informed Consent  
The informed consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_1034]/CRO prior to submission to the 
IRB/IEC. The Sponsor/CRO may provide a template informed consent form to be qualified b y 
each research facility to conform to local requirements. All informed consent forms must contain 
the minimum elements as mandated by [CONTACT_91359], applicable local law(s) and regulations and 
will be subject to Sponsor /CRO  approval as well as IRB /IEC approval. The Sponsor /CRO  may 
submit informed consent forms to a central IRB/IEC for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_526127]. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of 
the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ample time and 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the prospective subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the prospective subject will be asked to give consent to participate in 
the study by [CONTACT_1725]. As part of the consent process, each prospective 
subject must consent to direct access to his/her medical records for study-related monitoring, 
auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. It should be cle arly explained to each 
prospective subject that participation in each and every clinical visit and assessment is expected.  
The subject may be discontinued from study medication, but that does not necessarily negate the expectation that the subject will continue to participate in the study through the final 
visit/assessment.  The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to 
each subject , and will record the date of the informed consent on the CRF. 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or if important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, 
the informed consent form must be revised, submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval or 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The revised informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from a 
subject currently enrolled in the s tudy if he or she is affected by [CONTACT_29991]. The revised 
informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from any new subjec ts who are enrolled 
into the study after the date of the approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29928].

Confidential and Propr ietary  111 17 Nov 2017 26. APPENDIX VII. ABUSE POTENTIAL MONITORING PLAN  
Overview of Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan 
Dasotraline is  a new chemical entity being investigated for the treatment of Binge Eating 
Disorder (BED). Dasotraline is a diastereomer of the major metabolite of sertraline but is not a 
metabolite of sertraline, nor is it converted to the demethylated metabolite of ser traline in vivo. 
Dasotraline is a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE), and 
dopamine (DA) via the respective transporters SERT, NET, and DAT, with preferential 
inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29906] (NET) relative to the serotonin transporter (SERT) without significant off- target activities. Clinical studies 
demonstrated central SERT occupancies in healthy subjects well below those attained at DAT, in addition decreases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) were observed, indicating central NET inhibition. This pharmacological profile warrants the implementation of an Abuse Potential 
Monitoring Plan, which surpasses the clinical monitoring, and adverse event (AE) reporting 
historically implemented in development programs for SSRIs. 
The Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP) for dasotraline has been designed to detect 
potential abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor AEs consistent with the 
pharmacology. The plan will detect irregularities in the handling of dasotraline in clinical trials 
and identify the misuse of dasotraline or other psychoactive substances. Moreover, the APMP 
provides a process by [CONTACT_708568], processed, 
and reviewed. Events subject to additional monitoring were identified based on the pharmacology of dasotraline, as well as adverse event profiles of compounds with similar 
mechanisms of action.  
Procedure for Managing Medication Irregularities  
Defining Threshol d Criteria  
The purpose of this procedure is to capture information about all medication-handling 
irregularities that meet the predefined threshold criteria. All instances meeting the medication irregularity threshold criteria will require a clinical risk a ssessment by [CONTACT_708569]. The Investigator will be required to complete 
Attachment A, the Medication Handling Irregularity (MHI) form in these situations. 
For clinical trials utilizing dasotraline,  we define the threshold criteria for medication 
irregularities as any one of the following:  
• 10% or more of dispensed drug is either used in excess of prescribed dose or is 
unaccounted for; and/or  
• Suspected abuse or diversion of dasotraline; and/or  
• Suspect ed abuse of any other substance including alcohol, illicit substances, and 
over-the-counter (OTC) medications or prescription drugs. 
Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.[ADDRESS_963128] complete the Medication Handling Irregularity (MHI) form 
(Attachment  A) and fax to the contact [CONTACT_708570] [ADDRESS_963129] will fax 
the completed MHI form to Sunovion within 1 business day of receipt and determine whether 
further action is warranted (ie, discontinuation of subject due to noncompliance with study protocol, education of the subject, etc. ). Attach ment B  displays the process flow for handling 
medication irregularities. Any instance of medication irregularity may further be classified as an event subject to additional monitoring (ESAM). 
The management of documented medication handling irregularities will be driven by [CONTACT_708571]. As shown on Attachment A, items coded #1-3 
describe situations of accounting errors and/or noncompliance with study procedures without evidence of study medication misuse or abuse of othe r substances. In these instances (code #1 -3 
on the MHI form), the Investigator  will complete Attachment A and fax to the contact [CONTACT_708572] 3  business days of knowledge of the irregularity. 
 
Suspected or Known Abuse or Diversion of Study Medication 
All cases of suspected or known abuse or diversion of study medication should be documented 
on the MHI form and coded #4. The Investigator  will complete Attachment A and fax to the 
contact [CONTACT_708570] 3 business days of knowledge of the irregularity. For all cases of medication irregularities coded as  #4, the Investigator will attempt to obtain a urine drug screen 
from the subject, perform early termination procedures and discontinue the subject from the 
study.  
 
Suspected or Known Abuse of Alcohol or Othe r Substances  
The abuse of alcohol, illicit substances, OTC medication or prescription drugs while a subject is 
participating in a dasotraline clinical trial should be documented on the MHI form and coded #5. The Investigator will complete Attachment A and fax to the contact [CONTACT_708570] 3  business 
days of knowledge of the irregularity. For all cases of medication irregularities coded as #5, the Investigator will attempt to obtain a urine drug screen from the subject, perform early termination procedures and discontinue the subject from the study. 
 
Event Subject to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
A key objective of the Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan is to monitor for instances of abuse or 
diversion of the study medication and other psychoactive substances. In addition to monitoring 
for irregularities in medication handling, AEs that may be suggestive of a developi[INVESTIGATOR_708514], will also receive special attention. The following adverse experiences or related signs and 
symptoms may be associated with increased risk to subjects and will require additional 
monitoring . This list is a guide as to the types of events that require additional medical 
surveillance; it is not comprehensive and other events may be identified that require similar

Protocol SEP360-321, Version 3.[ADDRESS_963131] to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
To ensure clarity and completeness of information, all Events Subject to Additional Monitoring 
will require the preparation of a na rrative by [CONTACT_737] . This narrative will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_7195]/sponsor/Investigator to determine if the subject should be discontinued from 
the study. A narrative summary template will be provided to the Investigator s (Attachment  C). 
Handling of the Event Subject to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
• Investigators will report all Events Subject to Additional Monitoring with narratives to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours (Attachment C)  
• The medical monitor will review all ESAM in real time and forward a copy of the 
report to the sponsor s’ Medical Director within one  business day 
 
Urine Drug Screens  
The protocol incorporates exclusion criteria targeting individuals with a history of substance use 
disorders (eg, alcohol abuse or dependence and illicit drug abuse or dependence). The protocol 
includes urine drug screens at screening and at various post- randomization visits as well as 
providing the Investigator with the discretion to obtain random urine drug screens. Investigators 
will be directed  to obtain urine drug screens in instances where there is known or suspected 
abuse of study medication and/or other substances.

Study Title:  Colorado Oregon Altitude STudy (COAST)  
Protocol Number:  TBD 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_154159] T. Lovering, PhD  
 
A.  Introduction and Background  
Rapid and prolonged exposure to high altitude presents a serious threat to the health of people. 
Unfortunately, no major advances have been made in promo ting health and performance at high 
altitude in the last [ADDRESS_358427] three new ideas to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_294344].   
  
While a two-week  period of acclimatization to high altitude substantiall y improves physical and 
cognitive function (2), this strategy is clearly impractical for many people who travel from low 
altitude to high altitude quickly. Pharmacological countermeasures to offset the negative effects of 
high altitude are thus attractive to ensure optimal health and performance at high altitude. 
Unfortunately, current pharmacological strategies only work moderately well, or are fraught with 
side effects and risks (1, 3). Our team has recently conducted a series of Department of Defense 
(DoD) funded studies aimed at understanding the molecular and genetic basis of human adaptation 
to high altitude as a means to identify novel ways to promote acclimatization. Based in part on our 
research and research from their labs, we have identified two c ompounds that we believe will 
improve human health and performance at high altitude: iron and erythropoietin. Moreover, we 
will study the molecular biomarkers of natural exposure and acclimatization in a placebo  group and 
the two intervention  groups to discover how these intervention s aid performance, and to look for 
markers of use of each compound to aid detection of illicit use in the face of high altitude exposure.  
In addition, we propose to study the effect of these drugs on altitude acclim atization in those with 
and without a patent foramen ovale (PFO), a small hole in the atrial septum present in ~30% of the 
population. The PFO has been shown to alter ventilatory responses to hypoxia and increase 
susceptibility to acute mountain sickness, although the mechanism remains unclear.  
  
Iron and erythropoietin are linked by [CONTACT_294379] a role in the oxygen sensing pathway regulated by 
[CONTACT_294380] (HIF). We know that HIF plays a key role in sensing low oxygen, and thus 
plays a key rol e regulating human’s response to low oxygen during acute and chronic exposure to 
high altitude. By [CONTACT_294381], fit 
humans.   
 
B.   Specific Aims/Study Objectives  
 
The overarching goal of the study is to determine the ef fect of iron and erythropoietin (EPO) 
supplementation  on acute and chronic physiological  responses to high  altitude.  
 
Specific aims  
 
1. To determine the effects of iron and EPO on exercise performance acutely (first 3 days),  
during acclimatization (days 7-8), and chronically (days 13-14) at altitudes of 10,000 to 14,000 
feet in PFO - and PFO+ subjects . 
2. To determine the effects of iron and EPO on acute and chronic changes in hemoglobin (Hb) 
mass, cognitive performance, ventilation, and molecular markers of hypoxia exposure at 
altitudes of 10,000 to 14,000 feet  in PFO - and PFO+ subjects . 
3. To determine the e ffects of iron and EPO on development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) 
at altitudes of 10,000 to 14,000 feet  in PFO - and PFO+ subjects . 
 
Please note that all baseline  studies will provide novel data on men and women with and without a 
patent foramen ovale (PFO) so that even if the altitude studies become unfeasible , new 
information will be gained from these studies.  
 
C.   Methods, Materials and Analysis  
Overview:  The initial components  of the study will be performed over 6 days at baseline  to 1) screen 
subjects for inclusion in the study and 2) obtain baseline  measurements , with all studies 
conducted at the Cardiopulmonary Lab, Eugene, OR. These screening and baseline  studies will 
be followed by 4 weeks of placebo or drug interventions  (Cardiopulmonary Lab, Eugene, OR) and 
14 days living at high  altitude ( Breckenridge or Lea dville , CO). Within [ADDRESS_358428] prefers to spread tests out over additional days.

What follows is a detailed description of each study day:  
BASELINE : EUGENE , OR RESEARCH SITE  
All studies done in Eugene will be done in either l aboratory s pace within Pacific Hall  and/or on 
running tracks and trails within the Eugene/Springfield metropolitan area or very cl ose to this 
community.  
 
Any subject with childbearing potential will be required to take a pregnancy test  on VO2max days 
and Hemoglobin mass testing days (both at baseline  and altitude) as the other testing days will not 
involve any activity that would otherwise affect the fetus.  
 
Day 1 – Informed consent, medical History, blood draw : Cardiopulmonary Lab, Eugene, OR  
(~60 min)  
Subjects who express interest in the study will have any initial questions answered on the phone or 
over email, depending on subject preference. Those interested in continuing with the study will 
arrive to the lab, and subjects will undergo informed consen t and a  complete a self -report health 
history questionnaire , and complete a menstrual cycle history questionnaire (biological women only)  
(~30 min) . Subjects will have the option to undergo  informed consent remotely prior to arriving to 
the lab (see ‘Infor med Consent Process’ below) but will complete all other paperwork , including 
signing the informed consent,  upon arrival to the lab. Menstrual cycle history will be documented for 
control purposes for blood biomarker analysis, although subjects will not be required to be in a 
certain phase for testing, nor will they be excluded for contraceptive use.  
 
After completing paperwork, subjects  will undergo physical examinations by [CONTACT_5640] a Nurse 
Practitioner or Physician Assistant [ADDRESS_358430], to log daily exercise activity for the duration of the study.  (~30 min) .  
 
Day 2 – Army Physical Fitness Tests (APFTs) : Cardiopulmonary Lab, Eugene, OR  (~60 min)  
Subjects will perform a modified version of the Army Physical Fitness Tests (APFTs)  outdoors at the 
University of Oregon. The APFT will include 2 minutes of push -ups and sit -ups and a 5k run. Total 
time ~1 hour.   
 
Day 3 – Lung function . cardiac screening,  blood draw, Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) 
questionnaire with finger saturation , and cognitive function testing : Cardiopulmonary 
Lab, Eugene, OR  (~125 min)  
Subjects will perform pulmonary function testing (~15 minutes)  and cognitive function testing (~20 
minutes).  
 
Subjects will have an intravenous catheter (IV) placed. Subjects will then undergo comprehensive 
ultrasound screening. Amount of blood flow travelling through the PFO/ASD and IPAVA will be 
graded using saline contrast echocardiography while the subject is breathing room air . Pulmonary 
artery pressure, cardiac output, and TAPSE will  also be measured using ultrasound (~ 60 minutes).    
 
 
Subjects will complete the Lake Louise Questionnaire (LLQ) and Environmental Symptoms 
Questionnaire (ESQ) to determine acute mountain sickness (AMS) . Subjects will be instrumented 
with a pulse oximeter to measure oxygen saturation (~15 minutes).   
Lastly, subjects will have resting ventilation and HCVR measured (~15 minutes).  
 
Day 4 – VO2max testing day : Cardiopul monary Lab, Eugene, OR  (~30 min)  
Subjects will perform a VO 2max test (~30 minutes) . Additionally, resting, exercise, and post -exercise 
heart rate and systemic blood pressure will be measured.  Any subject with child bearing  potential 
will be required to take a pregnancy test prior to the VO2max test.  
 
All subjects will arrive at the Cardiopulmonary lab and will be given a telemetric core temperature 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_294345] [ADDRESS_358431] more questions. These directions apply to 
every time subjects  take the core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  
 
 
Day 5 – Performance Stabilization , Eugene, OR  (occurs ~30 days before departure for 
Colorado)  (~30 min)  
To further ensure accurate baseline  measurements of physical performance, the top 80 subjects 
(and 20 alternates) with the most similar physical characteristics will repeat the 5K. This strategy will 
minimize the influence of learning effects associated with the tests and facilitate matching  between 
groups. (~30 min).   
 
Day 6 – Hemoglobin mass , Eugene, OR  (occurs ~30 days before departure for Colorado)  (~75 
min)  
Subjects will perform hemoglobin mass (Hb mass) and p50 measures (~ 75 minutes).  This 
measurement involves placing an IV and drawing an additional [ADDRESS_358432] baseline venous blood dra wn ([ADDRESS_358433]).  Dried Blood Spot 
samples will be taken utilizing a commercially available dried blood spot sampling device (80 uL) 
(TASSO, Tasso Inc, Seattle, [LOCATION_003]).  Dried blood will be analyzed for HGB, CD71/Band3, ESAs, and 
reticulocytes.  Total Blood drawn for this day of ~7 6 mL. 
 
 
Drug intervention , Eugene , OR  
For the 4 weeks immediately prior to the scheduled departure date , subjects will arrive at the 
Cardiopulmonary Lab as required by [CONTACT_294382] (see ‘Drug Intervention ’ below for 
details) to receive  their assigned intervention  via a sub -cutaneous injection  and/or intravenous 
injection . After the last dose, subjects will have venous blood drawn (~ 60 mL) prior to departure to 
Colorado  for measurements of various biomarkers . A dried blood drop sample (80 uL) will also be 
taken.

Post -altitude measures , Eugene, OR  
Within 1 week of returning to Eugene, OR, subjects will return to the Cardiopulmonary Lab (Eugene, 
OR) to repeat the 5k run and blood draw only . Tests will be performed over post-Altitude days  3-5. 
The 5k run will be done either on the same day as the other tests, or on a separate day depending 
on subject availability. Total blood draw  60 mL.  
 
Note : During the 14 days at high  altitude, subjects will be involved in data collection on days 1, 2, 3, 
7, 8, 13 and  14. On all other days, there  will be group activities  and the possibility for subjects to hike 
or bike ride in small groups.  They will not participate in any research activities  during these “off” 
days, and they will be reminded frequently to  follow CDC guidelines for COVID -19 risk mitigation 
(see ‘COVID -19 exposure scenario’ below).  
 
 
Description of Data Collection Procedures:  
Pulmonary Function Tests:  Subjects will perform standard non -invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_82422] a 
maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_294348] -volume loop, forced vital capacity (FVC), slow vital capacity 
(SVC), forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 sec (FEV1), and mid expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (FEF25 -75%). These tests will 
require the subject to blow in and out of a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_82424] a computerized flowmeter 
(pneumotachometer). This is a routine clinical test.  
 
VO 2max tests : The VO2max test will be an incremental test to volitional exhaustion on a cyc le 
ergometer. Subjects will breathe through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_294349] n cycling at a low resistance (5 0 
W), with the resistance increasing every minute by [ADDRESS_358438] 
reaches volitional exhaustion or a plateau in VO 2 as m easured by [CONTACT_294384] (Medgraphics 
Ultima CPX)  is reached. During the entire protocol, subjects will breathe room air through a [ADDRESS_358439] 
non-rebreathing small sampling flowmeter (pneumotachometer), which will allow us to measure 
ventilation (V E), VO 2, and breath -by-breath metabolic data. Subjects will be instrumented with a 
forehead oxygen sensor to measure heart rate and SpO2 at rest and during exercise.  
 
Army physical fitness tests (APFTs):  The Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) is used by [CONTACT_294385]. The test consists of the maximum number  of push ups  in [ADDRESS_358440] cut offs for push ups or sit ups 
will be used as screening criteria, how ever, to  meet the higher standards required of the Special 
Operations Forces (SOF), the run has been extended from 3.2 km (2 miles) to 5.[ADDRESS_358441] 80% of the age adjusted minimum performance level on each of the three APFT criteria , but 
preference will be given to those who complete the criteria at 100% or more.  For example, 100% 
passing for m ales (age 1 8-21), means they are  able to complete 42 push ups in 2 minutes, 53 sit -ups 
in 2 minutes, and 5k run <24:42 (7:57 per mile pace). 100% passing for f emales (age 1 8-21), means 
they are  able to complete 19 push ups in 2 minutes, 53 sit -ups in 2 minutes, and 5k run < 29:22 (9:27 
per mile pace). The  APFT will be performed once at baseline  for all subjects and possibly twice for 
performance stabilization.  Below is the table with the 100% passing criteria for all age groups 
included in the study.

Measurements of Core Temperature : Core temperature (Tcore) will be measured using a Vital 
Sense Monitor and a telemetric pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (JonahTM  ingestible temperature sensor, Mini Mitter Inc, Bend 
OR). The sterile telemetric pi[INVESTIGATOR_82425] (with liquid) the 
5-10 hours prior to testing or the volunteer will self -insert the pi[INVESTIGATOR_82426] m orning of 
testing. Core temperature will be measured during the 5k runs ( performance stabilization at 
baseline ), and approximately days 1, 7, and 13 at high  altitude).  
 
 
Intravenous catheter and venous blood draw:  We will place a 20 -22 gauge (small diamete r) IV 
into a vein in the subject’s arm. This IV will be used to for various tests – blood draws for Hb mass & 
p50, blood draws to measure various biomarkers in the blood, iron/saline infusion during drug 
treatment, and for contrast bubble injections during  ultrasound measures at sea level.  
 
Venous blood draw : Blood for measuring biomarkers will be drawn from an IV (60 mL per blood 
draw) and centrifuged, and de -identified plasma and serum stored at -80°C until assayed. 
Additionally, blood will be drawn for baseline iron , transferrin, ferritin , complete blood count, and 
basic metabolic panel  analysis (via QUEST diagnostics, 25 mL) on baseline day 1, and blood will be 
drawn for sickle cell screening on baseline day 6 (via QUEST diagnostics, 5 mL). Intraven ous blood 
for biomarker analysis will be drawn on baseline 6, and on the second day of iron or saline infusion 
to minimize the number of needle sticks.  Blood will also be drawn  days 1, 7, and [ADDRESS_358442] altitude . 60 mL of bl ood will be drawn for biomarker analysis  on each  of these  
blood draw day s.  
 
Hypercapnic ventilatory response : We will use a published, well -established method (Duffin method) 
for assessing chemo sensitivity to carbon dioxide (MacKay et al., Adv Physiol Education, 2016). Subjects 
will be fitted with a nose -clip and breathe room air through a two -way rebreathing v alve that can be 
directed between a filtered 6L non -diffusing bag filled with a mixture of CO2 and O2, with values 
dependent on whether studies are being conducted at baseline  or altitude (CO2 range: 3% to 7%, O2 
range: 60% to 97%) (medical grade) , and room air . If O2 and CO2 do not equal 100%, the tank will be 
balanced with nitrogen . Ventilation, end tidal CO2 ( PETCO2 ), end tidal O2 ( PETO2 ) and saturation will be  
measured continuously throughout this test  (Medgraphics).  T o establish a baseline bef ore hypercapnic  
testing using the modified rebreathing protocol,  subjects will breathe room air for 5 min. Subjects will  
then be coached to hyperventilate  by [CONTACT_294386] 1 
minute to reach a target PETCO2 of ~20 -25 mm Hg (~40 -45 mm Hg is normal); this part of the test is 
required to reduce CO2 stores in the body.  After [ADDRESS_358443] will be asked to take a full breath 
in and out then they will be switched to the bag filled with the hyperoxic O2 and hyperca pnic CO2 
mixture  and will be coached to take 3 large breaths then resume normal breathing until: 1) their 
breathing increases so much that it becomes in tolerable and they signal to quit; 2) the PETCO2 = 55 mm 
Hg or 3) the rebreathing bag becomes deflated.  Subjects will be informed of what to expect with this 
test prior to performing it, i.e they will be told that we will coach them through it and that when they 
start to breathe out of the bag they will initially have very little urge to breathe but as the rebreathing 
progresses they will have a very strong urge to breathe.  
Comprehensive ultrasound screening:  Ultrasound screening will be performed using a previously 
placed IV (see above).  Subjects will sit in the left lateral decubitis position for ultrasou nd screening.  
An agitated saline contrast injection will be made while transthoracic saline contrast 
echocardiography (TTSCE) is performed on the subject to evaluate extent of blood flow through 
IPAVA and PFO/ASD (see below).  Subjects will be asked to pe rform a Valsalva maneuver while 
breathing room air. This maneuver enhances blood flow across the PFO/ASD. Multiple saline 
contrast injections (up to 3) may be performed to verify bubble grades/presence of a PFO/ASD. 
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP ), cardiac output, and TAPSE (tricuspid annular plane 
systolic excursion) will be measured with ultrasound. Comprehensive measurements  will be done 
on baseline 3, and PASP, cardiac output, and TAPSE will be measured on days 1, 3, 7, and [ADDRESS_358444] Echocardiography (TTSCE):  Echocardiography requires a medical 
sonographer to place a small probe against the subject's ribcage,  which transmits and receives 
sound waves to produce images that are captured and stored on a computer. Saline contrast is 
made by [CONTACT_82445] (mixing) 3 -5 ml of sterile saline and 1 ml of air to create a suspension 
(mixture of liquid and gas) of ve ry small bubbles called microbubbles. This suspension is injected 
through an IV, which allows us to detect the transpulmonary passage of microbubbles.  
 
Cognitive Function : We will use the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) to 
assess neurocognitive function across the study. We have recently documented decrements in 
several components of the DANA during a simulated rapid deployment to high altitude that 
impro ved with acclimatization (2) and thus believe the tests are sensitive and specific to the 
cognitive challenges SOF face in this environmental extreme. Using a handheld computer, the 
following nine cognitive function tests will be administered:  
1. Simple Reac tion Time -1 (measured at the beginning of neurocognitive testing to gain an 
understanding of pure visual -motor response);  
2. Simple Reaction Time -2, repeated at the end of neurocognitive testing to assess diminished 
reserve of cognitive effort on reaction ti me;  
3. Procedural Reaction Time, a measure of choice reaction time and accuracy;  
4. Go-No-Go, a measure of speed, accuracy and impulsivity;  
5. Code Substitution —Simultaneous, a measure of visual scanning and attention, learning, and 
immediate recall of digit -symbol pairings;  
6. Code Substitution —Delayed Recall, a measure of short -term memory for digit -symbol 
pairings;  
7. Spatial Discrimination, a measure of visuospatial analytic ability;  
8. Matching to Sample, an assessment of attention and memory for visuospatial disc rimination;  
9. Sternberg’s Memory Search, a measure of working memory for letters.  
  
The total time required to complete the battery of tests is ~20 minutes. DANA will be administered 
once at sea level (baseline day 3 ) and in the evening of day s 1, 3, 7, and 13 at high  altitude.  
 
Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2): The severity of AMS symptoms 
will be determined using a subset of the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ) and the 
Lake Louise AMS Questionnaire (LLQ), the two most common and accepted measures of AMS.  
  
The ESQ is a self -reported, 68 -question inventory used to document symptoms induced by [CONTACT_294387]. A weighted average of scores from 9 symptoms 
(headache, lightheaded, dizzy, etc.) designated AMS -C will be calculated. AMS -C scores greater than 
0.7 are considered positive for AMS (77).  
  
The LL Q consists of a six question self -reported assessment of AMS symptoms, with a score of ≥ 3, 
including headache, defin ed as AMS. The high  altitude -illness assessment questionnaires will be 
administered on paper forms and tabulated in digital format at the end of each day (78).  
 
After completing the AMS assessment forms, arterial saturation will be monitored by [CONTACT_406]. 
Each AMS assessment and pulse oximetry measurement will take ~10 minutes to complete. These 
measurements will be made once  at baseline , immediately upon arr ival at high altitude, and every 
night and morning of days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 13 at high  altitude . Based on our previous study of 164 
subjects, this ascent profile induced symptoms of AMS in ~50% of the subjects on the first evening at 
high altitude.  
 
Hemoglo bin mass (Hb mass) and p50 : Determination of blood volume is done by [CONTACT_294388] (CO) rebreathing method and doing some calculations 
(see below). Prior to the test the rebreathing circuit is flushed and prefilled with 100% oxygen and 
sealed.  Upon arriving to the laboratory subjects will have an IV placed into their arm by [CONTACT_294389]. Prior to any measurements, subjects rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 
quietly for ~ 20 minutes. Then, we obtain 1 blood sample  (2 mL) for p50 meas urements. After, using 
a noseclip and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], subjects will breathe 100% oxygen for 4 minutes.  At the end of this 4 
minute period, another 2 mL blood sample will be taken to measure hemoglobin concentration, 
hematocrit, baseline proportion of hemoglobi n bound with CO (HbCO), and baseline proportion of 
hemoglobin bound with oxygen (HbO2) . HbCO is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1.5 to 2.0% in nonsmoking city dwellers. 
Once the baseline blood sample has been taken,  subjects will be instructed to breathe out 
completely. Then th ey take a slow breath from the rebreathe circuit  prefilled with 100% oxygen to 
completely fill their lungs while a bolus of 99.9% pure CO is injected into the circuit . The bolus 
volume of CO is calculated from body mass (1. 0 mL/kg body mass for men; 0 .8 mL/kg body mass for 
women). This dose of CO is expected to raise HbCO by ~6% to ~8%, which is below the levels 
associated with side effects ( >15%; see below). After CO administration the subjects begin breathing 
normally for [ADDRESS_358445]-rebreathe blood sample of 2mL is taken to 
measure the above -mentioned  blood parameters  (with the exception of p50, which is measured 
once prior to Hb mass testing) . Subjects  then goes back to resting while breathing ambient air. 
Finally,  we obtain the total volume of gas in the rebreathe circuit  and determine the concentration of 
CO left in  the rebreathe circuit  after the test. Using established formulas,  we calculate hemoglobin 
mass and then use the following equations to obtain red cell volume (Red Cell Volume = hemoglobin 
mass x hematocrit x hemoglobin -1 x 100 -1) and then blood volume ( Blood Volume = red cell volume 
x 100 x hematocrit -1 x 0.91 -1). Subjects will then repeat the above procedures within [ADDRESS_358446] variable as it minimizes biological variation 
that would occur between days. If these two tests yield results within 3% then the test i s complete. If 
greater than 3% we will repeat the [ADDRESS_358447] 
returned to baseline (~48 hours). In total, 10 mL of blood will be take n (8mL for Hb mass - 4mL for 
each test, and 2mL for p50) . CO level in the blood is not expected to exceed 20% following the 
second test. If it does, subjects will breathe 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. p50, the partial pressure of 
oxygen when Hb is 50% saturated with oxygen, is calculated using pre -rebreathe value s for pH, 
PvO2, PvCO2, Hb concentration, HbO2, and HbCO. Hb mass will be measured in this manner, i.e., 
duplicate tests, at baseline day 6  and on days 1, 7, and 13 at high  altitude. p50 will be  measured on 
every day Hb mass is measured, as well as on basel ine day 3 and day 3 at high  altitude when Hb 
mass is not measured. On p50 only days , one 2mL blood sample will be taken to measure p50 , but 
no Hb mass measurement will be made .  
 
Blood measures:  Blood samples will be used to measure biomarkers such as soluble transferrin 
receptor, ferritin, hepcidin, erythropoietin, C -reactive protein, erythropoiesis agents (ESAs), 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, reticulocyte number, reticulocyte per centage, mean 
corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, CD71/Band3, cytokines including interleukins 
(IL) -1, 6, 8, 10, 12p (70), 17A, 18, 23, and 33, interferons -2 and -, tumor necrosis factor -, 
monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, nitric oxide  synthase, endothelin -1, myoglobin, matrix 
metalloproteinases 2 and 9, cystatin C, myeloid -related protein 8/14, osteopontin, neutrophil 
gelatinase -associated lipocalin, myeloperoxidase, serum amyloid A, insulin like growth factor binding 
protein 4, intrac ellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion protein 1. Serum will also be 
collected for Luminex analysis of genetics and metabolism regarding inflammation which will 
include many of the previously mentioned markers. Additionally, serum will be saved for cell culture 
experiments in which endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells will be exposed to serum, these 
cells will be analyzed for mechanistic changes involving inflammation and health status change of 
the cells.  
 
Plasma, buffy coat, and s erum samples will all be stored for later use ; however , these samples will 
be unidentifiable, only stored with an ID number that will indicate which treatment the sample had 
been exposed to.  
 
Abnormal blood test results will be shared with participants wit h a recommendation to see their 
physician . 
 
Dried Blood Spot Sampling : We will use a commercially available and FDA -approved for patient use 
blood spot single -use disposable sampling device (TASSO, TASSO Inc, Seattle, [LOCATION_003]).  The device 
adheres to skin which has been cleaned with isopropyl alcohol with a light adhesive.  Upon 
activation, a vacuum forms and a lancet prick s the surface of the skin.  The vacuum draws blood out 
of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_294350], collecting 4 samples 
of 20 microliters (0.020 mL) each over the course of [ADDRESS_358448] separates from the d evice and is submitted for analysis. Samples will be taken 
every time a venous blood draw is taken  at sea level (baseline 6, and post dosing) and altitude (day 
1, 7, and 13).  
 
5k run : The 5 -kilometer run will be performed as part of the APFTs at baseline  (see above) and on its 
own on days 1, 7 and 13 in Colorado . The run will be performed on a 400 m track  or local running 
trail (Pre’s trail)  in Eugene, OR and on the high school track or  local paved trail s near the research 
site in Colorado . Subjects will be asked to complete the run as fast as possible while being timed . 
 
Drug intervention : In a single -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled design, subjects will receive a 
placebo (saline placebo ), iron , or erythropoietin.  
 
Iron.  Volunteers will  receive an intravenous  injection  of Fe(III) -hydroxide sucrose (200 mg) or 
placebo twice before high altitude exposure, once [ADDRESS_358449] an allergic reaction  (see risks below)  and to ensure 
placebo subjects are blinded to the treatment .  
 
EPO. Volunteers will receive a sub-cutaneous injection of epoetin alpha 150 IU/kg injections given 
weekly (50 IU/kg 3 x week) for three consecutive weeks prior to high altitude exposure. This dose 
and timing match the AMS prevention study protocol of  Heo et al.[ADDRESS_358450] the same intervention  
schedule. For those in the iron group, they will come  to the lab 3x per week as required by [CONTACT_294390], for example , and receive saline intervention s. For those in the EPO group, 
they will come to the lab one time  4 weeks prior to departing to Colorado to receive a placebo 
injection while the iron group receives their iron injection. The placebo group will receive saline at all 
visits.

Rucksack carry : Subjects will be instructed to complete a 3.[ADDRESS_358451] to simulate military style field 
operations for another DoD funded study. The course follows a rugged h iking/jeep trail that begins 
in a wooded area at ~10,500 feet and ends on a ridge above tree line at ~12,[ADDRESS_358452] day at high altitude to familiarize themselves with 
the terrain. The following morning (2nd day) they will be asked to complete the course as fast as 
possible while being timed. Subjects will also run the course on days 8 and 14. Fit subjects, free of 
AMS, can finish the course in ~60 minutes.  
 
Traveling and accommodations:   
Subjects will be transported to Denver, Colorado in groups of 10 -20 by [CONTACT_294391] , Colorado by [CONTACT_294392]. The total 
travel time from baseline  to high altitude will be ~[ADDRESS_358453] regimen of 
tasks designed to simulate a high level of physical activity at high altitude (10,000 to 14,000 feet) over 
three days and two nights (acute) followed by 11 additional days of residence at high altitude 
(chronic exposure) before returning to Oregon on the 14th day.  
  
Subjects will be housed and fed in condominiums in the Leadville  or Breckenridge  area. All meals 
will be cooked and served communally . Omnivorou s and vegetarian options will be provided. 
Subjects will sleep in individual beds, but will share quarters and bathrooms (see note below about 
COVID management in ‘COVID -19 exposure scenario’). Caffeine intake will be limited to the 
equivalent of two cups of coffee per day. Subjects will refrain from taking any non -study related 
supplements (over -the-counter, prescription, and recreational) or other non -study drugs or alcohol 
for the duration of the study beginning with baseline studies through the completi on of the study. 
Violation of these policies will yield a subject’s data invalid for the whole study, and thus will result in 
expulsion from the study and prorated payment.  
 
D.  Research Population & Recruitment Methods  
 
Participant population  
We will stud y civilians who are recreational athletes who meet the basic health and physical fitness 
eligibility standards as evaluated using the modified Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). We use the 
APFT because of its standard of use across all US Armed Forces, and  our experience with it 
successfully selecting broadly fit students, i.e. a specialized runner might struggle, but a male or 
female with overall high aerobic fitness and strength will do well. Subjects will be matched and 
assigned to either the placebo or the two intervention  groups to achieve the necessary statistical 
power to detect meaningful changes in health and performance at high altitude. Our team has 
extensive experience in recruiting and screening subjects on college campuses to achieve this goal 
(4-64). 
  
Up to 3 00 volunteers will be screened in Eugene, Oregon to identify 100 subjects meeting the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below).

we will have enough subjects to  go to Colorado  
 
Biologic al sex once we have enrolled a 
sufficient number of males and/or females as 
we are aiming to enroll ~50% of each sex.  
However, all subjects will be allowed to 
complete all baseline screening to assure that 
we will have enough subjects to go to 
Colorado . 
 
Subjects will be excluded from telemetric pi[INVESTIGATOR_294351] a  history of obstructive 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including 
diverticulosis, diverticulitis, inflammatory 
bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn's 
disease, ulcerative colitis,  or previous GI 
surgery .  
 
Detailed recruitment methods  
Recruitment of participants will begin immediately following IRB approval. Participants will be 
solicited through flyers posted locally (posted in Eugene and on University of Oregon’s campus) , 
online,  via word of mouth , through directly contact[CONTACT_294395], faculty, and staff  using the list 
maintained by [CONTACT_294396] , and through newspaper and radio ads . Screening  will be conducted at University of 
Oregon, under the direction of [CONTACT_294417], and Universi ty of Oregon personnel will seek 
informed consent.  
 
The PI (Andy Lovering)  and graduate students  will be responsible for actively recruiting participants 
and seeking informed consent.  
 
Potential subjects responding to advertisements will be given a basic d escription of the study over 
either phone or email (depending on personal preference) and given a chance to ask any initial 
questions. Questions in the phone and email script will be used to ensure those most likely to 
qualify present for the comprehensive  screening days .  If the  subjects  wish to participate in the 
study, we will schedule their first visit.   
 
During subject recruitment, we will give examples of exclusion criteria to enable participant self -
identification for exclusion.  For example, “have you ever had a blood clot, or been told that you are 
anemic?”  
 
Compensation  
In return for the time and effort, subjects will be compensated for the st udy visits completed as 
follows:  
•        Baseline Screening: $ 75  
•        Performance Stabilizatio n: $25  
•        Colorado  Week 1: $ 400 
•        Colorado  Week 2: $ 400 
•        Post -study visits: $ 100 
 
All expenses (airfare, lodging and food) will be paid for the subject's trip to Colorado. Subjects will 
receive a check for a total of $ 1000 , if they  complete the entire study. Subjects will be mailed a check 
for $600 by [CONTACT_294397], the study s ponsor, approximately 2 weeks after completion of 
the study  and they will receive a separate check for $400 from the University of Oregon’s 
Cardiopulmonary and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_294352] . If subjects do not complete all study 
procedures or violate t he study rules (such as drinking alcohol or excess caffeine or violating CDC 
guidelines for lessening COVID -19 exposure risks), payment will be prorated based on the above  
compensation schedule, e.g., if subjects complete baseline screening and performance  stabilization 
before droppi[INVESTIGATOR_294353] $ 100. Subjects who do not comply with the study rules will be 
housed until they are able to be sent home on the next available flight without excessive costs to the 
investigators and will be paid only fo r the portions of the study they have completed before they 
were removed from the study.   
 
E.   Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent will be administered to each subject by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_20040].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_294354] -investigators thoroughly on how to best 
perform this procedure. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_294355] t he related physiology, 
study procedure and potential risks.  
 
The researcher will first verbally explain the study in its entirety and in doing so walk through the 
informed consent in person  or via an online video conferencing service . Subjects will then be  given a 
sufficient length of time to read through the informed consent form privately and 
instructed/encouraged to write down or remember any questions/concerns they may have. 
Afterward, the researcher will rejoin the subject and address any question or c oncern they may have 
while subsequently going back through the informed consent form with the subject and obtaining 
any needed initials and signature [CONTACT_82466]. Furthermore, the investigator will 
verbally address any questions the subject may have regarding the seriousness and/or likelihood for 
the occurrence of the risks described in the Informed Consent Form.  The research team will 
address probability and severity of any adverse reactions with the subject by [CONTACT_294398].  The 
investigator will also provide appropriate statistics (where available) regarding the probability of 
adverse reactions.  The investigator also advises the subject of what  he/she can expect to feel during 
a particular procedure, for example, during contrast injection.  Investigator further explains any 
questions regarding physiology or reason for a particular procedure in plain language.  
 
This process will be done either in  person when they arrive for their physical exam and informed 
consent visit or done via an online video conferencing service prior to coming to the lab for their 
physical exam. Remote informed consent via an online video conferencing service will be conduc ted 
in groups sized [ADDRESS_358456] will be telephoned or e -mailed (depending on preference) or told in 
person (while in Colorado ) to confirm participation , remind them of  the activities that will take place, 
checking for questions, and confirming continued interest  and as a reminder to: 1) stay hydrated by 
[CONTACT_294399] [ADDRESS_358457] day; 2) to limit caffeine 
intake to the equivalent of two 8 oz cups of coffee a day; 3) limit exercise to that prescribed in the 
study design; with no exercise the day before the VO2Max, APFT and 5K tests; and 4) for exercise 
tests to time their eating so [ADDRESS_358458] meal and hea vy exercise (VO2Max, 5K run or 
ruck hike).  In addition, subjects will be emailed (while in Oregon) or reminded in person (while in 
Colorado) to complete their COVID -[ADDRESS_358459] folder will be store d in locking file cabinet s inside the pr imary investigators ’ locking 
office s ([CONTACT_82470], [CONTACT_294418], [CONTACT_294419] hi, or [CONTACT_294420]) . All other 
computer files associated with the subject will be identified only through their unique subject ID and 
stored on password protec ted lab computers. The de -identified data will be kept for at least [ADDRESS_358460] will be assigned an ID using a random number code system consisti ng of three to five 
letters describing the study (e.g., COAST) and a random, non -repeating number (1 -1000). This ID will 
be associated with their data folder, which will contain all study documents and data collected 
including all associated forms (i.e. in formed consent document).  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_17459] a subject ID key capable of identifying subject IDs to subject names and contact 
[CONTACT_82457]. This ID key  will be kept in a locked filing cabinet also within the office of the primary 
investigator. No contact [CONTACT_82458].  
 
De-identified data may potentially be shared with other investigators for research purposes.  
 
Specimens collected for research will be de -identified using the subject’s unique ID and stored at the 
University of Oregon until future analysis. Blood collected to be analyzed by a third party (QUEST 
diagnostics) will be labeled with the subject’s ID and  birthdate, as required by [CONTACT_294400], and results 
from those tests will be available only to members of the Lovering lab who have access to the 
password protected QUEST Quanum online platform. No subject names are included online or on 
their specimens, and all  specimens get destroyed after analysis.  
 
G.   Potential Research Risks or Discomforts to Participants  
Confidentiality:  
If data is lost or stolen, subjects could experience invasion of privacy. To minimize the potential 
invasion of privacy, we are not col lecting social security numbers so that the potential economic 
impact is greatly minimized. All of our files will be kept in a locked filing cabinet to prevent theft and 
data will be de -identified. Data acquired on computers will be password protected.  As such, the 
probability  of the adverse outcomes discussed above is low, and the severity  is minimal.  
 
Psychological:  
For the echocardiography tests, female subjects will need to have  no sports bra  on to allow  for 
imaging of the heart and the placement of small electrodes on the chest to record heart rate.  To 
avoid any discomfort, subjects will be given a large, loose -fitting shirt (provided by [CONTACT_33365]) to 
cover up . Male subjects will either go shirtless or be given a loose -fitting shirt . As such, the 
probability  of the adverse outcomes discussed above is low, and the severity  is minimal.  
 
Physiological:  
Travel:  All subjects will be transported between Eugene and Colorado  by [CONTACT_294401]. Travel by [CONTACT_294402], carries the risk of injury or death. According to the National 
Transportation Safety Board, there are 0.[ADDRESS_358461] Traffic Safety Administration reports a fatality rate of 1.13 per 
100,000,000 miles driven on US roads. To minimize this risk, only commercial, US carriers will be 
used for air travel and all traffic laws will be strictly obeyed.  
 
Pulmonary Function Tests : Risks associated with pulmonary function testing include shortness of 
breath, cough, dizziness, and possible loss of consciousness. To minimize risks, the co -investigators 
will administer all pulmonary function tests and allow subjects to rest between meas urements.  
Lung function testing performed in our lab is a routine assessment performed in pulmonary 
function labs all over the world according to American Thoracic Society and European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_294356]. Subjects  can stop the test at any time if they  feel any of the above symptoms.  
The probability and severity of these risks is very low . 
 
VO 2MAX testing : Subjects will perform a VO2max test where they exercise to volitional exhaustion.  
Criteria for terminating a VO2max include achieving: 1) he art rate >85% of age -predicted max (220 -
age), 2) a plateau in oxygen consumption and/or a respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] >1.15; all of these 
criteria are continuously monitored on our metabolic system and Nellcor pulse oximeter. This 
carries the rare risk of d izziness, confusion, nausea, fatigue, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart 
rhythms, stroke, heart attack, and sudden death. In subjects less than 35 years old, the risk of 
sudden death of all causes is estimated to be 1 in 133,000 for men (Van Camp et al M SSE 1995).  In 
this study only 100 of 136 deaths with identifiable causes were caused by [CONTACT_294403], so this 
estimate of risk may overestimate incidence of cardiac events.  In the event of a cardiac event, 
research personnel will respond in a manner ap propriate to their level of training. All graduate 
students, study coordinators, and PIs are minimum CPR/AED/first aid certified and will therefore 
immediately call emergency services and perform CPR if appropriate. The overall risk of sudden 
death caused by a heart problem for all ages and sexes is estimated to be 1 in 15,000 to 18,000. 
(Source:  American College of Sports Medicine - ACSM).  As such, the probability  of the adverse 
reactions discussed above is low, and the severity  is very low (e.g.  dizziness) to very high (e.g. 
sudden death).  
 
Additional exercise tests (APFTs, 5k run, and rucksack carry):  Hard exercise has inherent risks 
associated with it, including stroke and heart attack. These risks are very low in young, healthy 
individuals (le ss than 0.[ZIP_CODE]%). Subjects may also feel dizzy, lightheaded, or unusually winded. 
These symptoms can be worse during exercise at high altitude. If subjects feel faint or feel like they 
can’t get enough oxygen, subjects will be instructed to tell study per sonnel as soon as possible. For 
field exercise tests, like the rucksack carry, research personnel will be stationed at various points 
along the course, including the start point, turn -around point, and various mid -way points. All 
research personnel will be equipped with  subject lists, and each subject will wear an identifiable 
running number on their clothing. Therefore, if a subject feels feint during this test, they will be close 
to the aid of research personnel  and easily identifiable to the research tea m. Subjects may 
experience muscle injury and stiffness following exercise. Proper warm -up and cool -down 
procedures will minimize the chances of this occurring.  
 
 Risks associated with core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]:  The risks of using the temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_82437]. Risks of the temperature 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_294357]. Additionally, ample lubricant 
(supposito ry) or water (oral) will be provided to the volunteer. Volunteers with history of obstructive 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including diverticulosis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative col itis, or previous GI surgery will not use a 
telemetric pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
Hypercapnia during rebreathing tests:  Risks associated with breathing hypercapnia (high carbon 
dioxide) at rest include feeling light -headed, headache, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath.  Subjects 
will be monitored with a peripheral estimate of arterial oxygen saturation using a forehead monitor to 
ensure you are well oxygenated and we will continuously monitor inspi[INVESTIGATOR_294358].  As such, the probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is moderate , 
and the severity  is minimal . 
 Intravenous catheter:   Risks associated with placement of an IV include pain and/or bleeding 
during placement, vasovagal syncope, hematoma (pooling of blood under the skin), infection, and 
vessel blockage. The placement of the IV may cause some discomfort with rare bleeding or  bruising 
at the puncture site. It also carries the risk of infection. To mitigate risks associated with vasovagal 
syncope, the subject will be safely positioned upright and sitting in an IV chair, and the subject will 
be continually monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lover ing and colleagues , all of whom are trained to place IVs . As 
such, the probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is low, and the severity  is minimal.  
 
Blood Removal:  Risks associated with the removal of blood include an aversion to seeing blood that 
could result in nausea, vasovagal syncope, increased stress, and/or feeling faint. To mitigate these 
potential risks, the subject is continually monitored by [CONTACT_294404]. In 
addition, the subject is safely and comfortably positi oned on a gurney or cot . In this way, the 
potential risk of vasovagal syncope (i.e., fainting) is mitigated.  
 
 A total of ~ 435-465 mL of blood will be drawn throughout the study. The range up to 465ml is 
included in case extra samples are required for screening metabolic panels due to abnormalities in 
findings or compromised samples. Of that volume, 25mL will be drawn baseline day 1  as part of the 
physical examination . In total,  ~162 mL will be drawn prior to departure to Colorado for metabolic 
panels, biomarker analysis, dried blood spots, Hb mass, and p50 . An additional ~ 213 mL will be 
drawn during the 2 weeks at high altitude (max volume of ~ 71mL per day), and ~ [ADDRESS_358462] -altitude testing. 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_294359], the normal volume of blood donated on a given day, 
is ~473mL. Throughout the entire study, we will be taking less than that, and the maximum volume 
for a given day does not exceed ~ 76 mL. As such, the proba bility of the adverse reactions discussed 
above is low, and the severity is minimal.  
 
The following table is meant to breakdown the volume of venous blood that will be drawn on a given 
day, as well as what it will be used for:   
 
 
  
 Saline Contrast Echocardiography:   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_82436] 
[ADDRESS_358463] blood flow through intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts.  Risks: transient 
dizziness associated with agitated sterile saline injection in patients with cardiac shunting. With 
respect to exercise, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16884] >10 years of experience using TTSCE in a research 
setting. In 4 years (2003 -2007) at the University of Wisconsin Madison, approximately 60 human 
(male and female) subjects (including 8 subjects with a paten t foramen ovale) were tested without a 
single adverse event related to TTSCE. Additionally, research done at the University or Oregon 
between 2008 and 2016 has involved >[ADDRESS_358464] and during exercise without 
incident related to the T TSCE. We will use agitated sterile saline without preservatives. Furthermore, 
we will use a minimal volume (3 -5 mL) of sterile saline. [CONTACT_82467] and colleagues  will perform 
saline contrast injections, while a trained ultrasonographer will perform echocardiography. Mixed 
saline (saltwater), either alone or with 5% sugar in water has been used to help see the 
ultrasound pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (echocardiogram) for over thirty years .  Saline contrast bubble injections 
are routinely used to screen for th e presence of a patent foramen ovale in the clinic.  The American 
Society of Echocardiography Guidelines (2014) state that “…life threatening reactions are rare (<1 in 
10,000)” when using contrast injections (including bubbles with protein shells) and The European 
Association of Echocardiography (2009) has stated that “… the evidence shows that contrast 
echocardiography is very safe in clinical practice.” And this includes using stabilized bubbles with 
protein shells and we only use non -stabilized saline co ntrast bubbles in our lab.  We only use a small 
amount of air mixed with saline, thus the probability  of any severe  adverse reaction is very low . 
Given the evidence presented above, the probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is 
low.  Although  the severity  of arterial gas emboli is high, given the amount of air used and the short 
life span of intravascular bubbles of this size, the likelihood of the constellation of unfortunate 
events required for a serious adverse reaction to occur is very sma ll. 
 
Hb mass measurement:  Risks associated with CO determination of blood volume include exposure 
to carbon monoxide.  Most non -smoking city dwellers have 1.5 -2.0% CO in their blood and the 
duplicate tests will increase it to ~15%.  The level most commonly  associated with symptoms is 
>15%, with no symptoms reported at 10% or lower. Minor symptoms are present when CO levels 
rise to 30%. These symptoms may include: confusion, headache, fatigue, nausea, shortness of 
breath, dizziness, cough, and cherry -colored  lips. To protect against an excessive increase in CO we  Informed consent  Baseline [ADDRESS_358465] -altitude

therapy we will call appropriate police dispatch, depending on the location of the incident (Eugene, 
OR or Colorado ). This method has been in use in research in a wide variety of populations to 
measure Hb mass including elite athletes (male and female), untrained individuals (male and 
female), adolescents (11 -15 year old boys and girls), elderly subjects, and pregnant women with no ill 
effects reported. The use of CO as a marker for measuring blood volume h as been in use for over 
[ADDRESS_358468].  
  
Altitude associated risks: Staying at high altitude causes systemic hypoxia. This decreased 
oxygenation can lead to several things depending on how high one goe s, how fast one goes there, 
and how well adjusted to high  altitude one is. The consequences can range from mild to severe.  
  
The most common symptoms of  high  altitude exposure are feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or short of 
breath during exercise.  We expect up to 40% of people to feel one of these things while at high  
altitude. A smaller number of people will develop acute mountain sickness (AMS). AMS is a name [CONTACT_294416], difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], upset stomach, throwing up, 
or feeling weak. These symptoms are usually temporary and manageable. They typi[INVESTIGATOR_294360]' health.  Participants will not be treated for AMS symptoms and AMS should be 
gone by [CONTACT_4475] 3 at the altitudes studied and therefore very unlikely  to overlap with COVID symptoms 
and COVID testing will occur 4 -5 days after arrival to Colorado to confirm the presence or absence of 
COVID infection.  In addition, while PFO+ subjects have shown to have increased susceptibility to 
AMS, this illness is non -life threatening and does not increase risks for those with a PFO traveling to 
altitude. More severe altitude illness will be identified and treated as outlined below.  
  
Traveling from sea level  to high  altitude can, in rare occasions, lead to more seriou s conditions. Two 
of these include high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). 
Both of these conditions are potentially fatal if left untreated. HAPE is a serious disorder that 
sometimes occurs with a fast change in altitu de (going up). It occurs in less than 1% of people going 
from baseline  to altitudes used in this study. The APFT will be at 9,[ADDRESS_358469]. Suspected HAPE cases will be treated by a doctor familiar with the 
condition.  
  
The o ther serious complication of high  altitude is HACE. HACE is very rare. The possibility of seeing 
HACE is extremely low. In our previous studies involving >[ADDRESS_358470] finger oximetry (Nellcor N -200). Subjects will also fill out a 
questionnaire designed to quantify the level of AMS they are exp eriencing, if any. Furthermore, 
subjects will be monitored for other signs that they are proceeding down a path that may threaten 
their health. These include severe AMS symptoms: a severe headache that does not go away, 
uncontrolled vomiting, extreme dizzi ness, or excessive weakness. Other signs include: blue 
fingernails, trouble breathing while resting, unsteady walk, extreme paleness, or incoherent or 
bizarre behavior. In the event that the research team notices these signs and symptoms, they will 
call em ergency services immediately so that appropriate m edical personnel can treat these 
symptoms. The research being done in Colorado, whether in Leadville or Breckenridge, will occur in 
and around town and will never be far from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294361] y transport. Oxygen and 
transportation back to Denver will be available at all times. In the event of a life -threatening 
emergency, we will call 911. Although we do not expect most of these symptoms to develop, we 
cannot rule out the possibility. It is imp ortant to note that the combined experience of the research 
team amounts to over a century of doing this type of study with no severe adverse events in that 
time.  
 
During the rucksack carry, there is cell phone service throughout the hikes. Subjects are 
accompanied with research teams ahead of and behind the subjects, with research assistants setup 
along the trail with radios (walkie talkies) to contact [CONTACT_294405]. The Colorado group ha s comp leted over [ADDRESS_358471]. Vincent He alth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] 1.4 miles from College Mountain College (where subject’s will 
be staying) and subjects can be transported within [ADDRESS_358472] significant environmental risks include 
lightning strikes, traumatic injury from falls in rough mountain terrain, and sunburn from the higher 
UV-light exp osure. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_294406]; by [CONTACT_294407], and by 
[CONTACT_294408]. Finally, the 
investigators have more than three decades of experience conducting field research and dealing 
with these challenges,4-64 including recent experience with an identical protocol in identical 
mountain setting with nearly identical testing procedures and with no serious unanticipated 
outcomes.  
 
Risks associated with drug intervention s: Some of the known risks associated with EP O are joint/ 
muscle/bone pain, fever, cough, rash, nausea, vomitting, soreness of mouth, itching, headache, 
redness and pain in the skin where EPO shots are given, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous 
thromboembolism, thrombosis of vascular access, and tumor progression or recurrence. Some of 
the known risks associated with iron are pain and swelling at the site of injection . In order to 
minimize these risks, all precautions and warning labels will be followed , and dosing volumes will be 
strictly adhered to . Serious allergic reaction s to this drug are unlikely, but may include: rash , 
itching /swelling (especially  of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing . Subjects 
will be excluded from the study for any health problems that may negatively effect their reaction to 
these dru gs (see table of inclusion and exclusion criteria  and drug appendices  for specific exclusion 
criteria ). FDA recall lists for drugs being administered to participants  will be checked weekly 
beginning with the initiation of drug administration.  
 
Risks for subjects who are pregnant : Potential risks to subjects who are pregnant (beyond the 
risks outlined above for the general population) include exercising beyond than what is 
recommended by [CONTACT_221003] (see ‘VO 2max testing’ and ‘additional exercise testing’ above)  and 
potential unknown risks to the child bearer or fetus from carbon monoxide inhalation (see ‘Hb mass 
measurement’ above). None of the additional risks described above are greater in those who are 
pregnant. Due to the increased risk of exercise tes ting and Hb mass measurements, any subject 
with childbearing potential will be required to take a pregnancy test on a day that involves maximal 
exercise testing (VO2max) and Hb mass testing while at baseline  and in Colorado , and if such a test 
comes back p ositive, they will be immediately excluded from the study. Therefore, there is no added 
risk to the child bearer or the fetus from any of the above -mentioned protocols, as they will not 
undergo those procedures. As such, the probability of an adverse react ion is zero, and the severity 
of an adverse reaction is zero.  
 
COVID -19 related risks : Due to the SARS -Cov2 pandemic, there is the added risk of COVID -19 
infection for subjects and staff in this study. To mitigate this risk, all research personnel will be 
fully vaccinated before the initiation of any study  (see below) .  Additionally, per standard 
protocol, all mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_294362]. Researchers will wear appropriate PPE, including masks, lab coats or 
scrubs, safety glasses, and gloves. Additionally, proper social distancing can be done with the most 
protocols descri bed above, i.e. maintaining 6 feet between participants and researchers. When 
possible, testing will be performed outdoors to maximize social distancing (i.e. during 5km and 
uphill rucksack tests).  While the severity of COVID -[ADDRESS_358473] created a COVID -19 plan outlined below, including 
additional precautions during travel, exposure scenarios , vaccination requirements, etc.  
 
COVID -19 plan  
All research team members and subjects will be required to be fully vaccinated prior to beginning 
the study. Subjects’ vaccination cards will be scanned, and identifiable data (name, birthday, etc.) will 
be blacked out prior to photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_294363]. Subjects will be 
considered fully vaccinated to the extent that is recommended by [CONTACT_294409] 
(for example, if a booster shot is recommended and available, subjects and researchers must 
receive it).  
 
Prior  to departure to Colorado, subjects will self -monitor symptoms and be told to not come in to 
the lab if they experience any symptoms of COVID and get tested if recommended by [CONTACT_294410]. While in Colorado, r esearch team  members will screen all 
participants daily for symptoms and signs of COVID. If subjects  report symptoms that suggest they  
have COVID, transportation will be provided to the closest COVID testing center. The subject  or the 
subject’s  insurance company will be responsible for costs related to the COVID test , if there are costs 
incurred . If the subject’s  COVID test is positive  prior to or while in Colorado , they  will be withdrawn 
from the study  and they  will be treated by [CONTACT_294411] C DC guidelines. The 
subject  or the subject’s  insurance company will be responsible for any costs related to medical care 
for COVID. Research team members will check on subjects  closely and will work to arrange safe 
transportation back to Oregon when the med ical personnel tell us it is safe for them to travel.  
 
Compensation for an injury or assistance with medical bills resulting from the subject’s  participation, 
including contracting COVID, in the course of this research is not available from the University  of 
Oregon or Research Logistics LLC.  If subjects  get sick or injured as part of your participation in this 
study, the subject  or the subject’s  insurance provider will be charged for the cost of the care.  
 
COVID Compliance protocol  
Compliance to CDC guidelines for minimizing risk of exposure to COVID -[ADDRESS_358474] be adhered to by 
[CONTACT_294412] . In order to hold participants accountable, subjects will 
be emailed a Qualtrics survey to check ‘yes, I have been following appropr iate COVID protocols’, or 
‘no, I have not been following appropriate COVID protocols’ in their reminder email prior to every lab 
visit in Oregon . Subjects will also be required to fill this survey out starting weekly [ADDRESS_358475] the opportunity to report pod mates 
who are no following guidelines.  Additionally, each week the participants will  be updated on any 
changes to CDC guidelines which will be included as part of the survey.  
 
COVID transportation protocol  
Participants will be given a “covid -19 travel bag” which will include one 4 oz bottle of hand sanitizer 
(minimum 60% alcohol), 3 KN95 masks, and several alcohol wipes. We will ask the participants to do 
the following while traveling:  
• Before walking into the airport: put KN95 mask on, this will stay on the entire duration of 
airplane travel  
• When seated on airplane use alcohol wipes to di sinfect all touch surfaces by [CONTACT_294413] p tray, buckle, arm rests, overhead light/air controls, and if in window seat, 
the window screen pull. Then, use hand sanitizer to clean hands.  
• After exiting the airport in Colorado trash the first KN9 [ADDRESS_358476] with a fresh one, 
this mask will be used for the duration of the bus ride to Leadville  or Breckenridge . Use hand 
sanitizer.  
• When seated in the bus, use alcohol wipes to disinfect all touch surfaces by [CONTACT_294414]. Use 
hand sanitizer.  
• Upon a rrival to Leadville  or Breckenridge , trash the bus KN95 and replace with a fresh mask. 
Use hand sanitizer.  
• Participants will be given a new “covid -19 travel bag” when they depart from Colorado  so 
that their travel back may be as safe as possible. They will be expected to follow the same 
protocol for traveling to Eugene as they did while traveling to Colorado . 
 
COVID testing protocol  
If at any time during a subject’s stay in Colorado they experience  symptoms of COVID , they will be 
given a COVID  test and their pod will be quarantined.  
 
Safety Equipment available in the Cardiopulmonary and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_294352] 
(where all testing and screening will be performed):  Phillips FRx AED, a spare AED battery, and 
spare AED pads, bottled oxygen and face masks, all necessary equipment to run ACLS algorithms 
(suction, masks, breathing bag, etc.) and ACLS drugs such as chewable aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and oxygen will be 
administered as required by [CONTACT_294415]. Additionally, a standard first aid kit is also 
available.   
 
Emergency Procedures:   According to American Heart guidelines, in the event of an adverse 
cardiopulmonary event, we will begin CPR, call 911 (as directed by U of O EH&S), and will continue 
CPR as required until emergency medical personnel arrive.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injectors (Epi [INVESTIGATOR_294364]) will 
be avail able if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_294365]/or 911 operator supported a decision to use  an 
Epi [INVESTIGATOR_294366].  In addition, a separate  emergency procedure document is included .  
 
Safety Monitoring : Subjects will be given clear instructions that they should notify the investigators 
immediately if they experience any of the above -mentioned risk symptoms.  During the VO2max test and 
recovery procedures, all subjects will be non -invasively and continuou sly monitored for vital signs 
using a forehead monitor to monitor arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate. During all other 
procedures subjects will be visually monitored for any signs of discomfort, distress or problems.  
During both exercise and restin g procedures, the investigators will continuously ask the subjects 
how they are feeling and how they are doing. If subjects have ingested a core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_294367] (no MRI) to wear until the study staff can ensure  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_294368].  
Medical Monitor : [CONTACT_294421], MD, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS)  will serve 
as the medical monitor for this study. [CONTACT_294422] will receive regular reports on volunteer status. 
He will also evaluate adverse event reports and monitor study progress. He will discuss research 
progress with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a weekly basis. He wi ll promptly report discrepancies or problems to the IRB 
of record and the HRPO. He shall have the authority to stop this research study in progress, remove 
individual subjects from a study, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and 
wellbeing of research subjects until the IRB can assess their report. The medical monitor is required 
to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse events and 
all subject deaths associated with the protocol and pr ovide an unbiased written report of the event. 
At a minimum, the medical monitor will comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and in 
case of a serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship of the event to participation 
in the study. T he medical monitor will also indicate whether he concurs with the details of the report 
provided by [CONTACT_978]. Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_21114] [INVESTIGATOR_294369].  
H.  Potential Benefits of the Research  
This study will not improve the health of subjects and is only  being done to gather information. This 
study will not improve the health of the general s ubject population. Completing the aims of this 
study will have the benefit of contributing to generalizable knowledge.

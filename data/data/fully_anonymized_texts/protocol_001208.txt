Anti-viral Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
July 14, [ADDRESS_1071399]. Davangere P Devanand.  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_779375] (CU).  Since m any
procedures are conducted at [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) through a Resear ch
Foundation for Mental Hygiene (RFMH) subcontract, the term “NYSPI” is used to refer to CU/NYSP I
conduct of the protocol.  By [CONTACT_15094], all policies and procedures refer to CU/NYSPI, and procedures
specific to the two other sites, [LOCATION_001] University (NYU ; PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Thomas Wisniewski ) and Banne r
Alzheimer’s Institute (BAI; PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Allison Perrin ), are indicated accordingly.
In this study, we will be conducting the first controlled clinical trial to directly address the long -standing 
viral etiology hypothesis of Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) which posits that viruses, particularly the very 
common herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV1) and herpes simplex virus -2 (HSV2), may be etiologic or 
contribute to the pathology of AD.  
The generic antiviral drug valacyclovir at 4 g per day, repurposed as an anti -AD drug, will be compared 
to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 patients (65 valacyclovir, 65 placebo) with mild AD in a 
randomized, double -blind, 18 -month Phase II proof o f concept trial.  Participants are required to be 
seropositive for HSV1 or HSV2.  The targeted number of participants was reduced from 130 to 120 (60 
valacyclovir, 60 placebo) because of delays due to the COVID pandemic and the funding timeline.  This 
change was approved by [CONTACT_779495], NIA.  
We hypothesize that patients treated with valacyclovir will show less decline in cognition and function 
compared to placebo; will show less amyloid accumulation than those on placebo using 18F -Florbetapir 
PET imaging, and less tau binding than those on placebo using 18F -MK-6240 tau PET Imaging.  
Background  
The viral hypothesis  of Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  posits  that viruses  in the brain, specifically  herpes 
simplex virus -1 (HSV1) and to a lesser extent herpes simplex virus -2 (HSV2), may be etiologic or 
contribute to AD pathology. HSV has been implicated for several reasons. HSV1 and HSV2 can 
trigger amyloid aggregation and their DNA is common in plaques. Anti -HSV drugs reduce Aβ and 
P-tau accumulation in brains of mice infected with HSV1, and HSV1 reactivation is associated
with tau hyperphosphorylation. There  is a strong association  between HSV1 and amyloid  plaques
in AD brains but not normal brains. After initial oral infection, HSV1 becomes latent in the
trigeminal ganglion and can enter the brain via retrograde axonal transport. Recurrent reactivationwith newly produced HSV viral particles, ‘drop by [CONTACT_210339],’ is  supported  by [CONTACT_779496] p-tau and VP22, a key target  for phosphorylation.
Valacyclovir, a pro -drug of acyclovir, is a generic anti -viral drug. Acyclovir is converted by [CONTACT_779497]. Therefore, valacyclovir leads to death of infected cells but not non -infected 
cells and has efficacy against several herpes viru ses.  
Valacyclovir may be both symptomatic and disease -modifying because chronic use leads to prolonged 
HSV suppression in patients with peripheral HSV infection. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_87492] [ADDRESS_1071400] size of around 1.0 on three cognitive tests of memory from the Penn battery. V alacyclovir has 
been tested in multiple sclerosis (MS) with equivocal results for changes in MRI lesions; cognition was 
not assessed in the MS trials.  
[ADDRESS_1071401] widely used generic antiviral drug with over 20 years of worldwide use. It is approved for the treatment of HSV1, HSV2, varicella zoster (shingles), and chickenpox. No other available antiviral drug, e.g., acyclovir (intravenous), famciclovir and ganciclovir, has been shown to be superior to valacyclovir in the treatment of HSV1 and HSV2.  Recommended dose of oral valacyclovir for peripheral acute HSV infections is 1 to 3 g daily, and bioavailability is 54%. For long-term HSV suppression, the dose is 1 g daily. In patients with HIV infection and clinical AIDS, valacyclovir 8 g/day was associated with serious adverse events in 10% of patients including GI disturbances and headache, and thrombotic microangiopathy in a few cases. Doses of 6-8 g daily are tolerated in healthy young adults. The difficulty in obtaining efficacy for any drug in AD has led us to target a dose of valacyclovir 4 g daily in this proof-of-concept trial; [ADDRESS_1071402] of this protocol, which is consistent with U.S. prevalence rates, HSV1/HSV2 seropositivity rate is estimated to be 60-65%.  Participants can continue on cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, if doses are stable for 1 month prior to study entry. Major neurological and psychiatric disorders are excluded.  Psychotropic and other medications will be permitted. Medication dosage may be changed if indicated by [CONTACT_5989]. All medication changes will be documented using the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) rating form for possible ancillary analyses. Valacyclovir does not have any major drug-drug/drug-food interactions.  SPECIFIC AIMS.  The aim is to evaluate valacyclovir, a repurposed generic antiviral drug, as a treatment for early AD. An additional aim is to evaluate the effect of valacyclovir on biomarkers of AD. VALAD is a Phase II, proof of concept (POC), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month treatment trial with early AD and antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2.  Hypothesis 1. Patients treated with valacyclovir will show smaller decline than patients treated with placebo on the ADAS-Cog11 (primary outcome; cognitive measure, 0 to 78 weeks). Hypothesis 2. Patients treated with valacyclovir will show smaller decline than patients treated with placebo on the ADCS-ADL (secondary outcome; function measure, 0 to 78 weeks). Hypothesis 3. Patients treated with valacyclovir will show less accumulation than patients on placebo in PET amyloid scans’ (18F-Florbetapir, 0 to 78 weeks) combining six ROIs (SUVR: cerebellar reference) that show increased uptake in AD: medial orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate, precuneus. Hypothesis 4. From baseline to 78 weeks, patients treated with valacyclovir will show smaller increase in 18F-MK-6240 binding (SUVR: combining medial temporal, lateral temporal, prefrontal, parietal, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_779376], ROIs, with cerebellar reference) than patients treated with placebo. 18F-MK-[ADDRESS_1071403] year after study initiation and conducted in a subset of the overall sample.  In exploratory analyses, we will compare valacyclovir to placebo for changes in global cognition (MoCA), verbal memory (Craft story delayed verbatim recall), and examine age, sex and apolipoprotein E e4 genotype as a potential moderator of outcome.  We will explore the AD “signature” of regional cortical thinning and whole brain cortical thinning on MRI for 
4  
         valacyclovir compared to placebo. We will evaluate plasma acyclovir levels.  In the subsample with CSF acyclovir levels, we will examine CSF acyclovir levels and if a sufficient number of participants has LPs done for CSF, plasma/CSF acyclovir correlations will be examined.  Inclusion Criteria:  1. Females must be postmenopausal defined as 12 consecutive months without menstruation. 2. Diagnosis of probable AD by [CONTACT_779498]. 3. Folstein Mini Mental State (MMSE) score 18 to 28 (inclusive) out of 30. 4. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 (mild dementia). 5. A family member or other individual who is in contact [CONTACT_779499]. 6. Patient retains capacity to consent for him/herself or retains the capacity to identify a surrogate who will consent on his/her behalf. 7. At screening, patients must test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2. Patients that test equivocal (index between 0.90-1.09; < 0.90 is negative and > 1.09 is positive) will repeat the test within [ADDRESS_1071404] (first test was equivocal), we will enroll the patient in the study because “equivocal” indicates the presence of antibodies that do not reach the minimum threshold. 8. Use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, and concomitant psychotropic medications (other than high- dose benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]), will be permitted throughout the trial. Doses of these medications will need to be stable for at least 1 month prior to study entry. Any changes to the medication will be documented in the participant research chart. Medications given for other medical reasons, e.g., anti-diabetic or antihypertensive medications, will not be altered for the purposes of this trial and the patient’s primary physician may adjust such medications as medically indicated throughout the trial. Details of concomitant medication use will be documented at all visits and will be available for statistical analysis. 9. For patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and CDR score of 0.5 (questionable dementia), if these patients have biomarkers of AD neuropathology with either a positive amyloid PET scan, positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan of the brain, or positive findings for AD in CSF (low ABeta42 and high tau, p-tau protein levels) they will be eligible for the study. This applies to patients who already had an amyloid PET scan, FDG PET scan of the brain, or lumbar puncture, prior to recruitment into the protocol.   Exclusion Criteria:  1. Caregiver and/or participant is unwilling or unable to comply with study instructions. 2. Patient has dementia predominantly of non-Alzheimer’s type, including vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, substance-induced dementia. 3. Modified Hachinski scale score greater than 4 4. Current clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, other psychosis, bipolar disorder or current major depression by [CONTACT_2681]-5 criteria. Prior history of major depression will not be exclusionary (25% of older adults have a lifetime history of major depression). 5. Active suicidal intent or plan based on clinical assessment. 
5  
         6. Current or recent (past 6 months) alcohol or substance use disorder (DSM-5 criteria). 7. Current diagnosis of other major neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, CNS infection, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 8. Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. MRI findings of cerebrovascular disease (small infarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion. 9. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or metastases in the last [ADDRESS_1071405] history of successfully treated cancer will not lead to exclusion. 10. Sitting blood pressure > 160/100 mm Hg Physician Evaluation 11. Renal failure as determined by [CONTACT_779500] (GFR) < 44 ml/min/1.73m2. 12. Serum vitamin B12 levels below the normal range. 13. Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome will be excluded. 14. Use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_779377] 2 mg daily. 15. For patients consenting to lumbar puncture (40% of sample), this procedure will be conducted if there is no lower spi[INVESTIGATOR_779378]. 16. For MRI, metal implants and pacemaker, and claustrophobia such that the patient refuses MRI. In our experience, these exclusions occur in less than 5% of patients with mild AD. MRI is required for VALAD. 17. Radiation exposure in the prior 12 months that, together with 18F- Florbetapir and 18F-MK-6240 PET, will be above the FDA annual radiation exposure threshold. This will be determined through study staff ( i.e. Principal Investigator, Study Physician) discussion with potential subjects at Screening, documenting inquiry about radiation history. If there is any history of additional radiation exposure in the past year; it will be reviewed with PET Center staff for their approval before proceeding. The combined radiation exposure from the maximum doses used for 18F- Florbetapir and 18F-MK-6240 is within the FDA limits for annual radiation exposure and the second scan in each patient will be done 18 months after the initial PET scan (for both radioligands). 18. Severe vision or hearing impairment that would prevent the participant from performing the psychometric tests accurately. This will be a clinical determination by [CONTACT_779501]. 19. Olfaction component: current upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (patient tested as soon as this improves), current smoker > 1 pack daily (past smoking has been shown not to affect UPSIT scores, UPSIT score < 12/40 ([ADDRESS_1071406]) indicating congenital anosmia. In our experience, less than 3% of cases are excluded for having one or more of these exclusionary criteria. If a patient is excluded from the olfaction component, the patient will still be eligible for the main protocol and all other study procedures.   In the study sample, we anticipate 55% female and 45% male participants, 25% minorities comprising 12% African American, 12% Hispanic and 1% Asian.

Introduction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Valacyclovir treatment in a 78-weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group treatment trial in participants with early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and positive serum antibodies (IgG or IgM) to HSV1 or HSV2. This statistical analysis plan provides more detailed descriptions of the statistical analyses conducted in the paper.   2. Study Design  One hundred and twenty participants with clinical diagnosis of probable AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), confirmed by a positive amyloid PET or FDG PET scan or a CSF AD profile, 
7  
         were randomized to Valacyclovir or placebo at 1:1 ratio. Block randomization with varying block sizes (2 and 4) was used to reduce the risk of treatment allocation prediction by [CONTACT_15098]. Participants were evaluated at five scheduled visits (weeks 0, 12, 26, 52, and 78).  As a proof-of-concept study, the target dose of Valacyclovir was 4 g per day -- at the higher end of the usual oral dosing range. Treatment began at 2 g per day (1 g twice daily), with the dose increased by 1 g per day every two weeks until reaching either 4 g per day or the participant’s maximum tolerated dose.  3. Outcome Measures. 1) Cognitive and functional measures:  •  Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11), assessed at weeks 0, 12, 26, 52, 78; scoring range 0-70, higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.  (Primary) • Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), assessed at weeks 0, 12, 26, 52, 78; scoring range 0-78, higher scores indicate better daily functioning. (Secondary) • Craft story delayed verbatim recall, assessed at weeks 0, 52, 78; scoring range 0-44, higher scores indicating better memory. (Secondary) • Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), assessed at weeks 0, 52, 78; scoring range 0 to 30, higher scores indicating better global cognition. (Secondary) For all cognitive and functional measures, the outcome of interest is the change from baseline at each follow-up time point. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 78 weeks.  2) Imaging measures: • 18FFlorbetapir PET SUVR: Mean standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporal lobe, and precuneus, normalized to cerebellar gray matter. • 18FMK-6240 PET SUVR (Medial Temporal): SUVR averaged across medial temporal regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampus. • 18FMK-6240 PET SUVR (Global Mean): SUVR global mean normalized to cerebellar gray matter. • MRI Cortical Thickness: Mean cortical thickness across nine predefined brain regions. • MRI Hippocampal Volume: Volume of the hippocampus. All imaging measures were collected at baseline and 78 weeks. The outcomes are defined as the change in each measure from baseline to 78 weeks.  4. Sample Size Calculation. The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome: change in ADAS-Cog11 scores from baseline to [ADDRESS_1071407] correlation of r=0.3 (moderate correlation) for repeated measures and a uniform dropout rate reaching 15% by 78 weeks, a total sample size of 130 participants (65 per arm) was 
[ADDRESS_1071408] Cohen’s d of 0.50 with 80% power at 5% significance level.  With approval from sponsor (NIA) and DSMB, the recruitment target was reduced to 120 participants due to pandemic-related recruitment delays and required study completion within the extended funding timeline.  For n=120, the minimum detectable effect size increased slightly to a Cohen’s d of 0.52.  5. Statistical analysis The analyses were conducted on the Intent-to-treat (ITT) sample, i.e., all randomized participants according to the treatment that they were assigned. All hypotheses were tested at level of significance of 5%.  There was no adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons in this trial.  All analyses were conducted using R.    We first examined patients’ baseline characteristics to ensure that covariates were balanced between treatment and placebo arms. Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations, while categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages.  Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the efficacy of Valacyclovir as compared to placebo on cognitive and functional outcomes. Specifically, for each outcome measure, we considered the following model Δ𝑌!"=𝛽#+𝛽$∗𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝!+𝜶∗𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒!"+𝜸∗𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝!∗𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒!"+𝛿𝑌!#+𝑏!+𝜖!",         (1)    where Δ𝑌!" is change of the outcome measure (week 𝑡 minus baseline) for subject 𝑖 at timepoint 𝑡, 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝! is the treatment group indicator for subject 𝑖 (1= Valacyclovir and 0=placebo), 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒!" is the visit time point (treated as a categorical variable), 𝑌!# is baseline value of the outcome measure for subject 𝑖, 𝑏! is a subject-specific random intercept, and 𝜖!" is the unexplained residual error term.  (𝛽#,𝛽$,𝜶, 𝜸,𝛿) are fixed effects parameters. The efficacy of Valacyclovir versus placebo at each time point was tested by [CONTACT_779502]. The model was further adjusted for key demographic and genetic variables, including age, sex, and apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status. Missing data on outcome variables were dealt with by [CONTACT_2329] (longitudinal) linear mixed effects models which do not require complete measurements under the “missing at random” assumption.   For the primary outcome (ADAS-Cog 11), a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the findings across key clinical subgroups and under different analytic assumptions. These included: 1) a per-protocol analysis limited to participants who completed the study; 2) a subgroup analysis of participants who received cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine; and 3) a subgroup analysis of participants with a baseline 18F-Florbetapir PET SUVR ≥ 1.15 (amyloid positive for AD).  Linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of Valacyclovir on changes in imaging outcomes from baseline to [ADDRESS_1071409] being a completer, with probabilities estimated using logistic regression with ridge regularization to handle potential collinearity among baseline variables.  To assess safety, adverse events were systematically evaluated. For each type of adverse event, number and proportion of participants who experienced the adverse event was reported and compared by [CONTACT_779503]’s exact test. In addition, plasma acyclovir and CSF acyclovir concentrations obtained at [ADDRESS_1071410] deviations.

         • report to NIA on the safety and progress of the trial;  • make recommendations to the NIA and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_201127], termination or modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study; • ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring; and,  • assist the NIA by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, sample size and/or data collection.  The DSMB will discharge itself from its duties when the last participant completes the study.  The DCC will be responsible for preparing data and completing data analyses requested by [CONTACT_4318]. The study team will hold teleconferences with the DSMB every 6 months (or more frequently based on subject recruitment and/or participant safety concerns) at the call of the chairperson and/or NIA program official. The DSMB will be notified of SAE reports from the study site on an ongoing basis. The program manager will be responsible for scheduling DSMB teleconferences as well as generating an agenda for those calls.   To schedule DSMB teleconferences, the program manager will send a Doodle poll to all required attendees: Coordinating Center and sub-site PIs, [CONTACT_779593], NIA Program, DSMB Chair and members, as well as DSMB members’ assistants if needed (with the DSMB members cc’d in the initial scheduling email).

[ADDRESS_1071419] Andrews generates the unblinded report directly to DSMB members with participant data by [CONTACT_15500].  Blinded study staff are not privy to this information.  DSMB Communications  All key communications (including protocols, manual of procedures, reports, recommendations and other study-related correspondence) will be distributed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Devanand and/or the data management team led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Howard Andrews to DSMB board members and NIA program officials.  In between meetings, the DSMB would like to be notified of, and review key changes to the protocol requiring IRB approval. These communications should be generated by [CONTACT_6624] (i.e. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779395], who will produce official reports for coordinating center and sub sites), reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Devanand, then sent to the DSMB chair and members. An example of this would be amendment to protocol: the DSMB would like to be notified of any amendments to protocol after they have been submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1036]. Report of amendment should be coalesced with supporting documentation for the DSMB’s review by [CONTACT_40422] [INVESTIGATOR_779395], reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124].

Recruitment: Recruitment is multifaceted and involves a variety of sources. Each source must be managed meticulously, and the relationships involved with each must be maintained accordingly. A focus on recruitment for this study is a high priority.  At all stages of recruitment, two key points should be emphasized:  1. This study has a simple two-step screening and consent process. Potential patients may not be eligible due to HSV seronegativity based on a blood draw in the clinic followed by [CONTACT_779510]1 IgG and IgM, and HSV2 IgG and IgM levels.   2. Patients will have an hour to discuss the study procedures with a physician at their screening visit.   Recruitment Sources (Recruitment Closed at this time) 1.

Whitney (Nitsa) MS, RD, RN  Email: [EMAIL_14869] Phone: ([PHONE_16255]   Taub Recruitment and Referral Procedure: For referred patients who are potentially eligible for multiple studies: Taub staff will initiate contact, discuss options, and send study information to patients. Taub staff will offer patients the possibility of hearing more about the study from the study team. If the patient(s) agree to hear more, Taub staff will refer accordingly and will follow up on which study the patient(s) decided to participate in. For referred patients who are potentially eligible for one study: Taub staff will forward the referral directly to the study team to avoid multiple contacts. The Taub staff will follow up with the team regarding screening outcome. For patients who were identified as potentially eligible but were not referred to us: Taub staff will not contact [CONTACT_102]. If the clinician agreed that the study team may contact [CONTACT_102](s), the study team will inform Taub staff prior to contact[CONTACT_779516]. No patient will be contact[CONTACT_779517]. Taub staff must be informed regarding the outcome of research staff contact [CONTACT_779518]. For outside referrals: Taub staff will prescreen any interested participant, recruit for all potential studies, and refer to the study team accordingly, and will follow up on regrading which study the patient decided to participate in. Monthly updates to PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749]: A monthly report will be sent to the PIs with the status of referred patients per study.   In-person Recruitment When a referring physician has a potential research patient and their caregiver(s) in the office for a scheduled visit, they may call [CONTACT_779589] and/or the RC to come over and discuss the study. RC’s should always be ready for an in-person presentation as this is a highly effective resource for recruitment. [CONTACT_779589] and/or the RC will be ready with a consent packet and some basic screening forms including the MMSE and calendar. This is an opportunity to build rapport and explain the study in detail. We may find out that a patient/family is not interested, that they need more time to think about their involvement, or that they would like to schedule an evaluation as soon as possible. After this interview, the RC needs to follow up within the week and finalize the decision about whether the patient joins the study based on communications with the patient/caregiver/referring physician as appropriate.  As a rule, if a patient with whom a RC has previously discussed the VALAD protocol (by [CONTACT_648], over email, etc.) is going to be seen at the NI3 for a DPO appointment, the coordinator who previously spoke with that patient must meet with the patient before or after their appointment, to follow up, further discuss VALAD 
17  
         screening and plan an in-person screen. Consents and a 1-page ad will be brought to the patient for reference. We know when patients are being seen based on patient names reviewed during weekly pre-screening EPIC review, and corresponding email sent to Nitsa Whitney. If old medical records cannot be found in EPIC, CROWN records are still available for review.  The RC will email or call the DPO provider 1-2 days prior to the patient’s appointment, and let the MD know that we would like a few minutes to discuss VALAD with the patient. If the MD isn’t interested in the RCs visit to NI3, we offer the patient the opportunity to come to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779401], for an in-person screen (patient must come with a caregiver in this case). Outcomes will be presented at the Tuesday Research Meeting.  Prescreening To comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, the site applied for a partial waiver of HIPAA. The study team at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779402] a Request for HIPAA Waiver Authorization and/or Waiver of Consent. The NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779403] a partial waiver for telephone screens and a full waiver for the purpose of accessing an existing database or records to identify potential research subjects. Recruitment for this study depends on this waiver and ability to prescreen because it is not practical for the attending physicians to screen for their patients’ eligibility themselves. Therefore, the research study staff needs to identify potential research participants before suggesting that the attending physicians and Nitsa discuss the study with their patients.  Recruitment ended before IRB protocol transfer from the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779404].  Therefore, the Columbia IRB did not require their own HIPAA waiver documentation and approval for recruitment of participants in this protocol.  Prescreening patients for potential eligibility is a necessary practice for effective recruitment in this study. What follows is a general description of how to prescreen based on practices at NYSPI.   Procedure: Communication with Nitsa and DPO Providers  • The RC reviews possible participants from lists of patients scheduled to see DPO Providers in the week to come. Pre-screen eligibility is determined through comparing EPIC records against key inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Procedure: Responding to Direct Referrals from Physicians  Note: This procedure applies when a physician directly emails patients to [CONTACT_779589] or a research coordinator. When physicians refer through Nitsa, all further communication and updates should follow the ‘Communication with Nitsa and DPO Providers’ procedure above.  1. First, review in EPIC whether or not the patient is eligible or close to being eligible. MMSEs from 18-28 are acceptable.  a. If a patient is clearly not eligible, include that in your response to the physician.  b. If the patient is eligible, gather as much information as possible about the patient from EPIC. This includes where they live, who the informant is, and whether there are any practical issues affecting recruitment (e.g. the patient is living in [LOCATION_012] for 3 months).  2. Respond to the physician email.    a. [CONTACT_779589] and all relevant study staff.  b. Contact [CONTACT_102]/caregiver as appropriate.  c. Update the provider within 24 hours regarding the patient’s status: the patient is not interested; the patient is scheduled for a screening visit; the patient is considering the study but has not made a final decision. d. For patients who are yet to make a final decision, the process of follow up (calls and email) needs to be completed within the week. The following steps are suggested: 
18  
         • Inform the patient/caregiver that they may speak with an MD to discuss study participation if they wish.  If patients would like to speak with the aforementioned providers, phone numbers will be provided. • For patients who do not wish to speak with an MD, inform them that you will reach out again in 3 days to follow up.  • When reaching out [ADDRESS_1071425]. We do not want to keep potential patients in a pending status for more than 5 business days.  • In all phone calls, offer the option of coming in for a screening visit to meet with the research team and discuss any issues. We must always stress that we as the research team are here to address issues/concerns, whatever they may be. Be as specific as possible when offering to schedule the screening visit (i.e. “I have just had an opening free up for this Thursday at 1:00pm. Would you be available to come in for a screening visit then?”). In cases where the RC has not been able to schedule a screen for a patient despi[INVESTIGATOR_779405] (at least 3 times with no success), the RC will send out a follow up letter with investigator approval. Ideally the screening visit should involve the patient and caregiver.  In some cases, the caregiver may want to come alone to discuss the study, and that is also acceptable. • Update the tracker accordingly and provide an update to the referring provider after each contact [CONTACT_779519] (within 24 hours). When the research coordinator is unable to schedule a patient for a screening visit, the patient should be taken off the “Pending Screening” section of the tracker and moved onto the “Archived” tracker.  Very important: When a DPO provider directly refers one of their patients to the VALAD study, we screen for VALAD first and do not consider the respective patient(s) for any other protocol at MDC. In the case of VALAD screen failure the RC must first ask the referring provider whether or not he/she approves of his/her patient being considered for any other study. We can query the referring provider about other protocols his/her patient may be eligible for as soon as VALAD screen failure is fully elucidated.   Phone Screens: The following phone screening script will be used: *Verbal consent must be obtained before continuing with phone screening. All patients/informants who discuss participation in the trial need to be recorded on a phone-screen log. Coordinators should express to callers that we are offering a free screening evaluation to a research study without any initial commitment required. During the phone screen, staff must explain compensation details to subjects and/or caregivers. “We are required to mention the total compensation for participation in the protocol.  For subjects who complete Lumbar Puncture the total compensation will be $880.00; for those who do not complete LP, the total compensation will be $580.00. We will also reimburse for transportation.”    Contact [CONTACT_779520], we will implement this by [CONTACT_779521] “Patient Tracking Form” in full during in person screening.  Whenever calling a patient directly the RC should ask the patient if they can also speak to their family member or other caregiver if applicable. If they say yes, then speak to the family member as well to make sure everyone is on board and to identify the informant and to confirm appointments, etc.    Initial Phone Call: First make sure that you are speaking to the correct person, or ask for the correct person, e.g., patient or patient’s spouse, at the start of your phone call. Hello. My name [CONTACT_832] ______. I am calling from Columbia University Medical Center (or NYU) I understand that you called in response to an advertisement for a research study for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. 
[ADDRESS_1071426].______ as a research coordinator, and I understand that he spoke with you about our antiviral treatment study in patients with Azheimer’s disease. I am looking for Mr/Mrs/Ms._________. (We must identify who will be the interviewee: patient or caregiver? If caregiver, we need to state their name [CONTACT_114278]). Do you have a few minutes to discuss this with me? (if yes) Great, let me start by [CONTACT_351408] a few brief questions related to you/your loved one’s health. If these questions are difficult to answer, or you need to take a break, please let me know.  (if no) Ok, let me know a good time and number to call you back.   The following scripted section applies to patients responding to advertisements only and should be skipped for patients referred from the DPO/other known evaluation source, e.g., MDC. Do you/your loved one have a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease?   [If no, are you concerned about your memory?]  [When did the concerns begin?]  [Specific memory concerns:] Have you been evaluated by a neurologist? If so, for what reason?  (If patient has completed neuropsych measures within 3 months, the scores can be used for initial visits in the study) Have you been evaluated by a psychiatrist? If so, For what reason? Are you taking any medications?   [If yes, duration & reason:] MRI: Claustrophobia or metal implants If female: still menstruating? Approximate date for LMP? Do you ever use alcohol or other substances, including marijuana? I understand that some of these questions are very personal. All information discussed during this call is kept confidential.  (If yes, how often?) Are you involved in any other research studies? (If yes, take note)  For DPO/MDC/other known referral source:  The conversation needs to be resumed here after skippi[INVESTIGATOR_779406]. Reminder: if speaking with a patient who comes from the DPO, state: “I work with [CONTACT_45172], [CONTACT_342201], etc.” or with whomever that patient sees clinically in DPO. There needs to be a sense of clinical cohesion set forth in script.   Screening Script  Based on our discussion today (or based on DPO referral), it seems like this study may be a good fit for you. Our screening and consent is a two-step process. The first step is simple. We can schedule you and your loved one (dependent upon if speaking with the patient directly or family member/caregiver) to come into our clinic for a simple blood test that checks whether you have been exposed to the common viruses treated by [CONTACT_779522]. About half of the population is positive for the virus. If the results of the blood test are positive you may be eligible to participate in the study and a study physician will discuss the details with you. If the results are negative, you will not be eligible, and we will review other available studies for which you may be eligible, or we will give you an appropriate referral.  If you are interested, we have the following appointment slots available for you (list 3 possible dates and times). Which one of these openings works best for you and your (insert either patient info or informant info depending on who is speaking)?   Study description: In this study, which is funded by [CONTACT_7681], we are evaluating a new therapy for mild Alzheimer’s disease: valacyclovir, which is a widely used generic and safe, FDA approved anti-viral medication. We are conducting the first-ever clinical trial to address the theory that viruses, particularly 
20  
         herpes simplex virus, may cause or contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Basic science studies show that anti-viral drugs are effective in lowering brain amyloid and tau, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.    The blurb below is only to be read to those patients who directly inquire regarding additional information: it is better to leave these points to be discussed in person and stick to the main points of the 2-part screen on the phone, seeing as the study design, procedures, and medications may not be relevant to those who won’t qualify, and could serve as a deterrent if miscommunicated or misunderstood):  The study is a year and a half, involving roughly [ADDRESS_1071427] neuropsychological assessments (memory testing, various pencil & paper tasks, remembering word lists, stories, etc.). You will also meet with physicians who will monitor your condition throughout the study. During some of your visits, you will have blood drawn, have an MRI, and PET-scanning. Visits may last from one to four hours at the beginning and end of the study, with shorter visits of one to two hours in the middle of the study. For the entirety of the study, you will be randomized (i.e. assigned by [CONTACT_3364]) to a daily dose of either valacyclovir or a placebo (i.e. inactive/sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]). Study staff will always be available to work with you and answer any questions you may have.  We will leave mention of the LP for the in-person conversation with the study MD. If the patient/caretaker asks about it specifically, mention that he/she will be able to discuss this with the physician at the screening appointment. Know what you don’t know and leave specific conversations for the appropriate study team member.   Completing the call  Ask the patient/caretaker if they have any remaining questions, comments, or concerns. Remind them again of their appointment date and time/next steps for scheduling the screen.  What to bring to the visit: The patient should bring a list of his/her current medications, his/her medical records (though not a limiting factor in scheduling a screen), a government issued photo ID and someone close to him/her, like a family member or friend, who will be able to answer questions about the patient’s memory and frequency of contact [CONTACT_10970]. a. Possible types of IDs: US passport or passport card, US Military ID (active duty or retired military and their dependents), Permanent Resident Card, Driver’s License or other state photo identity card issued by a Department of Motor Vehicles, a foreign government passport, Canadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) card and US Government Employee ID with photo. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]‐issued identification is also acceptable and is generally obtained at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779407]. The ID must contain DOB and a photo.  b. HSV Labs: If a patient is coming from out of state, or farther away in NY, they are free to go to an independent Quest Lab to have HSV labs drawn, to be ordered by [CONTACT_779523]. We will reimburse for this afterwards. Results should be faxed to us at [PHONE_16256] and reviewed prior to the screening appointment.  c. Routine Labs: We can accept routine labs completed externally, within 30 days of screening. d. Informant Proclivity: If the patient doesn’t have an informant or refuses one (and seems like a viable pre-screen) we should schedule them for an in-person visit to begin discussing the protocol and describe participation; though actual screening measures will not be carried out. This may slightly delay proceedings, but bringing the patient in to be introduced with staff and space is a step in the right direction to get a patient comfortable with the process and knowing there are qualified staff on site who are here to address their concerns.   Another important point about informants: Our biggest concern is that informants provide quality reports; how frequently informants see patients isn’t as paramount. The informant can be family, a friend, a neighbor, home health aide, etc., really anyone who can 
21  
         comment on the patient’s memory. RC should discuss anything that seems like an ethical violation or major issue in what they observe of the Patient-Informant relationship, but aside from that, the actual nature of the relationship we don’t query. We also do not inquire about the mental or physical status of the informant.    • Memory Disorders Center (MDC) (primary contact [CONTACT_779524]; [EMAIL_14870])  For patients co-enrolled in the ADRC protocol, and one of our protocols at MDC.  • Center for Excellence in Alzheimer’s Disease (CEAD) (primary contact [CONTACT_779525]: [PHONE_16257]; [EMAIL_14871]) Patients seen here are followed by [CONTACT_779526], NP and [CONTACT_779596].   • Cross Referral between [CONTACT_779595]/[CONTACT_779589] (NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779398]) (Primary Contact: [CONTACT_779527]; cie2104@ cumc.columbia.edu) We will work with Charleny Escalante for the TOPAD study.  • NIA Email Blast (NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779397]) Primary Contact: [CONTACT_779528]; email:  [EMAIL_14872]; [EMAIL_14873] The VALAD protocol is featured on the NIA’s monthly clinical trials recruitment email blast under the ‘Drugs” section (every protocol included in this blast has a header under which the link to the protocol’s corresponding NIA website is featured).

         Protocol Participation:  Consent Procedures At all sites, participants referred to the study will undergo a screening process (MMSE and initial check for inclusion/exclusion criteria). If the patient appears eligible based on screening, an investigator at the site will confirm by [CONTACT_779530]/exclusion criteria are met and will go over the details of the study with the patient and the informant, as described in the informed consent form. Participants will also be informed that they need to have an informant available in person or by [CONTACT_779531]. Patients will be given ample time to review the consent form and will be given the opportunity to ask questions of investigational staff prior to signing.  NYU subjects and caregivers will sign both NYU and NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779408]. [CONTACT_779589] will sign all NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779409]. This is required.   Throughout the study, the study physicians at each site will cross-cover one another for patient assessments and management in the study. All study physicians are board certified psychiatrists or neurologists and their clinical role is to serve as the study physicians.  Patients with mild AD with Folstein MMSE score 18-28 at screen will sign consent to participate in the protocol; all patients will be required to have the capacity to consent to the protocol, with IRB-approved PCS forms being completed. If the Folstein MMSE declines to below [ADDRESS_1071428] also provide written consent, via the caregiver consent form, indicating their understanding of the study, willingness to provide information about the patient, and complete questionnaires and interviews with the research staff.   The IRB-approved forms for informed consent and for assessment of capacity are made part of the patient’s permanent medical record, with a copy being filed in the research chart.  Patients and informants will sign every new version of consent form following the IRB approved amendment.   Screening Eligibility (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: pages 4 to 5) The study sample will be composed of outpatient participants who have been diagnosed with probable AD by [CONTACT_779532]1 or HSV2. RC and MD will 
23  
         complete the inclusion/exclusion criteria form. Patients who do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will not enter the study and will be considered a screen fail and noted as such on the corresponding log.   Recruitment Logs: Logs to be kept at both study sites unless otherwise noted in description. The following logs will be used to track recruitment:  1) Patient Tracker: This log includes the tracking of active study patients, patients who have been scheduled for a screening visit, patients who are pending screening evaluation (but not yet scheduled), and patients who are pending/we are unable to contact.

[ADDRESS_1071429] study physicians as follows:   In any case where [CONTACT_779597]/[CONTACT_779598] are doubtful of a screening case (diagnosis), or have to make an initial diagnosis, they should call [CONTACT_779589] to consult prior to the patient departing from the clinic. If the physicians don’t reach out to [CONTACT_779589] themselves, one of the RCs will reach out to [CONTACT_779589] on their behalf.   Ideally, screening visits are carried out on Mondays or Tuesdays as there is ample clinic availability. Screening visits are permitted on Wednesdays and Fridays despi[INVESTIGATOR_779410]. Scheduling research appointments is permitted on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday each week.   Additional conference rooms can be booked for these days. The screening visit, including consent procedures, is estimated to take 1-1.5 hours on average.  In developi[INVESTIGATOR_779411], allow up to 45 min for the study physician to obtain consent.   Medical Records Prior to the visit, if the patient is an outside referral and/or called in from an advertisement, RCs should ensure that medical records are obtained from the subject’s primary care physician and/or neurologist. If medical records are not obtained this will not serve as a limiting factor on scheduling the screen; the patient should be brought in for screen anyway. Subjects may also bring their own records in person at screen but are encouraged to send records to the clinic prior to the visit to move the review process along faster. Subjects must come to the screening visit with the individual who will serve as their study informant. All patients and informants should be made aware of [LOCATION_001] State law, which stipulates that the request and delivery of medical records to patient by [CONTACT_779536], written and signed request. The physician must comply within a 24-hour turnaround time and provide records to the patient accordingly.    If the patient is an internal (DPO-CUMC) referral, all available records should be printed from EPIC for reference at the visit. This includes labs, radiology/scan reports, and notes from the DPO provider. A coordinator should never exclude a patient for any reason based on the EPIC records, with the exception of MMSE (18-29 is acceptable for screening criteria; questionable if MMSE of 17). The only information that you do not need to print out: address and personal information, insurance information, other non-clinical and non-research information.  It is a strict expectation that 24 hours prior to a VALAD screening visit the RC will review all records available in the EPIC chart, MDC chart, independent medical records sent in from external provider, etc. This is key to understanding who your patient is medically and personally.    RC Responsibilities during Study Visits:  From Screening until week 78, it is the expectation that the respective RC (ideally, the RC who conducted the phone screen with the patient) will be present in the exam room during all study visits, with patient and study MD, to preside over all activity and provide any relevant information, including self-reported measures such as the UPSIT. This will ensure that there are no gaps in knowledge or information shared throughout the duration of the patient’s protocol participation.   The RC will always check all forms, both RC and MD, prior to the patient leaving the clinic, to ensure that all necessary measures were completed accurately. If another RC is present, they should cross check the forms. This should be done on the same date as the visit itself, no matter how late it gets. 
[ADDRESS_1071430] medications that they take at lunchtime, they should bring them and take them at their regular dosing time when they are here. It is a good idea to take the patient’s chart, and particularly their list of medications, along with the patient when there are procedures outside our clinic (such as MRI, PET, LP).  Nurses or technicians at these other sites often wish to see the list of meds the patient is on and patients tend to lack reliability in reporting current medication administration.   Screening Visit: Procedures   NYU Capacity to Consent: Per PI [INVESTIGATOR_73261]: NYU subjects will sign all consent forms even if deemed as “not having capacity” (per NYU’s standard, which is different from NYSPI’s standard and includes MMSE and subjective consent quiz). There will not be notes in the NYU subject chart about lacking capacity. NYU will continue to abide by [CONTACT_58703]’s rules and standards NYU subjects lacking capacity will not undergo the LP.  At screening, the patient meets with the study physician (or delegated staff at NYU and BAI) to be consented. The coordinator should be in the room to ensure their own understanding of the protocol and consent procedures and can supply physicians with necessary information. The physician will obtain signatures and sign the Patient and Caregiver Consent Forms, the PCS Cover Sheet and Form II, and the Consent Procedure Note with the patient and caregiver and review the inclusion/exclusion criteria. NYU and BAI will utilize their equivalent PCS Forms at the Screening visit. BAI patients only sign BAI consents.   NYU subjects and caregivers will sign both NYU and NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779412]/CUMC facilities.  The RC then completes a “Patient Tracking Form,” which outlines key information about subjects and caregivers.  The RC then takes vitals (BP, pulse) and completes the MMSE with the patient. If blood pressure is high or out of range, the RC should repeat BP twice, [ADDRESS_1071431] been undergoing regular neurological follow up for memory disorders tend to be familiar with “apple, table, penny.” This is necessary to ensure MMSE inclusion, barring circumstances where an MMSE has been documented in the previous month. The RC also completes the Informant FAQ if applicable per clinical standards, Metal Screening Questionnaire, and the Medical Records Release form with the patient and/or their caregiver.   It is recommended that measures used for determining eligibility be completed earlier within a visit; should a subject screen fail on key criteria early in the visit, there is no need to complete other study measures because this patient has already been found to be ineligible.  The patient then meets with the study physician again (or delegated staff at NYU and BAI) to discuss eligibility and review the inclusion/exclusion criteria again.  For patients who sign consent, an RC will draw blood for SMAC, CBC, and HSV. If patients are “difficult draws” at NYSPI, the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779413] (Manny de la Nuez; X8048) will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].   As patient and caregiver depart, let them know that the final blood results and follow up will be communicated to them by [CONTACT_779537] 3-[ADDRESS_1071432] floor.    The RC centrifuges the red top (SMAC) tubes on centrifuge pre-setting 3 (3200 rpm, 20 minutes) after allowing the blood to clot in an upright position for 30 minutes. The RC does not centrifuge the purple top tube. The RC will fill out the NKI requisition (NYSPI) as described in the blood draw policy section of this manual. Staff at NYU will fill out the requisition for their local lab, which will be used to process both red and purple top tubes, as will BAI.   The requisition form and tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_779538]-up RC. Those who check will be looking to make sure the patient’s name, X number (NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779414]), sex, ward unit, facility name, date and time of draw, and proper tests requested are checked on the form and match the information on the tubes. The red top and purple top tubes are then left in the refrigerator in the lab on the 4th floor (Pardes Building at NYSPI) for processing by [CONTACT_370207]. The NKI form should be time stamped by [CONTACT_779539]. The NKI form has 3 sheets: the first page (white) should be placed in the front sleeve of the specimen transport bag containing the tubes and put in the fridge, the second page (yellow) should be placed face-down in the tray in the lab, and the third page (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]) should be kept in the patient’s chart. NYU requisition forms will contain data to be collected and checked per participant as will BAI forms.  A subject will not be considered eligible unless all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Inclusion/ exclusion criteria checklist will be signed at screen or baseline by [CONTACT_779540].   For BAI, NYU, and NYSPI [CONTACT_1766], HSV antibody results take 2-4 days to be posted online in the e- portal, Quanum/Care 360; so results are not immediately known. Once the initial results are published, the RC will print them for the subject’s chart and get signed by [CONTACT_5989]. Note: If the IgM results are “pending” from the results, the RC will continually monitor until the final results are published in Quanum/Care 360 to be printed and signed by [CONTACT_5989].   To access results in Quanum/Care 360: https://portal.care360.com/care360/care360.login Username: [CONTACT_779583]: Devy1600!  Information concerning eligibility should be promptly communicated to the patient by [CONTACT_122440]; for subjects who screen HSV negative, a study physician will have to reach out and inform of not only ineligibility but appropriate follow up.  Documentation of communication (via progress note filled out by [CONTACT_70852]) of screen failed subjects must be kept in each screen failure chart at all study sites. All of this information needs to be presented in the team Wednesday morning meeting for all active patients, and any questions should be raised with the team, e.g., referral for specific ineligible patients.    Scheduling Baseline Measures: Procedures for NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779397] (BAI will follow this protocol with modification made per their site standard)  All baseline measures (PET scans, optional LP, MRI) should be scheduled once HSV positivity has been confirmed for those patients with qualifying MMSEs. It is important that all key measures get on the books as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary back and forth with patients or caregivers and to simply move the protocol along in an expeditious manner. Note, we must confirm at screen that patients and caregivers are available to come in on either a Monday or Friday for their Tau PET (18F-MK-6240 tau ligand exclusively available M/F). If the caregiver is not available, study staff will offer to arrange droppi[INVESTIGATOR_779415] (from tau PET) and do what we can to make it work. This is applicable to NYSPI/CU and NYU, BAI will schedule per their site standard.  
[ADDRESS_1071433] procedure for day 1. Theoretically, MRI followed by [CONTACT_736460]; followed by [CONTACT_779541] a highly cooperative and cognitively intact patient, with a sufficient gap of at least [ADDRESS_1071434] 24 hours from the amyloid PET scan. When scheduling a PET scan and the LP on the same day: a gap of at least [ADDRESS_1071435].   Ideally, all patients will complete all baseline measures as dictated per protocol, however, if a patient cannot complete one of the measures, for example, tau PET (due to failure on the part of the Kreitchman PET Center, failure to successfully produce the ligand, an unforeseen scheduling conflict on the patient’s part, etc.) we will not discontinue that patient from the protocol; instead, we will try to complete the procedure on another day. If that is not possible, write an exception or deviation, report to the IRB if needed, and continue the patient in the protocol.   PET, MRI and LP will take place at CUMC/NYSPI. It will be the responsibility of the NYU RC to obtain patient availability for MRI, both PETs, and LP (if applicable) at the end of the patient’s screening visit and report to NYSPI [CONTACT_430598] 24 hours. The NYU coordinator will email this availability (along with any forms such as PET Center Forms) to the NYPSI coordinator using patient ID, not name. Staff at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779416]’s availability as soon as possible in order to schedule each procedure as per the patient’s request. The NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779417]/times to the NYU team so they can communicate this information to their patient in timely manner. The MRI, PET scans, and LP should be scheduled by [CONTACT_40422] [INVESTIGATOR_779418].    Research Pharmacy Ordering Study Drug/Randomization: Procedures for All Sites  The [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute pharmacy is the research pharmacy for the study.  The randomization code was generated by [CONTACT_779542]. Howard Andrews who leads the Data Coordinating Center for the study.  The research pharmacy updates the randomization table as participants enroll in the study and are dispensed study medication (valacyclovir or placebo) and sends the updated table to [CONTACT_779593] on a monthly basis.  Any discrepancies are resolved by [CONTACT_779543]. Andrews.  For all Columbia/NYSPI, NYU and BAI patients: The NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779419]’s protocol participation.   NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779420]-site at clinic visits and when needed through shippi[INVESTIGATOR_779421]. Each subject’s first study drug kit will be dispensed by [CONTACT_40422] [INVESTIGATOR_779422]/research coordinator to be distributed at the baseline study visit. The pharmacy will send NYU/BAI kits to NYU/BAI RC’s for later distribution to subjects by [CONTACT_779544].  NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779423] a receipt in every study drug shipment sent to sub sites, indicating what is included in each study drug shipment. These receipts are necessary for accession, filing and compliance purposes.   At least two weeks before the patient’s scheduled Baseline visit, the Study Drug Order Form will be submitted to the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779424] 1-[ADDRESS_1071436] two weeks in advance, specifying 
28  
         weeks 1-8 and 9-16.  As a reminder, the study drug order form should not be submitted until a study physician confirms eligibility, the patient is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and the baseline MRI/PET scans are scheduled.   Coordinators assign subject identification numbers for the protocol, ascending sequentially from [ADDRESS_1071437] IDs will not be reassigned, even if a patient does not come back after baseline (once randomized, always randomized).  Study drug kits are broken down as follows: (NYSPI) For weeks 1-12: 644 total capsules. Week 1-2: 28 capsules x 2 bottles (2g per day, 1g morning (2 caps), 1g evening (2 caps) Week 3-4: 42 capsules x 2 bottles (3g per day, 1.5g morning (3 caps), 1.5g evening (3 caps) Week 5-8: 56 capsules x 4 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps) Week 9-16: 56 capsules x 8 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps) From then onward it’s 56 capsules x 8 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps), unless clinically indicated by [CONTACT_5989].  (NYU) For weeks 1-12: 644 total capsules.  Week 1-2: 28 capsules x 2 bottles (2g per day, 1g morning (2 caps), 1g evening (2 caps) Week 3-4: 42 capsules x 2 bottles (3g per day, 1.5g morning (3 caps), 1.5g evening (3 caps) Week 5-8: 56 capsules x 4 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps) Week 9-12: 56 capsules x 4 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps) Week 12-16: 56 capsules x 4 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps) From then onward it’s 56 capsules x 12 bottles (4g per day, 2g morning (4 caps), 2g evening (4 caps)), unless clinically indicated by [CONTACT_5989].  It will be the responsibility of each RC to track when each replenishment is due (there is a log in each subject chart for this) and complete the study drug order form. Given that NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779425]’s, it is the expectation that NYU and BAI coordinators scan and send a copy of the completed “Study Drug Kit Send Out Log” to coordinator(s) at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a tracking and management tool. This will be done during the Baseline period. NYSPI, NYU and BAI kits will contain 4 months/16 weeks’ worth of valacyclovir/placebo.  NYSPI, NYU and BAI RC’s will complete the study drug order form at least two weeks prior to subject replenishment due date. NYU and BAI coordinators will scan and send completed study drug order form to the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779426].  At all three sites, kits will be returned to coordinators at scheduled study visits so that compliance checks can be conducted in tandem with a check in with the patient regarding how they’re feeling (update of AE and Con Med Logs should be completed at this time based on result of conversation with patient). Coordinators must call patients once a month to check in with the patient regarding medication compliance, and any AEs and Con Med changes.  Kits returned to NYU and BAI coordinators will be stored at respective pharmacy or other designated storage location, for later monitoring by [CONTACT_40422] [INVESTIGATOR_779427].

         Week 0 (Baseline) Visit: Procedures for NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779397] (BAI will follow this protocol with modification made per site facility standards) Details on MRI, PET scans, and LP procedures can be found in the specific Policy & Procedures Manual for each respective procedure located in the next section   Participation Standards: The team will re-iterate expectations, as it pertains to participating in the study, with both subjects and caregivers. In brief, if subjects/caregivers agree to participate, the expectation is that they will remain in the protocol for the entire 78-week duration.  Baseline measures will need to be completed over a span of a few days. Informants do not have to be present during all baseline study procedures, but the informant must drop off and pi[INVESTIGATOR_779429] (or make arrangements for this; research team staff can assist as well).   Description of NYU staff activity at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779430], per subject request.   Prior to baseline, the RC will find out whether or not the subject has undergone any of the neuropsych testing that will be conducted per protocol. If so, any neuropsych test administered within the CUMC, NYU or BAI system [ADDRESS_1071438] be checked with investigational staff for final approval. All data from historic neuropsych testing will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_779431], and entered into the VALAD database with the current, baseline date (not the date of original testing).    The coordinator will take vital signs and administer the ADAS-COG 11 and NACC Neuropsychological Battery. The coordinator will administer the UPSIT. Finally, the coordinator will complete the initial NACC packet (the GDS and 3-page demographics form). Qualified/certified staff at NYU and BAI will complete the aforementioned NACC measures, coordinators will complete all other measures as dictated per protocol.   The patient will then see the study physician, who will write a progress note and complete the MD NACC packet, the Concomitant Medications log, the CIBIC-Plus, and the CDR. The physician will also complete the ADCS-ADL with the informant. This informant interview can be done over the phone at a later time within the Baseline period, as well.   The coordinator will then draw blood for APOE genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (yellow top), which is to be stored at the Human Genetics Resources Core (HGRC). Both NYU and NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779432], as will BAI subjects. BAI staff will store APOE on site for later send out to the HGRC. The RC will fill out the HGRC form as described in the blood draw policy section of this manual. The form and tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_779538]-up RC. They will sign the corresponding accuracy log.  An extra serum tube (red top) will also be drawn for all subjects, processed, and stored in the -80 freezer on Pardes floor 4 (at NYSPI, BAI will store locally). Please see the Lab manual section for greater processing description.   As described in the consent forms, all clinically applicable information collected during the trial will be disclosed to patients and their caregivers, as well as interpretation of baseline MRI, 18F-Florbetapir amyloid PET radiological read, and results from CSF analysis.  After the baseline evaluation, the results of outcome measures specified in the hypotheses will not be disclosed. Apolipoprotein E genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_779433] 18F-MK-6240 tau PET scan; tau PET imaging results are still in research development and there is no standardized method to make a clinical read and provide a report to the patient.  
[ADDRESS_1071439] page before the patient leaves the clinic.  The RC will double check that the study physician has completed all necessary forms, as well. After all verifications are complete, the patient and caregiver may be sent home.    A few important notes to keep in mind at Baseline: A. The ADCS-ADL must be done by [CONTACT_779545] (At BAI, neuropsych and rating scales are completed per site standard with trained staff and raters).  It should be done at the end of the visit, i.e., after NACC and other forms are administered (specific forms will vary from visit to visit but ADCS-ADL should always be done at the end).  The ADCS-ADL should be administered to the informant but when the informant is not sure about the answer to a question, it can be done with the patient as well.  The study physician must fill it out completely based on the best information available, even if it seems to be spotty based on unclear patient and informant responses. B. We will use our own discretion in deciding whether subjects and caregivers should be compensated with Petty Cash, or through filling out a reimbursement form, which would result in a check being sent to the subject or caregiver’s place of residence. Reimbursement forms require collection of social security number and W9 completion from the payee.  C. The RC must do the maximum, not the minimum, and know every detail about their patient(s) to truly make this a successful study. There needs to be an ongoing conversation about patient concerns, not just facts of the study. The single most important thing will be establishing a decent rapport with the study patient and making sure they (as well as their caregivers) know that we’re here to address their concerns and make participation in the study convenient for them. This will keep them coming back.     Weeks 2 & 4 Phone Call/Visit ● In-office or telephone call by [CONTACT_779546]. This telephone call or in office visit should last approximately 10 minutes. ● Physician will write note and RC will complete medication compliance form.  Medication Compliance Calls: The RC will call the patients or caregivers once a month and medication compliance will be documented on a log upon query. These calls will occur throughout the subject’s 78 weeks of protocol participation. During phone contacts, patients should be reminded that they will be followed by a physician here. Patients should know exactly what they’ll be getting through participating in research.  The following compliance script will be used when placing these calls:  Hi Mr./Mrs. __________________. This is ________________ calling from Columbia about the “Antiviral therapy in Alzheimer’s disease” study that you/your family member is enrolled in. Do you have a few minutes to talk with me? I am just reaching out to check-in and see how you (and the patient) are doing. (If now is not a good time to speak, schedule a specific time when they know they will be available via phone. It is good to note in your personal tracking if there are certain days or times that are best for phone contact [CONTACT_419239]) -person on the phone (patient or caregiver) should be where they have the study medication available   (To complete over phone before the patient starts a new Study Drug Kit)  The last kit you received had [ADDRESS_1071440] been finished?

         Now, let’s go over the kit you just received and will be starting on ________. Can you read me the labels on the bottles of the new kit?  Thank you. As I mentioned, you will be starting the new box on ________. The pharmacy will ship you a new box by [CONTACT_779547]. Please do not discard the old bottles. You can bring them with you in your next appointment. Feel free to reach out to me if you encounter any problems.  The patient will be encouraged to come in if and when they believe it is necessary to be seen by [CONTACT_464]/medical team on protocol. AE and Con Med Logs to be updated based on information obtained at these calls.   Week 12 Visit This visit should be completed in 2-4 hours.  ● Clinical assessment: Progress note, CDR, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC-plus will be completed (Study Physician completes at NYSPI; PI [INVESTIGATOR_779435]/certified Sub-I at NYU and BAI). ● Neuropsychiatric measures: ADAS-Cog11 (Research Coordinator completes at NYSPI, delegated/certified staff at NYU and BAI). ● RC will record vitals. ● RC draws blood for: SMAC blood chemistry (red top), complete blood count (lavender top) and plasma acyclovir levels (lavender top).   ▪ For SMAC blood chemistry and complete blood count, the RC will fill out the NKI requisition (NYSPI) or NYU Langone Lab req if NYU subject, and BAI specific lab req at BAI, as described in the blood draw policy section of this manual. The req and tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_779538]-up RC. Those who check will be looking to make sure the patients name, X number (med rec number), sex, ward unit, facility name, date and time of draw and order, and proper boxes are checked on the form and match the information on the tubes.  ▪ Plasma acyclovir levels will be drawn, processed and stored for further analysis by [CONTACT_779548]. Plasma should be checked for: ID, draw time, date, date/time of most recent dose, valacyclovir/placebo, DOB, [CONTACT_779589], IRB #.  ● For patients consenting to the LP, CSF (and plasma) will be collected ([CONTACT_342201] performs the LP, NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779436]). The NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779437]. The form/tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_122440], the back-up RC and the program manager.  ● Before the patient leaves, the RC will double check that the study physician completed all necessary forms. After verification is complete, the coordinator will confirm that all RC forms have been completed, as well. The RC must check the checklist for the visit, and ensure that all forms listed in it are completed and ticked off on the checklist page. Only after both of these checks have taken place can the patient and caregiver be sent home. Week 26 Visit The week 26 visit is estimated to take about 2-3 hours.  ● Neuropsychiatric measures: MMSE and ADAS-Cog11 (RC at NYSPI, delegated/certified staff at NYU and BAI).  ● Clinical assessment: Progress note, CDR, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC-plus (study physician completes at NYSPI; PI [INVESTIGATOR_779435]/certified Sub-I at NYU and BAI). ● SMAC blood chemistry (red top) will be collected to assess kidney function (RC completes). The RC will fill out the NKI requisition (NYSPI) or NYU Langone Lab req if NYU subject, BAI specific lab req if BAI subject; as described in the blood draw policy section of this manual. The req and tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_779549], the back-up RC and the program manager. Those who check will be looking to make sure the patients name, X number (med rec number), sex, ward unit, facility name, date and time of draw and order, and proper boxes are checked on the form and match the information on the tubes.  ● Coordinator will record vital signs.

         ● Before the patient leaves, the RC will double check that the study physician completed all necessary forms. After verification is complete, the coordinator will confirm that all RC forms have been completed, as well. The RC must check the checklist for the visit and ensure that all forms listed in it are completed and ticked off on the checklist page. Only after both of these checks have taken place can the patient and caregiver be sent home.  Week 52 Visit This visit will take 3-4 hours.  ● Re-evaluation of diagnosis, Progress note, CDR, ADCS-ADL, CIBIC-plus, and NACC packet (study physician completes at NYSPI; PI [INVESTIGATOR_779435]/certified Sub-I at NYU and BAI). ● ADAS-Cog11, NACC neuropsychological battery, NACC RC questionnaire forms, vital signs.

Only after both of these checks have taken place can the patient and caregiver be sent home.  Week 78 Visit or Endpoint (dropout) visit  End of Study Procedures: We will not break the blind at Week 78. We will only break the blind after the entire clinical trial is over and the final subject enrolled completed all week [ADDRESS_1071441]’s experience in the study will be provided in addition to the cognitive testing summary (see below).   These measures will span over 2-4 clinic visits.  • This visit follows a very similar protocol to the week 0 visit, with the addition of blood drawn for SMAC, CBC, and HSV antibodies.  • The RC will fill out the Quest forms and tubes as described in the blood draw policy section. The form and tubes will be checked by [CONTACT_779549], the back-up RC and the program manager. Those who check will be looking to make sure the patient initials, IRB number, correct collection time and date, language about research use only, and the 6447 and [ZIP_CODE] HSV Boxes are checked on the form.

Whenever a patient ends the protocol, regardless of time-point, the protocol exit form needs to be completed. If a patient terminates the protocol early for any reason, the patient needs to be brought back to complete all planned study visits and procedures under the intent-to-treat principle. Any intervening treatments or other changes will be documented but will not affect the assessments.  During this time, the patient should be instructed not to participate in any other treatment research protocol. Before the patient is free to go the RC should double check that the study physician has completed all necessary forms. After this is checked the coordinator should confirm that all RC forms have been completed. Only after both of these checks have taken place can the patient and caregiver be sent home.  Study records (scan reports, lab results) for patients referred to VALAD by [CONTACT_779550], will be dropped off in a manila folder, with Renata on NI3. These records will be dispersed to respective DPO provider. RC should compose a brief narrative of what exactly each manila folder contains, and which study visits have been completed to date.

If the caregiver is present, they will remain with the patient until it is time for them to enter the scanner, then come out to the waiting room with the RC.  10. Patient will be at the PET center for about 1.5 hours (scan acquisition time is 20 minutes and the uptake time is 50 minutes). The RC will go back to the scanner [ADDRESS_1071473] SCAN PROCEDURES: 1. Instruct patient that he/she can continue normal activities after PET scan. 2. Patient is advised to drink several glasses of water and contact [CONTACT_779562]/her hand or arm (slight soreness and bruising is expected since a small tube was inserted into vein of arm).   Obtaining Amyloid Scan Reads  (completed through the PET Department’s Safety Read System in RedCap) : Amyloid reads will be completed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Akiva Mintz, MD ([EMAIL_14886]) and/or [CONTACT_779600], MD ([EMAIL_14887]) Amyloid read reports are available in RedCap 1-10 days following amyloid PET scan.   To access an Amyloid read: 1. Website: https://radiosftp.cpmc.columbia.edu /redcap/redcap_v8.11.7/DataEntry/record_status_dashboard.php?pid=31&pagenum=2  1. Navigate to "Record Status Dashboard" (on the left-hand side of the home-page) and all VALAD subjects are on the list of study subjects receiving reads that will automatically populate when one navigates to the Record Status Dashboard.  2. Subjects are identified on this list by “NYSPI #7537” followed by [CONTACT_779563].  3. RCs must download a PDF the report with “saved data,” print, file in subject chart and obtain signature [CONTACT_779587] [CONTACT_102]’s study MD.

         4. SUVR: Once the analysis and decisions about how to interpret SUVR are confirmed by [CONTACT_779564], we will decide how to communicate results to subjects and caregivers, with Drs. Mintz and Kreisl. [CONTACT_779601] would like to be informed of discrepant cases (between amyloid pos/neg status and SUVR AD Dx interpretation).  Study physicians will review the amyloid read and SUVR results with the patient and caregiver when they come in for their next visit. If the patient wants the results sooner the physician may call to discuss but in-person discussion is strongly preferred. Some reads may require immediate follow up. 1. Prior to filing, PI [INVESTIGATOR_779465].  2. Reports for NYU subjects will be sent to NYU from NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779466]. Devanand. [CONTACT_779602] will call NYU subjects with findings.  18F-MK-6240 Tau PET Imaging Procedures (NYSPI/NYU specific, BAI will follow this protocol with modification made per facility standard) – Week 0 & Week 78 General Note:  a) For patients who have confirmed radiation exposure from the past year, contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mintz via email for review of patient medical records/self-report of scanning as soon as you’ve been made aware of the issue. This information is captured on the Metal Screening Questionnaire and the Medical Screening Form. Prior research scans will count toward actual, calculated radiation exposure by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mintz but SOC scans will not. [CONTACT_779601] is to evaluate research scan radiation exposure prior to running PET scans. We should go ahead and book scans under the assumption that there will not be a significant delay in scanning, even for those patients who have had previous research scans; we will cancel/rebook if need be per [CONTACT_779601].  b) For the sake of IRB Compliance, the VALAD team will always email [CONTACT_779601] in regard to patients who have been exposed to radiation in the past year (SOC or research). [CONTACT_779601] will compose either a stock reply that pi[INVESTIGATOR_779467]. Weintraub’s decision that SOC scans will not count toward radiation exposure in this protocol, or a more pointed reply with pointed scan scheduling directions if a patient had a research scan(s) in the past year. IRB needs assurance that patients will not exceed 5 REM yearly allowable limit FDA guidelines.  Scheduling: 1. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779468]. Each participant will need a separate request (if there are 3 participants, 3 separate requests will need to be initiated). NYU staff will communicate subject availability and relevant forms to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779447] [ADDRESS_1071474]’s schedule/follow-up with potential dates. 4. Coordinator officially requests slot. Please note slots are first-come-first-serve. It is best to try to schedule as far in advance as you can per protocol. 5. Coordinators will need to attach all the necessary forms including a scanned copy of the signed consent form, the scan requisition form, and the pregnancy attestation form.   Please Note the following tau PET Scheduling Proclivities: Scheduling for MK-6240 will utilize the following time slots. We allow two tau dose synthesis failures before proceeding with randomization.   1. MK-6240 injection times will be concentrated on Monday’s and Friday’s.  2. MK-6240 will not be available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. 3. The following injection times are available Monday’s and Friday’s: 14:00, 14:15, 14:30, 15:30, 15:45, and 16:[ADDRESS_1071475] form. Military time will be calculated in 24 hours. 12.00 am would be 0000 hours 12 pm would be 1200 hours and 11 pm would be 23 hours. 5. Pregnancy: All female patients need to be sign prior to scheduling their appointment. The patient will also need to indicate the year of their last menstrual period. a. You may want to contact [CONTACT_779561] ([EMAIL_14885]) regarding this process, she can also answer questions regarding the cancellation policy.    PET PRE-SCAN PROCEDURES: 1. During study screening:  a. check for inability to cooperate/claustrophobia (sedation is not offered for this protocol), inability to lie on scanner bed for [ADDRESS_1071476] voicemail for them to call back to confirm. b. If patient and caregiver do not confirm/do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_779469]. 3. Call patient and caregiver 3 days and 1 day before scan to remind them of appointment.  ON THE DAY OF THE SCAN:  1. Patient should eat breakfast and take all of their medications, as usual, prior to arrival at PET Center (RC will inform them at 24-hour confirmation). If a patient has a long schedule for that day, the patient should bring all medications that they need to take e.g., medications typi[INVESTIGATOR_779462]. 2. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779470] (or patient and coordinator if NYU patient) to meet her/him at the Memory Disorders Clinic [ADDRESS_1071477] be present for all scanning procedures if running an NYU patient. NYU RC’s presence is optional.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the PET scan will not be the first procedure a patient completes at baseline or week 78, for these longer visits RC’s should keep their eye on the time to ensure that they arrive at the PET Center at least [ADDRESS_1071478], and a copy of the signed consent or consents (NYU and NYSPI) if NYU subject. The PET center will keep all forms. If the consent form has been changed between the patient’s week [ADDRESS_1071479] sign the updated consent and the RC should bring this updated consent to week 78 PET scan. Always bring the entire chart with you. This will be helpful in answering any question staff might pose. 4. RC needs to bring her/his dosimetry badge. 5. When checking in at reception, the RC will need the IRB protocol number. Once the patient is checked in the RC will wait at the PET center with the patient and caregiver until they are called in. 6. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779471], and pregnancy attestation, subject ID, and RPO forms to the PET tech. 7. RC will make sure the patient has removed all metals from head – pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], clips, earrings. 8. Pre-injection vital signs (BP, heart rate, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]) must be collected by [CONTACT_779565]. The RC must check to ensure this has been done.  9. RC(s) will remain with patient and caregiver during the injection process. RC and caregiver must sit or stand at least [ADDRESS_1071480] is anxious and needs the caregiver in room with them. 10. The RC should remain with the patient and use this time to organize the patient’s chart and if the patient is in condition for measure administration, administer measures as required per protocol. Best use should be 
[ADDRESS_1071481] from the patient.  11. Patient will be at the PET Center for 2 hours (scan acquisition time is 40 minutes and the uptake time is 80; 120 minutes in total). The RC (s) will go back to the scanner 5 minutes before the scan time is up to retrieve the patient and review/sign a copy of the PET checklist. 12. Post scan vital signs (BP, heart rate, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]) must be collected on the PET center checklist, this will have to be checked by [CONTACT_779566] 18F-MK-6240 scan is completed. 13. Room # and Scanner Type (ID) will need to be recorded on the PET center checklist and tracked per patient from baseline to [ADDRESS_1071482] SCAN PROCEDURES: 1. Instruct patient that he/she can continue normal activities after PET scan. 2. Patient is advised to drink several glasses of water and contact [CONTACT_779562]/her hand or arm (slight soreness and bruising is expected since a small tube was inserted into vein of arm).  3. [ADDRESS_1071483] a follow up safety call to the patient or caregiver to assess for adverse events and/or pain. RCs will call respective subjects.  4. Clinical reads will never be performed on tau scans. Performing clinical reads with non-FDA approved tracers is against federal regulations.  Important Reminder for RCs: [CONTACT_779589] has advised of the following policy: if tau imaging procedures get canceled due to technical issues, the main goal is to keep the patient in the protocol. Therefore, the patient may not complete an imaging procedure, but continue in the protocol.   If a patient is unwilling to do the tau PET scan, the patient will still be enrolled in the protocol and will be followed to [ADDRESS_1071484] be reviewed with the patient’s study physician and [CONTACT_779589], if needed.  Important Contact [CONTACT_779567]: Kim Goldner (Director of PET Center Technical Services): [EMAIL_14885]; [PHONE_16264] Rodolfo Arevalo (Project Coordinator); [EMAIL_14888]; [PHONE_16264] Akiva Mintz, MD (PET Center Director/Attending Radiologist): ([EMAIL_14886])   Mikhail Dubrouvin, MD (Attending Radiologist): ([EMAIL_14887])   MRI Protocol: NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779472] (BAI will follow this protocol with modification made per site standard)  MRI PRE SCAN PROCEDURES: – Week 0 & Week 78 1. After Recruitment and screening – complete the Metal Screening Questionnaire. All implants NEED TO BE CONFIRMED and reviewed with the MRI suite in tandem with the Metal Screening Questionnaire. ** Obtaining MRI Clearance** If the patient checks ‘YES’ for any item on this questionnaire (examples include metal stents, wire mesh), clearance must be obtained prior to the MRI scan or the scan will not take place.  It is acceptable to schedule the scan prior to obtaining clearance. The coordinator must obtain the name [CONTACT_73150]’s implanting surgeon from the patient/caregiver as soon as possible. It is the coordinator’s responsibility to follow-up with the patient and/or surgeon to determine the presence or absence of a contraindication. The coordinator will then fax/email the surgeon’s office the MRI suite’s Request for Proof of MR-Safe Implants, including a signed Release of Information and a fax cover sheet with the patient’s name, DOB, and any other available information 
[ADDRESS_1071485]. Lawrence Kegeles ([EMAIL_14889]) for clearance. The coordinator should print a hard copy of the Metal Screening Form, Request for Proof of MR-Safe Implants, and [CONTACT_779603]’ clearance email to bring to the scan. If requested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kegeles, the subject should be advised that there is a possibility of movement and overheating of the implant as a result of the scan. 2. Ask about claustrophobia. 3. Schedule an appointment in the Calpendo for 30 minutes (the actual scan takes 30-40 minutes + time for removing metal, wanding and paperwork, etc.) a. Schedule scans at least [ADDRESS_1071486] will arrive 30 minutes in advance of scan.  d. Scan cancellation needs to be 95 hours (4 days) before scheduled scan. NYU staff will communicate cancelations to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779473].    ON THE DAY OF THE SCAN for Research Coordinator: 1. Bring the subject in to the MRI suite along with caregiver if needed. The caregiver can wait in the waiting area. 2. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779474] (and clearance if needed) to the tech first. 3. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779475], check box to indicate we want a neuro read. Fill out the rest of the form and return to Joe. 4. Make sure subjects remove all metals – pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], clips, credit cards etc. 5. NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779476]. 6. The tech will check and then take the subject into the scanner room. 7. RC must go in to help place the subject in a comfortable position. 8. RC should wait with the technician outside the scanning room and keep an eye on the patient throughout the duration of the scan. If the RC notices excessive movement, they should notify the tech about the possibility of re-running that scan section. 9. The tech can instruct the subject over the intercom.  AFTER THE SCAN: ● The RC should enter the scan room and make sure that the subject gets out of the scanner carefully. ● Let them collect their belongings and take them out of the MRI suite. ● The study will be uploaded to XNAT (NYSPI). ● Go to XNAT.nyspi.org and check in your projects and download when ready (NYSPI [CONTACT_71602]). ● You can then download the scan to a PC or MAC and then send it over NYSPI - file transfer or burn on CDs and send them to the respective sites. ● RC will print the MRI report for PI [INVESTIGATOR_779477]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_779478]. Make sure this is completed in clear handwriting. ● Pay attention to reading each report carefully, ensuring that the narrative structure of unremarkable reports are not identical.  ● Reports for NYU subjects will be sent to NYU from NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779466]. Devanand. [CONTACT_779602] will call NYU subjects with findings.

Axial T2 STAR Note: As a general rule, we cannot accept data from outside MRI or PET scans for research purposes.    MRI Protocol: Mind Brain Behavior Institute (BAI will follow this protocol with modification made per site standard)  Informants will not be permitted to attend the actual MBBI MRI scan, and will wait in the facility waiting room, unless there is an emergency. RC will remain at MBBI MRI suite through completion of scan and will escort subjects/informants to exit and go home.  MRI scans will be conducted in the Mind Brain Behaviour Institute (MBBI) scanner “Eve” when they are not cleared to complete a scan on the NYSPI [CONTACT_673254]. Subjects scanned at MBBI for Baseline will need to be rescanned at MBBI for Week 78 (on the same scanner) as is the case for subjects scanned in the NYSPI [CONTACT_673254].  Administrative points to keep in mind: 1. Scanner to be used for this protocol: a. “Eve” Eve is fMRI machine; “June” is non-fMRI machine. Siemens Prisma 3T, 60cm bore 80 mT/m @ 200 T/m/s whole body gradients 128 RF receiver channels 2 RF transmit channels Multinuclear spectroscopy capable 13 tons, 213 cm long Closed helium cryocooled (zero helium boil off) magnet Head, neck, body and spi[INVESTIGATOR_779479] 2. Certified MBBI Tech will run our scans. Availability during COVID-[ADDRESS_1071489] up to 2 scans per day.  3. Clinical Reads a. If there is an incidental finding on the clinical read, it is MBBI policy that a MD from Columbia Neurology do the incidental finding follow-up call with the patient. Our MDs will be notified of the findings via letter and perform follow up with subjects over the phone as well.  b. RC’s need to complete the request for a clinical read in RedCap prior to the patient’s scan 4. Medical Coverage a. If medical coverage is deemed necessary for a patient by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Devanand (i.e. the patient is very impaired, on Lorazepam, or deemed “difficult”), the patient must be scheduled to be scanned on a Monday or Tuesday, as [CONTACT_779589] and [CONTACT_779604] indicated that those are the only days both are available for MBBI medical coverage (on site). In this case, [CONTACT_779589] and [CONTACT_779604] will be present at MBBI and sit in a counseling room adjacent to the MRI room, in case of a medical emergency.  b. If no medical coverage is deemed necessary, [CONTACT_779589] and [CONTACT_779604] must be made aware of the date/time of a patient scan, so that he/she is available by [CONTACT_648]/beeper. c. In the case of what staff deem to be “any major medical emergency,” MBBI calls [ADDRESS_1071490] to be swiped in by [CONTACT_468150], which could pose an inconvenience. To sit in with patients (in the actual MRI scanning room), MDs must have M3 level access.  5. Data Transfer a. All data is uploaded to FlyWheel, which is a cloud application accessible to those with a UNI. b. We will be able to do fMRI QC using FlyWheel. c. PM will be able to download the scan onto CDs, as she has been doing from XNAT. Dania can do this as well.  6. Week [ADDRESS_1071491] be scanned again at MBBI at Week 78.  Procedures:  1. All scans will be booked using iLAB (Devanand NYSPI [CONTACT_26374]) for [ADDRESS_1071492] will be set up the day you schedule the scan so that the patient’s clinical read can be recorded in a timely manner. 2. At the initial screening visit, the designated RC will complete MBBI’s Metal Screening Questionnaire. a. If needed, staff will obtain medical records pertaining to the patient’s implant and send to [CONTACT_779605] ([EMAIL_14891]) 3. On the day of scan: a. Designated RC will ensure that the patient’s chart is brought to MBBI. b. Designated RC will meet patient and MBBI Tech at MBBI ([ADDRESS_1071493]) [ADDRESS_1071494] the patient in changing into scrubs provided by [CONTACT_779569]. d. Designated RC will complete wanding and all metal screening procedures with the participant.  e. Designated RC will escort patient to MRI bed. f. Designated RC will provide ear plugs to the participant, per MBBI policy. g. Once scan is complete, RC will escort the patient out of the MRI scanner bed and bring him/her back to the dressing room.  h. Dispose of scrubs in soiled linen basket. i. Complete subject payment form with the participant and schedule remaining baseline measures.  4. After Scan/FlyWheel Procedures a. Lauren and MBBI Tech will be able to queue the MRI/fMRI QC post-scan using FlyWheel. b. Lauren will download scan onto three CDS (copy for:  CU, DU, QC) c. Research staff will obtain clinical read (RedCap) and review it with Study MD. i. If not listed, RC will include patient’s name, study ID, and date of birth on the document. RC is then required to initial and date the upper right-hand corner.  ii. Study MD is required to initial and date the lower right-hand corner. d. [CONTACT_779589] or study MD will then sign IRB MRI Findings Letter. Letters will be sent to NYU RCs for report to NYU subjects by [CONTACT_779570]. e. RC to give the findings letter and clinical read document to patient at his/her next visit, or within a month of the scan date.  5. Scan Cancellation Procedure/Policy a. Cancellations must be made 48-hours in advance in iLAB. b. If the cancellation must be made less than [ADDRESS_1071495] email Kathleen Durkin ([EMAIL_14892]) directly. c. To cancel: 
50  
         i. Login to iLAB. ii. Go to Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute (MBBI): MR Core along the left side, Core Facilities, Click Schedule Equipment. iii. Click view schedule for the scanner which you booked your scan on. iv. Find the reserved block, click on “details,” that appear to the left. v. On the screen that appears, there will be a “delete reservation” button in the lower-right corner.   Additional Protocol Points:  New Staff Communication: For emails regarding scheduling and procedures for an individual patient, communicate amongst coordinators for confirmation of correct language, phrasing, etc. For broader issues pertaining to the protocol or communication with people outside our core team, your draft email should be sent to both program managers specifically for review. In this draft email, you need to explain the context and include the sequence/chain of emails that led you to generate your draft email. For emails with broader implications, e.g., IRB protocol changes of significance, [CONTACT_779589] and the entire study team should be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Program Managers are to be CC’d on all key communication; when in doubt, CC a program manager as this will ensure that the proper material is always sent to the proper party covering questions within the email narrative such as Who, What, Where, When, and Why?  Standing Communication Review Protocol: All communications to outside entities, e.g., DSMB, NIA should be presented for review in our Wednesday meeting and sent out only after that.  The exception is if [CONTACT_779589] has instructed you to do something immediately (in between our Wed meetings). For clinical and other emergencies, let [CONTACT_779589] know immediately. Otherwise, bring all pending issues and materials, including those that need signature, to the weekly meetings on Wednesday at 3:00pm in Room 2001.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be carefully monitored, recorded, and reported in this study. An AE is an unexpected medical occurrence or worsening of symptoms, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. A SAE is a medically serious event, any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death.  Each patient that has an AE or SAE reported will have an AE log filed in their research chart. Both AE and SAE are to be recorded on the AE log. AE logs are data forms for this study. Hardcopy AE forms are rewritten each time new information about the event is made available, with all revisions kept in paper research charts. However, the database AE form will only contain information reflecting the final resolved event or last recorded information once the patient has left the protocol. Information regarding the treatment provided, outcome, and presumed relationship to study drug will be updated as new information becomes available. Site PIs will sign the bottom of the AE logs for their own site once the patient has exited the protocol.  SAEs are also logged on the AE form for data purposes in this study. For any SAE occurring at NYU or BAI, the SAE will first be reported to local IRB, then to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779480], as well as for follow up reporting to additional oversight bodies as described above (DSMB, IRB).     All information obtained between visits by [CONTACT_779571], consulting with [CONTACT_779589] if necessary. Based on the decision, the study coordinator needs to ensure that the AE and SAE 
51  
         forms and completed and submitted to the relevant agencies. Individual AEs need not be reported outside of the core research group and database team.  SAEs need to be reported to the IRB and DSMB and NIA.  Protocol Deviations: If unavoidable deviations from the study protocol occur, they will be recorded on a protocol deviation form filed in the patient’s research chart. A protocol deviation log of all deviations throughout the protocol for every patient will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder. Site coordinators will keep a log of protocol deviations in an excel document for continual reference and recording.   Protocol Exceptions: Requests for protocol exceptions are submitted to local IRB on a case by [CONTACT_413].   Caregiver Communications: Coordinators will log all clinically relevant communications with patients and their caregivers in the VALAD charts. The only communications that should not be recorded are those initiated by [CONTACT_14676], and those regarding scheduling.   Study coordinators will call caregivers to confirm their appointments one day before the scheduled date. When calling to confirm an appointment, take the opportunity to remind caregivers to bring study medication bottles to the clinic and confirm that they have been administering the correct dosage to the patient. For screening or scanning visits remind the patient to bring a valid form of ID.  Reimbursement/Payments: Patients will be paid $100 for each PET scan and $50 for each MRI scan; each patient will receive 4 PET and 2 MRI scans. The patient will receive $100 for each lumbar puncture procedure.  Therefore, over 18 months subjects who complete LP will be compensated $800.00; and those who do not complete LP will be compensated $500.00. In addition, informants will receive $10 per hour or $200 for the entire study that requires approximately 20 hours of informant time during the one-year study. We will also cover transportation costs that we estimate at $80 per patient on average during the study. Petty cash will be used at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_779481].   Monitoring Visits: NYSPI /CUMC will conduct Site Initiation, Interim Monitoring, and Close Out visits for any sub site completing work on this protocol. Monitoring visits will include review of sub site regulatory binders(s), source documents, subject charts, database data entry, pharmacy/pharmacy logs, lab space and equipment, any space where study visits are conducted, as well as scheduled time to meet with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_779482]. A detailed monitoring report inclusive of all findings and action items for the site will be generated 1-2 weeks after the visit.   Research Charts: Study site coordinators are responsible for assembling and updating each patient’s research chart. Coordinators review each subject chart at the end of each subject’s visit for accuracy and completion of each form. A second coordinator will double check all forms. This instant checking and cross checking is designed to ensure protocol compliance and subject safety. Staff will follow local regulations for paper research charts, with special attention paid to regulations for proper storage of consent forms.   It is recommended that the sections of a research chart be ordered as follows:  1. Patient Tracker/Table of Study Procedures/AE log/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_242434] 2. Consent 3. Labs/Medical Records 4. MRI 5. PET (tau and amyloid) 6. LP 
52  
         7. Screen 8. Week 0 9. Week 2 10. Week 4 11. Week 12 12. Week 26 13. Week 52 14. Week 78  Forms and measures will be placed in the chart’s specific sections and visit weeks as specified in the “Study Visits: Measures to be Completed per Visit” section of this manual.   Early Discontinuation and Alternate Scenarios: The reasons for early discontinuation of a patient from the study include the following: 1. Intervening severe medical illness that either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_779483]. 2. Discontinuation of treatment with valacyclovir or placebo for more than 6 weeks. After an interruption of treatment for any reason, e.g., medical illness, the patient can resume the protocol if the interruption is less than 6 weeks. 3. Based on the result of a blood draw at the week 26 visit, if the serum creatinine level increases to more than 1.5 or eGFR declines to less than 44 mL/min, we will lower the study medication to the minimum dose of 2g valacyclovir or placebo per day. Patients will then have blood collected and labs repeated at an additional visit at week 30. If, at week 30, kidney function is still abnormal based on the above criteria, study medication will be discontinued for this patient. The reduction in kidney function will be communicated to the patient's primary care physician. This is an intent-to treat protocol. Therefore, a patient who is discontinued early in the study due to the above reasons will be followed and evaluated (whenever feasible) until the Week 78 visit or until the patient withdraws his/her consent to participate. 4. Patient moves their residence to a distant location. 5. Side effects leading the subject to discontinue medication.  6. Insufficient Clinical Response. 7. Non-Compliance with study protocol and/or procedures. 8. Withdrawal of consent. 9. Death.  Intent to Treat/ Dropouts and Missing Data:  Dropout is estimated at 15%. In patients who discontinue study medication, reason for early exit will be documented and study visits will continue at scheduled time-points per the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle.   The primary analyses will be on the ITT sample, i.e., all randomized subjects according to the treatment that they were assigned. Missing data on outcome variables will be dealt with by [CONTACT_2329] (longitudinal) generalized linear mixed effects models that do not require complete measurements under the “missing at random” assumption. For MRI scan, 18F-Florbetapir PET scan, and 18F-MK-[ADDRESS_1071496] estimates that could arise due to non-ignorable missing data.  Treatment interruption for up to 6 weeks will be allowed for medical/surgical intervening conditions.  When a patient is at risk of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248]:  When a patient is at risk of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], study staff should assess the concern and take action accordingly, and the study doctor for that patient needs to be informed about intervening to keep the patient in the study if 
53  
         possible. Staff should keep all relevant blank paper work for the week 78 or Endpoint (dropout) visit in the subject’s chart at all times.  While the goal is ITT assessments up to [ADDRESS_1071497] Andrews as to which time-point the data should be entered in the database.   Assessment Instruments: For a full reference of all forms, measures, requisitions, and notes kept for subjects participating in this protocol, please refer to the Mock Chart, which is kept in room 1600A at NYSPI.  Testing materials for the ADAS-Cog11 and other procedures are stored in room 1600A.  Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog11, modified version): Includes tests of attention, category fluency, epi[INVESTIGATOR_395969], non-verbal memory, and naming. ADAS-cog has been used in virtually all FDA registration trials in AD, and we can compare our results with the literature. ADAS-cog has three different/equivalent word list versions that will be given sequentially to reduce practice effects.  ADCS-ADL: A research measure of daily functioning in AD that has been used in several major AD trials. It includes a large section on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living that are affected in mild AD.  Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): The formal CDR interview will be used to score 6 domains (boxes); sum of boxes. Overall score: 0=none, 0.5=questionable, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe dementia  National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centers (NACC) Forms: The physician will complete the NACC that takes 35-40 minutes and includes history, neurological exam with assessment of Parkinsonian signs, psychiatric assessment that includes the short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), vascular risk factors and the modified Hachinski ischemic scale.  NACC-UDS Neuropsychological Test Battery (2015 version): Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Number Span Test Forward and Backward, Category Fluency for animals and vegetables, Craft Story21 recall (and delayed), Benson Complex Figure Recall and delayed, Multilingual Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, Phonemic Test. These tests are given for diagnostic purposes only at baseline and 52 and 78 weeks. Drs. Devanand and Stern will make consensus diagnoses at baseline (done with ADRC), and at 52 and 78 weeks, based on clinical assessment and these cognitive tests. We considered the ADCS-PACC (composite score from 4 tests) and the CogState C3 composite used in the A4 trial (PET amyloid-positive, cognitively intact subjects), but these scores were derived by [CONTACT_779572]; they have not yet been validated in AD clinical trials and hence we will not use them.  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE): Apolipoprotein E will be genotyped (ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles) by [CONTACT_779573]429358 and rs7412. A portion of the blood will be sent out to Prevention Genetics for identification of APOE genotype. Using a standard protocol, DNA is amplified by [CONTACT_779574] (PCR). The genotypes are determined blind to subject status (patient or control) by [CONTACT_779575].  Olfaction Assessment/ The UPSIT (scratch-and-sniff odor identification test): Has been administered to several hundred thousand subjects around the world and its use is not associated with any known side effects. The UPSIT comprises synthetic odors and there is no risk of an allergic reaction with this procedure. If there is an acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], testing will be delayed until the participant has recovered.

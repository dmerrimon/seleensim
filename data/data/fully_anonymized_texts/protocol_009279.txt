Protocol Number:  
A-101-WART 3 03  A Phase 3 Open Label Safety Study of A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_795333]:  
Aclaris Therapeutics  
 Phase of Development:  
Phase 3  
Study Drug Description:  
 
A-101 Solution contains 45%  hydrogen peroxide that will be supplied in a single use 
applicator  to be a pplied directly to common warts (verruca vulgaris) t wice a week.     
 
The study drug, A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 45% Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] (hereafter referred to as A -
101) is a colorless solution that must be stored at room temperature (15- 25º C or 59 - 77 º F).     
Study Objectives:  
 
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety of A -101 45% when 
applied twice weekly to common warts .  
 Secondary : 
The secondary objectives of this study  include:  
• Efficacy of A -101 45% in the treat ment of recurrent and/or further treatments for new 
warts  
• Duration of response of A -101 45%  
• Onset of action of A -101 45%  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 3, open label, long term safety study of A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% in 
subjects with common warts.  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protoc ol Number:  A -101-WART -303 
Protocol: Version 3:  [ADDRESS_1097147] complete clearance of all warts at the end of A -101-WART -301 or A -101-
WART 302 may enter i nto the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 
assessments.  These subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or 
development of new common warts.  If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these 
subjects may re turn to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% twice a 
week for an additional [ADDRESS_1097148] not cleared at the completion of A -101-WART -301 or A -
101-WART 302 may enter into the A -101-WART -303 study f ollowing completion of the Visit 
1 assessments and will receive A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% twice a week for 8 weeks.  If at 
the completion of the initial 8 -week treatment course with A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% the 
identified warts are not clear, s ubjects m ay continue to receive repeated 8 -week treatment 
course with A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% twice a week. The final 8- week treatment course 
must be initiated by [CONTACT_2006] 122.   
 Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical 
chemistry), assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medication review.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart  according to 
the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) scale.  The Investigator should NOT refer to any other 
assessments or previous assessments  to assist with this evaluation.  
 
Number of Patients to be Enrolled:  
Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled  to the study.   
Number of Study Sites:

    4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Summary  
Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by [CONTACT_795350] n papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) family.  Cutaneous HPV 
subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papi[INVESTIGATOR_795336]. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most co mmonly through direct contact [CONTACT_160816] (evident  lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly throu gh exposure to contaminated 
surfaces, or even by [CONTACT_795351] n. 
Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar 
and plantar warts, mosaic warts, flat w arts, and butcher’s warts. Common warts are generally 
small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodul es and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_795337] 1, [ADDRESS_1097164] commonly located on the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces 
of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any 
other anatomical location, potentially spreading by [CONTACT_795352] r/hand lesions . 
In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously  resolve in less than [ADDRESS_1097165] for many years, may 
be large and/or cosmetically unsightly ( e.g., face, h ands), spread to distant anatomical regions by 
[CONTACT_160819], be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide  a significant 
reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at risk for significa nt morbidity . 
There are currently no specific antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795338] -approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_274254]. Existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
many of which are off -label uses of drugs approved f or other indications, and many of which 
have never undergone the drug approval process, are  of unproven safety and/or effic acy, and are 
generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative m odalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, application of 
acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_795339], cantharidin, topi[INVESTIGATOR_160770] 5 -fluorouracil, or bleomycin; topi[INVESTIGATOR_160771] ( e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_160772], intralesional candida antigen, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_795340] e ster) or lesion removal. Several of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795341] -the-counter (OTC) wart therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] l esser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_160776], home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as 
cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be 
effective in  some cases. While these methods may achieve cure in some cases, many require 
multiple visits to a physician’s office, and may require provi ders with specialized training and 
the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require anest hesia and/or 
analgesia, and they can be complicated by [CONTACT_795353], as well as the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_17396] -surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy 
is consistently effective in all cases and, in f act, there is great variability among practitioners in 
the methods employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the  results.

    Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest 
peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including 
chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, a nd disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 
has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene 
products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment 
of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, 
in addition to its use as an oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_160777], H 2O2 is widely employed at low 
concentrations ( e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topi[INVESTIGATOR_113380]/disinfectant, and has been 
in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by [CONTACT_160821] 1858.  ( Schumb, 
1955)  (Chan, 2008)  (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) ( Zonios, 2007) . 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of 
reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by [CONTACT_46917] a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidas e, superoxide 
dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water -soluble groups.  The local application of supra -
physiologic concentrations of H
2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of 
reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by [CONTACT_274294] O
2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells . 
 
4.2. Study Rationale  
The rationale for the dose selection and treatment design of A -101-WART 301 and 
A-101-WART -302 and this open label, long term safety study is based on data 
collected from three completed (3) Phase 2 studies which assessed dose response 
and dose frequency of A -101 (H2O2) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_795342].   All three studies demonstrated good efficacy and safety of H 2O2  45% for the 
treatment of common warts.   
The three studies conducted are identified below and they represent data collected 
from 406 subjects.  
• Study A -101-WART -201: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle- Controlled, 
Parallel - Group, Study of A -101 Solution in Subjects with Common Warts  
(n=90).  
• Study A -101-WART -202: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 
Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_160760] a Week in 
Subjects with Co mmon Warts  (n=157). 
• Study A -101-WART -203: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel 
Group Study of A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_274263] a Week in Subjects with Common 
Warts  (n=159)

Protocol: Version 3:  [ADDRESS_1097166] treatment follow up.  Aclaris recognizes that many patients may require multiple treatme nt courses and there is therefore a need to assess the long - 
term safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] H

assessments.  These subjects  will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or 
development of new common warts.  If a recurrenc e occurs  or a new wart develops these 
subjec ts may return to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 45% twice a 
week for an additional [ADDRESS_1097168] not cleared (or were not treated) at the completion o f A-101-

according to the schedules noted below . 
12.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s assessment of the signs and the subj ect’s assessment of the 
symptoms associated with irritation at the identified common wart  site ( i.e., the common wart  and the skin 
immediately surrounding the common wart  exposed to study medication).  
The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are:  
• Eryth ema 
• Edema  
• Erosion  
• Ulceration  
• Vesicles/bullae  
• Excoriations  
• Scabbing 
The Local Skin Reactio n symptoms to be assessed (by [CONTACT_31388]) are:  
• Stinging/burning  
• Pruritus (itch)  
The Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs at the each identified common wart site  as follows:  
• At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application  
and 
The Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the identified common wart site as follows:  
• At visits w here a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application 
At visits where NO  study medication treatment is  performed:

    13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Defini tions 
13.1.1. Adve rse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens 
in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under 
study (or  any concu rrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : 
• intercurrent illnesses ; 
• physical injuries ; 
• events possibly related to concomitant medication ; 
• significant worsening (cha nge in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as a n adverse event ); 
• Drug interactions; 
• Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study;  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by [CONTACT_448071]) that results in the withdrawal of 
the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or is considered by [CONTACT_160837].  N
OTE: 
Abnormal laboratory test  results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from 
entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but 
will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
The investigator must, for any common wart  related AE, question the subject in detail 
to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by [CONTACT_274307], 
sunburn) for any such AE . 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinicall y relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . 
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment s hould be 
reported as medical  history, not as an AE . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 47  
    13.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296]; 
• Result s in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or  
• Is an important medical event.  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274281] -patient basis, even if released the sam e day. Prolongation of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_760946]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
 Important medical events are those  that may not be immediately  life threatening, result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. Thes e 
should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
13.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The investigator must start re porting non- serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication tr eatment continuing until the subject’s last study visit. Non- serious adverse events 
that occur between the time the subject was consent ed and the first application of study 
medication will be reported as medical history . 
Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until the 
subject’s last study visit (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experiences 
a SAE after the subject’s last study visit,  that is deemed by [CONTACT_795358], the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report 
form . 
13.1.4. Severity  
The investigator must define the severity of each AE using  the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the mos t appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 48  
    Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity.  
13.1.5. Relati onship to Study Medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and 
consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal  relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the st udy medication by [CONTACT_118238] . 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
study medication and the AE. 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE . 
The term “reasonable causal relationsh ip” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 
13.2. Reporting Procedures  
13.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will ques tion the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”   
The Investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least [ADDRESS_1097211]’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or  until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study 
medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  [ADDRESS_1097212]:  
1. Take the appro priate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform th e Aclaris of the SAE  by [CONTACT_795359]. If the 
Axiom database is unavailable, the site must fax a provided paper SAE form to Aclaris at the number 
below : 
 
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359  
 
3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other 
relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test 
results) must be enter ed in to the Axiom database . 
4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject’s 
last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118200] a clinically stable outcome with or without sequel ae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor  agree that the SAE  is 
satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor  of SAE updates by [CONTACT_795360] . 
Comply with the appropriate regulator y requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions 
regardi ng reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) . 
13.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be w ithdrawn from study drug at any time at 
the discretion of the inve stigator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.  The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, unti l a 
determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the 
patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform 
the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events.  Additional reports must be provided when requested .

    14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Details of all statistical summaries and analyses  will be provided in the study specific Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The sample size is based on an estimate of how many patients will be required to provide at least 
100 subjects requiring repeated treatment for a wart over the course of the study . 
• By [CONTACT_30224] [ADDRESS_1097213] ive treatment 
in the A101- WART 301/302 studies. 
• We expected  approximately 26% of warts treated in A -101-WART -301/302 studies to be 
clear  at the en d of the A101- WART 301/302 studies . 
• Based on the assumption that 26% of warts will be clear, at least 148 subj ects will require 
exposure to active treatment.  
• We anticipate that some subjects originally randomized to vehicle will be  expos ed to 
active treatm ent. 
As a result, the study should exceed the target of exposing more than 100 subjects to repeated treatments  over the course of the study.  
14.2. Analysis Populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects consented in the study.  
14.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
Unless otherwise stated, all efficacy summaries and analyses will be conducted u sing the ITT 
population.  All efficacy summaries and analyses will be produced for the following groups:  
• Subjects treated in the  study that were r andomized to active treatment during the previous 
A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101-WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study overall . 
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study t hat were randomized to active 
treatment during the previous  A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study  that were randomized to vehicle during 
the previous A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects not requiring treat ment in the study overall.  
• All subjects combined

Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 51  
     
The primary efficacy analysis will be the effectiveness of A -101 45% based on the proportion of 
subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts  at any 
scheduled visit .  Any i dentified common wart for a subject that has missin g PWA  data will be 
treated as not clear for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 Four secondary efficacy analyses will be performed:  
• Durability of response:  for warts achieving a status of Clear (PWA=0), the number of weeks the wart remains clear will be tabulated and these results will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  The proportion of these warts that remain clear at the end of the 
study will also be prese nted.   
• Mean per -subject p ercent of treated warts that are Clear (PWA=0) at  each visit  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics .    
• Proportion of subjects with a single wart at baseline whose wart is Clear (PWA=0)  will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765].  
• Median time to achieve onset of Clearance (PWA=0) for all treated warts.  
Efficacy summaries will be supported by [CONTACT_795361].  
14.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data  
Unless otherwise stated, all safety  summaries will be conducted using the ITT population.  All 
safety  summaries will be produced for the following groups:  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous 
A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the  previous A101-
WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study overall . 
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 s tudy.  
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the st udy that were randomized to vehicle during 
the previous A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects receiving active treatment during the study or the previous A101- WART 
301/302 study .  
The proportion of subjects w ith treatment em ergent adverse events will be tabulated and 
presented by [CONTACT_795362] (MedDRA).   Likewise , the proportion of subjects with serious AEs will be 
summarized.   Adver se event summaries will be presented showing the pro portion of subjects 
experiencing adverse events, both overall and by [CONTACT_7204].  The version of MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the SAP .

    15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
15.1. Protocol Amendments 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_1201] /EC, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety concerns to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or adminis tration.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_160806] . 
15.2. Protocol Violations 
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medic ation , and/or GCP guidelines .  Protocol 
violations will be identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060], on the CRF . 
As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptio ns to protocol -specific entry criteria 
to allow patients to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered 
ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard 
Operating  Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility cr iteria 
was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately  inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by [CONTACT_3211]/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 
15.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects . 
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this visit, participants  will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appr opriately trained individual prior to 
participating in any of the procedures and evaluations i n this study . 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items.  Team or ganization, communication and operational 
issues will also be discussed . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center . 
15.4. Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_160846], Inc. study monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

    The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. representatives designee and/or and 
any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject 
medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation.  The i nvestigator also agrees to assist the 
representative, if required . 
15.5. Data Management  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study .  The data 
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS)  that meets 
the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The 
CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the  scientific, regulatory, and logistical 
requirements of the study before it is used to capture  data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are 
trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights . 
The handling of data, including data quality ass urance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, 
including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data 
management and control processes s pecific to this study will be described in a data management 
plan.    At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for  
reporting and statistical analysis .

Programs to Support You During Chemotherapy (Pro -You): A randomized controlled 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_101236] 1: To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101237] a Yoga Skills Training 
(YST)  versus an Attention Control (AC) group among adults with a gastrointestinal 
(GI) cancer  receiving  chemotherapy to determine preliminary  efficacy for  the primary 
outcome of fatigue, secondary outcome of depressive symptoms, and possible 
mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian disruption, inflammation) as assessed 
by [CONTACT_101266].   
 
Aim 2: To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily  assessments of 
fatigue, depressive symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore 
relationships among daily and standard assessments.   
 
Aim 3: To qualitatively assess perceived efficac y of the YST and AC and 
acceptability of new methodology through semi -structured interviews in a subset of 
20-[ADDRESS_111749] recalled assessments of fatigue, depressive symptoms and possible 
mediators will be collected at four time points (baseline, mid -intervention, post -
intervention, 4 -week follow -up). Participants will also be asked to complete daily 
assessments of o utcomes, mediators, and adherence to home practice of the 
intervention via an automated daily survey  and wear a wrist actigraphy device for two 
weeks before and two weeks following the interventions. Inflammatory cytokines will 
be collected along with pati ents regularly scheduled blood draws at weeks [ADDRESS_111750] for a prior study to teach the key 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  9 of 52 elements of yoga in a manner that would accommodate patients’ needs and reduce 
barriers to adherence during chemotherapy.  The YST intervention has been modified 
for this study to consist of four 30 minute in -person sessions (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) that 
instructs skills to enhance mi ndfulness and promote relaxation.  
 
An empathic attention control group will be employed as the AC to account for the 
added attention and efficacy expectations of the YST as used in previous studies.1–31–
31–[ADDRESS_111751].  
The total length of time each participant will be on study  is approximately 14 weeks 
(see Study Schema) .  
 
Sample Size and Population  
The target population is 44 participants, 22 in each group. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_101267] (colon , rectal /other better prognosis GI cancers, poorer 
prognosis cancers ) and cancer stage (localized stages II/III or metastatic stage IV) to 
minimize differences between  groups  (6 strata total) . We will add cancers of the small 
intestine , anus  and appendix to our existing rectal cancer strata since the survival rates 
are similar.  The cancer types with poorer prognoses will be put into the new strata 
(with <50% 5 -year surv ival rate; cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, 
gallbladder, liver).

Protocol Date  07/15/19  11 of 52 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
 To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101238] (GI) cancers receiving chemotherapy to 
determine preliminary  efficacy for  the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary 
outcome of depressive symptoms , and possible mediators (i.e., psychological 
stress, circadian disruption, inflammation) as assessed by [CONTACT_101266].  
  Hypothesis: The YST will show trends for reducing fatigue and depressive 
symptoms as assessed with standard recalled measures to a greater degree than 
the AC and these r educti ons will be associated with decreases in mediators.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily  assessments of fatigue, 
depressive symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore 
relationships among daily  and standard assessments.   
 
 To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the YST and AC and acceptability 
of new methodology through semi -structured interviews in a subset of 20 -40 
participants.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, D isease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Burden of fatigue and depressive symptoms in gastrointestinal  cancer s is high . 
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are among the  most prevalent cancer s for both men and 
women,4 and the number of GI survivors continues to increas e.5–7 Fatigue, ‘‘a 
subjective state of overwhelming and sustained exhaustion and decreased capacity for 
physical and mental work that is not relieved by [CONTACT_9075],”8  is reported by a majority 
(>50%)9,10 of patients with GI cancer s, co-occurs with other common symptoms such 
as depression (>30% in patients receiving chem otherapy),11–[ADDRESS_111753] -treatment quality of life.14,15 There is overlap in some methods for 
assessing fatigue and depressive symptoms; however, these symptoms remain 
moderately correlated even when commonalities are removed.33 There is also 
considerable evidence showing that fatigue and depression are distinc tly associated 
with other variables such as quality of life.16–18 Further, although chemotherapy is 
efficacious for increasing survival,19 it leads to increases in fatigue and depress ive 
symptoms20,21 such that symptoms peak approximately 3 -5 days following treatment 
and then improve;22–24 however fatigue and depressive symptoms do not return to 
pretreatment levels in a substantial subset of patients (20 -80%).25–29 Fatigue and 
depressive symptoms experienced during treatment are associated with subsequent 
symptoms.16 Thus, it is important to address elevations of fatigue and commonly co -
occurring depressive symptoms during chemotherapy to improve quality of life in 
patients with GI cancers . 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  12 of 52 Importance of shared biobehavioral mediato rs of fatigue and depressive 
symptoms. The biobehavioral conceptual framework and data23,30 –[ADDRESS_111754] that 
fatigue and depressive symptoms tend to co -occur because they may share underlying 
mechanisms including psychological stress, circadian disruption (i.e., an altered ratio 
of nighttime activity to daytime activity) and inflammation.34,37,38 Figure 1 illustrates 
the potential relationsh ips among these variables using a biobehavioral framework. 
Data support that psychological stress  in cancer patients is associated with fatigue, 
depressive symptoms, circadian disruption and inflammation.30,31,33,39 Cancer and its 
treatment can also lead to circadian disruption, which is associated with fatigue in GI 
cancer  patients ,36 and fatigue and depressive symptoms during chemotherapy.23,34,35 
Further, evidence suggests that circadian disruption precedes fatigue and depressive 
symptoms.23,40 Data also show that increases  in inflammation (i.e., sTNF -R1, IL -6) 
specifically 
during 
treatment for 
gastrointestinal 
cancer  is 
related to 
changes in 
fatigue and 
other symptoms 
(e.g., distress).10 
 
2.2 Study Rationale  
Preliminary efficacy of yoga for fatigue and depressive symptoms.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_101239] , there are few behavioral interventions designed for GI cancer 
patients that aim to proactively improve fatigue and depressive symptoms during 
treatment.41,42 Guidelines for managing  cancer -related fa tigue include non -
pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that target fatigue itself, comorbid 
medical conditions and coexisting symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms).[ADDRESS_111755] that a combined approach may be 
optimal.29–[ADDRESS_111756] increased efficacy.48 Although the optimal dose of yoga is 

Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111757] improvements in fatigue were found in cancer survivors who 
practiced yoga an average of three times per week49 and a review of exercise 
interventions (including yoga) during chemotherapy found that 90 -120 minutes of 
moderate activity per week was better than highe r doses.50 Further, ~[ADDRESS_111758] of yoga on fatigue and depressive symptoms.  
Reviews of yoga research call for the investigation of m ediators to explain how yoga 
influences cancer -related outcomes such as fatigue and depressive symptoms.52 The 
Self-regulati on Framework can be applied to understand the efficacy of behavioral 
integrative medicine interventions such as yoga.53 This framework posits that people 
are able to consciously alter their cognitive (e.g., mindfulness), emotional (e.g., 
feelings of relaxation) and behavioral (e.g., breath ing) responses to various 
experiences (e.g., psychological stress from cancer and its treatment) to obtain desired 
goals (e.g., reduced fatigue).54,[ADDRESS_111759] step in the self -regulation 
process.56 Yoga aims to increase mindfulness and promote relaxation to strengthen 
patients’ ability to regulate their responses. There is evidence supporting that yoga 
reduces psychological stress,57 and improves subjective and objective sleep quality (a 
component of circadian disruption).58,59 Further, inflammatory cytokines are 
theoretical biomarkers of effective self -regulation60 and there is  some evidence that 
yoga reduces inflammation  (e.g., IL -6, TNF -α).61–64 Therefore, further study of yoga 
for reducing fatigue is warranted.21  
 
The proposed yoga intervention, Yoga Skills Training (YST), will be 
implemented i n the clinical setting to be inclusive of patients most in need of 
intervention.  Implementation of the proposed YST individually in the clinical setting 
challenges the current paradigm in the [LOCATION_002] that typi[INVESTIGATOR_101240]. A  study that recruited cancer patients to group yoga classes found 
that there were some common barriers to participating in yoga classes including, 
transportation, scheduling, being too busy or too sick.58 This was important to 
consider in this study design because  such a large portion of cancer patients travel 
long distances for treatment (i.e.,  83% of colorectal cancer patients treated at 
Vanderbilt -Ingram Cancer Center travel more than 10 miles for treatment and 48% 
travel 50 miles or more ).65 Patients’  experience of fatigue was also associated with 
attending fewer yoga classes in another study.[ADDRESS_111760] is designed to lessen identified barriers to 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111761] into patients’ already scheduled visits for 
chemotherapy. So far, only preliminary research h as been conducted to explore if 
yoga can be safe and efficacious when applied in clinical settings related to cancer 
care.62,[ADDRESS_111762] efficacy than more commonly used recalled assessments.  Fatigue and 
depressive symptoms are generally assessed in intervention studies through 
retrospective patient -reported outcomes (e.g., “how much fatigue have you 
experienced in the past 7 days”).69,70 However , assessment over a week’s time period 
is likely to miss the acute variation in the experience of symptoms and not capture the 
influence of an intervention on fatigue at its worst [ADDRESS_111763] of an intervention on the trajectory of 
symptoms following chemotherapy. Dai ly diaries are one method for measuring an 
experience in a participant’s natural setting with low patient burden.[ADDRESS_111764] of yoga 
on “positive” ther apeutic processes (i.e., invigoration, acceptance, relaxation), 
however, psychological stress, circadian disruption and inflammation were not 
assessed.51,[ADDRESS_111765],59 and inflammation,61–[ADDRESS_111766] sizes were large (anxiety, d= -0.82; 
relaxation, d=0.83). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101241] a clinical setting.  In addition,  this study supported  the 
safety of implementing the YST during chemotherapy . Minimal  risk including 
potential for  muscle soreness from the gentle movements or emotional discomfort 
from breathing and meditation practices  is expected from participating in the YST . 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111767] as compared to an attention control group for 
patients receiving chemotherapy for colorectal cancer . Of the 29 patients approached, 
15 (51.7%) agreed to participate with interest from both men (60%) and women 
(40%). Mos t (80%) of the in -person intervention sessions (YST or active control) 
were completed with missed sessions due to patients not receiving chemotherapy. The 
active control consisted of empathic attention. Thus, these preliminary data support 
feasibility for recruitment and randomization. Based on what the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_101242], and with input from my current mentors and other experts, we plan to 
build upon this previous YST by [CONTACT_101268] (i.e., daily asses sments of symptoms, objective measure of circadian 
disruption, mixed -methods follow -up assessment) and enhancing the YST 
intervention (i.e., more targeted to fatigue, attention to treatment fidelity, focused on 
adherence to home practice).   
3. STUDY DESIGN  
 We propose  a prospective stratified randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_62848] a sample of GI 
cancer  patients receiving first -line Fluorouracil (5FU) -based chemotherapy  (5FU -based 
chemotherapy is the standard treatment for all patients with colorectal cancer s and most 
patients with other gastrointestinal cancers ). This study  will assess preliminary efficacy 
of YST on the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary outcome of depressive 
symptoms, and possible mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian disruption, 
inflammation) as assessed by [CONTACT_101266]. Secondary objective s are to measure 
the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily  assessments of fatigue, depressi ve 
symptoms,  explore relationships among daily and standard assessments , and explore 
mediators . At study completion, the first [ADDRESS_111768] recalled assessments of fatigue, depressive symptoms and possible mediators 
will be collected at four time points (baseline, mid -intervention, post -intervention, 4 -
week follow -up). Participants will also be asked to complete daily assessments of 
outcomes, mediators, and adherence to home practice of the intervention via an 
automated daily survey  and wear a wrist actigraphy device for two weeks before and 
two weeks following the interventions. Inflammatory cytokines will be collected  along 
with patients regularly scheduled blood draws at weeks [ADDRESS_111769] for a prior study to teach the key 
elements of yoga in a manner that w ould accommodate patients’ needs and reduce 
barriers to adherence during chemotherapy.  The YST intervention has been modified 
for this study to consist of four 30 minute in -person sessions (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) that 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111770] as used in previous studies.1–3 1–[ADDRESS_111771] meet all of the inclusion crite ria to participate in this study . 
 Adults ( ≥21 years of age )  
 Scheduled to receive first -line Fluorouracil (5FU) -based intravenous 
chemotherapy treatment for a gastrointestinal  cancer (stages II -IV) 
 Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤1  
 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an informed consent 
document in English  
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
study participation . 
 
 Has a self -reported history of diagnosed sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive 
sleep apnea, insomnia), comorbidities associated with poor sleep or fatigue 
(e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome), or a job with night shift s.

University  (CCC -WFU) and the  Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC ; site-
specific protocol, closed to recruitment ). To identify potential patients, a study team 
member ( STM ) will screen participants using electronic medical records containing 
patients’ schedules and communicate with attending physicians regarding patients’ 
potential eligibility for trial. Subject recruitment will be documented in a Screening 
Log including reasons for ineligibility, eligible patients approached, number who 
decli ned participation, and number successfully recruited.  
 
If the patient is interested, the STM will approach the patient  at a clinic visit or call 
the patient  to explain the protocol, answer questions, further determine eligibility, and 
discuss informed cons ent. After making sure the patient clearly understands the study 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  17 of 52 procedures and agrees to follow them, the patient will be asked to sign the informed 
consent form either in person or remotely  (Appendix A: Informed Consent 
Document) . If signed remotely, patients will be asked to mail, or fax the form back to 
us, as well as bring the original with them to their next clinic visit. A copy of the 
consent form will be given to the participant in person the next time they are in clinic, 
and the original copy will be kept in the participant’s file.  
 
Eligible participants enrolled in the study will be randomized after baseline 
assessments to YST or AC at week 0.  
 
Randomization. Eligible , consented,  and enrolled participants will be randomize d to 
YST or AC . To control for type and stage of cancer, randomization will occur within 
both type (colon , rectal /other better prognosis GI cancers, poorer prognosis cancers ) 
and stage (localized stages II/III or metastatic stage IV).  Randomization  (1:1) lists 
within each strata will be generated via a permuted block program developed and 
executed by [CONTACT_101269] [ADDRESS_111773] s will be held by a STM (not involved with data collection ) 
who will allocate each participant to study group . Once assigned, details about that 
arm will be revealed  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101243] . 
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Active Intervention . The Yoga Skills Training (YST) intervention will be 
administered individually in the outpatient clinic while patients are in the chair during 
outpatient chemotherapy sessions and patients will be encouraged practice the YST 
daily at home. First-line 5FU-based chemotherapy for gastrointestinal  cancer s is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_101244]. [CONTACT_101305] developed the YST for a prior study 
to teach the key elements of yoga in a manner that would accommodate patients’ 
needs and reduce barriers to adherence du ring chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_111774] intervention 
consists of four 30  minute in -person sessions (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) that instructs skills to 
enhance mindfulness and promote relaxation: (a) Awareness  – noticing  the current 
state and establishing relaxed breathing – 5 minutes; (b) Movement  - 7 minutes of 
gentle movements coordinated with the breath (such as raising and lowering the 
arms); (c) Breathing Practice  - 3 minutes of inhaling cool air as if through a straw; 
(d) Meditation  - [ADDRESS_111775] will address any questions and inquire 
about the participant’s current physical status. The last five minutes will be used to 
review a handout descr ibing the YST  (Appendix B: YST Home Practice Guide ; 
Appendix C: YST Diary ) and to encourage participants to practice daily with 
strategies to increase adherence to home practice described later in this section. 
Participants will also be given an audio recording of the YST and devices to play the 
recording. Th e content of the YST was informed by [CONTACT_60306]. Sohl’s  training from the 
Integral Yoga Academy’s Yoga for People with Cancer Teacher Training taught by 
[CONTACT_101270], RN, RYT, the Urban Zen Integrative Therapy training, and was 
modified for this study to furt her target fatigue and depressive symptoms by 
[CONTACT_101271]  07/15/19  18 of 52 consulting with expert yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101245] (i.e., led 
by [CONTACT_101272], Ph.D). Each session will contain the same content, but the 
movement will be individualized based on ability a nd level of energy that day. Self -
compassion will be highlighted throughout the YST and any medical restriction can 
be accommodated. All yoga instructors (i.e., interventionists) will have completed 
accredited yoga teacher training programs and be experien ced teaching patients with 
chronic illness.  Minimal  risk including p otential for muscle soreness from the gentle 
movements or emotional discomfort from breathing and meditation practices  is 
expected from participating in the YST .  
 
Attention Control (AC). An empathic attention control group will be employed as 
the AC to account for the added attention and efficacy expectations of the YST as 
used in previous studies.1–[ADDRESS_111776] will recommend that the 
patients write brief diary entries daily at home as used as a control condition in  
another previous study  (Appendix D: AC Home Diary) .[ADDRESS_111777]. 
The AC will be implemented by [CONTACT_101273] a background conducting research 
in a medical setting who will be trained to create and maintain a relationship by [CONTACT_101274], reflection of statements, and avoiding negative 
judgments. This individual will spend approxim ately 30 minutes with patients for 
four sessions while they are undergoing chemotherapy. S(he) will utilize standardized 
instructions to prompt the patient as adapted from previous studies2,76,77: “What were 
some of the events or circumstances that affected you in the past two weeks?”  
Patients will be encouraged to ‘‘discuss one experience at a time, even if it means 
talking about the same experience each se ssion. However, if you find that you have 
discussed it in adequate detail, please move on to a new topic.’’ The instructions for 
daily diary entries will be, “What were some of the events or circumstances that 
affected you in the past day? Think back over the past day and write down on the 
lines below up to five events that had an impact on you.”[ADDRESS_111778] eps will be taken to ensure treatment fidelity.78–

patient  or anyone else present ) with 10% of the recordings randomly selected for [CONTACT_101306]’s  review , and document each in -person session with a checklist  (Appendix E: 
Treatment Fidelity Forms ). The  checklist will be also used to evaluate consistency of 
implementation.  
 
Adherence Strategies.  To optimize adherence to home practice interventionists  will 
be trained to  adopt brief coaching methods based on motivational interviewing as 
used to encourage yoga practice and walking in other studies of cancer patients.49,81 
Specifically, the interventionists will ask open -ended questions to inquire about goals, 
specific times planned for home practice, and strategies to ensure home practice of 
the interventions. Confidence in the ability to practice will be verbally assessed and 
reports of low confidence discussed.  
5.3 Concomita nt Interventions   
5.3.1  Allowed Interventions  
All participants  will continue with routine treatment of medical conditions including 
chemotherapy  and medications.  
 
5.3.2  Required Interventions  
 
                  No additional interventions are required ex cept for those propose in  the protocol . 
 
5.3.3  Prohibited Interventions  
 There will be no prohibited medications  among patients in this study.  Prior approval 
of participation in other behavioral intervention studies is required.   
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence will be assessed by: (1) participation in -person sessions (i.e., number of 
sessions  completed ); (2) number of components completed at each in -person  YST  
session; (3) and  days of  intervention home practice (see Section 6.2 - Description of 
Evaluat ions).  Instructors  will directly observe and document adherence to in person 
sessions . We will consider high adherence to protocol if participants  complete  75% of 
the planned in-person sessions  and 3 or more days of home practice per week  in 
between in -person sessions .

A Interventionists will note any adverse events that occur during the intervention or reported by [CONTACT_101275] .  
B The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101247] s’ notes and identify any AE’s that need to be captured.  
C Other Study Team Members  (e.g., Research Nurses) will report ratings of 3 or higher on the suicide item from the depression 
assessment (corresponding with Weeks 0, 8, 10 and 14). They will not collect any additional information related to adverse ev ents. 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  21 of 52 6.2 Desc ription of Evaluations   
Recalled assessments will be collected at four time points (baseline, mid -intervention, 
post-intervention, 4 -week follow -up; Appendix F: Chart Review Form and 
Questionnaires) and a semi -structured interview conducted after completio n of all 
assessments (either in person or by [CONTACT_756]; Appendix G: Semi -Structured Interview 
Guide).  To minimize burden, all assessments via recalled questionnaires  and interviews 
will be scheduled to coincide  with the patients’ appointment for chemothera py. 
Therefore, sequencing of each patient’s assessments will be based on the timing of the 
respective patient’s first completed chemotherapy visit.  The standard chemotherapy 
timing is every two weeks. The randomized study condition will commence with the 
second chemotherapy visit. Given that there may be slight personal modifications to the 
standard schedule, we have proposed a design that will attempt to control for the possible 
effect of chemotherapy schedule on outcomes. If a chemotherapy visit is rescheduled for 
within two week s of the standard  schedule, the intervention will occur  at that next visit 
(and all following assessments will then follow the subsequent standard chemotherapy 
schedule). If th e rescheduled chemotherapy visit is more than two week s later, the in -
person study intervention  session for that participant will not occur , the assessments will 
be mailed to the participant for completion, and this will be documented as an aspect of 
treatment fidelity.   
 
Participants will also be asked to complete daily assessments of and adherence to home 
practice of both interventions for two weeks before and after the intervention via an  
automated daily survey  and wear a wrist actigraphy device. Partici pants will also be 
asked to complete daily assessments of outcomes, mediators, adherence to home practice 
of the intervention for two weeks before and after the intervention via an  automated daily 
survey (Appendix H: Daily Survey) and wear a wrist actigraphy device. Participants will 
be given the choice to respond to the automated daily diary via  an interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)  or internet survey hosted through a REDCap  platform  that will 
verify the date and time of assessments. IVRS  and internet surveys  have  been 
successfully applied in similar  research to  assess daily symptoms in  people with 
cancer73,82,83 and may improve compliance to assessments as compared to more 
commonly used paper daily diaries.84 Participants  will be asked to complete surveys in 
the evening. Those who choose to complete the survey via IVRS will be called at 
approximately 6:00pm each evening  (unless the participant indicates another strong time 
preference)  and have the option to call back before they go to sleep. A paper guide with 
response options for the daily survey will be provided to improve comprehension over 
the telephone. If participants do not complete the first two surveys  a STM  will call them 
to confirm receipt of  calls.  If for any reason the automated survey system is not available , 
a STM will call the patient to complete the same survey. Participants will also be given a 
wrist actigraphy  device and instructions for its use to measure circadian disruption. 
Instructions for use will be guided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Malow and [CONTACT_72117] .  
 
Inflammatory cytokines will be collected via EDTA plasma samples by a Licensed 
Practical  Nurse  or phlebotomists along wi th patients regularly scheduled blood draws at 
weeks 2 and 10. Although this method may not account for possible variation in circadian 
patterns release of some cytokines, cytokines were similarly assayed in another study, 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111780]. Nicklas .  
 
Semi -structured interviews will be conducted face -to-face or by [CONTACT_101276] a trained facilitator for approximately 45 minutes.85 If the interview is 
implemented by [CONTACT_756], no personal health inform ation will be revealed unless 
speaking directly to the participant. Additional s tudy process variables will also be 
tracked (e.g., recruitment, adherence to in -person intervention sessions, safety) and 
participants will be asked for feedback regarding reasons for declining participation and 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_87020].   
 
Measures  
 
Demographic s.  Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, ability to pay for the 
basics, alcohol/substance use and malnutrition status will be self -reported at basel ine.86  
 
Clinical D ata. Cancer type, chemotherapy  regimen, stage of disease, recurrence status, 
receipt of other treatments, day s since surgery, height, and weight  will be abstracted from 
medical charts at baseline . Any chemotherapy dose modifications or symptoms related to 
dehydration (e.g., diarrhea)  and medications for fatigue, sleep, anemia, depressive 
symptoms, and pain  will be abstracted at follow -up. 
 
Questionnaire  
 
 Fatigue (recalled) “in the past seven days”  will be assessed with the 7-item 
measure of Fatigue from the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System  (PROMIS) -Cancer .87,88 Higher scores indicate more f atigue.  
 Depressive Symptoms (recalled)  will be assessed with the standadized10 -item 
PROMIS -Cancer Depressive symptoms short -form.89  
 Psychological Stress (recalled)  will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 10 -item Perceived Str ess 
Scale (PSS).90 The PSS has 2 factors (stress and counter stress).91 
 Regulation of Psychological Stress (recalled)  will be determined by [CONTACT_101277]92, which  assess self -
efficacy for stress management (α = 0.86), copi[INVESTIGATOR_101248] -related side -
effects (α = 0.82), accepting cancer/maintaining positive attitude (α = 0.86), and 
affective regulation (α = 0.81).  
 Circadian disruption (recalled)  will be assessed with measures of activity and 
rest. Activity will be measured using the 3 -item Godin's leisure score index 
(LSI),[ADDRESS_111781] will 
be ass essed with the 8 -item PROMIS sleep disturbance short -form.87 
 Efficacy Beliefs . Participants will be asked  after experiencing  their assigned 
intervention how strongl y they believe that it will improve their fatigue and 
depressive symptoms as implemented in another randomized controlled trial 
during chemotherapy95 with adapted items.45 
 Outcome Expectancies (specific).  Using items adapted from other studies, 
participants will be asked how strongly they b elieve that various modalities 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  23 of 52 including moderate physical activity, gentle physical activity (e.g., stretching), a 
mind -body practice, writing, counseling or medication would improve their 
fatigue and mood  during chemotherapy.95 
 Outcome Expectancies (general).  Generalized outcome expectancies will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_101278] -Revised.96 
 
Daily Survey  
 
 Fatigue and Depressive Symptoms (daily) “in the last day”  will be assessed 
with 3  items selected from the PROMIS measures of fatigue and depression 
validated for use in daily diaries.97 
 Psychological Stress (daily) will be assessed with two items from the 4 -item 
PSS90 that would be on the same factor to optimize internal consistency.91 The 
PSS has been successfully applied daily.98  
 Regulation of Psychological Stress (daily)  will be assessed with the [ADDRESS_111782] Schedule -Expanded 
Form.99   
 
Actigraphy (Circadian Disruption - daily)  will be assessed with actigraphy, a non -
intrusive alternative to the traditional polysomnogram when monitoring sleep in 
humans.[ADDRESS_111783]/activity patterns in a natural setting. Circ adian disruption is 
defined as a ratio of nighttime activity to daytime activity with higher scores indicating 
greater circadian disruptions. A similar device and the same ratio has been used in 
patients during chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_111784]  and 
10% of these sessions will be observed to verify treatmen t fidelity.  
 
Intervention Home Practice.  Throughout the intervention, participants will keep daily 
paper logs of their home practice.101 In addition , one item will ask via the daily 
automated survey  how many minutes participants practiced the intervention that day for 
two weeks after completion of the intervention as assessed in another yoga study.51  
 
Adherence.  Percent of all assessments completed and the timeliness of completion will 
be tracked.  
 
Blood draws (Inflammation) . Inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, sTNF -R1, TNF -α) that 
have been associated with fatigue during treatment for gastrointestinal cancer 7 and 
influenced by [CONTACT_101279]61–[ADDRESS_111785]. Nicklas. IL -6 and 
TNF -α will be measured using high -sensitivity Quantikine  immunoassay kits (IL -6: 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  24 of 52 sensitivity=0.10 pg/ml, expected detection range=0 -10.0 pg/ml; TNF -a : sensitivity=0.12 
pg/mL, expected detection range=0 -32.0 pg/ml). In our laboratory, the inter -assay and 
intra-assay CVs for IL -6 are 7.5% and 4.5%, respectively, and for TNF -a are 11.8% a nd 
6.2%%, respectively. IL -1Ra will be measured using standard Quantikine  kits 
(sensitivity=14 pg/ml, expected detection range=0 -3000 pg/ml). All samples will be 
assayed in duplicate and the average of the two measures will be used for data analyses. 
To eliminate variability due to reagent conditions, we will pre -order the same lot number 
for all kits needed for a particular assay. In addition, we run all sample time points from 
individual participants on the same assay plate to reduce intra -assay variatio n. We will 
include an internal laboratory control on each 96 -well plate. To date, inter -assay 
variability in this internal control has been low (CV<15%) in this laboratory, indicating 
that cytokine levels can be measured reliably over time. However, if the  value for this 
control exceeds this 15% range, we will re -run the samples on that plate.    
 
Interview ( Qualitiative Feedback ). A semi -structured interview will also implemented 
after all other data collection is complete to solicit feedback on the accepta bility of data 
collection methods, the participants’ experience with both the interventions (e.g., 
expected efficacy, what was useful), and barriers and facilitators to home practice.   
 
6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
If the patient is interested and referred by [CONTACT_099], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a STM will approach 
the patient at a clinic visit or call the patient at home to explain the protocol, answer 
questions, determine eligibility, and discuss informed consent  (Appendix I: Recruitment 
Script; Appendix J: Recruitment Flyer) . After  making sure the patient clearly understands 
the study procedures and agrees to follow them, the patient will be asked  to sign the 
informed consent form either in person or remotely. If signed remotely, patients will be 
asked to mail or fax the form back to us, as well as bring the original with them to their 
next clinic visit. If consent is obtained via REDCap, an origin al signature [CONTACT_101301]. A copy of the consent form will be given to the participant in 
person the next time they are in clinic, and the original copy will be kept in the 
participant’s file.   
Screening  
Screening evaluations  will begin  once a patient is scheduled for a consultation related to 
receiving first -line chemotherapy for GI cancer s at VICC  or CCC -WFU. The allowable 
range of time for screening is up to one year prior to study entry and baseline assessment. 
Electronic medical records of patients  planning to receive chemotherapy will be reviewed 
by a STM to identify potential patients that meet enrollment criteria. This screening will 
consist of (Appendix K: Eligibility Checklist):  
 Review of medical history  
 Review of tre atment plan  
 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  25 of 52 We will approach patients either in person or remotely (e.g., telephone, m yWake Health) 
regarding their interest in study participation . For patients interested in the study, research 
staff will verify eligibility through patient interview regarding medical history.  
 
6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
Enrollment is defined as the randomization date or as the date all of the screening criteria 
are met and the individual agrees to participate . This  enrollment date will be recorded  
(Appendix L: Protocol Registration  Form ). 
Registration Procedures

Baseline Assessments  
For participants who have successfully been screened for  eligibility and are enrolled into 
the study, baseline assessments will be performed.  
 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  26 of 52 Demographic s.  Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, ability to pay for the 
basics, alcohol/substance use and malnutrition status will be self -reported at baseline.86  
 
Clinical Data.  Cancer type, chemotherapy  regimen, stage of disease, recurrence status, 
receipt of other treatments, days since surgery, height, and weight  will be abstracted from 
medical charts at baseline.  
 
Questionnaire: Fatigue,  Depressive Symptoms, Psychological Stress , Regulation of 
Psychological Stress, Circadian disruption, and Outcome Expectancies   
 
Daily Survey  (weeks 0 -2) will assess baseline Fatigue and Depressive Symptoms (daily), 
Psychological Stress (daily), Regulation of Psychological Stress (daily) , bedtimes and 
rising times  
 
Actigraphy  (weeks 0 -2) will assess baseline circadian disruption (daily)  
 
Blood draws (Inflammation).  Inflammatory cytokines will be assessed  at Week 2  prior 
to starting the intervention.  
 
Randomization  
 
Randomization will occur the same day that screening is confirmed and will precede 
intervention initiation  by [CONTACT_36084] 2 weeks  (corresponding with the timing between 
chemotherapy treatment s 1 and 2).  
 
6.2.3  Blinding  
 Participants will be told that both groups offer programs to support their experience in 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_101249].   
 All STM will know to what arm participants are assigned. The STM collecting 
outcom e assessments will not know which  intervention each arm  letter  represents.  
 A complete description of each study arm will be presented to participants upon their 
completion of  all study measures ( Appendix M: Thank You Letter) . 
6.2.4 Followup  Visits  
Adherence to all assessments completed will be tracked  throughout the data collection 
period . In addition, the following treatment and followup visit assessments will be 
performed.  
 
 Weeks 2, 4, 6  
 Treatment fidelity  Each in -person session will be documented with a checklist . 
 Intervention home practice.  Throughout the intervention, participants will keep 
daily paper logs of their home practice .

6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
The following assessments will be performed the final visit  (Week 14) .  
 Clinical data. Any chemotherapy dose modifications , symptoms related to 
dehydration (e.g., diarrhea) and prescription medications for fatigue, sleep, 
anemia, depressive symptoms, and p ain will be abstracted at follow -up. 
 Questionnaire: Fatigue,  Depressive Symptoms, Psychological Stress, Regulation 
of Psychological Stress, Circadian  disruption  
 Interview (Qualitiative Feedback). A semi -structured interview will be 
implemented  after all other data collection is complete.  
 
Participants who discontinue study the intervention  early  (e.g., due to changes in 
chemotherapy treatment  location , who choose to withdraw participation) will require no 
specific evaluations. The reason for di scontinuation will be documented. We will contact 
[CONTACT_101280] -up data remotely if they discontinue participation due to 
change in treatment location.  Patients terminated from the study will undergo no further 
monitoring once they have sto pped the study intervention.  
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Expected adverse experiences for each study intervention are as follows:  
            Yoga Skills Training  
 Emotional discomfort  
 Muscle soreness  
Active Control  
 Emotional discomfort  
Expected adverse experiences  to the participant related to assessment are as follows:  
Protocol Date  07/15/19  28 of 52  Bruising or minor swelling  
 Emotional  discomfort  
Each interventionist will monitor and note any adverse events experienced during the 
interventions (e.g., patients’ experience of disturbe d breath, expression of 
physical/emotional discomfort, or request to discontinue the in -person intervention 
sessions). In addition, interventionists will ask participants if they experienced any 
problems when doing the home practices and review notes from the home practice logs. 
These logs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_101281] -person session.  
 
If a participant reports a 3 (sometimes) or higher on the item, “I thought about suicide” 
from the standardized PROMIS -Cancer Depressive symptoms short -form , we will 
inform the participant’s oncologist regarding concern for depression and need for further 
evaluation from a mental health specialist (psychiatrist and/or clinical psychologist) 
within 24 hours of receiving the questionnaire (all implemented i n person with the 
exception of the follow -up, which may be returned by [CONTACT_2319]). We will also notify 
oncologists if their patient verbally reports severe depressive symptoms or suicidality 
during the course of the study to research staff.  
 
Two or more advers e events attributable to the interventions will prompt modification of 
the protocol.           
7.[ADDRESS_111787] during chemotherapy  
infusions  at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine  from 08/2009 – 01/2010 .75 There were 
no adverse events observed related to the yoga practice  in this study . From  07/2011 -
01/[ADDRESS_111788] or AC

to the interventions . 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events   
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_111789] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  29 of 52 from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
   
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting 
purposes only.   
 
 Attribution  of the AE:  
 
- Definite – The AE is clearly  related  to the study intervention . 
- Probable – The AE is likely  related  to the study intervention . 
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study intervention . 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study intervention . 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study intervention . 
 
SAEs unequivocally due to disease progression are not considered SAEs for the 
purposes of this study and will not be reported as such.   
Only AEs related to the study interventi on or measures will be captured  with the 
exception of unexpected grade [ADDRESS_111790] on the 
patient. An AE will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the 
patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if 
it causes a substantial disr uption to the patient’s well -being.  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study 
intervention. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely unrelated, definitely related, 
probably related, or possibly related to the study intervention.  
Interventionists will document and report solicited AEs including physical or 
emotional discomfort. STM will also document self -reported ratings of 3 or higher on 
the suicide item from the PROMIS -Cancer Depressive sympt oms measure. No 
additional u nsolicited events will be systematically captured . Research  staff will 
report AEs according to data safety monitoring plan. Events will be documented in 
the ORIS  data entry system including date of event which will avoid double capture.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101250]’s emotional and physical reactions during all regular study meetings 
with the interventionists and offer referrals by [CONTACT_101282] h mentors when 
appropriate.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101251], probably, possibly or unrelated. AEs reports will be distributed to the 
Independent Monitoring Committee ( IMC) electronically via email.   
 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111791] 
been reported to the appropriate agencies (e.g. IRB, NCCIH) and that such reports 
have been made in a timely manner. Non -serious adverse events will be reviewed on 
a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_27904]. The IMC will be notified of serious adverse events 
within 24 hours of occurrence and reviewed within 48 hours.  
 
SAEs that are unanticipated, ser ious, and possibly related to the study intervention 
will be reported to the IMC , IRB, and the National Center for Complementary and 
Integrative Health (NCCIH) by [CONTACT_101283] ( Appendix 
N: Adverse Event Form ). The CC C-WFU Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee 
(STRC) will also review unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 events regardless of their 
attribution . 
 
 Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be 
reported to the NCCIH Program Offic er within 7 days. Other serious and 
unexpected AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the NCCIH 
Program Official within 15 days.  
 Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be 
reported to the Independent Moni tor(s), IRB, NCCIH, and other oversight 
organizations in accordance with their requirements. In the annual AE summary, 
the Independent Monitor(s) Report will state that they have reviewed all AE 
reports.  
7.5 Follow -up for Adverse Events  
AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_101284] [INVESTIGATOR_101252], resolution, and ongoing 
toxicities that may be related to the intervention. Documentation and reporting for 
follow -up AEs will occur according to reporting procedures described in Section 7.4. 
The duration f or follow -up will be for the length of the study period while 
participants are enrolled in the study. If non -serious adverse events are related to the 
interventions, then the protocol will be modified to avoid adverse events. If the 
frequency of non -seriou s adverse events is higher than anticipated or alters the benefit 
risk ratio, the study investigators , after conferring with IMC, will also modify the 
protocol.  Two or more specific adverse events among participants will prompt 
modification of the protoco l.           
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC) for this study is comprised of the 
Wake Forest School of Medicine’s Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
members who have expertise in clinical trial methodology and conduct, biostatistics, 
ethics, and clinical research. The Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
membe rs are not part of the key personnel involved in this grant. They are qualified to 
review the patient safety data generated by [CONTACT_101285], mental health/ethics and statistics.  
Protocol Date  07/15/19  31 of 52 Study progress and s afety will be reviewed quarterly (and more frequently if needed). 
Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be 
provided to the Independent Monitor(s) following each of the quarterly reviews. An 
Annual Report will be  compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In

8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
The intervention will be discontinued for a participant if: (1) the intervention is 
associated with an adverse effect for a specific partic ipant ( i.e., participant  does not 
tolerate the intervention ), (2) the participant  no longer is interested or willing to 
receive the intervention or parti cipate in the study, or (3) the participant’s healthcare 
provider no longer recommends that the patient  receive the intervention for medical 
reasons or (4) the participant no longer receives  chemotherapy  at designated research 
facility. The IMC and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101255].  
This study w ill be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated 
with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty 
in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate th e 
study endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that 
necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur that might warrant 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101256], retention,  or data collection.  
 
Participants will be followed with their permission if the study is discontinued. The

empathic attention control was chosen to contr ol for the non -specific effects of the 
intervention without including any of the proposed active intervention components.  
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111793] ical control via covariate analysis 
would not suffice.  The statistical hypotheses are:  
 
Specific Aim 1 Hypothesis  
 
Primary :  Yoga Skills Training (YST) will demonstrate clinically meaningful 
reduction in  fatigue and depressive symptoms compared to an attention control group.  
 
Fatigue and depression will be measured using  the Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System  (PROMIS) -Cancer  specifically designed for use in 
cancer patients (see Section 9.5 Outcomes).   
 
Secondary: Reductions in fat igue and depressive symptoms will be associated with 
decreases in mediators.  
 
Specific Aim 2 Hypothesis: The YST will show trends for reducing levels and 
variability of daily  fatigue and depressive symptoms to a greater degree than the AC 
and r eductions will be associated with decreases in mediators.  
 
Specific Aim  3: Qualitative data will be used to inform a larger trial.  
9.[ADDRESS_111794]/AC completion  (Week 10)  
are available will comprise efficacy intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis sample.  We used 
the revised CONSORT 2010 guidelines for intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis of 
randomized control trials102  in our sample considerations. Those guidelines dropped 
specific ITT in favor of clear descriptions of exactly who would be (or was) included 
in the analysis per our specification above. We also took into account considerations 
for minimizing missing data  within the context of ITT specified by [CONTACT_101286].[ADDRESS_111795] of the interventions on a one -
month follow -up asse ssment of outcomes and changes in daily assessments of fatigue, 
depressive symptoms, psychological stress, and circadia n disruption. Further 
exploratory (not hypothesis testing) analyses will be conducted with the YST study 
group to examine the association  of dose (i.e., days of in -person sessions completed 
plus days of home practice) , outcome expectations and efficacy beliefs  with changes 
in fatigue, depressive symptoms, psychological stress, circadia n disruption, and 
inflammation.  
Protocol Date  07/15/19  33 of 52 Based on prior longitudi nal work with patients from similar populations, we are 
anticipating  approximately 15% dropout (from N= 44).  From previous research in a 
mixed sample of cancer patients,[ADDRESS_111796] deviation of 8 points 
(Mean t -score=53.6) .  Effect sizes in preliminary studies of yoga for fatigue as 
compared to an active control in patients with cancer range from 0.33 to 1.50.45,104 
This variability may be explained in part by [CONTACT_101287]’ initial levels 
of fatigue.[ADDRESS_111797] these symptoms at their nadir and thus may be more sensitive to such 
phenomena  than recalled measures. Therefore, it is important to obtain a good 
estimate of the variance of fatigue in this group to use in future studies. Power 
calculations for a subsequent larger study will be based on clinically meaningful 
differences between the  groups on the primary outcome using estimates of SD. 
With a sample size of 44, the probability is 0.80 (80% confidence) that the estimate 
of the standard deviation ( SD) will be no more than 10% of the true population SD 
below the true population SD; if th e SD varies by [CONTACT_19313], there is 80% confidence 
that the estimate of the SD is no more than 1 4% below the true SD.  
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Eligible, consented, and enrolled participants will be randomized to YST or AC. To 
control for type and stage of cancer, randomization will occur within both type 
(colon , rectal /other better prognosis GI cancers, poorer prognosis cancers ) and stage 
(localized stages II/III or metastatic stage IV).  There is not a sample size goal within 
strata. Given this relativel y small preliminary study, it was deemed more efficient and 
enabled  tighter control over known influences on outcome to stratify rather than to 
use statistical control via covariate analysis.  The other alternative would have been to 
use only a single type/stage of cancer , which was not feasible due to too few cases at 
VICC  and CCC -WFU. The population of the cancer patients with the types/stages 
selected was sufficient  at VICC  and CCC -WFU to enable randomization  within  thus 
increasing generalizability p otential .  
 
Randomization (1:1) lists within each strata will be generated via a permuted block 
program developed and executed by [CONTACT_101288] 2 and 6. The randomization lists will be held by a staff member  (not 
involved with data collection) who will allocate each participant to study group. STM 
who are collecting data will not be informed of  group assignment.  
9.3  Definition of Populations  
Per out description above, we used the revised CONSORT 2010 guidelines for 
intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis of randomized control trials102 in our sample 
considerations. Those guidelines dropped specific ITT in favor of clear descriptions 
of exactly who would be (or was) included in the analysis per our specification abo ve. 
We also took into account considerations for minimizing missing data within the 
context of ITT specified by [CONTACT_101286].[ADDRESS_111798] incorporated flexible windows for 
the data collection in our protocol and are allowing for possible randomly missing 
interim assessments.  Therefore the population to whom these preliminary efficacy 
Protocol Date  07/15/19  34 of 52 findings will be generalizable to will be that represented by [CONTACT_101289] (see above).  
9.4 Interim Analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101257]. Summaries of process variables (i.e., recruitment, adherence, data 
collection, retention, safety) will be conducted on a rolling basis as the study 
progresses.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101258] (IMC) . We anticipate recruitment on average of 
1-2 patients per month or 18 patients in one year completing enrollment over the next 
30 months.  Fidelity of implementing the interventions  will also evaluated during the 
study period.  If we document fidelity less than 80% during the clinical trial, than 
interventionists  will undergo  further  training with subsequent re -evaluation 
demonstrating sufficient fidelity.  
 
Futility analyses for efficacy or safety will not be conducted in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  SAE’s 
related to the intervention will suspend enrollment and/or the study intervention until 
a safety review is convened (either routine or ad hoc) by [CONTACT_101290], proceed with caution, be further 
investigated, discontinued, or be modified and then proceed. If SAEs  events are 
related to the interventions , then the  relevant intervention  protocol will be modifie d to 
avoid adverse events.  If the frequency of non -serious adverse events is higher than 
anticipated or alters the benefit risk ratio as determined by [CONTACT_101291], the study 
investigators will also modify the  relevant  intervention  protocol. Two or more  
specific adverse events among participants  will prompt modification of the protocol .    
9.5 Outcomes  
The STM collecting outcome data  will be masked to the participant’s intervention 
group assignment .  
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
Fatigue (recalled) “in the past seven days”  will be assessed with the 7-item measure 
of Fatigue from the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System  
(PROMIS) -Cancer  specifically designed for use in cancer patients (item responses: 1 
= never, 5 = always).87,88 This measure was selected for the primary outcome (at 10 
weeks) because it is standardized, validated in people with cancer,  and PROMIS is 
supported by [CONTACT_101292] .89,105 
 
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   
 
Depressive Symptoms (recalled)  will be assessed with the standardized 10-item 
PROMIS -Cancer Depressive symptoms short -form, which was designed to be valid 
for cancer patients.89  
 
Fatigue and Depressive Symptoms (daily) “in the last day”  will be assessed with 3  
items selected from the PROMIS measures of fatigue and depression validated for use 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111799] sensitive to day -to-day changes. Response options 
are the same as in the recalled measures.  
 
Psychological Stress (recalled)  will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 10 -item Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS).90 The PSS has 2 factors (stress and counter stress) and is valid for use 
with cancer patients.91  
 
Psychological Stress (daily) will be assessed with two items from the 4 -item PSS90 
that would be on the same factor to optimize internal consistency.91 The PSS has been 
successfully applied daily.98  
 
Regulation of Psychological Stress (recalled)  will be determined by [CONTACT_101293]92, which assess self -efficacy for 
stress management (α = 0.86), copi[INVESTIGATOR_101248] -related side -effects (α = 0.82), 
accepting cancer/maintaining positive attitude (α = 0.86), and affectiv e regulation (α 
= 0.81).  
 
Regulation of Psychological Stress (daily)  will be assessed with the [ADDRESS_111800] Schedule -Expanded Form.99   
 
Circadian disruption (recalled)  will be assessed with measures of activity and rest. 
Activity will be measured  using the 3 -item Godin's leisure score index (LSI),[ADDRESS_111801] will be assesse d 
with the 8 -item PROMIS sleep disturbance short -form.87 
 
Circadian Disruption (daily)  will be assessed with actigraphy.100 Circadian 
disruption is defined as a ratio of nighttime activity to daytime activity with higher 
scores indicating greater circadi an disruptions.  
 
Inflammation.  Inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL -6, sTNF -R1, TNF -α) that have been 
associated with fatigue during treatment for gastrointestinal cancer 7 and influenced 
by [CONTACT_101279]61–64 will be measured in plasma extracted from whole blood drawn 
during regularly scheduled clinical blood draws .

9.6 Data Analyses   
SAS will be used  for statistical analysis. Graphical and descriptive statistical methods 
will be applied to examine the shapes of study data distributions and need to 
transform, if necessary, for inferential analyses. Per descriptions above, a nalyses will 
be conducted usi ng intention -to-treat principle s as stated in the CONSORT 2010 
guidelines102 and flexible protocol elements to minimize missing outcome data.103 
Missing data are expected to be of two types: 1) nonrandom (death, deterior ating 
condition, or other lost-to-follow -up) and 2) random (inability to make it into the 
clinic for one of the assessment periods). Because fatigue post -intervention is the 
most critical outcome assessment point, the 1st assessment (study entry) and the p ost-
intervention assessment point at Week [ADDRESS_111802] those 
types of missing  data to be random; therefore imputation procedures will not be 
conducted. Maximum Type I error of 0.05 (uncorrected and/or corrected as 
necessary) will be maintained for statistical significance and all analyses will be 
performed in consultation with [CONTACT_101307] . 
Specific Aim 1 . Key statistical tests will involve between group differences in mean 
values and group differences in the patterns (i.e., slopes) of individual changes from 
respective baseline values of the PROMIS fatigue and depressive symptoms scor es. 
These tests will be evaluated using mixed -effects (or multilevel) generalized linear 
modeling procedures with robust variance estimation. Of particular relevance to this 
study, the flexibility of generalized linear modeling allows for analysis of not o nly 
univariate normal error distributions, but also multivariate dependent variable 
distributions and Poisson distributions. Because we expect there to be a correlation 
between fatigue and depressive symptoms, a multivariate approach will provide more 
unified (systemic) statistical tests of the intervention effects. These tests for specific 
effects on single outcome variables tend to be more powerful because standard errors 
are smaller. Our expectation is that there will be group differences in both the pos t-
baseline means and shape (slope) of the outcome variable trajectories of participants 
Protocol Date  07/15/[ADDRESS_111803] fatigue and depressive symptoms (e.g., use of 
methylphenidate), those variables will be adjusted for in the analysis (i.e., included as 
covariates). Analysis of differences in the intervention effect between gender and 
racial/ethnic subgroups will also be performed . Finally, in addition to statistical 
significance test ing of the study and covariate effects in the models, bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_101259] 95% confidence intervals for all sample descriptive 
statistics and effect estimates. Changes in the proposed mediators will be summarized 
and analyzed usin g the same approach as described above. If changes in the proposed 
mediators are observed, exploratory longitudinal path analysis will be conducted to 
investigate the actual level of mediation apparent on fatigue and/or depressive 
symptoms. Further explora tory analyses will examine associations of the dose of the 
YST (i.e., days of in -person sessions completed plus days of home practice) , outcome 
expectations and efficacy beliefs  with fatigue, depressive symptoms, psychological 
stress /regulation of stress , circadian disruption, and inflammation.  
Specific Aim 2 . A critical element of this proposal is the inclusion of daily (vs. 
standard recalled) assessments of fatigue, depressive symptoms and proposed 
mediators, during two 2 -week periods in the study (initia l: 0-2 weeks, later: 8 -10 
weeks). Summaries of the proportion and frequency of missing daily assessments will 
inform the feasibility of collecting this type of data. Graphical displays of these daily 
reports will prove invaluable for informing both the pat terns of the respective 
symptoms and mechanisms in and of themselves, and also for informing the optimal 
representation of the patterns in analyses with the recalled measures. Depending on 
missing data, study group differences in daily (or mean 2 -day) valu es will be 
evaluated using mixed -effects generalized linear modeling. Findings and effect sizes 
garnered from these analyses will be compared to those resulting from recalled 
measures. Informed by [CONTACT_101294], several summary indices of each of the 
two daily assessment periods (peak value, mean, coefficient of variation) will be 
generated for use in multi -method, multi -trait analyses of similarities and differences 
in the patterns of associations among the daily and recalled measures. This analys is 
will further inform which measures (and/or which summary indices) appear to be the 
best and most sensitive indices to use in future studies.  
Specific Aim 3:  Open -ended and interview data will be coded by [CONTACT_101295]. Schlundt  (Collaborator). [CONTACT_101305] will  consult with the Core 
to develop a coding system and also code 10% of the responses to assess reliability. 
Coded responses will be interpreted with a thematic analysis .105 The number of 
participants interviewed (20 -40) will b e decided by [CONTACT_101296].  Qualitative information gained will enrich quantitative results and inform the 
protocol of a larger trial.

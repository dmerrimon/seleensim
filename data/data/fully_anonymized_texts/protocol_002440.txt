7.0 INTRODUCTION
Vilazodone is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibi tor (SSRI ) and a partial agonist of the 
5-hydroxy tryptamine 1A (5- HT 1A) receptor. Vilazodone has greater in vitro potency  for 
serotonin reuptake inhibition than compounds such as fluoxetine (0.2 nM versus 6.0 nM
respectivel y). Vilazodone is more selective for inhibition of serotonin reuptake than for 
dopamine or norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (0.2 nM, 60.0 nM and 90.0 nM, respectivel y). In vitro 
studies also indicate that vilazodone binds with high affinity  and is a more potent agonist 
of 5-HT 1Areceptors compared with specific 5 -HT 1Aligands such as buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], with I C50 
values of 0.5 nM for vilazodone and 30nM for buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331]. A detailed description of the 
pharmacokinetics, chemistry , pharmacology , safety , and efficacy  of vilazod one for the 
treatment of MDD is provided in the US prescribing information (Viibry d®, 2014) and in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (Vilazodone HCl, 2013). Viibry d was approved by  [CONTACT_44730] 21 Jan 2011 . 
Approval for the use of Viibry dfor the treatment of MDD was based on 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], 
Phase 3, 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies in 
adult outpatients with MDD. Vilazodone 40 mg/day  demonstrated superiority  over 
placebo in the improvement of depressive symptoms as measured by  [CONTACT_44731] 8 in the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score 
(Montgomery  and Åsberg, 1979).
MDD is a common and serious illness in children and adolescents. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_44716]  0.3%- 1.4% of preschoolers (2 -5 years of age ) (Egger and Angold, 2006), 
1%-2% of prepubertal children, and between 3% and 8% of adolescents 
(Zalsman et al, 2006). The American Academ yof Child and Adolescent Psy chiatry
(AACAP) consensus ( AACAP ,1998) estimated the cumulative incidence of MDD in 
adolescence b y the age of 18 to be as high as 20%, while 65% report transient, less severe 
depressive s ymptoms. At any  point in time, 1 in ever y 10 children and adolescents are 
affected b y serious emotional disturbances ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration [ SAMHSA], 2009).
The National Comorbidity Survey  – Adolescent Supplement (NCS- A) examines both 
dysthymic disorder and M DDtogether resulting in data showing approximately 11.2% of 
13 to 18 y ear olds in the [LOCATION_002] are affected at some point during their lives and
3.3% have experienced a seriously  debilitating depressive disorder. SAMHSA examines 
the national prevalence of depression each year through the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health (NSDUH). The ir2008 data show an 8.3% prevalence of depression among 
12to 17 year olds in the [LOCATION_002] noting that among 13 to 17 year olds the 
prevalence of depression among girls is nearl y 3 times as high as that for boys . 
Additionally , while a pproximately  4%of 13 y ear olds experience depression, therate 
increases to 11.6 %among [ADDRESS_47081] Research Institute, Inc.

MDD compromises the development process; feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, 
and thoughts of suicide are common. Patients also experience difficulties with 
concentration and motivation. Each y ear as many  as 20% of adolescents have suicidal 
ideation and 9% attempt suicide (Grunbaum, 2002). Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents and is a major public health concern (NAHIC, 2006). A major risk factor for suicide in adolescents is major depression. In its review and met a-analy sis of placebo 
controlled trials assessing use of antidepressant medications among children and adolescents, the FDA concluded that these medications pose an increased risk (4% vs 2%) for suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation, although no suicides were reported 
(Hammad et al, 2006). Subsequently , the FDA mandated a boxed warning be put on the 
labels of all antidepressants indicating an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in youth taking these medications, but did not prohibit their use.
MDD in children and adolescents can be chronic and recurrent. The mean length of pediatric depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_44717]  [ADDRESS_47082] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], up to 40% of patients appear to recover without specific treatment. 
However, patients who do not recover appear to be at high risk of chronic depression, and those who do recover have high rates of recurrence and dy sthymia (Zalsman et al, 2006).
Current drug treatment options for pediatric MDD are very  limited (ie, FDA app roved 
fluoxetine for children and adolescents 8 -18 years of age and escitalopram for 
adolescents 12- 17 years of age ). Therefore, it is important that novel treatment options, 
such as vilazodone, be evaluated s ystematicall y for the treatment of MDD in child ren and 
adolescents to characterize its efficacy  and safety  profile in this population.
To address an unmet need of treating MDD in the pediatric population, th isstudy  of 
vilazodone in children and adolescent patients (7 -17 years of age ) with MDD was agre ed 
upon with the FDA.  Forest Research Institute, Inc.

9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION
Study  VLZ -MD-22 will be a multice nter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- and 
active -controlled, parallel- group, flexible -dose study  in pediatric patients, 7 to 17 yearsof 
age. The stud y will include a total of 9 visits and will be approximately  10weeks in 
duration (Figure 9.1.3–1) : 
1-week screening period 
8-week double -blind treatment period 
1-week double -blind down -taper period 
9.1.1 Screening Period
The screening /washout period will generally  be 1 week prior to Baseline (Visit 2) , but 
may be extended up to a total of 5 weeks to accommodate prior medication washout or to 
repeat assessments ( with prior approval of the Study  Physician or designee ). Patients will 
not receive an y investigational product during the screening period. Patients meeting the 
eligibility  criteria at the end of Baseline ( Visit 2) will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to 
1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, vilazodone, or fluoxet ine. 
9.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period
Approximately  400 patients are planned for enrollment in the double -blind treatment 
period (160 placebo patients, 160vilazodone patients, and 80 fluoxetine patients); 
randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_44732] .

9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE 
OF CONTROL GROUPS
This multicenter, randomized, placebo -and active -controlled, parallel- group, 
flexible -dose study  with an 8-week double -blind treatment was designed based on prior 
studies that established vilazodone efficacy  and safety  in adult patients with MDD .
Additionally , this study  was designed with reference to the FDA Guidance for Industry  
E11 Clinical I nvestigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population . In this 
pediatric stud y, Investigators willenroll pediatric p atients ages 7 through 17 who me t the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision 
(DSM -IV-TR) criteria for MDD. The MDD diagnosis will be confirmed using the Kiddie 
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia –Present and Lifetime
([K-SADS -PL]; Kaufman etal, 1997), a reliable and valid semi- structured interview 
designed to assess current and past epi[INVESTIGATOR_44718] a broad spectrum of ps ychiatric diagnoses through separate 
interviews with the patient and the caregiver. The Children’s Depression Rating Scale 
Revised ( CDRS -R)(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will assess the MDD s ymptoms and severity .
Study  centers will have experience with the study  population and will be encouraged to 
apply  available guidelines to minimize patient risk or distress (See European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) : ICH Topic E 11,Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of 
Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population, January  2001). To ensure accurate MDD 
diagnosis, both the K -SADS -PL and CD RS-R will be administered during the screening 
interviews b y a child ps ychiatrist or doctoral level clinical psychologist , or other clinician 
who has extensive professional training and experience in the diagnosis of mental illnessin pediatric patients .
Dose selection information is presented in Section 9.4.4. The planned titration regimen is 
based on experience from vilazodone studies (Viibry d Package Insert, 2014; 
Study VLZ- MD-21, in progress ). A titration period has been included to reduce the 
possibility  of tolerability  issues that may  accompany  the start of investigational product 
treatment at the dose levels to be studied. The 1-week, double -blind down -taper has been 
included to allow a gradual reduction in the concentration of the investigat ional product
to reduce the likelihood of emergence of discontinuation symptoms.  Forest Research Institute, Inc.

APPROVED 15  Apr 2015Amended Protocol VLZ-MD-22 Amendment 1
A placebo treatment group is included in the study to comply  with worldwide regulatory  
preferences (Laugh ren, 2001; Gispen- de Wied et al , 2012), since placebo -controlled 
superiority  trials have been shown to be conducive to higher quality  studies and to 
provide more reliable outcomes (Feifel, 2008; Laugh ren, 2001; Gispen- de Wied et al, 
2012). Additionally , from a scientific point of view, randomized double- blind 
comparisons ve rsus placebo are needed to permit adequate evaluation of efficacy . 
Comparison to a placebo treatment is also of value for distinguishing disease 
manifestations from adverse reactions of the investigational product (EMA guidance ,
2013). The use of placebo in place of the standard therap y (fluoxetine) should not cause 
irreversible health problems or extreme suffering (depression is recognized by  [CONTACT_44733] a condition in which there is substantial improvement and variability  in placebo 
groups) (FDA Guidance for Industry : E10, May 2001 ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Eve nts
An adverse event ( AE)is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with thistreatment .An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding, for 
example), sy mptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A) .
For the purpos e ofthe site’s data collection responsibilities, a ny untoward event that was 
reported from the time the I CF was signed until [ADDRESS_47097] (if the final visit does not 
occur) isto be considered an AE.
Examples of AE sare as follows :
Changes in the general condition of the patient
Subjecti ve sy mptoms offered by  [CONTACT_44742]
Objective signs observed by  [CONTACT_44743] r study  center personnel
All diseases that occur after signing inform consent , including an y change in severity 
or frequency  of preexisting disease
All clinically  relevant abnormalities in laboratory  values or clinicall y relevant 
physical findings that occ ur during the stud yschedule 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page [ADDRESS_47098] be given to AEs that were identified in the adult MDD 
vilazodone program: nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and weight loss.
Please note medical procedure sscheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the 
study  should not be capture das AEs , but should be listed in the medical history  if related 
to a pre -existing condition .
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment
For each AE, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the 
invest igational product. The causality  assessment must be recorded on the appropriate AE 
reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by [CONTACT_44744]:Is there a reasonable possibility  the investigation alproduct caused the event?
Yes:There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and AE , ie: 
○ There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product 
and the event, and /or
○The event is unlikel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent disease, other 
investigational products, or other factors, and/or
○Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist
No:There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and AE, ie :
○ There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product 
and the event, or
○The patient did not take the investigational product, o r
○The event is likel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent disease, other 
investigational products, or other factors, or
○The event is commonl y occurring in the (stud y) population independent of

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results i n death
Is life threatening
Requires i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapa city, or
Is a c ongenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44719], based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may  jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], orthe development of investigat ional product dependency  or drug abuse.

reporting.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patient s are to be queried regarding any  AEs or SAEs that have occurred 
since the previous visit. Patient s will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading 
question such as, “How do y ou feel since your last visit ?” Study  center personnel will 
record all pertinent information in the patient ’s eCRF . 
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF
whether or not they  are considered causally  related to the investigational product.
For every  AE, the Investigator must:
Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the eve nt (ie, is it an SAE ?), as well as 
the severit y and ca usal relationship
Document all actions taken with regard to the investigational product
Detail an y other treatment measures taken for the AE
Document the outcome of the AE
In addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the I CF and in accordance with 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], to notify  site personnel of an y AEs occurring durin g the 30 day poststudy  
period. Any AEs reported by [CONTACT_102] (or patient representative) during this period are 
to be recorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the eCRF if at 
least one of the following conditions is met: 1) the event meets the criteria for an SAE 
(see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]), and/or 2) the event is judged b y the Investigator to be 
potentially  causally  related to investigational product.
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol- defined stud y visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestud y status, has resolved or stabilized, or can 
be explained as being unrelated to the investigational product. If a follow -up visit is

summarized by  [CONTACT_44747].
Scree n failures (i e, patients who were screened but not included in the Randomized 
Population) and the associated reasons for failure will be tabulated overall. Patients 
completing 8 weeks of double- blind treatment ( Baseline through Week 8 [ Visits 2 - 8] ) 
will be considered completers. The number and percentage of patients who complete the 
double -blind treatment period and of patients who prematurel y discontinue during the 
same period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment 
groups. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the double -blind treatment 
period as recorded on the termination pages of the eCRF will be summarized (number 
and percentage) b y treatment group for the Safety  Population . The percentage of 
premature disconti nuations will be compared overall and for each discontinuation reason

Demographic parameters (eg , age, race, ethnicit y, sex, weight, height, body mass index ) 
and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by  [CONTACT_44748] y 
and ITT Populations. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and 
maximum) will be presented for continuous variables, and frequency  distributions 
(count s and percentages) will be presented for categorical variables.
Comparability  among treatment groups will be tested using a two -way 
analysis-of-variance model, with treatment group and study  center as the factors for 
continuous variables and the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel test, controlling for study  center, 
for categorical variables.

otherwise.
For efficacy  analy ses in which study  center is a factor, a small center will be defined as a 
center with < 2 patients in ≥ 1 treatment group in the ITT Population . Small centers will 
be pooled to form pseudo -centers so that each treatment group includes ≥ 2ITT patients 
within the center. Pooling will be done using the following algorithm: Based on the number of ITT patients, small centers will be ordered from the largest to the 
smallest, and centers of the same size will be ordered from the largest center code to the 
smallest center code. The pooling process starts with the largest small center from the top, which will be pooled with the smallest from the bottom until a non- small center is 
formed. The process will be repeated using the small centers left out after the first pass. If 
any centers are left out at the end of the process, they  will be pooled with the smallest 
pseudo- center. If there is >[ADDRESS_47105] non- small center. If there 
is >[ADDRESS_47106] center code will b e selected.
By-visit anal ysis based on the mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
using the observed case approach will be performed for all continuous efficacy  
parameters with multiple postbaseline measurements.
In addition, by -visit analy ses using the last- observation -carried- forward (LOCF) 
approach will be presented for all efficacy  parameters. For the LOCF approach, onl y the 
postbaseline total score of a parameter will be imputed using the LOCF approach; individual item scores will not be carr ied forward. Baseline total score will be carried 
forward only  for the intermittent missing scores immediately  after baseline. If all the 
postbaseline values are missing, the baseline value will not be carried forward . Forest Research Institute, Inc.

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Parameter
The change from baseline to Week 8 of the double -blind treatment period in CDRS -R 
total score will be the primary  efficacy  parameter. The primary  anal ysis for comparing 
vilazodone versus placebo will be performed with treatment group, pooled study  center, 
visit, and treatment group–by -visit interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value 
and baseline value -by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance 
matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -patient scores. The Kenward -Roger 
approximation ( Kenward and Roger, 1997) will be used to estimate denominator degrees 
of freedom. This anal ysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using onl y 
the observed cases without imputation of missing values.
In addition, 2 sensitivity analyses, LOCF and pattern-mixture model approaches, will be 
performed on the primary efficacy parameter. The LOCF approach is based on an 
analysis-of-covariance model including treatment group and pooled study  center as 
factors and baseline CDRS -R total score as a covariate.
The other sensitivity  analy sis using a pattern -mixture model based on nonfuture 
dependent missing value restrictions (Kenward et al, 2003) will be performed to assess 
the robustness of the primary  MMRM results to the possible violation of the 
missing -at-random assumption. The details of this sensitivity  anal yses are as follows:
The pattern for the pattern -mixture model will be d efined b y the patient’s last visit with 
observed value. The observed CDRS -R total score at a visit is assumed to have a linear 
relationship with the patient’s prior measurements. The missing values will be imputed under the assumption that the distribution of a missing observation differs from the 
observed onl y by a shift parameter value Δ. The dataset with missing values will be 
analyzed using an analysis-of-covariance model with treatment group and pooled study  
center as factors and baseline CDRS -R total score as a covariate for between -treatment 
group comparisons at Week 8. The imputation of missing values and the analy sis will be 
performed multiple times and the inference of this sensitivity  anal ysis will be based on 
the combined estimates using the stan dard multiple imputation technique. The values for 
Δ will be selected as 0 to 6 based on experience with historical data.
The comparison of fluoxetine v ersus placebo will be performed to assess study  assay  
sensitivity .

9.7.6 Safety Analyses
The safet y analysis will be performed for the double -blind treatment period and 
double -blind down -taper period separatel y using the Safet y Population. The safet y 
parameters will include AEs, clinical laboratory  parameters, vital sign measurements, 
ECG parameters
, C-SSRS evaluations, and the change from baseline in the age and 
gender -adjusted height (evaluation of growth). For each safet y parameter, the last 
assessment made before the first dose of double -blind investigational product will be 
used as the baseline for all analy ses of that safety  parameter .

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
An AE (classified b y preferred term) that occur s during the double- blind treatment period 
or during the double -blind down -taper period will be considered a treatment- emergent
adverse event ( TEAE )if it was not present before the date of the first dose of 
double -blind investigational product or was present before the date of the first dose of 
double -blind investigational product andincreased in severity  during the double -blind 
treatment period or during the double -blind down -taper period, respectivel y. If more than 
1AE is reported before the date of the first dose of double -blind investigational product 
and coded to the same prefer red term, the AE with the greatest severit y will be used as 
the benchmark for comparison with the AEs occurring during the double -blind treatment 
period or during the double -blind down -taper period that were also coded to that 
preferred term . An AE that oc curs more than [ADDRESS_47108] will not be counted as a TEAE.
An AE occurring during the double -blind down -taper period will be considered a newl y 
emergent AE if it is not present before the start of the double -blind down -taper period or 
was present before the start of the double -blind down -taper period but increased in 
severit y during the double -blind down -taper period. The newl y emergent AEs during the 
double -blind down -taper period will be summarized by  [CONTACT_44749], preferred term, and 
treatment group.
The number and percentage of patient s reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be 
tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term; by  [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term, and severity ; and by  [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and causal relationship to 
the investigational product. If more than [ADDRESS_47109] will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570].
The incidence of common ( ≥ 2% of patient s in any  treatment group) TEAEs during the 
double -blind treatment period will be summarized separately  by [CONTACT_11702], and 
treatment group .

[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Product Plasma Concentration Parameters and 
Exposure -Response Evaluation
Vilazodone plasma concentration data will be used to estimate population PK parameters, 
inter-patient, and residual variability  using nonlinear mixed -effects modeling software. 
The study  will be prospectively  powered to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the 
geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for vilazodone, with at 
least 80% power. The effect of covariates on the vilazodone pharmacokinetics will also 
be inves tigated. The maximum plasma drug concentration , area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve , time of maximum plasma drug concentration, half -life, 
apparent oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution for vilazodone will be determined and a summary  (mean, median) will be reported. Vilazodone PK data will be 
used to support the evaluation of a potential exposure/dose- response relationship. The 
analysis results will be provided in a separate report.

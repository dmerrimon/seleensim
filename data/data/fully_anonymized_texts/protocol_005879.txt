CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   Double- blind, Randomized, Multicenter, Placebo-c ontrolled, Parallel Group Study to 
Characterize the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of 24 Weeks of Evolocumab for Low Density 
Lipoprotein-c holesterol (LDL- C) Reduction, as Add-o n to Diet and Lipid-l owering Therapy, in 
Pediatric Subjects 10 to 17 Years of Age With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)  
Study Phase:   3b 
Indication:  Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in pediatric subjects  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the effect of 24 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) evolocumab 
compared with placebo, when added to standard of care, on percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH.  
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:   to assess the effects of SC evolocumab compared with 
placebo, when added to standard of care, on mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 and change from baseline to week 24 in LDL- C, and on percent change from baseline to 
week 24 in non- high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (no n-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), total 
cholesterol/HDL- C ratio, and ApoB/Apolipoprotein A -1 (ApoA1) ratio, in pediatric subjects 10 to 
17 years of age with HeFH  
Secondary Safety Objectives:   to evaluate the safety of SC evolocumab compared with 
placebo, when added to standard of care, in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH  
Secondary  Pharmacokinetic Objective:   to characterize pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure 
Hypotheses:   The primary hypothesis is that SC evolocumab will be well tolerated  and will result 
in greater reduction of LDL- C, defined as percent change from baseline to week 24, compared 
with placebo, when added to standard of care in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH.  
Primary Endpoint:  Percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C 
Secondary E ndpoints : 
• Mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 in LDL-C 
• change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C 
• percent change from baseline to week 24 in the following:  
− non-HDL-C 
− ApoB  
− total cholesterol/HDL- C ratio 
− ApoB/Apo A1 ratio  
Study Design: This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo- controlled, double- blind, parallel group 
study.  Subjects are eligible for screening if they are [ADDRESS_20836] met the local applicable diagnostic criteria for HeFH.  Subjects considered for enrollment will undergo screening assessments, including laboratory screening by [CONTACT_12115].  Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of QM evolocumab or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_6594]- C 
(< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL) and age (< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years).  
The study includes collection of biomarker development samples.  Where permitted by [CONTACT_427], subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetic analyses.  
After completion of Study 20120123, subjects will be offered to participate in an extension study where they will receive open- label evolocumab.  
Sample Size:   Approximately [ADDRESS_20837]:  Evolocumab

parental/guardian consent must be available.  Subjects must be on a low -fat diet and must 
receive optimized background lipid- lowering therapy which includes a statin at optimal dose as  
determined by [CONTACT_21909][INVESTIGATOR_871] .  
Lipid -lowering therapy must be stable for ≥ [ADDRESS_20840] be 
≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4  mmol/L) and fasting triglycerides must be ≤ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) as 
determined by [CONTACT_21910].  
The following are the major exclusion criteria: homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,  
type 1 diabet
es or recently diagnosed (within 3 months of randomization) or poorly contr olled 
(HbA1c > 8.5%) type 2 diabetes  or newly diagnosed impaired glucose tolerance; thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) < lower limit of normal (LLN) or TSH >  1.5x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and free thyroxine (T4) levels that are outside normal range, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <  30 ml/min/1.73m

(ALT) > 2x ULN, creatine kinase (CK) >  3x ULN (all screening by [CONTACT_12115]); known 
active infection, or major hematologic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine dysfunction .  
Subjects are excluded if they have taken any cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in the last [ADDRESS_20841]  previously received evolocumab or any other investigational therapy to 
inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).  Subjects cannot be enrolled in 
another investi
gational device or drug study, receive other investigational agent(s) or procedures, 
or be within less than [ADDRESS_20842] be willing to use acceptable method(s) of effective contraception  during treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo) and for an additional 15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo).  
For a full lis
t of eligibility cr iteria, please refer to Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_20843] Dosage and Administration:  Evolocumab and placebo are 
[COMPANY_010] investigational product (IP).  IP will be administered SC using a spring- based prefilled 
autoinjector/pen (prefilled AI/Pen) .  Each prefilled AI/Pen will contain 1.[ADDRESS_20844] Dosage and Administration:  Subjects will continue 
to use stable background lipid- lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21852].  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21853].  
Procedures:   Subjects being considered for participation in this study, and who have signed 
informed consent  or subject assent, will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Medical 
and medication history will be obtained.  Subjects will undergo screening assessments, including 
a SC administration of placebo to evaluate tolerability of the SC injection via the prefilled AI/pen.  
Lipid eligibility screening must be conducted after the subject has been on a low -fat diet and 
receiving lipid lowering therapy that includes an optimal dose of a statin not requiring uptitration in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_21854] ≥ 4 weeks.  Subjects should maintain their 
diet, lipid -lowering therapy, and exercise regimen unchanged throughout screening and all 
phases of study participation.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive IP (evolocumab or 
placebo), in addition to their background lipid lowering therapy.  An interactive voice response 
system and/or interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS) will allocate subjects to administration of investigational product.  Day [ADDRESS_20845].  Subsequent study visits are at weeks  4, 12, 20, 22, and 24 (EOS, 
end-of-study).  Day [ADDRESS_20846]:  Evolocumab

at week 20.   Subjects who discontinue IP early for any reason will be asked to continue to return 
for all other study procedures and measurements until the end of the study.  
Assessments and procedures include vital signs, adverse events /serious adverse 
events /adverse device effects (ADE) /disease related events(DRE) /cardiovascular (CV) 
events , and concomitant therapy, dietary instruction, physical exam  including neurologic 
examination  and assessment of  waist circumference, body height and weight, 12- lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], chemistry, hematology, anti -evolocumab antibodies, 
biomarker sample collection, serum pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential), urinalysis, assessment of growth and pubertal development (Tanner staging), Cogstate neurocognitive assessment,  carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT), and IP administration.  In 
addition, specific laboratory assessments will be performed,  including  estradiol for girls, 
testosterone for boys, creatinine phosphokinase, follicle- stimulating hormone, luteinizing 
hormone, adenocorticotropic hormone, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119], and cortisol.  If the subject consented to pharmacogenetics analyses, DNA will be extracted from some of the blood 
samples.  IP administration by [CONTACT_10530], if applicable, will be done after all other procedures have been completed.   
For a full description of procedures, please refer to Section 7. 
Statistical Considerations:   
General Considerations  
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all 
randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of IP.  
The superiority of evolocumab to placebo will be assessed for all efficacy endpoints.  
Methods of adjusting for multiplicity due to multiple endpoints are provided in Section 10.5.1  
Events of death, myocardial infarction (MI), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929], coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21855] (CEC). Subject incidence of exploratory endpoint events will be summarized for each treatment group.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
To assess the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in LDL- C at week 24, a repeated 
measures linear mixed effects model will be used to compare the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. Missing values will not be imputed when the repeated measures linear mixed effects model is used.   
Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The statistical model for the secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar to  the primary endpoint.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety summaries will include the subject incidence of adverse events, summaries of laboratory parameters, vital signs, and anti -evolocumab antibodies.   
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC) will formally review the accumulating data 
from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  Analyses  for the DMC will be provided by a group 
which is external to [COMPANY_010].

CONFIDENTIAL    2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Hypercholesterolemia and the Pediatr
ic Population  
Hypercholesterolemia (elevated serum low -density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL- C]) is an 
established risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in humans ( Grundy et al, 2004), 
and more  than 50 million patients are treated for hypercholesterolemia in the United 
States and Europe ( Kuklina  et al, 2011 ; Kotseva et al, 2009; Tolonen et al, 2005).  
Cholesterol elevations requiring pharmacologic therapy are uncommon in children.  
However, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an almost exclusively 
autosomal dominant condition most often resulting from deficient or defective LDLR function ( Rader et al, 2003), have elevated LDL- C beginning in childhood.  Since FH is a 
gene tic condition, the prevalence among children is very similar to the p revalence 
among younger adults.  
In the pediatric population, FH may be identified by [CONTACT_21913]- C 
and a positive family history of hypercholesterolemia and/or premature cardiovascular disease.  HeFH affects approximately one out of every 200 to 500 people worldwide (National Collaborating Centre, 2008;  Nordestgaard et al, 2013;  Rader et al, 2003).  By 
[CONTACT_2163],  homozygous FH ( HoFH ) is present in approximately 1 in 1,000,000 
individuals ( Goldstein et al, 2001).  Without treatment, these patients have severe 
hypercholesterolemia, develop premature coronary artery disease, and are at increased risk for premature cardiovascular death ( Rader et al, 2003 ). 
In the adult population, hydroxymethylglutaryl -coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase 
inhibitors (statins) are currently the treatment of choice for both heterozygous FH 
patients and homozygous FH patients ( Grundy et al, 2004 ), as statins inhibi t 
endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis and upregulate LDLR expression (increasing the 
activity of functional LDLR) ( Rader et al, 2003).  Although statins reduce mortality in this 
patient population ( Raal et al, 2011), cholesterol levels may remain elevated in FH 
patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_21857], exercise, and medications .  
Pediatric guidelines in the [LOCATION_002] ( Daniels and Greer, 2008;  
McCrindle et al, 2007;  Kavey et al, 2006) recommend considering pharmacologic

of age with LDL -C that is : 
 ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) for the highest risk (eg, diabetes mellitus)  
 ≥ 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L) for intermediate risk (eg, ≥  2 other CHD risk factors, 
family history of prem ature coronary artery disease [ CAD]) 
 ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) for the lowest risk (no cardiovascular risk factors)  
Similarly, treatment guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European 
Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS; Reiner et al, 2011) and from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE;  National Collaborating Centre, 2008) recommend 
statin treatment in patients who are ≥ [ADDRESS_20866] HeFH or HoFH , and 
consider pharmacologic treatment for subjects with HoFH at earlier ages (Reiner  et al, 2011).  When a child with FH has exceptionally high LDL- C and/or 
cardiovascular risk , bile  acid sequestrants and ezetimibe are also indicated and may be 
used in combination.  
Thus, while currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21858]- C levels, novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21859]-C would be valuable for both adults and pediatric patients with severely elevated 
cholesterol levels.

2.2.1  Background and Nonclinical Studies  
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface low -density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a 
critical role in regulating serum LDL- C levels.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 
type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the LDLR and d own regulates  hepatic cell surface LDLR, 
which, in turn, leads to increased levels of circulating LDL- C.  Humans with PCSK9 
loss-of-function mutations have cholesterol levels lower than normal and reduced 
incidence of CHD ( Abifadel et al, 2009 ).  Evolocumab (formerly referred to as AMG 145) 
is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2), developed at [COMPANY_010] Inc., that 
specifically binds to PCSK9 preventing its interaction with the LDLR.  The inhibition of 
PCSK9 by [CONTACT_21914]- C. 
Evolocumab binds to human, cynomolgus monkey, and hamster PCSK9 with a similar high affinity (dissociation equilibrium constant [ K
D] = 16, 8, and 14  pM, respectively)  and

CONFIDENTIAL    is pharmacologically active in both animal species.  Evolocumab exhibited nonlinear PK 
consistent with target -mediated elimination and a low volume of distribution (V ss/F) 
indicating limited tissue distribution.  A concentration- response relationship was 
observed between serum unbound evolocumab, free PCSK9, and LDL- C. 
Evolocumab- related effects were limited to expected pharmacology (serum LDL- C and 
total cholesterol lowering).  Toxicological assessments included repeated dose studies in the hamster and cynomolgus monkey (up to 3- and 6- months, respectively) at 
evolocumab dose levels up to 300 mg/kg, a [ADDRESS_20868] been filed in 
several jurisdictions, including to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in the United 
States and to the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) in Europe .  The submissions are 
based on a phase 3 program which evaluated evolocumab administered every tw o 
weeks and monthly in various treatment settings (ie, in combination with statins, 
statin -intolerant, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] or as an adjunct to 
diet [monotherapy]).  Additional studies with evolocumab are ongoing or planned, including studies to provide additional long- term safety and efficacy data,  studies  to 
determine the effect of evolocumab on coronary atherosclerosis,  and studies  to evaluate 
the effects of evolocumab on lipoprotein metabolism.   The FOURIER trial is a large 
cardiovascular outcomes trial  that is ongoing.  
The combined PK data including phase 1, [ADDRESS_20869] consistently show n that 
evolocumab displays approximately dose- proportional increases in exposure for 
repeated dose regimens ≥  140 mg SC. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies explored LDL- C and unbound PCSK9 responses after 
administration of a wide range of SC doses and dosing frequencies.  With the [ADDRESS_20870]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 19 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    once every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 420 mg QM (once monthly) regimens, maximal LDL- C 
reduction was observed at 1 week or 2  weeks following administration, respectively, and 
returned towards baseline at the end of the dosing interval. 
A side -by-side analysis of efficacy across the individual phase 3 primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_21860] 
140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM:  
• Evolocumab was superior to placebo in reducing LDL- C (approximately 55% to 75% 
compared with placebo), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), non -high density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non- HDL-C), total cholesterol /high -density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL- C), and ApoB/apolipoprotein A1(ApoA1) very low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL- C), triglycerides, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and increasing 
HDL-C and ApoA1.  
• Evolocumab reduced LDL- C as early as week 1 following administration, generally 
achieved maximal response within 1 to 2 weeks after dosing with 140  mg Q2W and 
420 mg QM, respectively, and maintained efficacy with long -term use.  
• Reductions in LDL- C and improvements in other lipid parameters were reversible 
upon cessation of treatment, with no evidence of rebound.  
• Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM dosing regimens were clinically 
equivalent; no clinically meaningful differences, with respect to reductions in LDL- C 
and improvements in other lipid parameters, were noted between the 2 doses.  
• Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM dosing regimens were effective in all subgroups relative to placebo and ezetimibe with no notable differences observed 
among subgroups (ie, age, race, gender, region, body mass index, current smoking 
status, baseline CHD risk factors, family history of premature CHD, glucose tolerance status [diabetes mellitus type 2, metabolic syndrome, or neither], 
hypertension, unbound baseline PCSK9, baseline LDL- C, baseline triglycerides, and 
National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] , 2002 high risk status).  
• Administration of evolocumab with the prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen) was shown 
to be safe and effective for its intended use and the conditions of use,  including 
self-administration in the home- use setting.  
The results of the analyses conducted in the primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (heterozygous 
familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_21861]:  
• In the integrated parent studies, the most common ( ≥ 2%) adverse events in the 
combined evolocumab group or control group were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], headache, back pain, and myalgia.  Common adverse 
events in the year  [ADDRESS_20871] of care (SoC) -controlled period did not include 
headache and myalgia; otherwise, common adverse events were the same as integrated parent studies with the addition of arthralgia and hypertension.  There 
were no additional common adverse events during the year 2+ open- label ex tension 
(OLE) period.

CONFIDENTIAL    • The types and incidence of adverse events were consistent across studies where 
evolocumab was given as monotherapy, in combination therapy with statins (with or 
without ezetimibe) or in subjects with statin intolerance.  
• Most  adverse events were grade 1 or  2. 
• Serious adverse events, deaths, positively adjudicated clinical events, and adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of investigational product (IP) were infrequently 
repor ted and similar across treatment groups.  
• No safety issues were detected for adverse events of interest associated with other 
lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, diabetes adverse events, liver-related adverse  events, 
muscle- related adverse  events , neurocognitive adverse events) and those that could 
theoretically be associated with PCSK9 inhibition/LDL- C receptor upregulation (ie, 
hepatitis C events).   No cognitive adverse events have been reported among 
adolescents in the completed Study 20110233 or in the ongoing open- label 
evolocumab- only Study 20110271. 
• The device- related adverse events from the 3 SC presentations (ie, pre-filled syringe 
[PFS] , prefilled AI/pen, and automated mini doser [ AMD ]) were uncommon, mostly 
grade 1, and generally limited to injection site reactions.  
• An evaluation of vitamin E data showed that long- term evolocumab exposure 
(52 weeks) did not change normalized vitamin E levels, regardless of LDL -C 
concentration.  Similarly, long- term evolocumab exposure (52 weeks) did not affect 
steroid hormone levels (cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle -stimulating 
hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, or estradiol), regardless of LDL- C 
concentration.  
• The type and incidence of adverse events observed in subjects with LDL- C 
concentrations < 25  mg/dL (< 0.6 mmol/L) and < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) were 
similar to those observed in subjects with LDL- C concentrations ≥ 40 mg/dL  
(≥ 1.0 mmol/L) .  In particular, no safety signal was identified for neurocognitive 
adverse events, vitamin E levels, or steroid analytes based on LDL- C concentrations.  
• Presence of anti -evolocumab antibodies was infrequent, non- neutralizing, and not 
associated with clinically relevant adverse events.  
Refer to the AMG 145 Investigators Brochure  for additional information re garding the 
clinical experience with evolocumab.  
2.3 Pediatric Risk Assessment  
Loss -of-function (LOF) mutations of the PCSK9 gene are associated with low serum 
LDL-C levels ( ≤ 100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]) (Cohen et al, 2005).  Subjects with 
heterozygous PCSK9 LOF mutations exhibit lower serum PCSK9 levels and as much as 
88% reduction in the incidence of CHD over a 15- year period compared with noncarriers 
of the mutations ( Cohen et al, 2006).  Importantly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_21862]9 and 
associated very low serum LDL -C levels (<  20 mg/dL [0.5  mmol/L]), 2  subjects with 
LOF mutations in both PCSK9 alleles appear healthy ( Hooper et al, 2007; Zhao 2006).

CONFIDENTIAL    The subjects in this study are a pediatric population.  In [COMPANY_010]’s development program 
for evolocumab, [ADDRESS_20872] included pediatric subjects along with adults.  The completed Study 20110233 was a phase 2/3 study of subjects 12 to 80 years of age with HoFH; Part A of Study 20110233 was an open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] 8 subjects and 
Part B of Study 20110233 was a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study of 
49 subjects ( Raal et al., 2014) .  The ongoing Study 20110271 is a phase 2/3, 
multicenter, open -label study of evolocumab  in approximately 310  subjects 12 to 
80 years of age with severe FH . 
To date, 15 subjects <  [ADDRESS_20873] been 
enrolled in Studies 20110233 and 20110271; [ADDRESS_20874] HoFH.  Per protocol, the non- apheresis subjects (n=10) began 
the study on 420 mg QM, while the apheresis subjects (n=4) began the study on [ADDRESS_20875] incidences of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were 71% and 14% among adolescents, compared to 68% and 10% among all subjects with HoFH.  Average exposure to evolocumab was longer among adolesc ents, median 11.[ADDRESS_20876] been reported in Study 20110271.  All but 2 of these events were deemed non-serious and were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
grade 1 or 2.  The 2 serious adverse events (worsening of chest pain and occlusive 
coronary artery disease) were both CTCAE grade 3 and unrelated to IP, and are both known cardiovascular consequences of the subjects’ underlying FH.  No serious adverse events were deemed by [CONTACT_21915]. 
The dose of 420 mg evolocumab SC was selected based on pharmacokinetic modeling 
for this pediatric age group (Section 2.4) and is supported by [CONTACT_21916] [ADDRESS_20877], the subjects in this study wi ll be monitored for the 
development of anti- evolocumab antibodies.  To date, the overall immunogenicity rate is 
< 1% and the formation of neutralizing anti -evolocumab antibodies has not been 
observed.

pediatric population. 
2.4 Rationale  
FH is a genetic disorder which typi[INVESTIGATOR_21863], sometimes beginning 
in childhood.  It is therefore important to study the safety and efficacy of potential treatments for FH in children and adolescents.  Because developmental processes that are complete in adults are ongoing in children and adolescents, additional safety assessments (eg, biochemical and clinical assessments of puberty, carotid intimal medial thickness, and cognition) are also appropriate.  Data from a dedicated randomized placebo- controlled study of evolocumab and adolescents will support the 
existing data from nonclinical studies in ages corresponding to human adolescence and 
clinical data from adolescent subjects participating in the TESLA and TAUSSIG studies.  
The safety and efficacy of evolocumab [ADDRESS_20878] 
included pediatric subjects (TESLA and TAUSSIG), evolocumab lowered LDL- C and 
other lipid parameters in subjects aged 12- 17 years.  The percent change from baseline 
in LDL -C has been chosen as the primary assessment for this study because of the 
extensive body of data from interventional studies and epi[INVESTIGATOR_21864] a strong causal relationship between serum LDL cholesterol, and the risk of CHD.  These data also support  the relationship with other clinical manifestations of 
atherosclerosis such as cerebrovascular disease (stroke) or peripheral vascular disease.  These relationships are present over a broad range of LDL- C levels.  Additionally, 
current guidelines focus on LDL- C as a target for  therapy.  
Non-HDL cholesterol (non- HDL-C), ApoB, the ratio of total  cholesterol/HDL- C, the ratio 
of ApoB/ApoA1, and Lp(a) have been included as secondary efficacy endpoints because these markers are known as useful markers of cardiovascular risk under cert ain 
circumstances and because they may be employed as future targets for lipid lowering therapy.  
Additional endpoints include triglycerides and HDL- C because data in adults 
demonstrates lowering of triglycerides and raising of HDL- C with evolocumab.  In 
addition, triglycerides and HDL- C are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
(Austin et al, 1998 ; Sarwar et al, 2007).

CONFIDENTIAL    Pharmacokinetic data from the 2 studies with evolocumab that included adults as well as 
pediatric subjects age 12 years and older (Studies 20110233 and 20110271) show that 
exposure among pediatric  subjects  is comparable to that seen in adults of similar weight .  
Further pharmacokinetic modeling to predict the optimal dosing regimen for pediatric 
subjects [ADDRESS_20879] met the local applicable diagnostic criteria for HeFH.  Subjects 
considered for enrollment will undergo screening assessments, including laboratory screening by [CONTACT_12115].  Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of QM evolocumab or placebo.

distributed using [COMPANY_010] clinical IP distribution procedures.  Evolocumab will be 
presented as a sterile, preservative- free solution in a single use, disposable, handheld 
mechanical (spring -based) prefilled autoinjector/pen ( AI/Pen) for fixed dose, 
SC injection.  The prefilled AI/Pen contains a 1.0 mL deliverable volume of 140 mg/mL 
evolocumab or 1.0 mL deliverable volume of placebo.  
IP (e volocumab or placebo) should be stored refrigerated and protected from light 
according to the storage and expi[INVESTIGATOR_21865] (where 
required).   IP should be handled per the instructions provided in the IPIM and the 
Instructions for Use (IFU) for the prefilled AI/Pen.  
The prefilled AI/Pen should be inspected for IP quality, expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061], and damage before 
using.   Damaged, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], or degraded product should not be used and any issues with 
the prefilled AI/Pen should be reported to [COMPANY_010].   Further details are provided in the 
IPIM and IFU.  
6.2.1  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
IP (evolocumab or matching placebo) will be administered SC in accordance with 
instructions in the IPIM and IFU.  IP administration by [CONTACT_21932] a study visit must occur after vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood draw procedures, if applicable.  After IP administration at the first dosing visit, subjects will be held for observation for at least [ADDRESS_20900] of 3 injections of 140 mg evolocumab or placebo in 1. 0 mL (administration by [CONTACT_21933]/Pen) for a total of 3.0 mL (placebo or 
420 mg evolocumab) administered.  
In this study, subjects have the option of self -administration, defined as 
SC administration of IP by [CONTACT_423], designee or a qualified health c are professional in 
a non- investigator site setting (eg, at home).  The subject (or designee, if not a qualified 
healthcare professional) must have demonstrated competency at administration of SC injections before self -administration is permitted.  T he fir st self -administered dose by

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures  
This is a multi- center, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial.  The study 
consists of 2 periods:  
• screening period 
• double- blind treatment period 
All on -study visits and dosing should be scheduled from study day 1.  Day  [ADDRESS_20915] diurnal 
variation.  The week 4 visit is 4 weeks after the study day 1 visit, corresponding to study 
day 29.  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the 
visit should  be performed within ± 3 days  (visit window ± 3 days) .  If a study visit is 
missed or late, including visits outside the visit window, subsequent visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  With the exception of screening and rescreen visits, all study procedures for a visit must be completed on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all procedures are performed according to the protocol.  Written informed consent must be obtained and will be 
implemented before protocol specific procedures are carried out.  The risks and benefits 
of participating in the study will be verbally explained to each potential subject prior to 
entering into the study.  The procedures to be performed at each study site visit are described below and the timing of the procedures is provided in  Table  1.  If IP is 
administered during a study visit, administration must be after completion of vital signs, ECG, and blood draw procedures, as applicable.  
Subjects must be fasting for  ≥ [ADDRESS_20916] is not fasting when presenting at the study site for a visit, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section 7.2.2  below.  
All screening and on -study laboratory s

[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening Placebo Administration  
In order to reduce the burden of unnecessary procedures on subjects who subsequently elect not to participate in the study or continue with study procedures, all subjects will undergo a placebo administration to confirm tolerance of SC administration by [CONTACT_21943].  This placebo administration can be done before or after screening venipuncture procedures but must be done before randomization.  The 
screening placebo administration consists of 1 injection of 1.0 mL placebo, using 1 prefilled AI/Pen  device.  This administration is following the same procedures as 
injections of IP during the treatment period.  Further details are provided in the IPIM.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period:  
• confir mation that the informed consent  and subject assent, if applicable,  has been 
signed  
• demographic data including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to 
study their possible association with treatment effectiveness, subject safety, or, f or 
example, to further study biomarker variability  
• medical history  
• vital signs (sitting blood pressure [ BP], heart rate [HR]; see  Section 7.7.1 ) 
• review for adverse events /serious adverse events /ADE (adverse events  possibly 
related to study procedures and serious adverse events  are collected during 
screening)

conditions:  
o ever injected illegal drugs  
o were exposed to blood known to be infected with HCV  
o were ever on chronic hemodialysis  
o are known to be infected with HIV  
o have a known HCV -infected sexual partner  
• the subject will be instructed to maintain his/her current diet throughout the course of 
the study and avoid going on any strict diet or aiming to lose weight during the study  
• screening placebo injection as per Section [IP_ADDRESS] ; includes instruction/training on 
AI/Pen device use  
• randomization, if eligible (on or as close as possible to Day 1; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
* Please note that subjects with ALT or AST >  2x ULN must be screen failed unless the 
elevation is transient as confirmed by [CONTACT_21942] [IP_ADDRESS] . 
If a fasting sample could not be obtained at the initial screening visit and the other 
screening laboratory assessments confirm eligibility for the study, fasting lipid and 
glucose s amples to determine eligibility must be obtained before randomization. 
All prohibited lipid lowering therapy (see  Section 4.1.2  and Section 6.9) must be 
discontinued ≥ 4 weeks before screening laboratories are taken or as indicated in 
Section 4.1.2  and/or Section 6.9, whichever is longer .

CONFIDENTIAL    [IP_ADDRESS]  Retesting  
If, in the investigator’s judgment, lab abnormalities  are likely to be trans ient, (eg , subject 
participated in vigorous exercise and CK is elevated immediately afterwards), laboratory 
tests can be repeated.  Triglycerides, CK, and liver function and other laboratory values, except LDL- C, can be retested at any time during screening as long as the subject can 
be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed screening period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening  
Subjects with any LDL-C < 130 mg/dL (3.4  mmol/L) during screening are considered 
screen failures and cannot be rescreened for this study.  Suitable subjects who are 
ineligible at the initial screening for other reasons and have not been randomized can be 
re-consented and rescreened at a later time unless they withdraw from screening.  For 
subjects who are rescreened, data from the first screening period will not be used for the analysis.  
With the exception of the screening placebo injection, rescreened subjects who are re-consented will repeat all screening procedures.  Rescreened subjects will maintain 
the originally assigned subject identification number . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screen Fail  
Subjects who fail any of the eligibility criteria during screening or rescreening and have not been randomized need to be screen failed in IVRS/I WRS before they can be 
re-consented and re- registered in IVRS/IWRS for rescreening.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_20923] administration of IP will be recorded in IVRS/IWRS and will determine the schedule of subsequent study visits.

respective visit.  
The following procedures will be completed during the 24 week treatment period at the 
times designated in  the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ): 
• vital signs (sitting BP, HR; see Section 7.7.1 ) 
• review for adverse events /serious adverse events /ADE/DRE /CV events  
• review of concomitant therapy  
• encourage subject to maintain a stable diet  
• physical examination (including neurologic examination; see Section 7.7.8 ) 
• body weight and waist circumference (see Section 7.7.2 ) 
• body height  
• Cogstate neurocognitive assessment  (see Section 7.7.7 ) 
• 12-lead ECG in triplicate using centralized ECG services equipment  
• blood draw for fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (≥  9 hour fasting sample), ApoA1, A poB, chemistry, 
hematology, PK,  high sensitivity C- react
ive protein ( hsCRP ), CK, FSH, LH,

anti-evolocumab antibodies, and viral load in subjects positive for HCV  
• cIMT  
• Tanner staging 
• urine sample for u
rinalysis  
• pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential  (serum at screening and 
EOS; urine at other time points)  
• IP administration at the study site (must be after completion of vital  signs, ECG, and 
blood draw procedures, if applicable)  
• dispense AI/Pen device with instructions for use  
No additional blood will be collected for the pharmacogenetics analyses.  For subjects who have consented to t he pharmacogenetic  portion of this study,  DNA will be extracted 
from blood samples already collected on day 1 or another visit (see Section 7.5 
“Pharmacogenetic Studies” and  Section 7.6 “Sample Storage and Destruction”). 
If a subject withdraws from the study early, all efforts should be made to  complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  If 
possible, the procedures of week [ADDRESS_20925]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  [ADDRESS_20926] samples assayed for binding and, if positive, 
neutralizing antibodies. Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune  complexes. Sites will be notified of any positive  
neutralizing antibody results to evolocumab. If results are not provided, no neutralizing antibodies to evolocumab have been detected.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti- evolocumab antibodies during the study. Subjects who test 
positive for neutralizing antibodies to evolocumab at the final scheduled study visit will 
be asked to return for additional follow -up testing. This testing should occur 
approximately every 3 months starting from when the site has been notified of the 
positive result, until: (1) neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the 
subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year (± 4 weeks). More frequent testing (eg, every month) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns. Follow -up testing will not be required where it is 
established that the subject did not receive evolocumab. All follow -up results, both 
positive and negative will be communicated to the sites. Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clinical sequelae that are considered 
potentially related to an anti -evolocumab antibody response may also be asked to return 
for additional follow -up testing. 
7.4 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  
It is expected that further advances will occur in the future  in investiga
 tional techniques 
that look at markers of  
  It is not po
ssible at this stage to anticipate what these 
advances will be;
 however, considerable benefit could accrue to future sufferers of 
coronary artery disease if these markers can be correlated with the data from the study.  It is also important to clarify any potential drug interactions in this population of subjects who will be on a number of other drugs.  For biomarker analysis 14.[ADDRESS_20927]:  Evolocumab

analyses may
 be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetics analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations such as those of the  gene or t
he LDLR gene to 
evaluate their
 possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21876].  The goals of the optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular disease, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_21877]/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to 
evolocumab.  No additional blood will be collected for this analysis.  For subjects who have consented to the pharmacogenetic portion of this study,  DNA will be extracted from 
blood samples already collected.  Subjects can participate in the main trial irrespective of whether they do or do not consent to the pharmacogenetic portion of the study . 
7.6 Sample Stor
age and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment s (Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of th e tests out lined in  the protocol and for any tes ts necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality . 
If permitted by [CONTACT_21945],  [COMPANY_010] can  do 
additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and 
better understand processes related to

antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg,  mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and 
maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be 
retained for up to [ADDRESS_20929]’s medical record and are not be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent . 
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the samples can be located and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commerc ial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See Section 11.[ADDRESS_20930]’s arms unless a concomitant condition favors the use of a particular arm.

Height and weight measurement will be obtained at the time points specified in 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ).  If possible, visits with height and weight 
measurements should be scheduled at a similar time of day (eg, in the morning).  Height is measured to the nearest centimeter with the subject’s back against a 
wall.  Use of a stadiometer is preferred and recommended.  Height is defined as 
the maximum distance from the floor to the highest point on the head, when the subject is facing directly ahead.  Shoes must be off, feet together, and arms by [CONTACT_21948].  Head, upper back, buttocks, and heels should be i n contact [CONTACT_21949].  Two  (2) measurements of height should be taken 
at each timepoint and entered into the CRF.  Weight is to be measured to the 
nearest tenth of a kilogram with the subject wearing light clothing and with shoes removed.  A properly calibrated digital scale should be used.  The scale should weigh in 0.[ADDRESS_20933]:  Evolocumab

7.7.3  Tanner Staging (Sexual Maturity Ratings)  
Tanner s taging is widely used to assess adolescents’ physical development duri ng 
puberty in 5 stages (from preadolescent to adult). Also known as Sexual Maturity 
Ratings (SMRs) , Tanner s tages  are a way of assessing the degree of maturation of 
secondary sexual characteristics (see  Appendix  D for guidance).  The developmental 
stages of the adolescent’s sexual characteristics will be rated and recorded separately 
(ie, one stage for pubic hair and one for breasts in females, one stage for pubic hair and one for genitals in males), because these characteristics may differ in their degree of maturity.  
7.7.4  Carotid I ntima -Media Thickness (cIMT)  
Carotid intima -media thickness will be measured by [CONTACT_21950] 7.1.  Sonograms will be sent to a core 
laboratory for analysis.  Please refer to the cIMT instruction manual for de tailed 
information on acquiring, storing, and transmitting the sonograms.  
7.7.5  Electrocardiograms  
At each scheduled visit where ECGs are being obtained ECGs will be performed in a standardized method, in triplicate, and run consecutively (ie, <  30 seconds apart ), prior 
to blood draws or other invasive procedures.  Using equipment supplied to each site, all protocol -specified ECGs will be acquired and transmitted to the centralized ECG 
services provider.  The Principal investigator ( PI) or designated physician wi ll review 
acquired ECGs.  One (1) signed, original ECG tracing should be retained with the subject’s source documents.  At the request of the sponsor, the original ECG should be 
made available to [COMPANY_010] to be manually read by a central reader.  
The centralized ECG services cardiologists will perform standard interpretations of all 
tracings.  A cardiologist reviewed ECG report will be provided to the study site.  Investigators must initial and date the ECG reports upon receipt.  If the investigator’s interpret ation of any protocol -specified or unscheduled ECG differs from that supplied by 
[CONTACT_21951], it is the responsibility of the investigator to make the final clinical decisions.  The investigator’s interpretation does not need to be reconciled with that supplied by [CONTACT_21952].  Any clinical interventions based on these results need to be documented in the appropriate source documents 
and eCRF as applicable.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain additional

Further detail about the equipment provided and its use for this study will be provided in an Investigator ECG Manual distributed to the sites before start of enrollment.  
7.7.6  Lipid Measurements  
Only the screening LDL- C concentration will be reported to the site for the eligibility 
decision.   Central laboratory results of the lipid panel, as well as ApoA1, ApoB, 
lipoprotein(a) , fasting vitamin s A, D, E,  and K,  and  will be blinded 
post-treatment until unblinding of the clinical database and will not be reported to the 
investigator post -screening.  In addition, investigators and staff involved with this trial 
and all medical staff involved in the subject’s medical care should refrain from obtaining 
lipid panels from randomization until at least [ADDRESS_20936]’s last 
administration of IP or until the subject ends the study, whichever is later (to avoid potential unblinding).   If a lipid panel is drawn, all reasonable steps must be undertaken 
to avoid informing the subject and study personnel of the results.  
7.7.[ADDRESS_20937] of the following 
4 tests:  
• Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT; Executive Function): The Groton Maze Learning 
task is a  measure of problem solving and reasoning and uses a well -validated maze 
learning paradigm.  In this task, the subject is shown a [ADDRESS_20938] is hidden among these 100 possible locations.  
Each box represents move locations, and the grid refers to the box array (ie, 10 × 10).  Subjects are required to find the hidden pathway guided by 4 search rules.  These rules are: do not move diagonally, do not move more than 1 box (ie, do not 
jump), do not move back on the pathway, and return to the last correct location after 
an error.  At each step, only the most recently selected box is shown.  Feedback is given with visual and auditory cues (green check marks and red crosses) to indicate 
whether the selected box is correct or incorrect.  The head of path, or the last correct location, flashes with a green check when two errors are made in succession (failing 
to return errors).  There are [ADDRESS_20939] move.  
• One Card Learning Test (OCL; Visual Memory): The One Card Learning test is a measure of visual recognition memory and uses a well -validated pattern separation 
paradigm using card stimuli.   In this test, the cards are similar  to those found in a 
deck of playing cards.  The subject is asked whether the card currently being 
presented in the center of the screen was seen previously in this test.  The subject 
responds by [CONTACT_21953].  Because no card has been presented yet, 
the first response is always No.

CONFIDENTIAL    • Identification Test (IDN; Attention/Vigilance): The Identification test is a measure of 
visual attention and uses a well -validated choice reaction time paradigm using card 
stimuli.  In this test, the playing cards are all either red or black.  The subject is asked 
whether the card currently being presented in the center of the screen is red.  The 
subject responds by [CONTACT_21954].  
• Detection Test (DET; Psychomotor Speed): The Detection test is a measure of 
information processing speed and uses a well -validated simple reaction time 
paradigm using card stimuli.  In this test, the playing cards are all red and black.  The 
subject is asked to press the Yes key as soon as  the card in the center of the screen 
flips over.  
This battery will be administered 3 times during the study: during screening, on study 
Day 1 (baseline), and at Week 24 (EOS).  Completion of this test battery will take approximately [ADDRESS_20940] been used to examine the potential adverse effects o f mobile

(Kral et al, 2012) , dietary patterns in adolescents (Nyaradi  et al, 2014) , and in ute ro 
exposure to cocaine ( Mayes et al, 2007) .  The Cogstate tests have also been used to 
examine the cognitive effects of treatment with stimulant medication in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) ([Mollica et al, 2004 ]: 8 to 12 year olds; 
[Snyder et al, 2008 ]: 6 to 16 year olds), as well as the effects of computerized cognitive 
rehabilitation in pediatric cerebral malaria survivors as young as 5 years old 
[Bangirana et al, 2009]. 
Additionally, regulatory authorities have approved the use of Cogstate tests for monitoring and evaluating the safety of central nervous system  penetrant drugs in a 
range of pediatric indications, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], neurogenic detrusor over- activity, 
bipolar depression, schizophrenia, and hyponatr emia , and in children as young as

Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their  future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21880] .  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21881] t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ) and 
collection of data, including endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must 
document the change to the Schedule of A ssessments  (Table  1) and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] ( eg, in person, by [CONTACT_21955]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). 
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The investigator should 
ask the subject’s consent to perform the procedures listed under the final study visit.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and /or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 53 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than  would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more  
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or 
involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while 
on study, is not considered an adverse event. 
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from  insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884], refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_20945] 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event 
as defined in Section  9.1.3– below) : 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event is to be reported as a serious adverse event if:    
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the invest igator 
would consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a subject  with the same underlying condition, or  
• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the 
investigational medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21886] , 
• and the event meets at least [ADDRESS_20946]:  Evolocumab

Date:  01 September 2015  Page 54 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.1.3  Definition of Disease -related Events 
Disease -related events are events (serious or non -serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  In this study, such events include atherosclerosis (especially of the coronary arteries) and its complications.  Examples 
include manifestations of myocardial ischemia such as chest pain and myocardial 
infarction, and percutaneous and surgical revascularization procedures.  Such events do 
not meet the definition of an adverse event unless assessed to be more severe than 
expected f or the subject’s condition or if the investigator believes there is a causal 
relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol 
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21887]. 
Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study 
(eg, disease progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21888]) is to be reported as a Disease Related Event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally 
be expected for the subject, or if the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol 
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21887], this must be reported as an Adverse 
Event or Serious Adverse Event.

The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or sy mptoms),  
• dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• severity  
• assessment of relatedness to investigational product ( evolocumab or placebo or the

• action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the most current version of the National 
Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) 
grading scal e.  The grading scale used in this study is referenced in Appendix  A. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to I P

The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,

adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.  
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases f or the purposes of expedited reporting.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the Serious Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.   See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  If the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.

The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility .  If the severity of a serious adverse event worsens from the date of onset 
to the date of resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_20951] be consistent with that recorded on the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse Event eCRF).  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  Investigators 
will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice .

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of IP.  This analysis set will be used in both efficacy and safety analyses.  In 
efficacy analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment 
group assignment.  For safety analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment group assignment with the following exception: if a subject receives treatment throughout the study that is different than the randomized treatment group assignment, then the subject will be grouped by [CONTACT_21961] g roup.  The 
completer analysis set (CAS) includes subjects in the FAS who adhered to the scheduled IP regimen and have an observed value for the primary endpoint.  
10.1.3  Baseline Covariates and Subgroups  
The following baseline covariates may be used for subgroup or covariate analyses with the subgroups as specified or in their original format:  
• age (< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years)  
• sex  
• LDL-C by [CONTACT_12115] (< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL)

Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Section 5.2 and Section 9.2.2 ). 
Individual subject treatment assignments will be maintained by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS. Any unplanned unblinding occurring during the study period will be documented and reported 
in the final clinical study report. 
The independent DMC members and Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG) will have 
access to treatment assignments and subject level data from  the clinical trial database.  
[COMPANY_010] staff members who are involved in randomization, biological sample management,  performing PK, and anti -evolocumab antibody assay analysis will have 
treatment assignment information but will not have access to subject level data from the clinical trial database. 
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
An external independent DMC has been established to formally review the accumulating 
data from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  The independent DMC is 
chaired by [CONTACT_21962][INVESTIGATOR_21890]. 
Analyses for the DMC are provided by [CONTACT_21963] (IBG), which is external to [COMPANY_010].  Details are provided in the DMC charter.  
10.4.2  Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis of this study will be conducted when the study is completed.  At that time, the database will be cleaned, processed and locked; the study will also be unblinded. Unless specified otherwise, the FAS will be the default analysis set in this 
study and data will be summarized by [CONTACT_21964].

variables, the frequency and percentage will be given.  
Methods of handling missing data for efficacy endpoints will be described throughout this section.   Missing data will not be imputed for safety endpoints.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Method  
To preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05, multiplicity adjustment for the multiple endpoints (primary and secondary efficacy endpoints as enumerated in section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
will be performed using sequential gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_21891] (Hochberg,  1988 ) as follows:  
• If the treatment effect from the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is 
significant at a significance level of 0.05, statistical testing of the secondary 
efficacy endpoint
1 and endpoint2 will proceed using the sequential procedure with 
a significance level of 0.05 (ie, secondary endpoint2 will be tested only if 
secondary endpoint1 is statistically significant at 0.05 significance level).  
• If the treatment effect from secondary endpoint2 is significant at a significance 
level of 0.05, statistical testing of the secondary endpoints3 will follow the 
Hochberg procedure at a significance level of 0.05.  
Unless specified otherwise, all other hypothesis testing will be 2- sided with a significance 
level of 0.05.  
10.5.[ADDRESS_20959] is the difference in mean percent change from 
baseline in LDL- C at week 24 regardless of treatment adherence for subjects in 
FAS.  A repeated measures linear effects model will be used to compare the efficacy of 
evolocumab with placebo.  The repeated  measures model will include terms for 
treatment group, stratification factor  (as appropriate), scheduled visit and the interaction 
of treatment with scheduled visit.  Missing values will not be imputed when the repeated 
measures linear effects model is us ed.  The analysis will use LDL -C values measured 
regardless of treatment adherence.

CONFIDENTIAL    Sensitivity Analysis 
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
as follows:  
• The primary analysis will be repeated using the CAS  
• Non-parametric analyses (Quade test)  
• To evaluate the impact of missing values, a sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who, discontinued IP and have missing endpoint 
data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted using 
multiple imputation  
The difference between the number of randomized subjects and the number of subjects in the FAS will also be assessed and reported in the Clinical Study 
Report .

reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of discovery or 
notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations have been concluded).    
Cases with  
AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_20979] (if baseline ALT or AST is ≤ [ADDRESS_20980])  
AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_20981] (if baseline ALT or AST is ≤ [ADDRESS_20982])  
are to be reported as adverse events.  
The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed and 
sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse events if  they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_20983](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21897]/are withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Sections 6.5.[ADDRESS_20984] or ALT elevations > 3x ULN (if

abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.    
The following evaluations are to be performed during this period:    
1. Repeat liver tests AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR as clinically 
necessary until laboratory abnormalities improve .    
2. Obtain pediatric gastroenterologist or pediatric hepatologist consult.  
The diagnostic approach (including blood tests) to investigate alternative causes for abnormal liver tests is to be determined in consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist.  
The “close observation” is to continue until all laboratory abnormalities return to bas eline 
or normalize and subject’s clinical condition improves.

ABSTRACT  
 
Delirium occurrence rates for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215773] 29 -64%.  Although 30 -50% of 
delirium is preventable, it frequently goes unrecognized until acute and potentially devastating.  The 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167047] (HELP) is a multidimensional c linical strategy that is effective in 
preventing delirium, but labor intensive.  This randomized controlled study will test an innovative 
method to implement the HELP approach:  a tablet -based digital avatar that can see, hear, and talk with 
a patient usin g speech -to-text technology.  The avatar platform has already been validated at Jamaica 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905] a previous study in 2016: “GeriJoy: The Use of an Avatar Virtual Service Animal to 
Improve Outcomes in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215774] ” as well as in multiple pub lished studies to effectively 
provide psychosocial support to older adults across varied clinical settings . This  study will focus on 
discerning the relative impact of implementing HELP through this technology. Participants aged 65+ 
will be randomly assigne d to receive one of the following interventions in addition to usual care 
throughout their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: 1) an avatar delivering HELP protocols and socialization; or 2) no 
intervention beyond usual care. Participants will be assessed by [CONTACT_093] s upon admission to the 
study and reassessed upon 24 -hour discharge notification using the Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire (SPMSQ) , Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, and Short CAM (Confusion 
Assessment Method ).  Based on patient medical record s of sedation, restraints  and incidence of falls and 
delirium, pre - and post -assessment scores will be compared using paired t -tests to determine outcomes 
among the groups.  If the avatar is effective in improving outcomes by [CONTACT_215790], 
the number of patients who benefit from HELP could increase greatly due to technology -enabled cost 
efficiencies, and protocol and data collection standardization across many sites.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Specific aims/hypotheses  
 
For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84360], will the use of an avatar delivering HELP protocols…  
1. decrease delirium incidence and severity,  
2. decrease falls and falls with injury,  
..more than usual care?  
 
Background and significance  
 
Delirium strikes more than 5 people every minute, totaling over 2.6 million people annually in the U.S. (U. S. 
Department of Health & Human Services, 2011).  It is under -recognized, leading to inappropriate use of 
sedation, sitters, and even restraints in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (Adams & Kaplow, 2013; Harding, 2010).  Deliriu m 
contributes to falls, cognitive decline, disability, morbidity, and mortality, increasing health care costs over 
$164 billion a year (Inouye, Westendorp, & Saczynski, 2014; Labella, Merel & Phelan, 2011; Leslie & Inouye, 
2011).  Delirium can also initiat e a “cascade of events” leading to an overall decline in function and 
independence (Fong, Tulebaev, & Inouye, 2009).  These risks are greatest among older patients with limited 
English comprehension, low health literacy, and socioeconomic disadvantage (Tow , et al, 2016). Acute 
delirium may become chronic and have serious permanent sequelae (Fong, Tulebaev, & Inouye, 2009).  
 
HELP is based on a geriatric assessment and integrates trained volunteers with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215775]’ individual needs.  The protocols target delirium risk factors including orientation, 
activities, mobilization, vision, hearing, hydration, nutrition, and natural sleep. Use of the tailored protocols is 
tracked daily for quality assurance.  HELP i s used in more than 200 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215776], 
cognitive and functional decline, falls, sitter use, institutionalization, and reduces length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
(Inouye, Bogardus, Baker, et al., 2000; Rubin, Williams, Lescisin, et al, 2006 ; Rubin, Neal, Fenlon, et al., 
2011).  Although HELP is cost effective, it requires extensive training and monitoring of a large team of 
volunteers, which can deter adoption, especially in safety net facilities that serve patients at highest risk (Rubin, 
Neal, Fenlon, 2011; Caplan & Harper, 2007).    
This study will measure the effectiveness of implementing a subset of the HELP protocols using a novel type of 
relational agent, which is a technological entity capable of building social relationships with pat ients (Wang & 
Osborne, 2017). The relational agent platform, called “care.coach,” is provided by a [LOCATION_004] -based company 
founded by [CONTACT_215791], and has been shown in multiple 
published studies to effective ly provide psychosocial support through conversation and socialization with older 
adults in varied clinical settings (Machesney, Wexler, Chen & Coppola, 2014; Demiris, Thompson, Lazar & 
Lin, 2016; Chi, Demiris, Thompson, Lazar & Lin, 2016; Wexler, Drury& P ollak, 2016; Wexler, Drury & 
Pollak, 2017a; Wexler, Drury & Pollak, 2017b; Wang, Luxenberg & Morey, 2016; Chi, Sparks, Lin, Lazar & 
Thompson, in press). Uniquely, the relational agent is embodied as an animated animal displayed on a tablet 
device. This “av atar” represents a real -time fusion of human and software intelligence, powered by a live, 24x7 
staff of health advocates who see, hear, and speak with each patient through the avatar, and who are guided by 
[CONTACT_215792]. Because the team is distributed across the world, they can 
cost-effectively provide unlimited compassionate psychosocial support, conversation in English and Spanish, 
and supervision: typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], when used for inpatient care, 1 -6 hours/patient of direct  attention, depending on 
patient need/risk, across 60 -80 “check -ins” per 24 hours.  
A study was conducted at JHMC in 2016 which enrolled 95 patients, of which half had a care.coach avatar.  
Patients were enrolled from 3 inpatient medical -surgical units.  Th e avatar was used as a social conversational 
agent.  The study found that patients who had the avatar experienced less delirium, less loneliness and 
experienced fewer falls (Wexler, Drury, Pollak, Scher, Iovino, Narducci, & Wang, in press).  
Unlike common digital assistants such as Apple’s Siri that are limited by [CONTACT_215793], the care.coach avatar connects one human being to 
 another through an engaging animated dog or cat tha t responds to touch and demonstrates emotions appropriate 
to the conversation or other interaction state, e.g. through facial expressions, bodily reaction to touch, heart 
symbols, tears, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], snoring, etc. Conversations and observations about the pati ent’s state are automatically 
recorded and referenced in future interactions, providing both continuity in the growing relationship and quality 
control in the delivery of clinical protocols.  In addition to conversation, the avatar can also display photos,  play 
music, and read or pray with the patient.  The staff undergo extensive non -medical training and for this study 
will also complete the HELP online training for volunteers.  
The software system guiding the staff can be programmed to deliver complex set s of protocols, and has 
previously been used to implement coaching programs for managing multiple chronic conditions at home 
(Wang, Luxenberg & Morey, 2016), as well as in our prior exploratory work for preventing falls (e.g. through 
frequent toileting che cks) and delirium (e.g. through simple re -orientation tasks) in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For this study, 
the system will be programmed to deliver a robust suite of adapted HELP volunteer protocols including re -
orientation, vision/hearing aid checks, hydration and me al consumption encouragement, cognition and attention 
assessment for early delirium detection, and so on, including an automatic guidance and triage protocol for 
when to phone the nurses station (e.g. if a bed -bound patient is getting out of bed or tugging  on IV lines).  
If the avatar is effective in improving outcomes by [CONTACT_215790], the number of patients who 
benefit from HELP could increase greatly due to 1) the low cost and ease of deployment of the avatar platform, 
not only enabling hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_215777] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_215778]/outcomes data by [CONTACT_215794] -enabled variant, but also enabling 
existing HELP sites to easily expand coverage to nights and week ends, and to additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215779], and 2) the ability of the avatar to standardize best practices and automate data collection and reporting 
(e.g. all survey instruments can be administered by [CONTACT_215795]), enabling large scale, hig hly consistent data 
aggregation and outcomes reporting across many such HELP sites.)   
Study design:  This randomized controlled trial will compare outcomes on delirium, falls, sitter utilization 
(1:1’s) and restraints between the two study groups: HELP -protocolized avatars, and usual care . Each day of 
the study, enrollment of subjects will pro ceed with randomization of each subject between groups (the 
randomization primarily effects delirium data, which is assessed by [CONTACT_1130]) until there are no mor e available 
intervention devices . However,  falls and other unit-level groupi[INVESTIGATOR_215780]-randomized (see below).  
 
Sample Size: A total of 3,650  patients (avatar and usual care) are expected to be enrolled  at JHMC over the 
course of two years , based on an estimated average length of stay of 4 days.  
 
Study Units:  Patients will be recruited from the following units at JHMC: 3S, 3N, 4S, IMCU, 5N, 6S, and 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] . Because the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215781]/reports unit-by-unit quarterly falls data , we will take the following 
measures to ensure that falls data collected for study purposes are a valid indicator of possible intervention 
effect:  
• There are expected to be protocol and technical adaptation s made during the first quarter of the study, 
and the study will not begin enrolling subjects exactly at the start of a calendar quarter . There fore, the 
first calendar  quarter of f alls data is not intended to provide useful data regarding unit -level falls 
outcomes , and enrollment of patients may be performed on select units by [CONTACT_215796].  
• Starting on the first day  of the first full calendar quarter , a unit-equitable enrollment  protocol will be 
implemented in which one or more of the study units at any time may be formally designated  for active 
subject enro llment , and such designated study units will have their enrollment numbers  monitored  and 
rounding adjusted as needed  to ensure that , on average , each designated unit receives a  similar number 
of intervention patients at any time.  Which units are designated or not designated for enrollment may be 
changed at the start of ea ch calendar quarter to compare the effect of the intervention and to control  for 
annual changes  in fall rates . Research assistants will not enroll any patients on units not design ated for 
enrollment, but will continue to round currently enrolled patients until they are dis -enrolled.  
 
 Sample inclusion and exclusion criteria:  All pa tients over age [ADDRESS_259529] a proxy who can provide informed consent will be assessed by [CONTACT_473]. Those 
who consent will be  randomly assigned to one of the two  treatment conditions unless the y meet any of the 
exclusion criteria: a.) aggression or combativeness with intent to harm self or others, b.) alcohol or drug 
withdrawal, c.) severe hearing impairment and simultaneous severe vision impairment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_215782], d.) cannot verbali ze fluently  in either Spanish or English , e). on 1:1 ;if a study subject is put on 1:1 
during the duration of the study, he/she will be unenrolled from the study , f) expected to be discharged within 
the next [ADDRESS_259530] -intervention:  
1. Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire  
2. Short CAM (Confusion Assessment Method)  – also conducted during each daily  round  
3. Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale  – if CAM screens posi tive 
 
Statistical analyses:  Demographic variables including age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and living 
arrangements will be collected to determine equivalency of study groups.  Pre -and post -assessment scores will 
be compared using paired t -tests to compare means at baseline and at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215783], and 
between groups.  All data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, 
Inc. Chicago, IL).  Statistical significance will be defined as p ≤ 0.05.  
  
 Additional Informati on 
Photos of Avatar  
 
Figure D.8.1 : A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215784] a photo. A “fisheye lens” mounted to the top of the avatar device enables wide -angle visual 
monitoring, to enable appropriate reaction by [CONTACT_215797]’s facial and body language 
cues, but also any dangerous unassisted transfers, tugging on IV lines, etc. To help with re -orientation, the 
window behind the avatar reflects the actual weather report, and the lighting of the avatar’s env ironment 
reflects day or night status. A video showing  the patient talking to the avatar and singing along is available at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfWjazOmKUk  
 
Figure D.8.2: The avatar is available in dog or cat form, depending on patient preference. Patients name [CONTACT_215802]. On the left, the dog avatar is showing a photo from a web -based Family 
Portal, which helps with engageme nt and reminiscence.  
  

 Avatar Staff Training  
The health advocates who staff the avatar system must each complete the following screening mechanisms and 
training certifications  (or their equivalent  as deemed by [CONTACT_215798].coach , as specific training courses and providers 
become outdated/ available  from time -to-time), through several online learning platforms, over the course of 
approximately 65 hours:  
1. care.coach psychometric, technical, skills -based & face -to-face interview assessment  
2. InfoCubic interna tional background check  
3. Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario delirium, dementia and depression course  
4. National Institutes of Health privacy & ethics course for human subjects research  
5. Partners Healthcare basic motivational interviewing class  
6. care.coac h technology, patient support, information security, and job shadowing training  
The qualification process is very stringent, and the proportion of health advocate job applicants who 
successfully complete all the required certifications and are hired is onl y about 1%. Health advocates also 
receive ongoing training and professional development after hiring, including programs such as the 
Alzheimer’s Association dementia care course (essentiALZ®).  
For the proposed project, each health advocate will also comple te the HELP volunteer training, and a one -hour 
module using resources from the A merican Delirium Society  and A merican Nurses Association . 
 
Clarification Regarding Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  (DSMP)  
In reference to the  DSMP , under the physical risk mitigation  section , the spi[INVESTIGATOR_215785], but as of  December 28, 2018, we are aware of the following 
minor technical  and practical  issues that affect the details of implementing the described mitigation techniques:  
• The voice recording that plays automatically when a device is unplugged is standardized to say that the 
device is an important healthcare tool that needs to be kept plugged in to power , but the comment abou t 
“the device must be sanitized before placing it back into its designated storage cabinet ” may instead be 
implemented with the following variations:  
o The reminder to sanitize the device may be performed by [CONTACT_215799]-
enrollment and/or enrollment protocol , combined with a visual reminder on a label on each 
device.  
o For many technical and practical reasons, the  avatar is now designed to stay online, plugged in 
to power even while on standby [CONTACT_215800] . So instea d of going back to a storage cabinet 
it will go to a charging area in [CONTACT_215803]’s office, and a visual reminder about this will be 
placed on a label on each device.  
• Due to  potential  technical limitations of the EHR/Epic integration  the practical nature of the varied data 
in each patient record , we may not be able to rely on s pecific Epic data for each patient to indicate 
suitability for self -ambulation protocols, and we may never be able to push/write to the patient record. 
Therefore, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_215786]:  
o Instead of relying on Epic data, w e may rely on nursing judgement when the avatar is verbally 
told to place the p atient on a self -ambulation encouragement protocol . 
o Instead of confirming the assignment of a self -ambulation protocol to a patient through an Epic 
integration, we may phone call the nursing station to confirm.

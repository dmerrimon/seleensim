2. Trial Design  
 
2.1 Trial Design  
This is a phase II single arm Simon two -stage single -center study of nivolumab in combination with 
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CMP -001 in patients with PD -1 naïve stage IIIB -IIID cutaneous 
(or unknown primary)  melanoma with clinically apparent lymp h node (LN) and/or in -transit and/or 
satellite disease. The study will be conducted over a 52 -week period.  
Patients with stage IIIB -IIID cutaneous (or unknown primary) melanoma with palpable nodal disease 
and/or in -transit disease who have yet to undergo d efinitive surgery are eligible to enroll. Patients 
with nodal and/or in -transit relapse including those who have received prior adjuvant IFN and/or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_838404]. However,  patients who have received either nivolumab or 
pembrolizumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] /nivolumab are NOT eligible. Other eligibility criteria include , but are 
not limited to,  absence of CNS disease and presence of disease amenable to biopsy.  
Suitable patients will be identified pre -operatively. Patients will undergo a rapid (preferred 21  days , 
up to 28 days ) screening evaluation consisting of systemic/CNS staging scans, tumor biopsy, and 
correlative blood studies to confirm suitability. Eligib le patients will receive nivolumab/CMP -001 
combination (prime phase) peri -operatively  for a total of 7 weeks . In the peri -operative period, CMP -
001 will be administered weekly via sub -cutaneous injection  (week 1) then intra -tumorally (weeks 2 -
7). Following  peri-operative therapy and restaging systemic scans, patients will undergo surgical 
resection. Post -operatively, patients will continue to receive nivolumab/CMP -001 combination (boost 
phase)  every 2  (or 4) weeks (nivolumab) and 4 weeks (CMP -001) to comple te 1 year (52 weeks) of 
therapy. In the post -operative period, CMP -001 will be administered subcutaneously.

4. Background and Rationale  
 
4.1 Background  
 
4.1.1  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background : Nivolumab  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation 
has been known for decades (Disis 2010) . The inability of the immune system to control tumor growth 
does not appear to result from an inability to recognize the tumor as foreign. Tumor cells have been 
shown to evade immune destruction despi[INVESTIGATOR_838405] -avidity T cells that are specific for these antigens (Boo n and van der 
Bruggen 1996; Boon and Old 1997; Boon et al. 2006; Ercolini et al. 2005) . Histologic evaluation of 
many human cancers show extensive infiltration by [CONTACT_165879]  (Galon et al. 
2006; Galon et al. 2012) , suggesting that the immune system responds less effectively  to 
malignancy. These observations have led to the hypothesis that dominant mechanisms of immune 
tolerance or immune suppression are responsible for the immune system's inability to effectively 
respond in a way that consistently results in rejection.  
There  are a number of inhibitory mechanisms that have been identified to be involved in tumor -
mediated immune suppression and include expression of the programmed death ligand -1 (PD -L1), 
which can engage the inhibitory receptor PD -1 on activated T cells; the pr esence of the tryptophan -
catabolizing enzyme IDO1, which exploits the exquisite sensitivity of T cells to tryptophan depletion 
and tryptophan metabolites; and infiltration with FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), which can mediate 
extrinsic suppression of ef fector T -cell function. Therefore, agents that target these negative 
regulatory pathways and thereby [CONTACT_165880] T cells present in the tumor may be 
beneficial in the clinic.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_1164597] stimu lated by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions. Programmed dea th receptor -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member 
related to CD28 and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated antigen -4 (CTLA -4), which has been shown 
to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and /or PD -
L2) (Freeman et al. 2000; Latchman et al. 2001; Liang et al. 2003) . The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_1164598] from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_838406] (Parry et al. 2005; Hiraoka 2010) . 
Programmed death receptor -1 has been shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including 
peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, Tregs, and natural killer cells (Hodi et al. 2008) . 
Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8- (double negative) T cells 
as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) . The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -
L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -
hematopoie tic tissues as well as in various tumors (Latchman et al. 2001; Loke and Allison 2003; 
Liang et al. 2003; Francisco et al. 2009; Taube et al. 2014) . Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1164599] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein 
is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments. Programmed death ligand -2 is th ought to control immune T -cell 
activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in 
peripheral tissues . Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundan t levels of this T -cell inhibitor. Programmed death receptor -1 has 
HCC 17 -169  
4 been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (Liotta et al 
2010). This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune eva sion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Nivolumab is a fully human Ig G4 antibody that blocks PD -1. Nivolumab was initially approved by [CONTACT_838428] 22, 2014 for the treatment of patients with unresectable  or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
Nivolumab was also approved on March 4, 2015 to treat patients with advanced (metastatic) 
squamous non –small cell lung cancer (NSCLC ) with progression on or after platinum -based 
chemotherapy. Additionally, FDA approved nivolumab on November 23, 2015 for advanced renal 
cell carcinoma. In Europe, it was approved on June 19, 2015 as a single agent (monotherapy) for 
the treatment of advanc ed (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. Another extension of 
indication was approved on October 28, 2015 to treat the advanced stages of squamous NSCLC 
after prior chemotherapy in adults. On February 25, 2016, it was also approved for advanced renal 
cell carcinoma after previous therapy in adults.  
More recently, nivolumab was approved by [CONTACT_1622] 
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm590004.htm) for the adjuvant 
treatment of resected stage IIIB -IVC melanoma  patients on th e basis of the data from the 
CheckMate -238 study (Weber et al. 2017) . In this study, compared to ip ilimumab, adjuvant therapy 
with nivolumab for 1 year resulted in significantly longer recurrence -free survival  and overall survival. 
Compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_838407] , nivolumab adjuvant therapy had a lower rate  of grade 3 
or 4 adverse events.  
4.1.2  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background: CMP -001 
CMP -001 is a molecule comprised of a 30 nucleotide strand, flanked by 10 guanines on either end. 
The nucleotide strand is surrounded by a Qβ viral -like protein. The intended mechanism of action of 
CMP -001 in oncology is the activation of TLR9 in pDC within the tumor or the tumor -draining lymph 
nodes (tumor -associated pDC). Tumor -associated pDC activated by [CONTACT_838429] -001 are expected to 
release large amounts of type I interferons (IFN), and increase their expressi on of costimulatory 
molecules and tumor antigen presentation to T cells, culminating in the generation of a clinically 
effective anti -tumor T cell response. In order for this response to be specific for the tumor, the pDC 
should have taken up the tumor ant igens already, which requires them to be activated either within 
the tumor, or in the draining lymph nodes, which in turn requires the subcutaneous route of 
administration to reach a locally effective concentration of CMP -001. Systemic administration of 
TLR9 agonists results primarily in liver, spleen, and RES uptake with little specific activation of pDC 
in peripheral lymph nodes. Immature tumor -associated pDC contribute to tumor growth and an 
adverse prognosis in patients with cancer  (Lombardi et al. 2015; Demoulin et al. 201 3). Activating 
and maturing these pDC through either subcutaneous or intratumoral administration of CMP -001 is 
expected to reverse the pDC functional effects from promoting to antagonizing tumor growth, and 
from supporting immune tolerance to inducing a n anti -tumor CD8+ T cell response in the tumor 
microenvironment.  
CMP -001 is composed of (i) a virus -like particle (VLP) comprised of capsid proteins derived from 
bacteriophage Qbeta, which encapsulate (ii) a cytosine linked to a guanine by a phosphate bon d 
(CpG) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) known as G10, which is a Toll -like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist 
designed to induce high levels of type I interferon production and an anti -tumor CD8+ T cell response 
through activation of TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells  (pDC). The therapeutic agent is a VLP 
referred to as QbG10. QbG10 has been previously studied in clinical trials under the name [CONTACT_176641]003. 
In this protocol the name [CONTACT_176641]003 will refer to historical data using the product in non -oncology 
settings. The name [CONTACT_838429] -001 will refer to Checkmate Pharmaceuticals’ plans for the agent.

Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.1.4  Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data: CMP -001 
Preliminary Safety and Efficacy in Asthma  
QbG10, currently known as CMP -001, has been previously studied in clinical trials under the name 
[CONTACT_176641]003. CYT003 has been administered to 732 humans (volunteers or patients with non -cancer 
diagnoses) either alone or in combination with va rious allergens. CYT003 has been administered at 
doses as high as [ADDRESS_1164600] activity with intended immune stimulatory effects. It has 
generally been well tolerated, with mild to moderate flu -like symptoms and/or injection site reactions 
noted in the majority of treated patients.  
Preliminary Safety and Efficacy in PD -1 primary Refractory Melanoma  
Intratumoral administration of CMP -001 is currently being eval uated in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic melanoma resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. In study 
CMP -001-001, A Multicenter, Open -label Phase 1b clinical Study of CMP -001 in Combination with 
Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Melanoma, CMP -001 is being administered 
intratumorally on a weekly (Schedule A) and Q3W schedule (Schedule B) across a dose range of [ADDRESS_1164601] supportive care. 
The mechanism of action associated with the acute toxicity profile appears to resemble symptoms 
associated with cytokine release . A tre atment algorithm has been developed for the management of 
these reactions and can be found in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . CMP -001-001 adverse event summary in 
Cohort 2 of the Dose Escalation Phase are presented in Table 4.1.4 -1.

Preliminary efficacy data, based upon RECIST investigator reads, from the ITT population across 
both schedules from the 1, 3 and 5 mg cohorts (N=28) demonstrated on ORR of 21.4% (5 PRs, 1 
CR). The ORR in subjects treated on Schedule A (N=21) was 24% (5/21; 95% CI 8.2% -47.2%) and 
on Schedule B (N=7) was 14.3% (1/7; 95 % CI 0.4 -57.9%). All responses seen were evidenced at 
the subject’s first follow up scan (12 weeks). Durability or all responses have been seen beyond 24 
weeks with some responses being maintained beyond 1 year.  
4.2 Rationale  
 
4.2.1  Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification : Nivolumab  
Refer to the eIB and the nivolumab SmPC  or USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_838408].  
 
Nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg has been approved as monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC 
patients . In the current study, nivolumab will be administered at [ADDRESS_1164603] Phase, nivolumab will be administered at either 240 mg Q2W or 480mg Q4W 
depending on physician discretion. The choice of the 240 mg Q2W (or 480mg Q4W) as an 
appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations perfo rmed using the 
population PK model of nivolumab showing that the fixed dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks (and 480mg 
Q4W) will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg 
dose every 2 weeks, 2) will maintain individual  patient exposures in the exposure range established 
in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients 
exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe  
(Freshwater et al. 2017; Long et al. 2018) .  
HCC 17 -169  
7 A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for dosing errors . A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical 
chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
4.2.2  Ration ale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification: CMP -001 
During the peri -operative period (Prime Phase), CMP -[ADDRESS_1164604] dose (week 1). Thereafter, CMP -001 will be administered intra -tumorally at 10mg weekly 
(weeks  2-7). 
During the post -surgical period (Boost Phase), CMP -[ADDRESS_1164605] dose approximately 100% of 
the subjects exposed to CMP -[ADDRESS_1164606] with an Anti PD -1/PD -L1 Antibody  
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are part of the innate immune system where they recognize and bind 
conserved pathogen -associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  (Murad and Clay 2009) . TLR9 
recognizes unmethylated cytosine guanosine dinu cleotides (CpG) oligodinucleotides (ODN); and 
TLR9 agonism activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and B cells, and results in potent T 
helper -1 (Th -1)-type immune and anti -tumor responses in mouse tumor models and in patients with 
human cancer  (Fourcade et al. 2008) . However, while CpG administration strongly induces tumor -
specific CD8+ T cell res ponses, objective responses are rare and T cell responses are not sustained  
(Fourcade et al. 2008; App ay, Speiser, et al. 2006; Appay, Jandus, et al. 2006) . There are 3 classes 
of CpG ODN: type A which strongly stimulate pDC IFN -α secretion and minimal B cell activation; 
type B which strongly stimulate B cell proliferation/differentiation and NF -κβ acti vation; and type C 
which stimulate B cell proliferation/differentiation and moderately stimulate pDC IFN -α secretion  
(Krieg 2007) . Pre-clinically, intra -tumoral CpG synergizes with anti -PD-1 therapy by [CONTACT_838430] -specific CD8+ T cells expressing IFN -γ and TNF -α (Wang et al. 2016) . In 
patients with advanced melanoma, the combination of type C TLR9 agonist SD -101 and PD -1 
inhibitor pembrolizumab is associated with significant responses with minimal additional toxicity  
(Ribas et al. 2018) .

5.2 Trial Treatments  
This is a neoadjuvant biotherapy study testing nivolumab with CMP -001 in patients with 
locally/regionally advanced/recurrent melanoma. Subjects will receive  combination nivolumab/CMP -
001 for 7 weeks (Prime Phase) prior to surgery . Surgery will be scheduled approximately 2 – 4 weeks 
after completion of Prime Phase depending on recovery. After recovery from surgery subjects will 
receive additional nivolumab/CMP -001 for appr oximately 46 additional weeks of study drug(s) 
HCC 17 -169  
11 administration (Boost Phase). The treatment to be used in this trial is outlined below.  Trial treatment 
should begin within 4 weeks of study registration.

b If symptoms resolve within one hour of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13056], the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate   (e.g., from 100 
mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms re solve and the subject should be premedicated for the next scheduled dose  
c Patients with intolerable or persistent Grade [ADDRESS_1164623] infusion, trial treatment 
should be discontinued after consultation with the Sponsor. With investigator and Sponsor 
agreement, subjects with a laboratory adverse event still at Grade  2 after 12 weeks may continue 
treatment in the trial only if asymptomatic and controlled. For information on the management of 
adverse events, see Section 5.6.1 . 
Subjects who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life -threatening event at the same 
grade or greater with re -challenge of nivolumab should be discontinued from trial treatment.  
HCC 17 -169  
13 [IP_ADDRESS]  Nivolumab timing of dose administration  
Trial treatment should be administered after all procedures/assessments have been completed as 
detailed on the Trial F low Chart in Section 6.0 . Trial treatment may be administered up to +/- 2 days 
before or after the scheduled Day 1 due to administrative reasons.  
 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
 
Nivolumab will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment intervals may be increased due 
to toxicity as described). Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 
minutes as possible. However, given the variability  of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -
5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
 
The Procedures Manual contains specific instructions for nivolumab dose calculation, reconstitution, 
preparation  of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nivolumab duration of administration  
During the Prime Phase (Weeks 1 -7), nivolumab 240mg will be administered every 2 weeks ( W2D1, 
W4D1, W6D1). During this period, missed doses will not be made up.  
 
During the B oost Phase ( Weeks 12 -56), nivolumab will be administered at either 240mg every 2 
weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks. 12 doses  (if Q4W) or 23 doses (if Q2W) of nivolumab will be 
administered over this period. During this period, missed doses will be made up . The choice of Q2W 
versus Q4W administration of nivolumab will be physician dependent.  
5.2.2  CMP -001 Dose Selection /Modification  
During the Prime Phase , the first dose of CMP -001 (week 1) is fixed at 5mg subcutaneously . 
Subsequent doses of CMP -001 administered during the Prime Phase (weeks 2-7) will be at 10mg 
administered intra -tumorally. Should patients develop side effects, intra -tumoral doses during this 
period of the Prime Phase (weeks 2 -7) may be reduced (see Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1). 
Following resection, during the Boost Phase , the CMP -001 dose is fixe d at 5mg injected 
subcutaneously at the site of the resected tumor . 
Rationale  for dose selection  is provided in Section 4.2.2 – Rationale for Dose 
Selection/Regimen/Modification: CMP -001. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recommended prophylaxis  
To reduce the severity of symptoms associated with CMP -[ADDRESS_1164624] at institutions should be followed, if 
not, below is a suggested regimen that has been effective for the treatment of CMP -001 induced 
adverse events:  
• Fluids (e.g. 1000 cc IV normal saline)  
• NSAIDS (e.g. 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg Indomethacin)  
• Anti-emetics (e.g.8 mg Zofran PO)  
• Hydrocortisone prophylaxis (50 -100mg hydrocortisone – only for patients with prior G2 -3 
CRS -like reaction)  
 
HCC [ADDRESS_1164625] CMP -001 dosing should be 
recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medications eCRF separately for each visit where it is given.  
 
IMPORTANT:  Subjects with a history of adrenal insufficiency are at increased risk for moderate to 
severe adverse events such  as hypotension which may occur with 1 -4 hours after injection. It is 
strongly recommended that these subjects receive stress dose steroids (eg. 50 -100 mg 
hydrocortisone PO q 8 hours) prior to, or immediately after injection of CMP -001. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing of CMP -[ADDRESS_1164626] be within 1 week of W1D1 (i.e., first CMP -001 injection). When 
CMP -001 and nivolumab  dosing fall on the same day, it is recommended that CMP -001 dosing 
precede nivolumab  dosing. There is no specified  waiting period between the end of CMP -001 
administration and the initiation of nivolumab  infusion. When a study visit occurs where only 
nivolumab  is given, pre -infusion vital signs should be collected and recorded on the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Guidance of CMP -[ADDRESS_1164627] 0.5cm in diameter and  may 
be cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal tumors that are visible, palpable, or detectable 
by [CONTACT_690082] . Patients with visceral tumors are not candidates  for this study. Patient 
candidates for CMP -[ADDRESS_1164628] more than one accessible tumor as a candidate for intra -
tumoral injection.  
• If 1 accessible tumor is present:  
o This should be selected as a c andidate for intra -tumoral injection.  
o CMP -001 dose selection is outlined as in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1.  
o Total CMP -001 dose administered should not exceed 10mg/day.  
• If >1 accessible tumors are present:  
o 1 or more accessible lesions can be injected (preferably all).  
o CMP -001 dose selection is outlined as in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1.  
o CMP -001 dose may be s plit at the discretion of the treating investigator (or designee).  
o Total CMP -001 dose administered across all tumors should not exceed 10mg/day.

Subcutaneous injections  
CMP -001 should be injected using aseptic technique. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or local anesthetic is 
permitted. The injection may be given into any SC site in the body.  
HCC 17 -169  
15 • Preferred Sites for Subcutaneous Injection  
o In principle, the injection may be given into any SC site in the body. Unsuitable sites 
for injection would include, for example, the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot.  
o The injection site should be within the area of lymphatic drainage associated w ith a 
site of metastatic disease or primary disease. For example, in a patient with a muscle 
or bone metastasis in the lower leg, the preferred SC injection site would be in the 
same leg, with the expectation that at least some of the CMP -001 will drain to  lymph 
nodes that also contain tumor antigens. Likewise, in a patient with metastases in an 
upper lobe of the lung, a preferred SC injection site would be in the ipsilateral 
supraclavicular fossa, where the injection may activate pDC in the supraclavicular  
lymph nodes that also can drain the upper lung.  
• Method of CMP -[ADDRESS_1164629] pressure on the syringe plunger to confirm 
extravascular location of the needle tip, the desired volume of CMP -001 is injected 
and the needle is withdrawn.  
At Screening, the selected tumor(s) should be large enough to allow intratumoral injection of 
the intended volume of CMP -001 ( Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1). Initial administration of CMP -001 (W1D1) will be 
subcutaneous to allow for development of antibodies to the virus like particle which is necessary for 
uptake of CMP into the dendritic cell. Subsequent administrations of CMP -001 during the prime 
phase will be intra -tumoral. The same tumor(s) should be injected each week during therapy, if 
possible, except as outlined below to involuting tumors.  
If the full volume cannot be injected within the tumor, then the remaining drug volume should 
be injected into a second accessible tumor, if present. If the full volume still cannot be 
administered  into the tumor, peri -tumoral injection of any remaining volume is acceptable.  
 
Following surgical resection, during the post -operative boost phase , CMP -001 will be administered 
subcutaneously  at the resection site . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CMP -001 Dose Modification  
CMP -001 will be dose -reduced in patients who develop CMP -001 related DLT and resume study 
therapy with Nivolumab/CMP -[ADDRESS_1164630]’s best interest. In this event, CMP -001 will be dose reduced as in 
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. 
CMP -001 will be withheld for CMP -001 related Grade 4 hematologic toxicities, non -hematological 
toxicity ≥ Grade 3 including laboratory abnormalities, and severe or life -threatening AEs .  
If CMP -001 is permanently discontinued for, subjects may continue to receive Nivolumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of CMP -001 Administration  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_838411]’ judgment. Using 
standard aseptic technique, the needle is inserted near the tumor periphery and is advanced into the 
tumor to the desired depth (usually to the needle hub, if the tumor size permits) while maintaining 
HCC [ADDRESS_1164631] the desired volume of 
CMP -001 along the needle track ( Figure 3, middle panel ). With the tip of the needle still within the 
skin, the syringe is then rotated by ~20 -40o and the process of insertion and injection during needle 
withdrawal is repeated ( Figure 3, right panel ). Using this process, CMP -001 is injected along 
multiple tracks through a single insertion point as far as the radial reach of the needle allows within 
the tumor; two insertion points can be used if the tumor is larger than the radial  reach of the needle 
and the  intended CMP -001 volume cannot be delivered from a single insertion point. If gentle 
injection pressure along 5 needle tracks within the tumor has not succeeded in delivering the desired 
volume, then the remainder of the CMP -001 may be injected peri -tumorally, around the same lesion.  
 
 
 
Essentially the same process is performed for cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal injections, but  
for deeper injections, the tip of the needle may be kept within the tumor and a longer needle may  be 
used . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Observation periods  
During the Prime Phase, subjects must be observed for a period of at least four hours following each 
of the first three CMP -001 injec tions (W1D1, W2D1, W3D1) for signs and symptoms of reactions to 
the injection and other adverse events. Beginning with the fourth CMP -001 injection (W4D1) the 
observation period may be reduced to [ADDRESS_1164632] and be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of CMP -001 toxicity  
CMP -001 Associated Adverse Events  
If subjects develop inflammation at the injection site this may be managed using cold compresses 
and/or acetaminophen or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents. If flu -like symptoms (i.e., fever, 
myalgia, and headache) arise, these may be managed using ace taminophen or non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory agents.  
Figure 3: Method for CMP -001 Intra -Tumoral Injection  
HCC 17 -169  
17 It is expected that symptoms associated with a large release in cytokines at the time of injection 
could present 1 -4 hours after the injection. These symptoms could include: fever, nausea/vomiting, 
chills/rigors, and hypotension. Subjects must remain in observation until all of these symptoms have 
resolved to ≤ Grade 1. Refer to Table 4.1.[ADDRESS_1164633] dosing of CMP -001 withheld until the toxicity has returned 
to ≤ Grade 1. If the Investigator determines that continued treatment with CMP -[ADDRESS_1164634]’s 
best interest, treatment may resume at a reduced dose of CMP -001. Only one dose reductio n is 
allowed. Subjects who still experiences DLTs at Dose Level -[ADDRESS_1164635] 
tocilizumab (Maude et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2016; Brudno and Kochenderfer 2018) . 
The recommended algorithm for the treatment of symptoms associated with cytokine release below  
has been adapted for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome resulting fro m other  
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_773576] -T cell therapy  (Lee et al. 2014)  and is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] [ADDRESS_1164636] line of treatment for hypotension unresponsive to supportive 
care such as fluids, is stress dose steroids as outlined below.  Additional treatment measures include 
the use of drugs targeting specific cytokin es believed to be involved in the development of cytokine 
release syndrome -induced hypotensio n. It is recommended that the treatment algorithm be 
implemented in subjects who present with acute hypotension following injection of CMP -001.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Changing the selected tumor  
Therapy  of a selected  lesion  generally  should  continue  per protocol  unless  the tumor  is EITHER  
dramatically  responding  clinically  OR dramatically  progressing  clinically.  Inflammation  of the injected  
tumor  is expected  following  the 2nd and subsequent  injections,  but should  not be mistaken  for anti-
tumor  response  or clinical  progression.  
 
If during  therapy  the injected  tumor  is clearly  involuting  and shrinking,  and if a different  eligible  
accessible  tumor  is progressing,  then the Investigator  should  change  the selection  to the progressing  
tumor,  injecting  the full dose  of CMP -001 into that tumor(s),  and continuing  to inject  the new tumor(s)  
until EOT (or that tumor  shows  involution,  in which  case  a third progressing  tumor  may be 
selected).  If during  therapy  the injected  tumor  is clearly  involuting  and shrinking,  and no other  lesions  
are present,  CMP -[ADDRESS_1164637]  to continue therapy  or transition  to surgery  directly.  Every  effort  
should  be made  to complete  7 weeks  of perioperative  therapy.  The decision  to proceed  with surgery  
should  be made  (in consultation  with the initial  evaluating  surgical  oncologist)  only if there  is a danger  
of the subject  being  rendered  inoperable . 
 
5.3 Treatment Allocation  
During the Prime Phase, p atients will receive nivolumab 240mg  every 2 weeks  in combination with 
CMP -001 5mg (week 1), and CMP -001 10mg intra -tumorally (weeks 2 -7). Subsequently patients will 
undergo surgical resection.  
 
During the Boost Phase, p atients will receive nivolumab  either 240mg  every 2 weeks (or 480mg 
every 4 weeks) at Investigator’s discretion al ong with CMP -001 5mg every 4 weeks . 
 
5.4 Stratification  
None.  
5.5 Concomitant Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the 
ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be 
required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the principal investigator. 
The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the 
subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or 
vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the treating physi cian investigator, the 
principal investigator, and the subject.   
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_1164638]’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981]. All 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, 
over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during 
HCC [ADDRESS_1164639] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined 
in Section 7.2 .  
 
5.5.2  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130970] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:   
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy   
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol   
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol   
• Investigational agents other than CMP -001 
• Radiation therapy   
 
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1164640] dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. 
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited t o, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, 
chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines 
(e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.   
 
Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of clinical interest 
of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved 
after consultation with the Principle Investigator .  
 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial. Subjects may receive other 
medicati ons that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.   
 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.   
 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.   
 
Agents known to have TLR9 a ntagonist activity are prohibited throughout the study. The  known 
antagonists are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine.  
 
Medications intended solely for supportive care (i.e., antiemetics, analgesics, megestrol  acetate for 
anorexia) are allowed.  
 
5.6 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care  
 
5.6.1  Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse eve nts with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the 
use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory 
agents if symptoms do not improve with administrat ion of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses 
of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. 
HCC 17 -169  
20 For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines 
are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to nivolumab .  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be  related, the investigator does not need 
to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification.   
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
• Pneumonitis  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, s teroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer additional 
anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration.  
• Diarrhea/Colitis  
o Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and  of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities 
of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be 
substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and 
endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis,  treat with intravenous ster oids followed by [CONTACT_180731].   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyper glycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
▪ Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for 
Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or k etonuria.  
▪ Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis  
o For Grade [ADDRESS_1164641] arted and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones 
may be requir ed as the steroid dose is tapered.  
HCC 17 -169  
21 • Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism  
o Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
base d on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
▪ In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g.  propranolol) are suggested as 
initial therapy.  
▪ In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
▪ Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid follo wed by [CONTACT_78019]. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required 
as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic  
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to baseline 
values (consider weekly).  
▪ Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or le ss, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Nephritis  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper shou ld be started and

5.[ADDRESS_1164643] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time and without penalty or loss of future  medical 
care, or any other benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. Subjects may  discontinue study 
medication for any of the following conditions:  
• Dose -limiting or other unacceptable toxicity considered to be related to either study 
medication;  
o Patients who develop unacceptable toxicity  deemed related to CMP -[ADDRESS_1164644] discontinue both CMP -001 and Nivolumab.  
• PD by [CONTACT_393] (Version 1.1) if accompanied by [CONTACT_838431], in 
the judgment of the Investigator. (Continuation of treatment through  suspected pseudo -
progression is permitted.);  
• If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110503], it is medically necessary;  
• Subject withdraws consent for the study (note that subjects who withdraw consent 
for additional study treatment and procedures will continue to be followed for long -term 
• survival unless they explicitly withdraw consent for any follow -up); 
• Subject develops an intercurrent illness or adverse event that precludes further  participation, 
or requires a prohibited concomitant treatment;  
• Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding;  
HCC 17 -169  
23 • Subject is lost to follow -up. 
 
Subjects discontinuing study medication earlier than planned or withdrawing from the study  should 
undergo the subsequent End of Treatment (EOT) clinical and laboratory assessments as  soon as 
possible after study medication is stopped and the requisite safety follow -up period of 30  days should 
also be followed. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the electronic case  report form 
(eCRF) and the subject’s source medical record. All subjects will continue to be  followed every three 
months after the last C MP-[ADDRESS_1164645] 1 dose of CMP -001 and nivolumab are evaluable  for safety. Patients 
who com plete pre -operative therapy and receive surgery will be evaluable for pathologic response 
rate and other efficacy endpoints . Patients who did not undergo surgery for reasons of disease 
progression precluding surgery (rapid disease progression) will be deem ed non -evaluable. Non-
evaluable subjects may be replaced.  
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_838413], subject’s disease is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_838414], treatment may be discontinued to permit surgery. These patients are 
evaluable for pathological response rate and other efficacy endpoints . These patients are eligible to 
receive CMP -001/nivolumab during “Boost” phase.  
5.9 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:   
• Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete   
• Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
• Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects   
• Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drugs. In the event of CheckMate 
decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be provided so that appropriate 
adjustments to subject treatment can be made.   
 
5.10 Surgical Considera tions  
The team members will make every effort to comply with the surgical procedures within the time 
windows allowed in this study protocol. However, under certain circumstances and as discussed 
between the sub -investigator(s) and the principal investigato r, an alteration in the  surgical 
schedule/timing is allowed. These include (but are not limited to) the following:  
• A [ADDRESS_1164646] dose of nivolumab is allowed.   
• The definitive surgery may be a lymphadenectomy  or resection of lymphatic metastases as 
clinically indicated. The definitive surgery may be divided into more than one surgical  
procedure, scheduled at different time points as clinically/surgically indicated. Under certain 
circumstances, the definitive surgery may be done after completion of additional therapy 
(e.g., after the forth dose of nivolumab) or earlier if nivolumab was discontinued due to 
adverse events or other reasons. Tissue from any of these surgical procedures may be 
banked under this protocol following the same protocol procedures for tissue handling and 
banking. The tissue for banking may be digested, frozen or ha ndled in another alternative 
method as discussed with the investigator.  
HCC 17 -169  
24 • If for some reason, the baseline biopsy or definitive surgery could not be completed due to 
un-anticipated factors such as patient refusal, this will be documented.   
 
NOTE : The surgica l guidelines are general and may be followed or modified at the discretion of the 
expert surgical oncologist on the case as clinically indicated and depending on the specifics of the 
individual surgical case.   
 
For the baseline biopsy required on this stud y, patients will undergo a core needle, punch biopsy, 
open surgical biopsy , or other technique at the discretion of the sub -investigator/investigator. The 
choice of specific surgical technique will be at the discretion of the surgeon or medical oncologist 
and actual techniques will be the same as those used as therapeutically or diagnostically indicated 
to surgically treat or confirm the clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_838415] (st andard of care) within 21 days (preferred; and 
up to 4 weeks) prior to entry to the study.   
 
5.10.1  Primary Excision or Primary Cutaneous Melanoma  
All patients with initial presentation of melanoma T1 -4 will be treated by [CONTACT_838432]. 
Definitive surgery will include wide excision of the primary and sentinel lymph node assessment . For 
patients with known primary cutaneous melanoma les ion and no history of wide local excision of that 
primary lesion, an adequate wide excision of the primary lesion (minimum margin 1 cm) is 
recommended. The wide local excision will be done at the time of complete lymphadenectomy. 
Patients with nodal relaps e after an inadequate primary excision will undergo wide excision at the 
time of complete lymphadenectomy. The recommendation for adequate wide excision is the same 
for patients enrolled at the time of lymph node recurrence as for those enrolled at the tim e of initial 
treatment of the primary. For lesions whose Breslow's thickness is > 1 mm, a 2 cm minimum margin 
is preferred when anatomically feasible (i.e., for lesions of the trunk and proximal extremities). For 
subungual melanoma, a distal interphalangea l amputation with histologically negative margins 
constitutes an adequate wide excision. The specimen shall be excised to include skin and all 
subcutaneous tissue down to the muscular fascia. Fascia may  be included at the discretion of the 
operating surgeo n. Closure of the defect may be via primary closure, split thickness skin graft, or 
rotation -flap at the discretion of the surgeon.  
 
5.10.2  Regional Lymphadenectomy  
Note:  For patients undergoing sentinel node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_838416], the minimum number of nodes may be less 
than the mandatory minimum numbers of 5/groin, 10/axilla, and 15/cervical node dissection.  
 
All patients should undergo one of the following staging lymphadenectomies, as fo und surgically 
applicable by [CONTACT_838433].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Head and neck lesions  
Face, ear  and anterior scalp: Modified radical neck or radical neck dissection. Parotidectomy to be 
included if lymphoscintogram indicates flow to the area.  
 
Submandibular and anterior neck: Modified radical or radical neck dissection.  
 
Posterior scalp, posterior neck and uppermost trunk (areas that drain to posterior cervical triangle): 
Modified posterior triangle neck dissection with suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_838417].  
 
HCC 17 -169  
25 At all times, the number of  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Upper extremity  
Axillary node dissection to include a t least 10 nodes taken from levels I and II. Level III nodes should 
be dissected if they are clinically involved. The pectoralis minor muscle may be divided or sacrificed 
at the surgeon's discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lower extremity  
Superficial inguinal node dissection  or deep inguinal node dissection  will be performed  at the 
discretion of the surgeon . Inguinal  node dissection to include at least 5 node s. 
5.10.3  Lymphadenectomy for Nodal Recurrence  
Regional node recurrences will be treated using the appropriate lymphadenectomy procedure. 
Whenever possible, diagnosis of regional node recurrence will be made using punch or open biopsy 
technique (if done as part of a clinically indicated baseline diagnostic procedure) to provide baseline 
pathologic material needed f or evaluation of treatment effect. At the time of the definitive 
lymphadenectomy, the biopsy site will be included in the operative specimen.  
 
6 Trial Flow Chart  
The Investigator/Sub -Investigators are expected to make every reasonable effort to comply with the 
study calendar. However, if a treatment  is missed or a subject's study treatment and/or testing days 
need to be rescheduled due to the subject’s inability to  comply with the study calendar (i.e., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], business and vacation travel plans, illness, transportation issues, holidays, family 
emergencies, etc.), a window of ± one week is available for rescheduling of study treatment and 
procedures per the  discretion of the Sub - Investigator, and as discussed with the Investigator. For 
the baseline biopsy, a [ADDRESS_1164647] dose of nivolumab and/or CMP -001.

7 Trial Procedures  
 
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each visit. 
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].   
 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deeme d necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
CheckMate for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require 
that additional informed  consent be obtained from the subject. In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.   
 
7.1.1  Treatment period  
The study consists of 3 main phases:  
• Prime Phase  (Weeks 1 -7):  
o Nivolumab (240 mg) I.V. infusion every 2 weeks for 3 doses (starting 2nd week of 
CMP -001 administration – W2D1) given concurrently with CMP -001.  
o CMP -001 will be administered subcutaneously (week 1), then intra -tumorally (weeks 
2-7) on a weekly schedule.  
• Definitive Surgery : Follows completion of prime phase.  
• Boost Phase  (following recovery from surgery)  (Week s 12-56):  
o Nivolumab (240 mg  I.V. infusion every 2 weeks; or 480 mg I.V infusion every 4 weeks ) 
given concurrently with CMP -001 5mg every 4 weeks.  
o CMP -001 will be administered subcutaneously ( peri-tumoral resection site ).  
o Total of 12 doses of CMP -001 will be administered.  
o Total of 46 weeks of Nivolumab will be administered (every 2 weeks - 23 dos es; every 
4 weeks – 12 doses ). 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1164666]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature [CONTACT_838452] t. 
During initial enrollmen t visit, study investigator (or designee) must discuss the following with 
patients:  
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Medical history – pertinently any condition diagn osed within the prior 10 years that are 
considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737].  
• Prior and concomitant medications. All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs 
should be recorded as defined in Section 7.2.  
• Disease details and treatments.  
 
7.1.3  Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event (AE) monitoring  
HCC [ADDRESS_1164667] to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated. Adver se 
experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 12.2). Toxicities will be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action t aken with regard to trial treatment.  
 
All AEs of unknown etiology associated with nivolumab exposure should be evaluated to determine 
if it is possibly an event of clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (irAE). See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  regarding the identification, evaluation and management of AEs of a potential 
immunological etiology . 
 
Related and clinically significant AEs occurring within [ADDRESS_1164668]. Related SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end 
of treatment or before initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment should also be followed and 
recorded.  
 
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full physical exam  
The investigator or qualified d esignee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening 
period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history. A full physical 
exam should be performed during screening.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Directed physical exam  
For visits  that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment 
administration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital signs  
The investigator or qualified desi gnee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of 
each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 6. 1). Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weigh t and blood 
pressure. Height will be measured at screening only.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 12.4) at screening, prior 
to the administration of eac h dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified 
in the Trial Flow Chart.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor imaging and assessment of disease  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_838434] (RECIST v.1.1) Committee [Eisenhauer. Eur J 
Cancer 2009; (45):228 -47]. 
  
Acceptable imaging studies  to evaluate disease at baseline include:  
HCC 17 -169  
32 • Whole body PET -CT scan (except brain)  
• Contrast -enhanced CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis (and affected body part if 
needed).  
• Brain imaging is to done only at Screening and need not be repeated. For brain imaging an 
contrast enhanced MRI is ideal. If  an MRI of the brain cannot be don e (or is contraindicated) 
a contrast enhanced CT of the brain is acceptable .  
 
A restaging PET -CT (preferred if possible, or CT) is required after completion of Prime Phase (+/ - 2 
weeks) and prior to definitive surgery ( i.e. after the completion of induction doses of nivolumab and 
CMP -001). MRI brain is not required for  follow up studies unless clinically indicated. Additional 
staging studies will be done as clinically indicated at the discretion of the treating physician. Du ring 
the maintenance phase imaging studies will be done every 8 weeks ( -/+ 2 weeks).  
7.1.4  Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies  
Planned correlative analyses will include  flow cytometric  analyses of tumor samples, TIL and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), IHC analyses of pre -/post - treatment tumor samples, 
tumor whole exome/RNA sequencing. Single -cell RNA sequencing will be performed on a subset of 
treated patients.  Studies will be performed under the directio n of the Principle Investigator along with 
co-Investigator Hassane Zarour in [CONTACT_838455]’s lab.  
 
Tumor tissue  
Patients must undergo biopsy (e.g.  punch or open biopsy) within 21 days (preferred; and up to 4 
weeks) of entry to the study (baseline biopsy). Definitive surgery will be performed after [ADDRESS_1164669].  Tumor tissue 
will be processed as described in the lab manual:  
 
Primary melanoma (if available)  
FFPE tissue block(s) or 10 unstained slides (air dried) from patients ’ originally resected primary 
melanoma will be requested as well.  
 
Blood biospecimens  
Blood biospecimens will be collected at baseline, and per the schedule outlined in Study Chart in 
Section 6.1 . 
 
At EACH time point  please submit the following:  
• One (1) 10mL RED top tube  
• One (1) 8.5mL YELLOW top tube  
• Eight  (8) 10mL GREEN top tubes  
• One (1) 2.5mL PAXgene DNA tube 
• One (1) 2.5mL PAXgene RNA  tube

7.1.6  Other Procedures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal and disc ontinuation  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities scheduled 
for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any adverse events which 
are present at the time of discontinuati on/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1164671] -Treatment Visits including Safety Follow -up Visit s are delineated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Following completion of treatment, patients will enter the Follow -Up Period of the study (described 
in Section 7.1. 7.2.2). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blinding and unblinding  
Not applicable . 
7.1.7  Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure -related details 
are provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  
Screening period  
Screening starts with the subject’s provision of a written informed consent and should be completed 
within 21 days (preferred; and up  to 4 weeks) of initiation of study drug(s) .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post -treatment surveillance  
Follow up period will start [ADDRESS_1164672] follow -up schedule  including imaging (CT vs. CT/PET vs. 
PET at the discretion of the treating physicia n) at the intervals directed below . Every 3 months (±2 
weeks) if patient is < 2 years from start of follow up period , every 6 months (±4 weeks) if patient is 
2-5 years from start of follow up period , and every 12 months (±4 weeks) if patient is > [ADDRESS_1164673] study drug administration.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety follow up visit  
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_1164674]. 
All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit sho uld be recorded. Subjects with an AE of 
Grade > [ADDRESS_1164675]. SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of 
HCC 17 -169  
35 treatment or before  initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment should also be followed and recorded.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow up visit  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into 
the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed by [CONTACT_110531]. Every 
effort should be made to collect information regarding dis ease status until the start of new anti -
neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, end of the study or if the subject begins retreatment 
with nivolumab as detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1164676] -study anti -neoplastic 
treatment will b e collected if new treatment is initiated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Survival follow up  
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new anti -cancer therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be contact[CONTACT_838436], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  This will be done 
every 3 months . 
 
7.2 Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
 
7.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events (AE)  
An AE is an untoward or medical occurrence associated with the use of study drug (active or placebo 
drug, biologic, or device) in clinical investigation subjects, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the study drug. An AE can therefor e be any unfavorable and unintended symptom, 
sign, disease or condition, or test abnormality whether or not considered related to study drug. AEs 
that do not meet the definition for an SAE are considered non -serious AEs.  
 
AEs include:  
• Changes described by [CONTACT_838437].   
• Test abnormalities (i.e., laboratory tests, ECGs) that result in an alteration in medical care 
(diagnostic or therapeutic).  
 
Disease Progression is  not considered an AE in this study.  
  
Abnormalities present at baseline are considered AEs only if they reoccur after resolution or they 
worsen during the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse events (SAE) and serious unexpected adverse 
events (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
An SAE is any AE that fulfills one of the c riteria outlined in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. 
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1: Criteria for Determination of Serious Adverse Events  
Death  An AE that results in death.   
*In this study, deaths that are unequivocally due to Disease Progression are  not to be 
reported as SAEs.  
HCC [ADDRESS_1164677], in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death 
from the AE as it occurred (i.e., does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death).  
Required or prolo nged 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838418]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838419], a period of normal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838420]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838421].  
Persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity  An AE that results in a substantial disru ption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
Congenital anomaly/birth 
defect  A congenital anomaly/birth defect that occurs in the offspring of a subject exposed to the 
study drug.  
Important medical event  An AE that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of 
the outcomes listed above.  
 
Examples of such “important medical events” include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependenc y or drug abuse.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as with important medical events described above.  
Events that meet SAE criteria must be recorded and rep orted regardless of expectedness or 
assessed association with study drug.  
Note:  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838422]. If planned admissions or procedures occur at a time other than what 
was planned (i.e., due to an exacerbation in the preexisting illness or disease), they should be 
reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected AE  
An unexpe cted AE is any AE that is not consistent in specificity or severity with the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
 
7.2.2  Evaluation of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for making an assessment as to the severity/grade (as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , below), causality/relationship (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , below), 
and outcome of AEs and SAEs (as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , below). In addition, the Investigator 
or designee must report any actions taken as a result of an AE or SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AE severity/grade  
For each recorded AE or SAE, the Investigator or designee must make an assessment of Grade 
using the Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  Grade refers to 
the severity of the AE. Note that severity is not the same as “seriousness ”. Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
HCC 17 -169  
37 [IP_ADDRESS]  Causality and relationship to study drug(s)  
For each AE or SAE, the Investigator will determine whether there is a reasonable possibility 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_838438] a causal relationship between the study drug regimen 
(CMP -001 pus nivolumab), and the AE acco rding to the categories provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. 
Attribution of adverse events specifically to either CMP -[ADDRESS_1164678] be made by [CONTACT_838439]. The Investigator may change 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up infor mation; if this occurs, the Investigator must amend 
the AE or SAE information accordingly.  
 
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1: Classifications for Adverse Event Causality/Relationship  
Classification  Definition  
Unrelated  There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a causal relationship between exposure to 
the study drug regimen and the AE; another cause of the AE has 
been identified, no temporal association with study drug has been 
identified, or the study drug cannot be implicated.   
Possibly related  There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal 
relationship between study drug regimen exposure and the AE; an 
alternative explanation (i.e., concomitant drug or concomitant 
disease) is inconclusive, the temporal association with study drug is 
reasonable, and the causal relationship cannot be excluded.  
Probably related  An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration 
of the investigational drug regimen and follows a known pattern of 
response, but for which a potential alternative cause may be present.  
Definitely related  There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between 
study drug regimen and the AE; the AE cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_4867] (i.e., concomitant drug or 
concomitant disease) and the temporal association with study drug 
is suggestive of a causal relationship.  
 
An AE is considered related to treatment if the attribution is “possibly related”, “probably related”, or 
“definitely related.”  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classification of AE outcome  
Adverse event outcome describes the status of the AE at the last observation. The Investigator will 
document the outcome of each AE or SAE u sing the categories provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. 
 
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1: Classifications for Adverse Event Outcome  
Classification  Definition  
Fatal  Termination of life as a result of an AE.  
Not recovered/not resolved  Subject has not recuperated or the AE has not improved.  
Recovering/resolving  Subject is recuperating or the AE is improving.  
Recovered/resolved  Subject has recuperated, the AE resolved, or returned to baseline status / 
stabilized.  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Adverse event has resolved, but the subject has been left with symptoms or 
pathology.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
 
HCC 17 -169  
38 [IP_ADDRESS]  Action taken regarding AE  
The Investigator will provide the action taken regarding study drug in response to the AE. 
Classifications for each of the potential actions taken are provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. More than one 
option may apply to a single AE/SAE. For example, study drug may be delayed and the dose reduced 
in response to an AE. Action related to CMP -001 and nivolumab will be assessed and recorded 
separately in the EDC.  
 
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1: Classifica tions for Actions Taken Regarding an Adverse Event  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  No change in administration of study drug  
Dose reduced1 Reduction in the amount of study drug administered  
Study drug interrupted  Temporary interruption (termination) in administration of the study 
drug 
Study drug withdrawn  Administration of the study drug terminated (no further dosing)  
Not applicable  Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context  
Unknown  Not known, not ob served, not recorded, or refused  
1Refer to Section 5.2.1. and 5.2.3.  regarding dose reductions  of either Nivolumab or CMP -001 due 
to dose -limiting toxicities.  
 
7.2.3  Timeframe for Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Collection  
The Investigator is required to record all AEs occurring during the clinical study (21 CFR 312.64[b] 
and ICH E6 [R1]) starting from the time the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_1164679] dose of 
CMP -001 on the AE page of the eCRF.  SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of treatment or 
before initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment should also be followed and recorded . SAEs as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. must also be reported to the Sponsor or its representative within 24 hours 
of knowledge of their occurrence, in accordance with Section 7.2.5.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment -related AE  
Treatment -related AE/SAE is defined as an AE that started or worsened in severity on or after the 
date the study drug was first administered. TEAE information will be collected from the time of the 
subject’s first receipt of CMP -[ADDRESS_1164680] dose of CMP -001. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAE 
SAE information will be collected from the point the subject starts study treatment  until [ADDRESS_1164681] has comp leted participation in the study, 
the Investigator or study staff becomes aware of an SAE that they believe is possibly related or 
related to CMP -001 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), then the event and any known details must be reported 
promptly to the Sponsor or its designee. The reporting instructions described in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1164682] 
be followed.  
 
7.2.4  Recording Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs experienced by a sub ject will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Information 
including a concise description of the event; date and time of event onset and resolution; 
determination of seriousness, severity, corrective treatment, outcome, relationship to study drug; and 
action taken regarding the study drug will be recorded. Vital signs, laboratory results, and other safety 
HCC 17 -169  
39 assessments noted in Section 7.1.2  will be recorded as AEs if they are determined to be clinically 
significant findings in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_54571] r. When possible, a diagnosis should be recorded 
as an AE, rather than symptoms or isolated laboratory abnormalities related to that diagnosis. 
However, when flu -like or cytokine release -like symptoms are reported, each individual symptom 
should be recorde d as a separate AE in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. A medical or 
surgical procedure is not an AE; rather the condition leading to the procedure should be recorded as 
the AE. If the condition is not known, the procedure must be recorded as an AE  instead. Similarly, 
death is not an AE, but is rather the outcome of the AE(s) that resulted in death. If the AE(s) leading 
to death are not known, then death must be reported as an AE.   
 
All SAEs experienced by [CONTACT_838440], in accordance with Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
7.2.5  Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAE and SUAE Reporting  
All events meeting the definition of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a MedWatch 
3500A Form 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM048334.pdf) or  
departmental SAE form. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_213159] :

• UPMC Institutional Review Board per institutional reporting requirements  
• In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication 
information, the report should include as applicable the following information that is available 
at the time of report within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A form or 
departmental SAE form:  
o CTCAE term(s) and grade(s)  
o Curre nt status of study drug  
o Intervention (s) to address the AE (testing and result, treatment and response)  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or discharge dates  
o Event relationship to study drug  combination  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
and must be reported within [ADDRESS_1164684] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]. ).  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment initiation , any ECI, or 
follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within [ADDRESS_1164685] for this trial include:  
• An overdose of Checkmate product  
• Cutaneous adverse events at  the injection site  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancies  
Female subjects or the partners of male subjects who discover they are pregnant within a year of 
their last CMP -[ADDRESS_1164686] complete a Pregnancy Form and report the pregnancy to Checkmate Pharmaceuticals Drug 
Safety within 24 hours (following the same reporting process o utlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The Investigator will inform the subject that the Sponsor or its designee is required to gather 
information regarding the course and outcome of a pregnancy that has occurred after exposure to a 
study drug. The progress of the p regnancy must be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the 
birth of a child, additional follow -up information may be requested.  
The Investigator wil l be asked to obtain follow -up information no later than 2 months after the 
gestational period to obtain maternal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.  
Follow -up information may be requested at additional time points. All study -related  contacts involving 
a known pregnancy should include pregnancy status assessment until pregnancy outcome is known.  
Please note that pregnancy in and of itself is not an AE or an SAE. Pregnancy should not be entered 
into the eCRF as an AE unless the Investi gator suspects an interaction between the study drug and 
the contraceptive method. Additionally, all information received will be assessed for any AEs and 
SAEs and processed per study guidelines. If the subject is discontinued because of pregnancy, 
pregnan cy will be documented as the reason for study discontinuation. Spontaneous abortions and 
stillbirths will be reported as SAEs.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1164687] notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the 
sponsor is  providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator's IND) in an IND safety report of 
potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case 
later than [ADDRESS_1164688] analyze the  significance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar 
reports or any other relevant information.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious and unexpected adverse reaction  
HCC [ADDRESS_1164689] a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e .g., tendon rupture);  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of dr ug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control group.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Findings from other studies  
The sponsor must report any findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analysis of mu ltiple 
studies, or clinical studies (other than those reported under section 7. 2.6.1), whether or not 
conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by [CONTACT_456], that suggest a significant 
risk in humans exposed to the drug. Ordinarily, such a fin ding would result in a safety -related change 
in the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure (excluding routine updates of these 
documents), or other aspects of the overall conduct of the clinical investigation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Findings from animal or in vitro  testing  
The sponsor must report any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by 
[CONTACT_456], that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or repo rts of significant organ toxicity at or near the 
expected human exposure. Ordinarily, any such findings would result in a safety -related change in 
the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure (excluding routine updates of these 
documents), or othe r aspects of the overall conduct of the clinical investigation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Increase rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions  
The sponsor must report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse 
reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Submission of IND safety reports  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 3500A or in 
an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA will perio dically issue guidance 
on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, 
preparation and organization of files). The sponsor may submit foreign suspected adverse reactions 
on a Council for International Organiz ations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) I Form instead of a FDA 
Form 3500A. Reports of overall findings or pooled analyses from published and unpublished in vitro, 
animal, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], or clinical studies must be submitted in a narrative format. Each notifi cation 
to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., "IND Safety Report," and must be 
transmitted to the review division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or in the Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and  Research that has respo nsibility for review of the IND. Upon request 
from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems 
necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1164690].  
HCC 17 -169  
42 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1164691] also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initia l 
receipt of the information . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Reporting format or frequency  
FDA may require a sponsor to submit IND safety reports in a format or at a frequency different than 
that required under this paragraph. The sponsor may also propose and adopt a different reporting  
format or frequency if the change is agreed to in advance by [CONTACT_838443].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1164692] marketing safety reporting requirements . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Reporting study endpoints  
Study endpoints (e.g., mortality or major morbidity) must be reported to FDA by [CONTACT_838444] 7.4.6 . However, if a 
serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis), the event must be 
reported under Serious and un expected suspected adverse reaction as a serious and unexpected 
suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study endpoint (e.g., all -cause mortality).  
 
7.2.7. Follow -up of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events   
 
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit that are designated as either recovering/resolving 
or not recovered/resolved, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_326918].  
 
All AEs will be followed until resolution of AE, completion of the subject’s participat ion, or study 
termination, whichever occurs first.  
 
Serious AEs and AEs resulting in discontinuation will be followed until one of the following occurs:   
• The event resolves.  
• The event stabilizes.  
• The event returns to a baseline value, if a baseline value is available.  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct.  
• The Investigator agree s that follow -up is no longer necessary.  
 
Follow -up rep orts from the Investigator must be provided as indicated using the SAE report form 
within  24 hours  of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the new information. Additional information 
(i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory, or other diagnostic test results) s hould be provided if requested 
and/or indicated.  
 
HCC 17 -169  
43 Rules for AE/SAE follow up apply to all subjects, including those who withdraw consent prior to study 
completion (to the extent allowed). The Investigator will ensure that follow up includes further 
investigations to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE/SAE. These investigations must be 
consistent with appropriate medical management and subject consent.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects t hat occur 
pursuant to the follow -up period. However, if the Investigator or designee learns of any AE or SAE 
at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study and the event is considered as 
reasonably related to the study drug, the Investigato r will notify the Sponsor.  
 
8 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
8.1 Study Design  
This is a non-randomized phase II single arm Simon ’s minimax two-stage study of neoadjuvant 
nivolumab and CMP -001. Nivolumab (I.V.) and CMP -001 (intra -tumorally) will be administered for 7 
weeks pre -operatively (week s 1-7) followed by [CONTACT_838445] 8 -10. Following 
recovery from surgery, nivolumab (I.V.) and CMP -001 (S.C.  or peri-tumoral resection site) will 
commence and continue for 48 weeks.  Details f or the two -stage design are in Section 8.3 . 
8.2 Safety Monitoring  
The PD -1/CMP -001 combination has been tested in the PD -1 refractory setting in melanoma 
including in a phase I study that evaluated multiple doses of CMP -001 including 5mg, 7.5mg and 
10mg. The safety profile observed thus far suggests that the risk of addi tive toxicities are  unlikely 
to be significantly increased  in the neoadjuvant setting. Further, the dose being tested in this study 
(5mg) is 50% the ceiling dose tested in other CMP -001 studies in combination with PD -1 inhibitors, 
none of which reported a toxicity rate >33%.  
However, in the context of this neoadjuvant trial, we will monitor dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for [ADDRESS_1164693] 3 patients accrued. DLT is defined as any adverse event(s) (AEs)  considered 
possibly, probably, or definitely re lated to the CMP -[ADDRESS_1164694] 15 days of therapy (i.e. following 3 doses of CMP -001; W1D1, W2D1, W3D1) IN the Prime 
phase  only.  Attribution of AEs specifically to either CMP -001 or nivolumab  is challenging, therefore, 
the relationship to CMP -001 should be based on attribution to the combination of the two drugs . 
During DLT monitoring period, no further accrual will be permitted.  Any patient who has started the 
studied treatment will be evalua ble for safety.  
The following AEs will be considered DLTs if deemed related to study therapy:  
• Hematologic  
o Grade 4 neutropenia  
o Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1000/mm3 with a 
temperature of ≥ 38.3 degrees °C  
o Grade ≥ 3 neutropenic infection  
o Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
o Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
• Non-hematologic

overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838423]: CMP -001 is designed to specifically bind to Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) which is  
expressed in the endosomes of pDCs. Upon activation through TLR9, pDCs will secrete large 
amounts of type 1 interferons and associated Th1 -promoting cytokines.  Given this mechanism of 
action, it is expected that the adverse event profile associated with intratumoral injection of CMP -
001 may be similar to that seen after administration of interferons (e.g . flu-like symptoms such as 
fever, rigors, nausea & vomiting). In addition, given the release of IFN -inducible chemokines and 
cytokines, symptoms associated with cytokine release, such as chills/rigors, fever, nausea/vomiting 
and hypotension, may occur wit hin hours of a CMP -001 intratumoral injection. Recommended 
prophylaxis, outlined above in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  may help to minimize the severity of these reactions . 
An AE believed to be caused by [CONTACT_838446] a DLT. Any such cases that would otherwise meet DLT criteria must be discussed 
immediately with the Principle Investigator . If the Principle Investigator and Sponsor agree that tumor 
flare is a likely explanation for the AE, treatment with CMP -[ADDRESS_1164695] CMP -001 and nivolumab  dosing withheld until the toxicity 
has returned to ≤ Grade 1. If the Inv estigator determines that continued treatment with CMP -[ADDRESS_1164696]’s best interest, treatment may resume at a reduced dose  (2.5mg weekly or every 4 
weeks; 1 dose level lower) at the same schedule after consultation with the Principle Investigator . If

dose level was tolerated without any DLTs; 2) Sponsor approval is given.  
8.[ADDRESS_1164698] been evaluated in the 
neoadjuvant context including: HDI  (Moschos et al. 2006) , ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Tarhini et al. 2014) , 
pembrolizumab (Forde et al. 2018)  and nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43809] (Blank et al. 2018; Amaria 
et al. 2018) . In earlier studies, response was typi[INVESTIGATOR_838424] (pCR) rates. Cognizant of the different mechanism of 
action of immuno -oncologic agents, more recent studies have utilized alternative means of assessing 
response using novel immuno -oncologic agent -specific cr iteria (major pathologic response or MPR 
rate) as delineated in Section 8.4 . In the latter studies, MPR rates reported with PD -1 inhibitors 
range from 28% (Nivolumab, melanoma) to 45% (Nivolumab/Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], melanoma)  (Huang et al. 
2019; Blank et al. 2018; Amaria et al. 2018) . 
However, the PD -1/CMP -001 combination has not been evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting and 
the MPR rate for this combination is unknown.  To balance efficacy while minimizing exposure of 
patients to a potentially ineffective combination, we utilize Simon’s minimax  two-stage design  with 
MPR as the primary endpoint.  
HCC [ADDRESS_1164699] the null hypothesis of 28% MPR versus the alternat ive hypothesis of 55% 
MPR. In the 1st stage, we will enroll 14 evaluable patients (defined in Section 5.8 ). If we see at least 
5/14 major pathologic responses, we will enroll a further 16 patients to the 2nd stage. The combination 
will be considered worthy of further evaluation if ≥13 responses are observed in both stages in 30 
evaluable patients.  The Simon’s minimax  two-stage design and sample size of 30 evaluable patients 
provides a type I error rate of 5%, with a power of 0.91. Allowing for 10% drop out rate, we set a total 
sample size of 33 patients . 
8.4 Efficacy Analysis  
Definition of evaluable patient  
See Section 5.8 . 
 
Determin ation of residual volume of tumor  (RVT)  
Early neoadjuvant studies in melanoma reported pCR utilizing criteria to define the residual volume 
of tumor (RVT) derived from neoadjuvant studies of chemotherapy in select tumors including lung 
cancer  (Hellmann et al. 2014)  
 
Neoadjuvant use of immuno -oncologic agents results in distinct histopathol ogic features compared 
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Specifically, neoadjuvant PD -1 therapy produces unusual features 
beyond CD8+ T cell infiltrate and tumor necrosis previously associated with response (Tumeh et al. 
2014)  including features in areas adjacent to the actual tumor – a location termed “the regression 
bed”. Histopathologic features associated with response herein include neovascularization; 
proliferative fibrosis; presence of cholesterol clefts; development of t ertiary lymphoid structures; 
presence of plasma cells, giant cells, foamy macrophages and granulomas (Cottrell et al. 2018; 
Tetzlaff et al. 2018) . 
 
This observations have led investigators to propose new criteria – immune related pathologic 
response criteria (irPRC) – wherein immune related  RVT (% irRVT) is defined as the total surface 
area of RVT divided by [CONTACT_838447] (comprising regression bed area + RVT area + areas 
of necrosis) (Cottrell et al. 2018; Tetzlaff et al. 2018) . Compared to standard methods , irPRC  had 
lower inter -observer variability better correlated with imaging assessments.  The neoadjuvant 
administration of PD -1 and/or CTLA -4 inhibitors is associated with high PRR; ranging from 25 -30% 
pCR (nivolumab monotherapy) to 45% pCR (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab combination)  (Amaria et al. 2018; 
Blank et al. 2018) . Primary endpoint of this study is MPR rate, where MPR is defined as ≤10% RVT 
remaining in post -therapy specimen using immunotherapy -specific criteria  based on residual volume 
of tumor  (RVT)  (Cottrell et al. 2018; Tetzlaff et al. 2018) . 
 
Residual tumor will be  determined in each resection specimen  as outlined in Appendix [ADDRESS_1164700] four 
(range, 1 to 14 slides). Hematoxylin -eosin stained sections will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_838448] .  
 
Definition of major pathologic response (MPR)  
MPR is defined as ≤10% RVT remaining  in post -therapy specimen using immunotherapy -specific 
pathologic response criteria ( irRPRC ) (Cottrell et al. 2018; Tetzlaff et al. 2018) . MPR  rate will be 
HCC [ADDRESS_1164701] 95% confidence interval. Other categories of response based  on 
%RVT are given below:  
• Pathologic complete response (pCR): 0% RVT  
• Major pathologic response (irMPR): ≤10%  RVT 
• Partial pathologic response: <10% but ≤ 50% RVT  
• Pathologic non -response: > 50% RVT . 
 
Definition of other endpoints  
RFS is defined as the time from initiation of treatment till melanoma relapse or death. All suspected 
relapse  should be biopsied to confirm relapse. In the event where this is difficult and/or dangerous, 
imaging may be used as a surrogate. OS is defined as the time from initiation of treatment till death. 
Kaplan -Meier estimate s of RFS and OS will be provided. The  corresponding median survival time 
(with 95% confidence intervals ) will be determined, along with survival estimates at selected time 
points (e.g. 6 months, 1 years, and 2 years).  
8.5 Safety Analysis  
As per NCI CTCAE Version 4.0, the term toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as 
either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The maximum grade for each type 
of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and freq uency tables will be reviewed to determine 
toxicity patterns.  
As CMP -001 has previously been dose -escalated in combination with PD -1 inhibitors 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab with minimal additional toxicities, no “dose -escalation” will be 
performed in this study. However, to accurately capture toxicities for this novel combination, we will 
be monitoring toxicities closely. The detailed data and safety monitoring plan is in Section 8.7. 
8.6 Biomarker Analysis  
To search for potential prognostic biomarkers (and toxicity marker) for the investigation regimen, 
logistic regression will be used to assess the association between each marker and clinical response 
(and occurrence of SAEs). The Cox  proportional hazards model will be used to assess the 
association of each marker and survival endpoints (i.e.  RFS and OS).   
 
8.7 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
All enrolled patients will be reviewed weekly to discuss AEs, in particular during DLT period.  
 
Principle Investigator/Sub -investigators, regulatory, CRS management, clinical research 
coordinators, clinical research associates, data managers, and clinic staff meet monthly in disease 
center Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) to review and discuss study data t o include, but not 
limited to, the following:   
• serious adverse events   
• subject safety issues   
• recruitment issues   
• accrual   
• protocol deviations   
• unanticipated problems   
• breaches of confidentiality  
 
HCC [ADDRESS_1164702] safety and decisions to continue, or close the trial to accrual are also 
discussed during these meetings. If any literature becomes available which changes the risk/benefit 
ratio or suggests that conducting the trial is no longer ethical, the IRB wil l be notified in the form of 
an Unanticipated Problem submission and the study may be terminated.  
 
All study data reviewed and discussed during these meetings will be kept confidential. Any breach 
in subject confidentiality will be reported to the IRB in t he form of an Unanticipated Problem 
submission. The summaries of these meetings are forwarded to the UPCI DSMC which also meets 
monthly following a designated format.  
 
For all research protocols, there will be a commitment to comply with the IRB’s policies  for reporting 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others (including adverse events). DSMC 
progress reports, to include a summary of all serious adverse events and modifications, and approval 
will be submitted to the IRB at the time of ren ewal.  
 
Protocols with subjects in long -term (survival) follow -up or protocols in data analysis only, will be 
reviewed twice a year rather than monthly by [CONTACT_384017].  
 
Both the UPCI DSMC as well as the individual disease center DSMB have the authority to suspend 
accrual or further investigate treatment on any trial based on information discussed at these 
meetings.  
 
All records related to this research study will be stored in a double locked environment. Only the 
researchers affiliated with the  research study and their staff will have access to the research records.

55 Detailed information for patients:  
• Thank  you for participating in this study . We are interested in evaluating your die tary history.  
To do this we are using a validated questionnaire termed the “Diet History Questionnaire 
(DHQ -3)”. 
• This questionnaire takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Yo u can do this either while 
receiving your therapy or at home.  
• After completing the questionnaire, you will receiv e a Respondent Nutrition Report. This 
report shows estimated daily nutrient and food group intakes based on questionnaire 
responses. Recommende d values are only available for some  nutrients and food groups.  
• Please feel free to discuss this with your study doctor.

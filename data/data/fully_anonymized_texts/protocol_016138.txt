SYNOPS IS 
Elevated blood pressure (BP) affects virtually all adults over the age of 65 years in the United 
States and is a risk factor for both cardiovascular events and falls, which are common causes of long-term disability and premature death. Many older adults ha ve limited mobility and experience 
food insecurity, relying on others for food preparation. Further, meals prepared for older adults are often high in sodium to overcome age -related declines in taste. Because of this, the Centers for 
Disease Control declar ed reduced -sodium meal plans in congregate living facilities a priority to 
combat the hypertension epi[INVESTIGATOR_594729]. However, many dietitians and health practitioners worry that low sodium in older adults could result in orthostatic hypotension (OH), causing impairments in physical function and consequently falls. Beyond BP there is evidence that sodium intake directly influences balance, seated -to-standing transitions, and gait speed. However, 
to date there are no clinical trials of the effects of sodium reduction on physical function.  
 We intend to perform an individual level randomized clinical trial at a community -based, 
congregate senior living facility that compares a reduced sodium meal plan ( <0.9 mg per kcal of 
energy intake ) to their typ ical meal plan (~ 2 mg per kcal of energy intake ). This proposal has the 
following aims: (1) to determine the short- term effects of sodium reduction on BP regulation and 
OH, a hypothesized mechanism by [CONTACT_594741]; (2)  to 
determine the short -term effects of a reduced sodium diet on physical function; and (3) to establish 
the premise for a longer -term trial by [CONTACT_594742], tolerability, and palatability. 
Ultimately, our two -tailed hypothesis ensures a high impact result long -term, since no effect on 
physical function would reinforce the safety of sodium reduction for cardiovascular disease prevention, while a positive relationship would reinforce a cautious approach to sodium reduction in this population. Be yond our scientific aims, our proposal will result in the development of a 
reduced sodium meal plan, using the leading food industry design platform, which can be readily 
implemented in a standardized fashion at long -term, senior care facilities throughout  the country.  
  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_594730] a clinical trial of sodium reduction in the prepared meals of semi-independent older adults. By [CONTACT_594743], our study will provide pertinent and timely guidance as to how sodium content in meals prepared for seniors impacts risk for clinical events that have long -term 
implications for independence.

Study Title : The Effect of Sodium Reduction on Blood Pressure and Physical Function in Older 
Adults (SOTRUE)  
Objectives  
 Specify the primary and secondary objectives . 
 
Virtually all older adults have hypertension, a known contributor to both cardiovascular disease 
and falls. The Centers of Disease Control has advocated  for low sodium, senior meal plans as a 
strategy to lower BP. (1) However, the long -term effects of low sodium intake on physical 
function are largely unknown in older adults. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594731] a randomized feeding study of a low sodium meal plan in a community -based, congregate senior living facility, will not only 
establish the premise for a definitive long -term trial on sodium reduction and physical function in 
older adults, but further contribute to a translatable, standardized menu that can be implemented en masse  at senior living facilities throughout the U.S. Our long- term goal  is to discover dietary 
interventions that enhance physical function as  adults age. The objective of this proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_594732]- level, random ized feeding study that 
examines the impact of sodium reduction on BP regulation among semi -independent, older 
adults. Our  central hypothesis  is that sodium reduction will reduce seated BP without causing 
OH. Improved BP regulation will enhance circulatory  function, efficiency of dynamic transitions 
from seated to standing positions, and ultimately a lower risk of falls.  
 
Primary Aim 1:  To determine the effects of a low sodium (<0.9 mg per kcal of energy intake), 
2-week  meal plan compared with a usual meal  plan (average sodium ~2 mg per kcal of energy 
intake) on seated BP among independently living older adults. 
Hypothesis Aim 1:  Compared with the usual meal plan, a reduced sodium meal plan will 
lower seated BP in older adults after 2 weeks.  
 
Feasibility A im 1:  To evaluate the recruitment experience, meal cost, meal delivery logistics, 
and compliance with and tolerability of the meal plan (urine sodium and palatability 
questionnaires). 
 
Feasibility Aim 2:  To determine effect size (variance) of secondary out comes: standing BP,  OH 
(standing minus seated BP), orthostatic symptoms, and a timed up and go test (TUG).  
  
Design and Outcomes   
 
This study is an individual -level, parallel, randomized clinical trial. Eligible participants will be 
randomized to low vers us usual sodium meal plans for two weeks. Assessments will be made at 
the in -person baseline visit, one week telephonic interview and 2 week in person follow -up visit. 
This proposal will be executed in collaboration with Dietetic Services of the Jack Satte r House  
(Revere), which is equipped with an industry -grade kitchen, chefs, and in- person dining as well 
as delivery services that collectively serve 255 residents. Further, the facility has private space for interviews and assessments. We plan to recruit 40 individuals (75% women).

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Significance  
Hypertension is rampant among older adults and is a major contributor to cardiovascular  disease, 
falls, and early death. Healthy diet is a critical determinant of BP, and decline in diet  quality is a 
common precursor to decline in global health. High sodium intake contributes to high blood pressure (BP), nevertheless, 9 of 10 Americans consume an excessive amount of dietary sodium 
each day .(2) Older adults with mobility limitations rely on others to prepare their foods, which 
are often high in sodium to combat age -related declines in taste. Eff orts to reduce sodium in 
senior meal plans have been stymied by [CONTACT_594745], summarized below.  
 1. Both hypertension and OH are fall risk factors. Uncontrolled high BP is a potent risk 
factor for falls among older adults. (3) Age -related hypertension results from vascular stiffness, 
decreased baroreceptor sensitivity, and altered sodium metabolism, contributing to low BP with changes in posture, called OH.(4, 5)  These acute drops in BP impair physical function. In our 
own studies, OH was associated with postural light -headedness, dizziness, and falls.(6 -8) In 
other studies, OH was strongly associated with impaired static (e.g. balance upon standing)  (9) 
and dynamic physical performance (e.g. chair stands, TUG, and 4m gait speed).( 10, 11)   
 2. Sodium is recommended to treat OH, but also worsens hypertension. While multiple 
studies have demonstrated improved orthostatic tolerance with sodium supplementation,(12 -15) 
a 2017 consensus statement highlighte d a need for long -term evidence, stating that the “long -
term risks associated with greater salt intake…need to be weighed against the short -term risks 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 11 
of…OH resulting in fall injury…the long -term risks of high sodium diets in individuals with OH 
have not been well studied .”(16, 17)   
 
3. Sodium reduction lowers BP with unknown effects on physical function.  Intensive 
pharmacologic treatment to lower BP reduces risk of OH without increasing risk of falls long-term. (18-20) Moreover, the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly (TONE) 
study, established sodium reduction as an effi cacious, non- pharmacologic intervention to lower 
BP in older adults.(21)  Whether reduced sodium reduced OH, improved physical function, or 
prevented falls was not reported. Nevertheless, several studies observed that long -term sodium 
reduction increased orthostatic tolerance in rats  (22) and had no effect on orthostatic tolerance in 
astronauts.(23)  In data from the DASH -Sodium trial, (24) we found that reduced sodium in the 
context of a healthy diet, actually decreased orthostatic light -headedness .(25)  
2.[ADDRESS_784619] largely been performed in middle -aged 
adults. Furthermore, sodium reduction is controversial in older adults, (26)  due to concerns about 
OH, which is highly prevalent among older adults and potentially worsened by  [CONTACT_594746]. This 
debate is perpetuated by [CONTACT_594747] a higher  risk of mortality 
among adults consuming a low sodium diet. In c ontrast, multiple studies have  shown that higher 
sodium consumption increases BP and causes lightheadedness. Furthermore, trials of BP management have demonstrated that lower BP decreases risk of OH  without increasing the risk 
of falls.  Given the controver sies surrounding sodium reduction, there has been a call for a 
definitive clinical trial from institutions worldwide, including: the Institutes of Medicine, the World Heart Federation, the European Society of Hypertension, and the European Public Health Association.(26)  One of the challenges facing prior studies of sodium reduction is achieving a 
controlled environment, (21, 27, 28)  especially among free living people. This has l ed some 
experts to suggest a population of prisoners, nursing home residents, or military personnel as 
ideal for a sodium trial. (26) However, ethical concerns, confounding medical conditions, or 
physical exertion requiring higher sodium are concerns in these populations. Our  approach of 
recruiting older adults, who participate in a meal plan of a congregate housing facility of HSL overcomes the above limitations, creating a controlled environment with the opportunity for a long- term intervention.   
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
• This is a  placebo -controlled, double -blinded randomized controlled trial . 
• Primary outcome includes seated blood pressure and secondary outcomes include 
orthostatic hypotension and timed up- and-go test.  
• The study includes two arms (1) Low sodium meal plan and (2) Us ual sodium meal 
plan. Forty participants will be enrolled in the study.  
• Study population includes older men and women residing in the Jack Satter House, a 
congregate housing facility in Revere. Approximate duration of enrollment period and follow -up (speci fy individual participant vs. entire trial)  
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 12 
• After baseline data collection, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 
meal plans: a usual meal plan (this is the current meal plan with an average sodium 
intake of 2g per kcal of energy intake)  or a low sodium meal plan (<0.9 g per kcal of 
energy intake similar to levels recommended by [CONTACT_594748]). Both normotensive and hypertensive individuals will be recruited. 
Hypertension treatment will be considered as a pre -specified stratification variable.  
• Urine will be collected from a random void at the baseline and follow up visits to measure sodium , potassium , and random creatinine . The samples will be sent to 
Quest Diagnostics Laboratories for analysis to measure excretion of these minerals 
pre and post exposure to the study diet. For urinary sodium the methodology used is 
ion selective electrode, with a reference range of 28 to 272 mmol/L. For urinary 
potassium sodium the methodology used is ion selective electrode , with a reference 
range of 12 -129 mmol/L . For random urinary creatinine  the methodology is kinetic 
colorimetry with a reference range for males of 20 -320 mg/dl and females of 20- 275 
mg/dl.  
• Quest Diagnostics is a nationally recognized CLIA certified labora tory capable of 
accurate and reproducible results on the analyses above. Reports are available 
electronically and will be uploaded directly into the statistical software at HSL via a 
CSV file.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Participant recruitment: We plan to recruit participants in several ways:  
• We will distribute flyers  and other recruitment materials  in the dining and recreational 
areas of the Satter House with staff discussing the program with residents.  
• Initial engagement meetings have demonstrated substantial interest among residents. Therefore, we plan to have engagement meetings every week.  
• We pl an to set up an information table with study flyers outside the resident cafeteria 
to provide study information and increase recruitment. 
• We will advertise the study details (information in the flyer) via voice friend  (tele -
messaging)  system at Satter Hous e as well as television. We anticipate ~75% of 
residents will have an eligible BP.  
• Direct phone calls to the  residents actively participating in the Jack Satter House meal 
plan. 
Procedures for documentation of screened participants who were not enrolled:   During pre -
screening phone calls and in -person screening visits, participants will be provided with the 
study information and data will be collected related to their medical records and medication list. Any participant deemed ineligible will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_105574]. Stephen 
Juraschek or [CONTACT_594772] ach. Those who were screened but not eligible or unwilling to 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 14 
participate will be documented in the screening log maintained by [CONTACT_594749]. 
Abby [INVESTIGATOR_413066].   
Consent Procedures:  Using the current IRB approved consent form the research assistant or 
physician will meet with the participant in a quiet, private location in Jack Satter House. The entire consent document will be reviewed with the participant, ensuring the participant ha s 
ample time to ask questions and understands the information. If requested by [CONTACT_2299] 
(due to visual difficulty or lower literacy) the consent will be read to the participant. Persons 
lacking the capacity to provide informed consent for themselves  are ineligible for SOTRUE.  
 The SOTRUE consent is all or none, if the participant refuses any parts or procedures of the 
study they may not enroll. If the participant decides to enroll they will sign and date the 
consent form. The study team member will also sign and date the form, and annotate the consent form with the participant’s study ID number. A copy of the signed document will be offered to the participant, and the original consent form will be stored in the locked research 
file, accessible to the  research team only.   
Randomization procedure : After baseline data collection, participants will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 meal plans: a usual meal plan or a low sodium meal plan. Randomization 
will be achieved using a web -based, password -protected, randomization software. While trial 
participants will know their intervention assignments, investigators and all study staff involved in baseline and follow -up data collection will be masked to participants’ randomization  
assignments. Study staff involved in administering the dietary intervention and assessing 
compliance will be masked to participants’ BP measurements. We will recruit the entire 
population cohort prior to initiating the intervention. 
[ADDRESS_784622] of two diet options  (one usual sodium and one reduced sodium)  for a 
two week period, during which participants will be asked to consume only the study diet 
provided. The study diets will be administered as described below. All participants will provide daily feedback on their consumption via a daily food log. Any issues of food intolerance or other possible adverse events (e.g. falls) will be reported to the study phy sicians for follow -up.

Participants will complete a daily food log, during the 2 week intervention period, and 
palatability questionnaires at study visits, to track compliance with and tolerability of the diet. Participants are blinded to their diet randomization and are asked not to discuss their study food with others during the course of the intervention.   
  
Meals for both the study arms will be kept as similar as possible except for the sodium content . 
 
Based on participant’s feedback, the protocol was changed and any partici pant who reported not 
consuming their meals via daily food logs were contact[CONTACT_594751]. This information was also collected at the 1 -week telephone visit for all participants. 
Portion sizes were altered based on part icipant’s preference. Furthermore, as a safe guard, 
participants who reported to be diabetic were contact[CONTACT_594752].  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  N/A 
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Participants will complete a daily food log, during the 2 week intervention period, and palatability questionnaires at study visits, to track compliance with and tolerability of the diet. Participants will be  asked to make every effort to consume the study diet in its entirety, or if 
unable to do so to eat some of each item in each meal. Participants will be  asked not to consume 
any non -study foods during the study intervention, but if they do, to include thes e foods in their 
daily diet log.

Protocol Template, Version 1. [ADDRESS_784625] occurs at the prescreening visit, 
when the study research assistant (RA ), postdoctoral fellow, or  study physician reads the 
prescreening script to the person and asks them if they are willing to be screened for eligibility to enroll in the study. If they verbally consent then additional data is obtained at both  prescreening 
and screening visits and kept in a locked file until it is determined if the person qualifies for 
enrollment. The person is given the RAs contact [CONTACT_594753]. 
 
At the second half of the screening visit (BV1a) a writte n consent is obtained by [CONTACT_594754]. A copy of the signed consent is provided to the participant. Documentation of signed consent is added to the consent log, which is checked at each visit. If the person declines to consent or is deemed ineligible , the initial information collected will be destroyed.  
 
Residents of Jack Satter  House may attend weekly educational sessions lead by [CONTACT_594755]. These sessions provide information about the study, as well as additional health education around the topi[INVESTIGATOR_594733]. Once enrolled in the study participants have access to the RA, study dietician, Study MD, and PI [INVESTIGATOR_594734].  
 
In the event that the study had a new consent form all currently active participants would be reconsented with the new consent form.  
 
Study research staff or physi cians will obtain consent. If the participant requests (due to visual 
difficulty or lower literacy) the consent will be read to the participant. Participants will be educated in the aims of the study and its implementation. They will have access to speak w ith 
members of the study team for any questions concerning the study.  
  
Screening   
Visit 1. [Screening (SV) and initial baseline visit (BV1a)]: Eligible  participants will be 
undergo written informed consent. Questionnaire based information on demography, self -
reported physical activity and medication list will be obtained for eligible  participants as part of 
the initial baseline visit. Assessments of orthostatic hypotension, M oCA and seated blood 
pressure will be done at this visit to check for eligibility  of the participant.  Weight and height 
will be measured to calculate targeted caloric intake.  This information will be needed in advance 
to prepare meals for the participants.  
6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization

Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 19 
o Symptoms and adverse events associated with sodium and orthostatic hypotension 
(headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, etc.)  
6.3 Description of Evaluations  
Urinary sodium and potassium and creatinine excretion. Spot urine collections, urinary sodium 
(Na), potassium (K), and creatinine excretion will be used to estimate group compliance with dietary aspects of the intervention (i.e., sodium excretion for salt intake and potassium excretion for fruit and vegetable intake). Urine specimens will be collected at baseline visit (visit 2) and 
the follow -up visit (visit 6). Specimens will be labeled with SOTRUE ID labels a nd retrieved by 
[CONTACT_594756] 48hr via courier. Specimens will be stored at room temperature until retrieval.  
 If the participant discontinues study intervention early, we plan to encourage the participant to continue to come for all the follow -up visits. 
7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
This is a dietary intervention study of typi[INVESTIGATOR_594735]’ natural environment and thus poses minimal risk. Nevertheless, it is possible the participants could develop an adverse reaction to a new ingredient or have fluctuations in blood pressure based on 
sodium levels that might increase fall risk.  
7.2 Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
Participants will be asked about any adve rse food reactions and any fall history prior to feeding, 
7-days into the study, and after the study is complete. We will also monitor blood pressure at day 
10 of the study. We will use the following definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events . 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE): any untoward or unfavorable medic al occurrence in a participant, 
temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in research (i.e., after RV), whether or 
not considered related t o participation in the research, including:  
o New disease diagnosis or illness  
o Worsening of pre -existing disease or illness  
o New or worsening symptom or sign  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  an adverse event that meets 1 or more of these criteria:  
o Results in death  
o Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o Is life threatening  
o Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
o Results in congenital abnormality or birth defect  
o Is a condition which the investigator judges to represent a significant hazard  
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 20 
o Is a SOTRUE -specific serious adverse event:  
 A fall event  
 An allergic reaction  
 Extremely high or low blood pressure measurements or high pulse rate*  
• Systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg 
• Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg 
• Diastolic blood pressure >110 mm Hg 
• Diastolic blood pressure < 40 mm Hg 
• Pulse rate >  120 beats per minute  
*Low blood pressures may require discontinuation of the study intervention. 
 
In the current project, no laboratory values are collected to assess safety.   
During the screening, run -in, intervention day 10- 13, and follow up visits participants will have 
their blood pressure checked. An algorithm will be followed by [CONTACT_594757], and to notify the study physician(s). At the baseline, telephone, and follow up visits information will be collected from participants about any adverse events, which will be reported to the study physician(s).   
 
Solicited adverse events includ e uncomfortable fullness, hunger, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, 
excessive thirst, fatigue, headache, lightheadedness with standing, nausea, falls, falls with injury, allergic reactions (including food related), and any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Additionally, t he participant 
may contact [CONTACT_594758] a fall or serious adverse event (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 
All study visit data will be collected by [CONTACT_594759] a R EDCap 
database. Data of clinical importance to eligibility or safety will be reviewed by a study physician. Study visits are scheduled frequently, and the duration of the intervention is [ADDRESS_784627] the m to notify us of any new health issue or accident, particularly any falls. We will 
capture details of any adverse events occurring from the time of randomization to study completion or to document absence of adverse events during the study period. 
 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 21 
If any  AE or SAE is reported the research assistant will inform the study physician, who will 
determine if it is safe for the person to continue in the study.  
 
Serious adverse events will be tracked until resolution or the end of the participant’s involvement 
in the study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_594736].     
 
For extreme blood pressure measurements observed at any time during the study we will adhere to the following procedure:  
 High Values  
 If SBP >  200:Notify SOTRUE Study Physician and advise participant to follow -up with 
primary care provider within 1 days (refer to emergency room if symptomatic)  
 If SBP >180:  Notify SOTRUE Study Physician and advise participant to follow -up with 
primary care provider within 3 days (same day if symptomatic)  
 If SBP >160, but ≤180:  Advise participant to follow up with primary care provider within 
1 month  
 If DBP > 120: Notify SO TRUE Study Physician and advise participant to follow -up with 
primary care provider within 1 days (refer to emergency room if symptomatic)  
 If DBP > 110: Notify SOTRUE Study Physician and advise participant to follow -up with 
primary care provider within 3 days (same day if symptomatic)  
 If DBP >100, but ≤110: Advise participant to follow up with primary care provider within 1 month  
 If Pulse >120 bpm: Do not have participant participate in the TUG test and advise them to follow up with their primary care provider within 7 days  
 
Low Values  
 If SBP <90: Notify SOTRUE Study Physician and advise participant to follow -up with 
primary care provider within 7 days  
 If DBP <40: Advise participant to follow up with primary care provider within 1 month  
 
Meal size concerns  
Participants with patterns of inadequate food quantity or conversely undereating due to the provision of too much food will be contact[CONTACT_594760]. In particular, we will reach out to participants with known glucose impairments  to ensure the appropriateness of 
their meal size with plans for adjustments based on feedback the preceding 3- 4 days.  
7.4 Safety Monitoring 
This study maintains a committee of physicians that will meet as needed to discuss safety 
concerns.  There is no formal DSMB.

Serious adverse events will be tracked until resolution or the end of the participant’s involvement in the  study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_594737] H ebrew Senior Life IRB.     
[ADDRESS_784629] the difference in seated SBP observed in the DASH -Sodium trial5 at 2-weeks ( -9.[ADDRESS_784630] deviation of 10.46, a type 1 error of 0.05 with 80% power), we would need 20 people in both arms (total 40). We will recruit 45 participants t o account for a 10% attrition rate. 
Effect and variance data from the other endpoints will be used for sample size calculations in subsequent proposals. 
9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Participants will be randomized using a computer -generated random ization scheme with varying 
sized blocks to 1 of 2 sequences in a 1:1 ratio such that approximately half of participants will 
undergo the low sodium diet  intervention, while the other half will undergo the usual sodium meal 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 24 
plan intervention. Sex will be used as a stratification variable to ensure that sex is evenly 
distributed between interventions.  
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_594738] : Given the short duration of the study, no interim analyses have been planned.  
9.[ADDRESS_784631] confirm that the residuals of seated blood pressure are normally distributed (if not 
then it will be log -transformed). We will compare net effect of reduced sodium versus usual 
diet on 2- week seated  blood pressure. This comparison will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a  linear 
regression with  adjustment for baseline seated blood pressure. We will perform an intent -to-
treat analysis.  
 
Our hypothesis is that 2- weeks of low sodium dietary  intervention will lower seated blood 
pressure compared to 2- weeks of usual sodium diet . The null hypothesis is that there will be 
no difference in seated blood pressure  between the two intervention arms . The comparison 
between the two treatment groups will be performed by [CONTACT_594762] (two -sided Wald test at 0.05 significance level).  
 
Secondary Pre- specified Subpopulations Analysis   
We will repeat the primary analysis to compare subpopulations based on the following criteria:  
1. Baselin e antihypertensive use (yes vs no)  
2. Baseline diabetes (yes vs no)  
3. Sex (men or women)  
 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. [ADDRESS_784632] 
modification by [CONTACT_393626]. Note these analyses are contingent on having sufficient number of participants with and without baseline antihypertensive use.  Other stratified or 
subpopulations analyses based on baseline charac teristics may be performed for hypothesis 
generation beyond the main study.  
 Sensitivity analyses  
1. Models from the analyses specified above will be fit with and without  adjustment for 
baseline seated blood pressure.  
2. We will perform three separate on- treatment analysis: (i) participants who ate 25% or less 
of non- study foods during the low sodium intervention, (ii) participants whose estimated 
calorie intake was met or exceeded by [CONTACT_594763], and (iii) pers ons who did not change antihypertensive medications during the 
post-randomization study period 
 
Analyses of other outcomes  
• Compliance: Compliance will be quantified by (i) counts and proportion of participants 
who ate 25% or less of non- study foods during the low sodium intervention, (ii) counts 
and proportion of participants whose estimated calorie intake was met or exceeded by [CONTACT_594764]. The data will be reported by [CONTACT_6654]. 
• Secondary Endpoints: We will examine the effect of the low sodium diet on the following 
additional outcomes, testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the following 
outcomes between the low sodium diet and usual sodium diet intervention. Continuous outcome s will be evaluated using linear regression to compare change between the 2 
interventions arms with and without adjustment for baseline. We will examine the distribution of all variables. We will use linear regression for normally distributed outcomes and logistic regression for binary outcomes. Continuous variables with non-normal residuals will be log -transformed with effects reported as a % change.  
 
o Seated diastolic blood pressure  
 Continuous variable, normal distribution  
o Standing  blood pressure  
 Continuous variable, normal distribution  
o Orthostatic hypotension 
 Binary variable, binomial distribution  
o Timed Up and Go Test  
 Continuous variable, normal distribution  
o Urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine excretion  
 These may require log- transformation;  anticipate continuous variables, 
normal distribution  
o Orthostatic symptoms  
 Binary variables (severe vs not), binomial distribution 
 
  
Protocol Template, Version 1. 8 26 
Handling of missing data:  We will employ a number of recommended strategies to prevent 
missing data:  
• A simplified data collection schedule that minimizes participant burden;  
• Intention- to-treat analysis that includes following participants according to the data 
collection schedule regardless of compliance with the study intervention;  
• Frequent engagement with the participants through visit reminder calls or notes;  
• A [ADDRESS_784633] for questions and support;  
• Contiguous windows of time during which specific follow -up visits are allowed; 
• Monetary incentives to encourage enrollment and continued participation;  
• Rigorous training of clinic staff emphasizing the importance of  
o Positive and warm interpersonal relationships between the participants and study 
staff  
o Study commitment during the consent process to ensure that potential participants understand the importance of completing the study  
o Addressing participant concerns to minimize dissatisfaction  
o Collecting data even if a participant discontinues the study treatment  
o Reasons for any drop- outs will be documented.  
 We will perform  the followi ng sensitivity analyses using established methods for addressing  
missingness in clinical trials: multiple  imputation s, best and worst -case scenarios, and use of the 
drop out event as a study end- point.
9 We will compare the results from these approaches  with 
primary analysis result's to  assess the primary result’s robustness t o the effects of missing data.   
Further, we will compare the baseline characteristics of  complete cases and  participants with 
missing measures between the two assignments . 
 
Safety outcomes  
We will compare self -reported symptoms that are thought to potentially arise from the diets.  The 
symptoms will be summarized by [CONTACT_594765]. The treatment groups will be compared with respect to safety outcomes by [CONTACT_2329] a chi-square test (Fisher exact test w hen there are cell counts less than 5).

 Page 3 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 1.0 Objectives 1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives. Response:  Aim 1.  To compare the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin and metoclopramide in the treatment of HG. Aim 2. (1)  (Exploratory)  To assess the change from Baseline in efficacy measures after 2 weeks of open-label gabapentin; and (2) (Descriptive) to assess the mean gabapentin dose, duration of gabapentin treatment and frequency of rescue metoclopramide pi[INVESTIGATOR_52948]-label gabapentin phase of the study. 1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested. Response: Is gabapentin more effective than metoclopramide	for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in women with hyperemesis gravidarum?  2.0 Background 2.1 Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. See section 2.3. 2.2 Describe any relevant preliminary data.  Response: See description above in Section 2.3  2.3 Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and significance of the research based on the existing literature and how will it add to existing knowledge. Response:  Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a disease of severe nausea, vomiting, and anorexia associated with early pregnancy leading to dehydration and weight loss.  HG has been coined a “heart-sink problem” for gynecologists because of the frustration of not being able to cure such distressed women and because of the prolonged and repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614].1  A recent meta-analysis of HG randomized controlled trials concluded that there are no effective treatments for this condition.2  As a result, more than 50,000 HG patients a year require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52949] (iv) hydration or parenteral nutrition.3,[ADDRESS_56064] for each woman with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.5  HG also inflicts significant psychosocial burden on patients.  In a recent on-line survey of 808 women with HG, 15.2% reported electively terminating at least one pregnancy due to HG.6  The top 3 reasons for terminating were “No hope for relief” (87.0%), “Unable to care for self or family” (66.7%), and “Emotional distress” (60.2%).  In this same survey, an additional 12.7% of women with HG reported that they “almost” terminated a pregnancy due to HG.  Therefore, about 28% of babies whose mothers have 
 
 Page 4 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 HG are at high risk for death.  There is a large clinical need for a safe and effective treatment for HG that will bring meaningful benefit and, consequently, decrease the high rate of associated fetal mortality.  Eight of the 9 published HG randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed their primary outcome measures while subjects were inpatients, where subjects experience very high placebo effects especially regarding rates of emesis (placebo effect mean of 82%).1,7-13  Even though patients’ symptoms improve greatly when they are inpatients, about 35% require readmission after discharge.[ADDRESS_56065] to report on open-label gabapentin’s benefit for refractory nausea and vomiting15,16 and theorized that gabapentin may be effective for HG.  An open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_52950] (see Appendix).17   Preliminary studies:  This clinical study protocol was first submitted to the FDA as Investigational New Drug (IND) 79,612 and was approved by [CONTACT_52994]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), and later by [CONTACT_52995][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s IRB, before any subjects were enrolled.  All subjects provided written informed consent.  We initially enrolled [ADDRESS_56066] dose at the time of enrollment.  They were given instructions on how to slowly increase the dose to a minimum of 1,200mg/day and a maximum of 3,600mg/day.  After 14 days of therapy, gabapentin was discontinued for 2 days to determine if symptoms recurred.  If there was a > 50% increase in nausea or vomiting while off gabapentin, gabapentin could be resumed on Day 17 and for the remainder of the pregnancy, if necessary.    The primary outcome measures were percent reduction in nausea and emesis/retching from Baseline to the mean of Days 12-14 based on subjects’ daily recordings on the validated Motherisk-PUQE (pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis) diary.18    Results:  The median gestational age at the time of enrollment was [ADDRESS_56067] 3+ ketonuria and >5% weight loss from their pre-pregnancy weight at Baseline.  The mean number of anti-emetics tried before enrolling was 2.4.  The first 3 subjects were enrolled as inpatients and managed as outpatients while the other 4 subjects were enrolled and managed as outpatients. Gabapentin’s onset of action appeared to be very rapid with all 7 subjects experiencing a ≥50% decrease in nausea by [CONTACT_2006] 2 of gabapentin therapy and complete resolution of emesis by [CONTACT_2006] 4.  The 3 subjects enrolled as inpatients were discharged 2, 3, and 2 days after starting gabapentin, respectively.  
 
 Page 5 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 None of the subjects required admission/readmission for hyperemesis after starting gabapentin.  The mean reductions in nausea and emesis from Baseline to Days 12-14 were 80% and 94%, respectively, and 84% and 98%, respectively, from Baseline to Days 19-21.19  There was a >3x increase in mean nausea and a >7x increase in mean emesis scores associated with discontinuing gabapentin during Days 15-16.  These data and oral nutrition scores are summarized in Figure 1.  Subjects gained an average 0.85 pounds from Baseline to Day 21.  The mean maximum daily gabapentin dose was 1,843mg.   Figure 1: Mean nausea, emesis and nutrition scores (n=7) 
   On Day 12, the amount of relief experienced from gabapentin on the 7-point Likert scale was reported as “6” by 4 subjects and “7” by 3 subjects.  The degree of satisfaction with gabapentin was recorded as “Satisfied” by 4 subjects and “Very Satisfied” by 3 subjects.  Subjects 8 & [ADDRESS_56068] 10 was enrolled as an inpatient and experienced a 100% resolution of emesis and a near full resolution of nausea and impaired nutritional intake by [CONTACT_52996] 12-14.

 Page 6 of 42 Revised: December 7, [ADDRESS_56070] delivered twins by C-section at 33 weeks gestation.  This pregnancy was conceived via in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  One twin had a tethered spi[INVESTIGATOR_52952] a lumbar skin tag requiring surgical correction while the other twin had no congenital defects.  These congenital defects have been reported to the FDA under IND 79,612.  In addition to the 11 subjects enrolled into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], another HG patient was treated with gabapentin by a local nurse practitioner (NP) who was familiar with our research.  This patient had a history of HG with [ADDRESS_56071] 10 pounds over the previous week (=4.3% of her pre-pregnancy weight), was found to have 3+ ketonuria, and was no longer able to work as a nurse due to persistent nausea and vomiting despi[INVESTIGATOR_52953], as prescribed.  She told her NP that she was going to have to terminate the pregnancy due to the severe and medically refractory symptoms and her inability to work. After the NP informed the patient on the promising results from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the patient agreed to first try gabapentin before making a final decision to terminate the pregnancy.  After receiving 3 liters of iv hydration, the patient started gabapentin 300mg tid on 7/19/11 at 12 weeks gestation.  By [CONTACT_52997] 7/20/11, the patient reported that her nausea and vomiting had improved by [CONTACT_2902] 90% and she was having no difficulty tolerating normal oral nutrition and hydration.  Within a few days, the patient returned to her nursing job full-time and continued to work until she delivered.  The patient also did not require any more iv hydration throughout the pregnancy.  On 9/9/11, gabapentin was increased to 300mg bid and 600mg qhs for some recurrent symptoms with good response.  The patient continued to take metoclopramide and ondansteron, as needed, which was 1-2x/week.  Metoclopramide and ondansetron were discontinued at week 21 and 26 gestation, respectively.  Gabapentin was continued until spontaneous labor began at 38 weeks gestation. A healthy baby [CONTACT_52998] 2 days later.  Only 1 of the 12 patients treated with gabapentin for HG to date has required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]/readmission for HG, which occurred 12 weeks after initiating gabapentin.  This markedly contrasts the 20-40% readmission rate within [ADDRESS_56072] been consistent with our previous experiences using gabapentin in other patient populations experiencing severe and refractory nausea and/or emesis.15,[ADDRESS_56073] significant benefit in the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.20-22  Gabapentin’s main clinical use is in the treatment of neuropathic pain, which is one of its FDA-approved indications.  Gabapentin’s mechanism of action in this condition is mediated through its specific neuronal binding site, the alpha-2/delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs),23,[ADDRESS_56074] likely by [CONTACT_52999] a calcium 
 
 Page 7 of 42 Revised: December 7, [ADDRESS_56075].25,26  In the leading animal model of neuropathic pain, alpha-2/delta subunits were shown to upregulate 17x in sensory neuronal cell bodies in response to an experimental nerve lesion associated with allodynia and neuropathic pain.27  It has been theorized that this dramatic upregulation in alpha-2/delta subunits is not only involved in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain but also is what offers the opportunity for gabapentin’s clinical efficacy in this condition.27  It has also been theorized that upregulation in this subunit in the nervous system’s temperature regulatory centers in response to plummeting estrogen levels at menopause is involved with the pathophysiology of hot flashes and accounts for gabapentin’s effectiveness in relieving hot flashes and night sweats.28 In the treatment of HG, we theorize that gabapentin mitigates calcium currents in nausea/vomiting centers (such as the area postrema of the medulla) by [CONTACT_53000]-2/delta subunits of that have been upregulated in response to the dramatic increases of estrogen and progesterone early in pregnancy.    In terms of gabapentin’s safety during pregnancy, there have been 5 infant major congenital malformations (MCMs) reported among [ADDRESS_56076] trimester gabapentin monotherapy exposures.17,29-32  Two of these 5 MCMs were from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], as described above.  This equals a 1.7% rate (5/294) of infant MCMs.  Comparing this rate with that found in the general population, the rate of MCMs detected by [CONTACT_53001] 1968 and 2003 was 2.1%,33 while the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52954] a MCM frequency of 1.6%–2.2% at birth depending on whether chromosomal and genetic abnormalities were included in the calculation.[ADDRESS_56077] in 7/[ADDRESS_56078] enrolled 7 subjects as of 6/14/15.  However, recently several eligible patients have informed us that they did not want to participate in this study due to the publicity stemming from [ADDRESS_56079] that it has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, due to the 12/[ADDRESS_56080] that once the Andersen et al. study is formally published, there will be more media attention on this issue, which will serve to make it even more difficult for us to enroll into our current clinical trial if we maintain the ondansetron treatment arm. Due to this new information, that was not anticipated at the time that our study protocol was approved, we requested approval from the NIH to change the ondansetron treatment arm to a metoclopramide treatment arm.  On 6/5/15, the NIH approved this

Response:  Eligibility Criteria: 1) Have received at least 2 administrations of intravenous (iv) hydration separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_56082] 7 days and 1 administration of iv hydration. 2) Have at least one of the following: 2-4+ ketonuria, serum potassium < 3.4mmol, or >5% weight loss from weight upon entry to prenatal care at any time during the current pregnancy. 3) Have failed therapy with at least one antiemetic. 4) Have fetal ultrasound within 6 weeks prior to enrollment confirming a normal-appearing, intrauterine, singleton pregnancy of gestational age < 16 weeks at time of enrollment. 5) Felt by [CONTACT_102]’s obstetrician or emergency room attending physician not to have other medical problems such as bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, biliary colic, or peptic ulcer disease that could be contributing to the patient’s symptoms. 6) Be >18 years old and not decided to terminate the pregnancy. 7) Have not received or planning to receive a peripherally inserted central catheter (PIC line). 8) Have a Motherisk-PUQE score of ≥12 for the 24-hour Baseline period. 9) Felt not to have any other significant medical, psychiatric or substance abuse problem that would preclude participation in the study. 10) Agrees to discontinue any current anti-emetic treatments (including antihistamines, ginger, > 10mg/day vitamin B6, serotonin or dopamine antagonists, anticholinergics, acupuncture, hypnosis, or wrist bands) for the next 3 weeks. 
 
 Page 12 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 11) Pregnancy not conceived through in-vitro fertilization. 12) Has not previously tried gabapentin for hyperemesis  13) No previous evidence of intolerance to metoclopramide 14) Able to understand and comply with the study procedures and give informed consent. 15) Not currently enrolled in another research study. 3.2 Describe how individuals will be screened for eligibility. Response:  Referred subjects will be interviewed to assess for eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be given a verbal overview of the study and then provided with a copy of the Consent Form to review.  After the subject has reviewed the Consent Form all questions will be answered and subject comprehension of study procedures will be confirmed before written consent is obtained. 3.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include or exclude each of the following special populations: (You may not include members of these populations as subjects in your research unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.) • Adults unable to consent • Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) • Pregnant women • Prisoners Response: This study will include pregnant women (at 18 years old) who have the capacity to provide consent. Adults who do not have the capacity to consent, and prisoners will not be included.  3.4 Indicate whether you will include non-English speaking individuals.  Provide justification if you will exclude non-English speaking individuals.  (In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection of subjects, non-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded from research.  In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent or is designed to investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who may not speak English, the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit and include non-English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies in which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak English: e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], small unfunded studies with validated instruments not available in other languages, numerous questionnaires, and some non-therapeutic studies which offer no direct benefit.)   
 
 Page 13 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 Response: The validated questionnaires are not available in non-english translation.   4.0 Study-Wide Number of Subjects (Multisite/Multicenter Only) 4.1 If this is a multicenter study, indicate the total number of subjects to be accrued across all sites. Response: A total of 60 women with HG will be enrolled into this study. 5.0 Study-Wide Recruitment Methods (Multisite/Multicenter Only) If this is a multicenter study and subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_28585] (e.g., call centers, national advertisements) describe those methods.  Local recruitment methods are described later in the protocol. 5.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited. Response: [CONTACT_53032] and [CONTACT_53033] have provided information about the study to providers with contact [CONTACT_53004].   5.2 Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects. Response: Providers will notify the study team of potential study subjects, based on meeting basic inclusion criteria.  In addition, study personnel will use the electronic medical record to screen ER patients at the study’s enrolling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  ER patients who may be eligible for this study will only be approached or contact[CONTACT_53005]/Gyn and ER provider.  A HIPAA waiver for these activities is currently approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 5.3 Describe materials that will be used to recruit subjects. (Attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_52963]. For advertisements, attach the final copy of printed advertisements. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final audio/video tape. You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior to tapi[INVESTIGATOR_47222]-tapi[INVESTIGATOR_47223], provided the IRB reviews the final audio/video tape.)

Response: N/A  9.0 Procedures Involved 9.1 Describe and explain the study design. Response: Randomized, double-blinded, 2-arm, parallel-design comparative clinical trial (gabapentin vs. metoclopramide). 9.2 Provide a description of all research procedures being performed and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety or minimize risks. Response: If eligibility is confirmed, a venous blood draw will be performed to be tested for screening blood work consisting of a complete blood count with platelets, a chemistry profile including liver function tests (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin), and a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level.  A fetal ultrasound will only be performed if one hasn’t been performed within the previous 6 weeks. Subjects will receive instructions (verbal and written) on how to complete the Patient Data Form, which they will complete every day for the next 21 days.  Gabapentin 300mg or metoclopramide 7.5mg will be identically-appearing and will be initiated as follows: 1 capsule at the time of enrollment and 1 capsule at bedtime on Day 1; 1 capsule in the morning, 1 capsule in the afternoon, and 1 capsule at bedtime on Day 2; 1 capsule in the morning, 1 capsule in the afternoon, and 2 capsules at bedtime on Day 3; 1 capsule in the morning, 2 capsules in the afternoon, and 2 capsules at bedtime on Day 4; and then 2 capsules tid on Days 5-7.  For subjects still experiencing bothersome nausea or vomiting after Day 5, the dose can be increased to 2 capsules qid for Days 6-7.  Gabapentin serum ½ life in humans is 5-7 hours, therefore, tid or qid dosing provides adequate full day coverage.  A maximum of 8 capsules a day equates to 2,400mg of gabapentin or 60mg of metoclopramide a day.  The gabapentin dose titration has been chosen based on our experiences with efficacy and 
 
 Page 17 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 tolerability of gabapentin over the initial 14 days of treatment in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Out of the 12 HG patients receiving gabapentin, 11 experienced satisfactory relief at a maximum dose of 2,100mg/day or less, while [ADDRESS_56085] required 2,700mg/day.  The maximum FDA-approved oral metoclopramide dose is 60mg a day for treating nausea and vomiting recommended maximum oral metoclopramide dose is 60mg a day for treating nausea and vomiting..41   The titration schedule can be slowed and/or the total daily dose decreased if bothersome side effects occur or if the subject requests due to adequate symptom control.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_53008] [ADDRESS_56086] 7 days to monitor subjects’ HG symptoms, to monitor for any study drug-related side effects, to confirm that subjects are filling out the Patient Data Form every day and to answer questions. If a subject cannot be reached at the primary phone number, all secondary numbers will be called. If a subject cannot be reached after [ADDRESS_56087] the study team for readings of 2-4+ ketones.  More symptomatic subjects will be contact[CONTACT_53009], such as lightheadedness or dizziness.  Subjects with 2-4+ urine ketones who are experiencing frequent vomiting or poor oral hydration and subjects otherwise felt to have symptomatic dehydration will be told to see their obstetrician or go to the ER that day for further evaluation. All subjects’ obstetricians will be notified of their participation in this study. On about Day 8, subjects will return for a follow-up visit (Visit 2) and will bring their completed Data Forms, and all unused study drug with them.  If the subject is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965] 8, this visit will occur at their bedside.  At this visit, the Patient Data Forms will be collected and, for subjects who had not received repeat iv hydration during the study, the NVPQOL, HGPTC and Satisfaction questionnaires will be completed.  A venous blood draw will be performed and tested for the screening blood work.  Subjects will be asked about adverse events, concomitant medications/treatments, and weight and urine ketone level will be recorded.  Subjects who have not withdrawn from the study will be offered open-label gabapentin treatment at Visit [ADDRESS_56088] recurrent symptoms during this titration period. In addition, metoclopramide 10mg po qid prn breakthrough vomiting can be used during the open-label phase. Subjects will be instructed to limit the 
 
 Page 18 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 use of metoclopramide for breakthrough nausea or vomiting to 4 times a day, not to exceed 40mg. The Open Label Patient Data Form will be filled out daily for an additional 14 days and brought, along with any unused study drug to the final follow-up visit (Visit 3) on about Day 22.  If the subject is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965] 22, this visit will occur at their bedside.  At this visit, the Patient Data Forms will be collected and the NVPQOL, HGPTC and Satisfaction questionnaires will be completed.  A venous blood draw will be performed and tested for the screening blood work.  Subjects will be asked about adverse events and concomitant medications/treatments, and weight and urine ketone level will be recorded. Subjects in the open label phase of the study will be followed up with weekly to assess any adverse events or side effects. Subjects will be instructed to call the study team sooner if necessary. Subjects will be supplied with enough gabapentin and prn metaclopromide to last until [ADDRESS_56089] has been taking metoclopramide for 12 weeks, it will be discontinued to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia (<1%). Subjects needing additional relief from breakthrough nausea and vomiting will be instructed to discuss the options with their OB/GYN provider.  Only the lowest effective gabapentin dose will be used.  Based on the site investigator’s discretion, subjects may be supplied with additional gabapentin at 4 weeks intervals after 18 weeks gestation.   Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks. Response: After enrollment, subjects will be followed up with daily or every other day depending on symptom severity, and will be asked about side effects, and oral intake status. Subjects will be provided with ketone strips and recommendations for IV fluids will be made as necessary.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_52966], should the subject have questions or experience side effects. Titration to the ideal dose will occur at the start of the study and appropriate dose adjustments can be made at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52967].  Subjects will be informed, in writing, about the current state of knowledge regarding gabapentin’s safety in pregnancy during the informed consent process.  Subjects will also be updated with any new safety information regarding gabapentin use during pregnancy or distinct from pregnancy that comes to light after they are enrolled.  Drs. Guttuso and Thornburg will review and sign/date weekly all case report forms, data forms and adverse event forms at each respective site. 9.3 Describe all drugs and devices used in the research and the purpose of their use, and their regulatory approval status. Response: Gabapentin is currently approved by [CONTACT_53010] & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of certain types of pain, seizures, and restless legs syndrome (the urge to keep moving the legs while laying or resting). Gabapentin is being used in this study for the treatment of

Response: data will be collected through the use of:  Patient Data forms (daily diary) Hyperemesis Gravidarum Pregnancy Termination Consideration Questionnaire (HGPTC)  The Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Quality of Life Questionnaire (NVPQOL) Satisfaction Questionnaire (All above documents are currently approved by [CONTACT_53011]) 9.5 What data will be collected including long-term follow-up. Response: data regarding symptom severity/frequency, oral intake, satisfaction of symptom resolution, consideration of pregnancy termination and quality of life measures will be collected in the blinded and open label phases.   Subjects will be followed until delivery and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52968]’ pediatrician records will be assessed for maternal and fetal outcomes. 9.6 For HUD uses provide a description of the device, a summary of how you propose to use the device, including a description of any screening procedures, the HUD procedure, and any patient follow-up visits, tests or procedures. Response: N/A. No HUD’s being utilized in this study.  10.0 Data and Specimen Banking 10.1 If data or specimens will be banked for future use, describe where the data/specimens will be stored, how long they will be stored, how the data/specimens will be accessed, and who will have access to the data/specimens. Response: N/A. No data or specimen banking will occur 10.[ADDRESS_56091] the data to be stored or associated with each specimen. Response: N/A. No data or specimen banking will occur 
 
 Page 20 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 10.3 Describe the procedures to release data or specimens, including: the process to request a release, approvals required for release, who can obtain data or specimens, and the data to be provided with specimens. Response: N/A. No data or specimen banking will occur 11.0 Data Management 11.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures. Response:  The Biostatistics Department at the U of R, under the direction of Xin Tu, PhD, will update the data set at least weekly.  Completeness of the data will be monitored by [CONTACT_25733]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_52969].  There will not be any interim analyses of the data. All statistical tests are two-sided with p<0.05. Descriptive statistics (counts and proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes) will be used to depi[INVESTIGATOR_52970] (e.g., age, race, insurance, number of prior pregnancy and relevant co-morbid conditions). We will also compare baseline characteristics across the two treatment conditions using methods appropriate to the data type such as t-tests, chi-square and/or Fisher's exact tests. We will also examine associations between the outcome variables and patients’ characteristics.  For those significantly associated with outcomes, we will treat them as covariates when constructing treatment comparisons (see below).   The primary as well as most of the secondary outcomes are change scores of pertinent variables over the two-week treatment period. We will model the change of such outcomes using longitudinal data methods based on the repeated assessments (e.g., pre-post changes and daily PUQE). For the outcomes that are collected once such as Satisfaction Questionnaire scores at Day 28, cross-sectional models such as t-test and regression (adjusting for the covariates identified) will be used to compare treatment differences.   We will use the two popular approaches, the weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) and the mixed-effects model (MM)42-44, for modeling treatment differences over time. Both approaches will be used for assessing treatment differences, which provide valid inference in the presence of missing data if the missing value follows the missing at random (MAR) assumption, a popular mechanism that applies to most studies in practice.43,[ADDRESS_56092] inference, especially in the presence of missing data.43-45  Given the relatively small sample size in the study, traditional inference based on the large sample theory may not provide accurate estimates. We may

Response:  In our proposed RCT, we anticipate a more conservative treatment effect of at least 20% for the Primary Outcome Measure and a mean Baseline Motherisk-PUQE score of 22.  Specifically, we anticipate a mean 70% decrease in Motherisk-PUQE scores for the gabapentin group (a decrease of 15.4 points, from 22 to 6.6) and a 50% decrease in Motherisk-PUQE scores for the ondansetron group (a decrease of 11 points, from 22 to 11).  Therefore, we anticipate a 4.4 point difference (15.4-11) for the Primary Outcome Measure and we will assume a conservative SD of 6. With these considerations, 30 subjects/group will provide 80% power to detect an inter-group difference in the Primary Outcome Measure with a two-sided type I error = 0.05. Describe the steps that will be taken secure the data (e.g., training, authorization of access, password protection, encryption, physical controls, certificates of confidentiality, and separation of identifiers and data) during storage, use, and transmission. Response: Original subject data forms will be retained in each subject’s individual study file and kept secured in a locked cabinet at each respective site. Data from the original forms will be entered onto a secure electronic database set up through the University of [COMPANY_002]ster. Only study personnel will have access to entering data on this database.   After study completion, [CONTACT_53033] will bring the data forms from U of R to his locked office at UB.  All data forms will have no subject identifiable information on them.  There is no plan to release subject identifiers. 11.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data. Response: Drs. Guttuso and Thornburg will review and sign/date weekly all case report forms, data forms and adverse event forms at each respective site. 11.4 Describe how data and specimens will be handled study-wide: Response: Data will be entered into a secured study database, by [CONTACT_53012], controlled by [CONTACT_53013]. Only study team members have access to this site.  11.5 What information will be included in that data or associated with the specimens? 
 
 Page 22 of 42 Revised: December 7, 2020 Response: questionnaire responses, diary data, adverse event data, IV hydration data, and study termination, and pregnancy termination data will be stored in the database. All data will be de-identified   11.6 Where and how data or specimens will be stored? Response: original copi[INVESTIGATOR_52971] a study binder designated for each subject. Electronic data will be stored on the study database. 11.7 How long the data or specimens will be stored? Response: Data will be stored for at least [ADDRESS_56094] access to the data or specimens? Response: only IRB-approved study members will have access to the data. Data management personnel will have access to the database for maintenance or troubleshooting issues, however all data is de-identified. 11.9 Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data or specimens? Response: Approved study personnel will transmit de-identified data onto the electronic data entry system 11.10How data and specimens will be transported? Response: Data will be kept by [CONTACT_53014] a locked cabinet in the UB OB/GYN offices 12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data and Ensure the Safety of Subjects 12.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe.   Response:  The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the study’s progress every 6 months and may perform an interim analysis of the data if so requested by [CONTACT_18121].  If there is a significant intergroup difference with a p<0.001 or an insignificant intergroup difference with a p>0.70, the DMC will be asked to consider terminating the study due to efficacy or futility rationale, respectively.  The DMC will consist of: Eva K. Pressman, MD, Professor and Chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Director of Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, University of [COMPANY_002]ster; J. Christopher Glantz, MD, MPH, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, University of [COMPANY_002]ster; Changyong Feng, PhD, Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of [COMPANY_002]ster; and Sireesha Y. Reddy, MD, Professor and Vice Chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology, [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso.Adverse Events Review:  
 
 Page 23 of 42 Revised: December 7, [ADDRESS_56095] adverse events: Subjects will be directly asked by [CONTACT_53015], including the 3 scheduled study site visits.  All adverse events (AE’s) will be recorded on the AE report form and communicated within 7 business days to our Data Management Center at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster.  All AE’s will be summarized in an Excel file and emailed monthly to the study’s Safety Monitor, Patrick M. Mullin, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Southern [LOCATION_004]. For serious subject adverse events: An adverse event will be considered “serious” (SAE) if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_52972] (Drs. Guttuso and Thornburg) the adverse event resulted in subject death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  This is the definition of SAE according to the FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies. When a study team member becomes aware of a possible subject SAE, the study team member will contact [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_52973].  The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_52974], [CONTACT_53033], by [CONTACT_53016].   An SAE that is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Guttuso to be a) unexpected, and b) reasonably possible to have been caused by [CONTACT_53017] a “Reportable Event”.  [CONTACT_53033] will report such events to both of the study IRB’s within 5 business days of the study team’s first awareness of the event.  [CONTACT_53033] will also report the event to the FDA as an “IND safety report” within 7 calendar days of the study team’s first awareness of the event, per the FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.   All SAE’s will also be communicated to the Data Management Center and emailed to the Safety Monitor within 5 business days of the study team’s first awareness of the event. For example, if a subject was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52975], this would be considered an SAE; however, this would not be considered a “Reportable Event” since it was both anticipated in this patient population and not considered reasonably possible to have been caused by [CONTACT_53018].  On the other hand, an incident of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or an infant congenital defect would be considered “Reportable Events” since they were serious, unanticipated and could possibly have been caused by [CONTACT_53018].

If the Safety Monitor recommends a protocol amendment, no further subjects will be enrolled until the amendment is approved by [CONTACT_53021]’s and the FDA.  Actively enrolled subjects will continue taking their study medications.  If the Safety Monitor recommends study termination, all enrolled subjects will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 3 business days and informed that they should stop taking all study medications as the risks will then outweigh the potential maternal benefit.  The NIH, both IRB’s and the FDA will also be notified within 3 business days of the decision to terminate the study. 13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects 13.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the research without their consent. Response: A subject may be removed from the research study by [CONTACT_53022], it is believed that gabapentin is causing or contributing to potentially dangerous side effects. 13.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination. Response: If a subject is to be removed from the research study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52977]. 13.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection. Response: Subjects’ data will be collected until the point of study withdrawal. Subjects will be assessed for adverse events at the time of 
 
 Page 26 of 42 Revised: December 7, [ADDRESS_56097] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the subjects related the subjects’ participation in the research. Include as may be useful for the IRB’s consideration, a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the risks. Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks. Response: Gabapentin is currently approved by [CONTACT_53010] & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of certain types of pain, seizures, and Restless Legs Syndrome.  Gabapentin’s most common side effects are sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, clumsiness, fatigue, and edema.  About 7% of patients placed on gabapentin discontinue treatment due to side effects.  Gabapentin has been in use since 1993 and has no known long-term side effects to the patient; i.e., when treatment is discontinued, the patient’s side effects all resolve.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_52978] 11 subjects, 57% of the subjects had mild-moderate sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_52979] a week.  No other adverse events were felt to be related to gabapentin therapy. The use of anti-seizure medications, in general, has been associated with a 0.21% increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (from 0.22% to 0.43%).  It is not known if this increased risk applies to the use of gabapentin, in particular.  Suicidal thoughts or behavior were not spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_39780] 11 HG subjects receiving open-label gabapentin in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Gabapentin therapy has also been studied in pregnant rats and mice at many different doses to determine the risk for birth defects in the rodents’ pups (Neurontin Package Insert).  The FDA lists gabapentin as Pregnancy Category C.  Two categories of congenital defects were observed in these preclinical studies: skeletal and renal.  Delayed ossification of several bones were noted in the pups of pregnant mice and rats who received oral doses of gabapentin 1/2-4 times the maximum human dose of 3,600mg/day.  The no effect dose for delayed ossification in mice was equivalent to a human dose of 1,800mg/day on a mg/m2 basis.  Hydronephrosis and hydroureter were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats exposed to gabapentin.  The no effect dose for hydronephrosis and hydroureter was equivalent to a human dose of 3,600mg/day.  There were no other congenital malformations observed in the offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given 4-8 times the maximum human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis.   In terms of gabapentin’s safety during pregnancy in humans, there are [ADDRESS_56098] reported on rates of infant

One MCM was from a twin pregnancy conceived through in-vitro fertilization, a technique associated with higher rates of infant MCMs.49  These data were submitted to the FDA on 12/17/10. Fujii et al.48: No MCMs among [ADDRESS_56102] trimester gabapentin monotherapy.  34% of cohort used gabapentin for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. No MCMs in [ADDRESS_56103] trimester gabapentin monotherapy exposures.  One took gabapentin from preconception to gestation week 34 for epi[INVESTIGATOR_52982] 12-38 for HG. Thus, based on these initial 294 exposures, there has been a 1.7% rate of infant MCMs associated with maternal first trimester use of gabapentin monotherapy.  Comparing this rate with that found in the general population, the rate of MCMs detected by [CONTACT_53001] 1968 and 2003 was 2.1%,33 while the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52954] a MCM frequency of 1.6%–2.2% at birth depending on whether chromosomal and genetic abnormalities were included in the calculation.[ADDRESS_56104] a 2-fold increase in MCM rate with 80% power,[ADDRESS_56105] remained fairly stable from an initial 182 or more exposures to 495 or more exposures.  For example, an initial 182, 197 and 197 exposures to oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], levetiracetam and topi[INVESTIGATOR_52983] 2.2%, 2.0% and 4.1%, respectively.47,50 After a total of 575, 530 and 495 exposures to oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], levetiracetam and topi[INVESTIGATOR_52984] 2.6%, 2.1% and 4.4%, respectively.30,32,47 Thus, there was a 5-18% increase in MCM rates observed with additional exposures for these [ADDRESS_56106] similar findings after additional exposures to the newer-generation antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_52985].  Even if there was a maximum 18% increase in the MCM rate after an additional 300 gabapentin exposures, that would equate to an MCM rate of about 2.0%, which is still approximately equivalent to the MCM rate found in the general population.33 The FDA cited particular concern regarding the single case of hydronephrosis in one of the infants from the gabapentin/HG pi[INVESTIGATOR_52986].  Primarily due to this single case of hydronephrosis, the FDA placed a Full Clinical Hold on our

On 5/24/12, [CONTACT_53033] received a “Remove Full Clinical Hold” letter from the FDA stating, “We have completed the review of your submission, and have concluded that the clinical trial can be resumed”.  The last IND annual report was submitted to the FDA on 8/2/[ADDRESS_56107] trimester, which equates to a hydronephrosis rate of 0.4%.  The prevalence of hydronephrosis in the general population of newborns has been shown to be about 0.5%;51 however, a more recent study showed a 2% rate of ultrasound-diagnosed, antenatal urologic findings, such as hydronephrosis, among [ADDRESS_56108] common side effects caused by [CONTACT_53023][INVESTIGATOR_008], diarrhea and restlessness.  Metoclopramide can rarely (<1%) cause movement problems such as hand shaking, slowed walking, muscle stiffness or abnormal movements in the face or neck (tardive dyskinesia).  With prolonged use of metoclopramide (>12 weeks), some of these movement problems can be permanent even after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_52987].

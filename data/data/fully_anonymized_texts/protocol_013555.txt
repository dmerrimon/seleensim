2. Objectives  
 
The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety a nd feasibility of using 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_889764] (>18 years of age) and comparing i t to the standard 
method of sweat induction (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889765]) in terms of sweat volume 
collected and sweat chloride concentrations. 
 
3. Background  
 
The sweat test remains the gold standard test for the diagnosis  of Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  
This test is performed in clinical labs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_889766] e world by [CONTACT_889830]. The 
current technique for sweat testing has remained unchanged sinc e it was first  
standardized in the 1960s. Performing this test in newborn infa nts who have a positive 
initial newborn screen for CF is clinically very important, as early diagnosis and treatment  
has helped to improve long-term growth and respi[INVESTIGATOR_195954]1. However, only 
accredited CF centers generally hav e the ability to carry out s weat tests. In addition, a 
common clinical problem encounter ed in all CF centers is the co llection of inadequate 
volumes of sweat during the te sting of young children, which ne cessitates repeat testing.  
This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, and also ca uses significant anxiety2 
for the parents of the newborn who are anxiously waiting to fin d out if their child has a 
chronic life-limiting condition3. 
 
This failure in collecting adequate sweat is especially common in infants less than [ADDRESS_1245836]  
medication that has been in clinical use since 1874 and it stim ulates the sweat glands to 
produce more sweat. The current sweat testing method (Figure 1)  uses a gel disc 
containing Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889767] a small electric current  
(iontophoresis) followed a 30-minute  period of sweat collection . Given that it is such an 
important clinical test, there is  an unmet medical need to impr ove the current testing 
method and develop more reliable alternatives to induce sweatin g to ensure adequate 
sample collection that all CF centers are able to carry out. 
 
In collaboration with [CONTACT_889848] tz from Georgia Tech, we have developed microneedle 
(MN) patches to administer pil ocarpi[INVESTIGATOR_889768] a simple, reliable way 
without electrical current that  does not need special training and does not require 
sophisticated iontophoretic equipm ent. As shown in Figure 2, ea ch MN patch contains an 
array of solid, water-soluble, micron-scale needles that encaps ulate the medication7. 
Upon application to skin, the MNs penetrate into the skin’s upp er layers and dissolve in

the interstitial fluid to release the loaded drugs. MN patches are painless and can be 
administered with little or no training8. 
 
MN patches have been extensively studied at Georgia Tech and el sewhere, mostly for 
vaccination and systemic drug delivery, including successful cl inical trials9. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889769] r its cholinergic effects10 and as a drug-free pretreatment of  
the skin to create micropores to increase efficiency of pi[INVESTIGATOR_889770]11. We have developed MN patches that deliver pi[INVESTIGATOR_889771]  t o  
simplify reliable sweat induction for CF sweat testing without the use of electrical current.  
Therefore, the impact of our wor k is to translate a cutting-edg e technology (MN patches) 
to address an unmet medical need (reliable sweat testing) to in crease test reliability,  
enable faster medical treatment, decrease costs and reduce pare ntal anxiety.

4. Study Design  
 
This is a cross sectional pi[INVESTIGATOR_889794] i n a phased manner (Figure 
4). The first phase of the study w ill include the enrollment of  [ADDRESS_1245840] (DSMB) that will  review the reported adverse e vents during testing. 
The DSMB will independently asse ss this safety data and provide  their 
recommendations on whether it is safe to continue the study or not. These 
recommendations will be submitt ed to the Emory IRB. If there ar e no safety concerns 
reported by [CONTACT_32622], then the sec ond phase of the study will begin  where the study team 
will continue enrollment of an additional 40 subjects to comple te testing. After the 
enrollment and testing of 50 subjects, the study will be comple ted and another report of  
safety data will be submitted to the DSMB at the end of the stu dy. The DSMB will review 
this final report and their final  recommendations will be share d with Emory IRB and 
study team.

If there are any safety concerns  reported by [CONTACT_4318], then the se will be addressed by 
[CONTACT_889835]. This 
will be followed by [CONTACT_889836]. After approval of the amend ed study protocol, the 
study team will conduct the revi sed testing procedure on 10 sub jects and submit safety 
data to the DSMB again for their review and approval.

6. Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
 
The study involves the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_889795] r sweat testing in human subjec ts. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_889796] s (Standard Procedure) 
on one arm of the subject, while the other arm will receive pil ocarpi[INVESTIGATOR_889797] 
(Experimental Procedure) without  any iontophoresis. This will a llow a direct comparison 
of the two methods in terms of the efficiency of induction of s weat production in human 
subjects and whether the sweat chl oride concentrations in the s weat samples obtained 
by [CONTACT_889837]. In addition, a contro l microneedle patch 
without any Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889798] a ssess the effect of the 
microneedle patch use. The subsequ ent steps for the collection of sweat after 
completing the induction will be done with the same method for both arms using a 
macroduct collector at each site (Standard Procedure). There wi ll be no sweat collection 
performed at the site the control microneedle patch. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] o f the skin sites will be 
taken before and after the interventions at each site. 
 
The study team will plan to enrol l study subjects of all ethnic ities or racial backgrounds,  
so that the impact of this interve ntion can be studied in indiv iduals with different skin 
characteristics.

Because this study involves an approved drug (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]) that  has been in clinical use 
for application to the skin for the purpose of sweat testing, w e think that this project will 
not require an Investigational New  Drug (IND) application. This  has been discussed at  
length with several regulatory experts and FDA and the conclusi on of these discussions 
was that the drug component is ex empt from an IND under 21 CFR 312.2(b), and the 
device component is exempt from an IDE under 21 CFR 812.2(b), s ince all the related 
conditions in those two provisions are met by [CONTACT_889838]. 
 
We have reviewed the guidelines from the Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA)12 for 
determining whether certain human research studies can be condu cted without an IND 
(From FDA website: https://www.federalregister. gov/documents/2015/10/30/2015- 
[ZIP_CODE]/investigational-new-drug-a pplications-determining-whether -human-research-   
studies-can-be-conducted ). 
 
This document provides the criter ia that FDA uses to determine if any human subjects 
research study involving a drug needs an IND or not. We have ex tracted the 6 main 
criteria from this FDA advisory document and provided an explan ation of how our study 
meets those criteria s et forth by [CONTACT_1622]. 
 
1) The drug product is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002]. 
 
For our proposed study, we are pl anning to use Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], whi ch is available for use in 
[LOCATION_002] and is approved by [CONTACT_889839]. The Sweat Test is the gold sta ndard clinical test for the 
diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis, t he most common lethal genetic di sease in Caucasians. 
This test involves collection of a small amount of sweat from t he forearms after the 
application of an agar gel disc co ntaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_889799] a small 
electric current (1.5mA) for [ADDRESS_1245842] of Europe 
as well. 
 
2) The investigation is not intended  to be reported to FDA as a w ell-controlled study 
in support of a new indication an d there is no intent to use it  to support any other 
significant change in the labeling of the drug. 
 
This study will not be reported to the FDA as a case-control st udy as we are planning to 
study the feasibility of pi[INVESTIGATOR_889800] 15 of 23 
IRB Form BIO 08102020 Protocol Version: 2021.11.01   
Protocol Title : A pi[INVESTIGATOR_889756] i nduction in healthy human subje cts 
 
healthy subjects only. The results of this study will compare t he effectiveness of the 
microneedle method of sweat induc tion with the standard of care  pi[INVESTIGATOR_889801] s ubjects and will not change the labeling of the drug.  
The sweat collection phase and a nalysis of chloride concentrati on will remain in the 
same and we will simply compare the volume of sweat collected b etween the standard 
method of sweat induction (usi ng iontophoresis) with our propos ed microneedle-based 
approach. 
 
3) In the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not i ntended to support a 
significant change in the advertising for the drug. 
 
This study and the data being coll ected from it will not be use d in any advertising 
materials for the drug. The same  drug (pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]) is being us ed for sweat stimulation 
in this study and we are simply comparing the effectiveness of another mode of delivery 
of this medication. If found e ffective, it will not change the use of this drug for the 
purpose of sweat testing. 
 
4) The investigation does not invol ve a route of administration, dose, patient  
population, or other factor that s ignificantly increases the ri sk (or decreases the 
acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 
312.2(b)(1)(iii)). 
 
The delivery of pi[INVESTIGATOR_889802] (transcutaneous) for the pur pose of sweat testing. 
The dose used in microneedles is s ignificantly lower and does n ot increase the risk for 
the subjects being tested. The pat ient population that this tes t is applicable to remains 
the same – all subjects that are being evaluated for Cystic Fib rosis. There is no change 
in the risk profile, as the drug is being applied to the skin f or the stimulation of the sweat  
glands on the forearm. Since our proposed microneedle method do es not involve the 
use of electric current, there will actually be a lower risk of  tingling sensations and rarely 
skin burns that sometimes occur with the iontophoresis procedur e. The standard 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_889803]. Our proposed 
method eliminates this risk of burns completely. 
 
In particular, the FDA advisory document (page 5)[ADDRESS_1245843] udy: 
 
In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could  
change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still  be exempt from 
the IND regulations, FDA stated that:  
The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to us e the drug in  
exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient popula tions described  
in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the  

Page 16 of 23

Protocol Title : A pi[INVESTIGATOR_889756] i nduction in healthy human subje cts 
 
lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks .  . . over the risk 
presented by [CONTACT_889840] d labeling  
 
Since our proposed study using micr oneedle-based delivery of pi [INVESTIGATOR_889804], it satisfies this criterion as 
well. 
 
5) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirem ents for review by 
[CONTACT_2717] (21 CFR part 56) and with  the requirements for informed consent (21 
CFR part 50). 
 
The study will be submitted for evaluation by [CONTACT_889841]. An inform ed consent will be signed by [CONTACT_889842]. Their data will be anonymized and stored in a HIPAA compl iant manner in a 
password protected secu re network computer. 
 
6) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirem ents of § 312.7 
(i.e., the investigation is not  intended to promote or commerci alize the drug 
product). 
 
The study will be conducted by r esearchers from Emory Universit y and Georgia Institute 
of Technology without any intention of promoting any commercial  drug products. 
 
Drug/Device Handling: The supp lies for the Standard Procedure w ill be obtained from 
the manufacturer directly and stored according to their specifi cations. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_889805] w ill be manufactured at  
Global Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI). This is not part o f Georgia Tech. It is an 
independent institution. The patc hes will be delivered to Emory  University by a member 
of [CONTACT_889849] lab. The patches  will then be stored at room t emperature at Emory 
University in a secure location until it is used for a study su bject. 
 
 
7. Procedures Involved  
 
Informed consent will be obtaine d by [CONTACT_2717]-approved member of the study staff. The 
process of informed consent will begin with a verbal descriptio n of the experimental 
tasks. Participants will then hav e an opportunity to read the i nformed consent form that  
explains in more detail the requi rements for participation, inc luding protections of  
privacy and confidentiality. Part icipants will be told of their  rights to discontinue 
participation at any time and that  there will be no immediate b enefit to participating and 
no disadvantage to discontinuing . Participants will be given co ntact numbers for the PI

any questions or concerns regarding their participation. Inform ed consent  
documentation will take place in  a private setting convenient t o the participant. 
 
Once the consent is obtained, the patient will undergo sweat te sting. The testing will be 
performed with the subject resti ng comfortably on a chair and t otal duration of testing 
will be 45 minutes. The right for earm will be used for pi[INVESTIGATOR_889807] m icroneedle-based stimulation for  a period of 5 minutes. A  
control microneedle patch without pi[INVESTIGATOR_889808]. After the sti mulation phase,  
collection of sweat will be per formed on each forearm simultane ously for a period of 30 
minutes (excluding the control microneedle patch site). At the end of the 30-minute 
sweat collection period, the colle ction device will be removed and the study visit will be 
completed. All the collected sweat samples ([ADDRESS_1245844])  will be frozen for later 
analysis of the sweat volume and chloride concentration. 
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_889809] f or Medical Innovation (GCMI). Th is is not part of Georgia 
Tech. It is an independent insti tution. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]-loaded MN patches are fabricated 
by a two-step molding process using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)  molds with some 
modification on an established method. The first casting soluti on is a mixture of 10% (w/v) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_889810], 10% (w/v) poly (vinyl alcohol) and 5% (w/v ) sucrose, which is prepared 
by [CONTACT_889843] o. This solution is then cast  
on PDMS molds under vacuum to facilitate filling the solution i nto the molds. After 20 min,  
excess solution is removed, and t he filled molds are centrifuge d at 5000 rpm for 20 min 
to dry the drug loaded MNs. The second casting solution contain ing 20% (w/w) 
polystyrene in 1, 4-dioxane is then cast on the filled PDMS mol ds under vacuum. The 
mold is kept under vacuum for anot her 3 h to dry the solution a t room temperature, and 
then further dried at 40°C overni ght before demolding the MN pa tches by [CONTACT_244230].  
Each patch is immediately stored with desiccant in individual s ealed pouches prior until 
use. 
 
 
8. Data and Specimen Banking  
Data for the study participants will be stored in the online RE DCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) Database with only de-identified infor mation being used 
for statistical analyses. REDCa p is a secure, web-based applica tion designed to 
support data capture for research  studies, providing 1) an intu itive interface for 
validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipul ation and export  
procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data do wnloads to 
common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing da ta from external 
sources. Access to this data will be limited to the study inves tigators only. Sweat  
samples may be stored frozen at Emory Children’s Center for fut ure tests. All the 
used microneedle patches will be s ent to Prausnitz lab to measu re the amount of  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889811] b e destroyed as per 
the steps outlined in Appendix 8.

9. Sharing of Results with Participants  
The study team does not plan to s hare the results of the sweat sample collection.  
Sweat samples will be tested for chloride concentration and vol ume. The 
summary results will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 
 
10. Study Timelines  
Participants will only need to t ake part in one study visit tot aling 45 minutes. The 
study team anticipates enrolling all study participants over th e course of 6 
months. Completion of all study related procedures, including d ata analysis, is 
expected to take approximately 12  months. No follow up visits w ill be needed for 
any of the study participants. 
 
11. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

14. Withdrawal of Participants  
Subjects will only be withdrawn from the study if they are unab le to complete the 
sweat sample collection. After a subject has been withdrawn, th e study team will 
discard incomplete sweat sample collection and no more data wil l be collected. 
 
 
15. Risks to Participants  
There are some risks associated with both forms of sweat testin g. 
All study subjects will be wa rned about the potential risk of s kin burns that can occur 
with the use of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889812] s tandard-of-care method of  
sweat testing. 
 
The product insert from the manufacturer detailing this side ef fect has been added as 
Appendix 10. This risk is estimated to occur at a rate of about  [ADDRESS_1245845] been reported to be ra nging from “tiny black pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828] s in the skin” to “crater- 
like, third degree burns two to three millimeters in diameter”.  As per the manufacturer’s 
product insert, individuals w ho had these burns had no signs of  pain or discomfort  
during iontophoresis, and the burns  are not noticed until after  the electrodes are 
removed. The burns are reported to  heal completely in 1-[ADDRESS_1245846] for hours af ter the completion of testing . There is no risk of  
burns with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889813]. There is no risk of systemic side 
effects from the exposure to Pil ocarpi[INVESTIGATOR_889814] p ilocarpi[INVESTIGATOR_889815] 10% (one-tenth) of the standard adult dose that is 
used in clinical practice (see section on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889816] 8). Not 
all the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889817] a microneedle patch will  be delivered into the 
skin, and only a fraction of that  small dose penetrating the sk in may be absorbed 
into systemic circulation. 
 
Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], the study will have a Da ta and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) compris ed of [ADDRESS_1245847] 10 subjects  enrolled. The DSMB  
charter has been reviewed and signed off on by [CONTACT_889844]  
(Appendix 11). 
 
After the DSMB has reviewed the safety of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889818] 10 subjects, it will prov ide its recommendations to the s tudy team and this 
communication will be submitted to Emory IRB as well. If the DS MB recommends

protection, encryption, and separ ation of identifiers and data during the storage,  
use, and transmission. Data wil l be stored on each users’ secur e servers and not  
downloaded to external devices, in cluding laptops. The informat ion, even if de- 
identified, will be destroyed at t he expi[INVESTIGATOR_889819].  
 
 
19. Economic Burden to Participants  
There will be no costs to participants that enroll this study.

20. Consent Process  
 
Consent of participants will tak e place during their scheduled study visit. The research 
coordinator will first introduce the study to the participant a nd give the participant ample 
time to consider enrolling in the study and to ask questions. T he subject will receive a 
copy of their signed consent form. 
 
 
21. Setting  
 
Study participants will be recruited with the help of study fly ers. After participants have 
been screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and inf ormed consent  
obtained, their study visit will take place in a designated res earch room located on the 
first floor of Emory Children’s Center. Study samples that are collected will then be 
taken to the research lab for sample processing. 
 
 
22. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889820]-loaded MN patc hes are fabricated by a two-step molding process using 
polydimethylsiloxane (P DMS) molds with some modification on an established method.  
The first casting solution is a mixture of 10% (w/v) pi[INVESTIGATOR_259087] e nitrate, 10% (w/v) poly (vinyl 
alcohol) and 5% (w/v) sucrose, which is prepared by [CONTACT_889845]. While this is our current formulati on, we will investigate other 
formulations that can increase the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889821] (on a so lids basis) and thereby 
[CONTACT_889846][INVESTIGATOR_889822]. This solution is then cast on PDMS molds under 
vacuum to facilitate filling the solution into the molds. 
 
After 20 min, excess solution is removed, and the filled molds are centrifuged at 5000 rpm 
for 20 min to dry the drug loaded MNs. The second casting solut ion containing 20% (w/w) 
polystyrene in 1, 4-dioxane is then cast on the filled PDMS mol ds under vacuum. The 
mold is kept under vacuum for another 3 h to dry the solution a t room temperature, and 
then further dried at 40°C overni ght before demolding the MN pa tches by [CONTACT_244230].  
Each patch is immediately stored with desiccant in individual s ealed pouches prior until 
use.

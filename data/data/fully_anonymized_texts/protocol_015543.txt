STUDY PHASE  Phase II  
INDICATION  Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To determine if exposure to 1 mg of Rasagiline daily  is associated with 
improved regional brain metabolism in the treatment group compared to the 
placebo group in Alzheimer’s Disease patients  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES   To evaluate the efficacy of Rasagiline 1 mg once daily compared to 
placebo after a 24-week treatment on cognition (ADAS -Cog 11), 
activities of daily living (ADCS -ADL), global function ( CGIC ), and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI)  
 To evaluate the efficacy of Rasagiline 1 mg once daily compared to  
placebo after 24 week treatment on measures of executive function 
(mazes a nd cancellation of the ADAS -Cog, Digit Span test, and

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  [ADDRESS_959243] OF 
RASAGILINE IN THE REGIONAL BRAIN METABOLISM ON FDG PET IN PATIENTS WITH 
MILD TO MODERATE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE  
 
Rasagiline  Rescue  in Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial (R2 Trial)  
 
1.  Novelty and Relevance  
1.1 Introduction  
Rasagiline is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO -B) inhibitor.  Rasagiline has been used 
extensively for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) where it is approved for signs and symptoms 
of idiopathic PD as initial monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to levodopa (package insert).  Rasagiline 
is currently being studied in a 24 -week, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
add-on parallel group study to assess the efficacy of rasagiline on cognition in patients with Parkinson’s 
diseas e (Study TBT -1012 -PM106).  Pre -clinical observations (summarized below) document 
neuroprotective activities of rasagiline beyond those of MAO -B inhibition.  The pre -clinical evidence, 
utility in PD, and the history of benefit of selegiline ---a related MAO -B inhibitor ---in Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD), provide the rational for a clinical trial of rasagiline in AD.  This proposal outlines a 
clinical trial based on a partnership between the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) , 
Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Ce nter for Brain Health and ADM Diagnostics LLC (ADMdx) to conduct 
a clinical trial in mild to moderate AD.   
 
Several novel aspects are incorporated in the clinical trial design presented.  Rasagiline is a repurposed 
agent and repurposing has many benefits in terms of accelerating development of AD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (1,2).   
The use of a biomarker as a primary outcome --- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG PET) --- is also a novel approach and allows a smaller number of patients to be recruited int o the 
trial.  The incorporation of Tau imaging with the novel ligand T807 (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals) is 
also innovative and has the opportunity to advance understanding of neuroprotection, neurofibrillary 
tangles, and tau imaging. This is the first clinic al trial in which positive tau imaging will be required at 
baseline.  Tau imaging will be secondary outcome of the trial, and there will be opportunities to 
understand the information provided by [CONTACT_705883] a complement to FDG imaging. The use of the 
Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health’s distributed clinical trial infrastructure is also a 
trial innovation.  Recruitment sites will include the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, 
Nevada (led by [CONTACT_705884], MD, ScD and Kate Zh ong, MD) and the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain 
Health in Cleveland, Ohio (led by [CONTACT_705885], MD with referrals from the Lakewood Campus site 
led by [CONTACT_705886], MD).  In addition, we will add novel , clinical trial outcomes sensitive to executive 
function a nd relevant to dopamine D1 receptor activation anticipated with MAO -B inhibition.  
Together, these novel trial design aspects promise to advance an understanding of rasagiline as well as 
to enhance clinical trial methodologies for AD drug development.  
 
1.2. Preclinical  Data  
Rasagiline is a selective MAO -B inhibitor (3).  Rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective, 
antiapoptotic action dependent on B CL-2, protein kinase C (PKC), and the proteasome -ubiquitin 
complex (4).  Importantly, the S -Isomer of rasagiline (TBT1022) is more than 1,000 times less potent 
as a MAO inhibitor and exhibits comparable neuroprotective activity.  In pre -clinical experiments, 
TBT1022 protects mitochondrial viability by [CONTACT_705887] -2 and PKC and by [CONTACT_100276] - regulating the 
proapopotic FAS Bax protein families (5).  Importantly, from an AD therapeutic perspective,

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  13 of 54   propargylamine -containing compounds such as rasagiline modulate proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid 
beta precursor protein (APP), decreasing beta amyloid production by  [CONTACT_705888] -amyloid 
genic  alpha -secretase pathway.  This effect involves activation of mitogen -activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) and PKC (6, 7).   
 
These kinases are deregulated in AD and they contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation 
of neurofibrillary tangles ( 31, 32 ). These observations link rasagiline to tau hyperphosphorylation, 
neurofibrillary tangle formation, and possibly detectable effects on tau imaging ( 33, 34 )  
 
1.3. Pharmacology  of Rasagiline  
Rasagiline is a selec tive, potent and irreversible MAO -B inhibitor.  It is well absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract and is highly blood -brain barrier penetrant.  Unlike selegiline, it is not metabolized 
to amphetamine -like derivatives (8).  Rasagiline has a molecular weig ht of 267.34 Daltons.  It has a 
100-fold selectivity for MAO -B compared to MAO -A.  Rasagiline is metabolized through the CYP1A2 
cytochrome P450 enzyme system and 1A2 inhibitors should be avoided in patients receiving treatment 
with rasagiline (3).  The maj or metabolite of rasagiline is 1(R) -aminoindan which at doses used in 
humans is unlikely to function as a MAO inhibitor.  The T -max of Rasagiline is 1 hour.  High fat meals 
impair the absorption of the drug reducing the Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) by 60% and 20% 
respectively.  The Tmax of rasagiline is not affected by [CONTACT_705889].  Plasma protein binding ranges from 88% - 94% and the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state is 87 liters.  There i s virtually complete biotransformation before excretion with 
dealkylation and hydroxylation followed by [CONTACT_705890] (3).  The principal side 
effects observed in clinical trials in patients with PD include dyskinesia, nausea, falls, weig ht loss, 
constipation, postural hypertension, arthralgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and abnormal 
dreams.   
 
Drug -drug interactions are historically a concern with MAO inhibitors, particularly tyramine -rich foods 
and beverages.  Although such interactions have not been problematic in patients with selective MAO -
B inhibitors, foods with particularly high concentra tions of tyramine (aged cheese, sauerkraut, sausage, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_705863]) will be avoided in the course of the study.  Similarly, sympathomimetic agents will 
also be avoided in trial participants.   
 
As a repurposed agent, rasagiline has substantial advantages since there is extensive study of the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound in both healthy volunteers and patients with 
PD.   
 
1.4. Clinical  Data  
Rasagiline has been extensively studied in the treatment  of PD (9).  Among the most important studies 
was the Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect® Given Once Daily (ADAGIO) study (10 , 
11).  A secondary analysis of the ADAGIO study (12) provided additional insight into the trial 
outcomes.  Of particu lar importance is the attention to non -motor outcomes including cognition 
presented in the secondary analysis.  Both the 1mg and 2mg doses were associated with an improvement 
in the activities of daily living subscore as well as the UPDRS mentation subscor e and the Parkinson 
Fatigue Scale (12).  The ADAGIO study suggests that cognitive impairment in PD was improved 
through treatment with rasagiline.  Many of the mechanisms of rasagiline relevant to its activity in PD 
are also relevant to the treatment of AD .   
 
Further support for pursuing a clinical trial of rasagiline in AD is provided by [INVESTIGATOR_18213] -blind, placebo 
controlled trial of selegiline, alpha -tocopherol and a combination of both of these agents compared to 
placebo in treatments with AD (13).  In t his study of patients with moderate AD, there were significant

therapy.  Primary outcomes included death, institutionalization, and loss of the ability to perform 
activities of daily living or severe dementia (defined as a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 3).   
 
1.5. Application  to Alzheimer’s disease  
The data available for PD and for AD suggest a pharmacologic profile of rasagiline compatible with 
either d isease modification or symptomatic improvement or both.  Enhanced mitochondrial function 
and improved dopamine neurotransmitter function would be anticipated to provide symptomatic benefit 
whereas the antiapoptotic neuroprotective activity of Rasagiline wo uld be expected to provide disease 
modification.  The proposed clinical trial will not resolve whether one or both of these important 
therapeutic modalities are predominant.  The clinical trial is designed to demonstrate if there is 
enhanced metabolism in a treatment group compared to a placebo -control. The mechanism of rasagiline 
is highly supportive of an effect on AD with aspects such as modulation of APP metabolism uniquely 
relevant to AD.  
 
2. Supporting Data  
 
FDG PET analyses and interpretation as well  as site qualification will be done by [CONTACT_705891].  This section 
provides background information on the analytic methodology to be used in this study.  Technical 
aspects of site qualification, scanner variables, and PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
acqu isition are presented in the appendix.  
 
18F-AV-1451  Tau imaging data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_705892] x. 
 
All clinical and imaging data  will be integrated through a database constructed by [CONTACT_104412]’s 
Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and clinical -imaging integr ation analyses will be conducted in 
conjunction with ADCS statisticians (http://ADCS.org).  
 
 
 2.1. Glucose  Metabolism as a Biomarker of Neuronal Function   
The loss of synaptic activity and neuronal function is closely associated with reductions in glucose  
metabolism, a primary energy source that is measurable using FDG PET (14 , 15). AD is characterized 
by a specific, progressive pattern of hypometabolism that begins in medial temporal and posterior 
cingulate cortices, extends to temporo -parietal cortices an d eventually affects most cortical regions. 
Different types of dementia are characterized by [CONTACT_705893] (16), which in turn 
correlate with the domains of cognition and function that become impaired (17).  Representative 
patterns from t wo different types of dementia are shown in Figure [ADDRESS_959244].

2.2 Dementia  Classifier  
The ADMdx Dementia Classifier is a machine learning -based software tool that has been trained to 
differentiate different forms of dementia using the FDG PET scans of 133 subjects with clinical 
diagnoses including Normal, AD, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Lewy Body Disease (LBD) 
(with pathology  or autopsy confirmation where available). The classifier compares the voxels of an 
independent test subject scan to a series of image patterns (canonical variables) that uniquely combine 
to characterize each type of dementia. The probability of a match wi th each dementia is determined. 
Validation was performed using a Leave -One-Out (LOO) approach and with completely independent 
test subjects.  Accuracies achieved in the LOO analysis were: AD vs. FTD 96%, AD vs. Semantic 
Dementia 97%, and AD vs. LBD 100%. T he classifier was subsequently applied to other scans 
including those of subjects participating in studies of bapi[INVESTIGATOR_34870].  It was found that subjects with 
amyloid plaque were more likely to show hypometabolic FDG patterns as identified using ADMdx’s 
deme ntia classification software, and that patients without AD pathology were less likely to show an 
AD pattern (18). ADMdx is continuing to refine its classification approaches.  
 
2.3. AD  Progression Classifier  
ADMdx has also developed a classifier trained on  subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database with clinical diagnoses of Normal (negative for AD), Normal -declined, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI who converted to AD, and AD.  This classifier assigns a numeric 
score to each independent test subject that reflects the degree to which the subject expresses a pattern 
of decline within regions including those shown in Figure 2 (19).

progression scores for Normal (NL), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and AD subjects from  
ADNI, all amyloid positive as measured using amyloid PET scans (20).  For each diagnostic class, the 
score at baseline and at [ADDRESS_959245] applied the AD Progression Classifier to 72 NL (40 with amyloid data available), 173 MCI 
(87 with amyloid data available), and [ADDRESS_959246] -sum of boxes (CDR -sb), and ADAS -Cog 11 to other 
predictors (baseline MMSE, baseline CDR -sb, baseline ADAS -Cog 11, and amyloid cortical average 
Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVr)). Results indicated that the AD Progression score was a 
signif icant predictor of decline in these measures and a better predictor than the other variables tested6. 
The classifier was also applied to patients in a trial of bapi[INVESTIGATOR_34870], with the result that more severe 
hypometabolism at baseline as identified by [CONTACT_705891]’s AD Progression Classifier was a strong 
predictor of subsequent clinical decline over the course of the trials (18).

uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonica l Variate Analysis (CVA) to segregate signal from 
noise, identify the component patterns contributing to overall effect, determine the relative contribution of 
each pattern, measure each subject’s relative expression of the pattern, and provide metrics reg arding the 
reproducibility and predictive power of the group results, and identify patterns of effect. It provides a 
powerful tool to gain insight into treatment effects (21 , 22).

hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and possibly detectable effec ts on tau imaging ( 33,

The incorporation of Tau imaging with the novel ligand18F-AV-1451  (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals)  provides  
the opportunity to advance understanding of neuroprotection, neurofibrillary tangles, and tau imaging. This 
is the first clinical trial in which tau imaging will be required at baseline.  Tau im aging will be secondary 
outcome  of the trial, and there will be opportunities to understand the information provided by [CONTACT_705894] a complement to FDG imaging.

8. Study Specific Procedures  
 
8.1 Cognitive Evaluations  
 
8.1.1  Mini -Mental Sta te Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) is a brief, frequently used screening instrument for AD drug 
studies. The MMSE evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, 
repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two ove rlappi[INVESTIGATOR_360907]. A lower score indicates more cognitive impairment. The highest score is 30. 
Participants with MMSE scores outside the range of 12-26 (inclusive) will not be included in 
this study. This test will be administered at Screening, Baseline, and Week 24. 
 
8.1.2  Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive 11 (ADAS -Cog 11) 
The ADAS -Cog (Rosen et al., 1984) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, 
attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. A higher score indicates more  
impairment. Scores from the original portion of the test range from 0 (best) to 70 (worse). A 
positive change indicates cognitive worsening. This test will be administered at Baseline, 
Weeks 4 , 8, 24 and 28. 
 
 
8.2 Clinical and Functional Evaluations  
 
8.2.1  Clinician Global  Impression of Change ( CGIC ) 
This is a rating scale of global impression of change. The CGIC  is a clinician assessment of 
change in the patient’s functioning administered to the patient and the  caregiver. This test will 
be conducted  at Baseline , Week 4, Week 24, and Week 28.  
 
8.2.2 Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL)  
The ADCS -ADL is an activities -of-daily -living inventory developed by [CONTACT_705898] (Galasko et al., 1997). Using a structured 
interview format, study partners are queried as to whether participants attemp ted each item in 
the inventory during the past [ADDRESS_959270] reliability. The ADCS -ADL includes some items from t raditional basic ADL tests (e.g., 
grooming, dressing, walking, bathing, feeding, toileting) as well as instrumental (complex) 
activities of daily living (e.g., shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], preparing meals, using household  appliances, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_705866], reading). This tes t will be administered at Baseline, Weeks 4 , 8, 24, and 28 . 
 
8.2.3 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)  
The behavioral outcome measure for this trial is the NPI (Cummings, 1997). The NPI [CONTACT_832] a well 
validated, reliable, multi -item instrument to assess psychopath ology in AD based on interview 
with the study partner. The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_430523] 10 
neuropsychiatric disturbances. Frequency assessments range from 1 (occasionally, less than 
once per week) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per  day or continuously) as well as severity 
(1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The overall score and the score for each subscale are the

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  [ADDRESS_959271]  (COWAT)  
This is a 3 -4 minute measure of phonological fluency that indexes a number of the  processes 
described as ‘executive function ,’ including, planning, strategy and working memory. Study 
participants are instructed, “ I want to see how many words you can say beginning with a certain 
letter in one minute. Don’t say proper nouns or numbers or the same word with a different 
ending and try not to repeat yourself. The letter is ‘ -, begin .” The study participant’s responses 
are reco rded on the worksheet. Study participants are then given an additional one minute for 
each of two different letters using similar instructions.  
 
Responses are then judged for their acceptability (example for the use of proper nouns, 
numbers, repetitions and stem word with a different ending). The score is the total number of 
acceptable words for the three trials combined. A higher score represents better performance. 
This test will be administered at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, and Week 28.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_959272].  A normal Digit Span is 7 digits forwar d +/- [ADDRESS_959273] digit span except that the patient repeats the presented digits in reverse 
order.  A normal  reverse digit span is 5 +/ - [ADDRESS_959274] will be 
administered at Baseline, Weeks 4 , 8, 24, and 28 . 
 
8.2.6    QoL -AD/Study Partner  
The QoL -AD is a commonly used 13 item QoL scale that assesses items specific to QoL in 
patients  with cognitive impairment.  It is administered to the research partner with answers for 
the patient. This assessment will be performed at the Baseline and Week 24 visits.    
8.2.7    Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identification Method (OSU TBI -ID)    
      Questionnaire  
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to tau protein deposition in the brain and these changes 
could be visualized on18F-AV-1451   Tau imaging.  To account for any contribution of TBI to 
the imaging findings , the Ohio State University (OSU) TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI -
ID) is being utilized.  The OSU TBI -ID is a standardized procedure for eliciting a person’s 
lifetime history of TBI via a [ADDRESS_959275]  for research and clinical us e.  
Physicians, nurses and mental health professionals working with military per sonnel need this 
tool to elicit a  complete history of TBI.  The validity of the OSU TBI -ID is not based on 
elicitation of a veridical accounting of a person's lifetime history o f TBI. Instead, the OSU TBI -
ID provides data for calculating summary indices reflecting the likelihood that consequences 
have resulted from lifetime exposure to TBI. Initial validation research has supported the 
psychometric qualities of these summary indi ces. Reliability has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_705899]-rater and test/re -test reliability (Corrigan & Bogner, 2007;  Bogner & Corrigan, 2009). 
Predictive validity has been shown by [CONTACT_705900]  R2 Study  
 
 
Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  33 of 54   measures of cognitive  performance, affective status, interpersonal functioning and aggression 
(Corrigan & Bogner, 2007; Bogner & Corrigan, 2009). Summary indices from the OSU TBI -
ID can be used in both research and clinical care   (35, 36).   This assessment will be 
completed at  the Screening and Week 24 visits.  
9. Study Methods  
 
9.1 Safety Assessments  
At each study visit, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  will be reviewed ; vital 
signs and weight will be done for safety assessment s. Hematology, blood chemistr y, and liver 
function tests will be collected at Screening visit and Week 24.  
 
Potential adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_414791]. Adverse 
events include signs or symptoms that may or may not be related to study medicat ion, abnormalities 
detected on physical examination, or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events 
will be graded (mild: causing no limitation of usual activities; moderate: causing some limitation 
of usual activities; severe: causing inability to carry out usual activities) and recorded on case report 
forms.  
 
9.2  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be recorded at each visit based on the study partner interview and 
any other available information. After randomization, initiation of any excluded medication, or 
change in permitted agents will be discouraged. However, follow -up of all participants, regardless 
of compliance with medication restrictions, will be continued in order to maximize the data 
available for the inten t to treat analysis.  
 
Initiation during the study of medications which are excluded because of confounding effects on 
cognitive outcomes (such as sedating or anticholinergic medications) is discouraged, but will not 
require termination of study drug or exclusion from the ITT analysis. Cessation or change of anti -
dementia therapi[INVESTIGATOR_705867], but will also not prevent continued 
participation in the protocol or inclusion in the intent to treat analysis.  
 
9.3 Physical Examination  
A brief physical examination will be performed by a medically qualified professional at the 
Screening visit and Week 24. A review of the major body systems will be performed for example: 
skin, head/ears/eyes/nose/throat (HEENT), cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdomen, musculoskeletal, 
neurological, and gastrointestinal. Assessments of height (Screening visit only), weight, and vital 
signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) are included and 
will be done at every visit.  
 
9.4 Neurological Examination  
This examination will be performed by a medically qualified professional and includes an 
assessment of cranial nerves, strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation, tremor and gait at 
screening and week 24 visits.  
 
9.5 Electroca rdiogram (ECG ) 
A standard 12 -lead resting ECG will be performed at the screening and week 24 visits. The ECG 
report will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_093]. Those with clinically significant 
ECG findings will be referred for follow -up as de emed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].

ADMdx has developed and will utilize an automated image processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], PETMAX™, 
which has secure user access, version control wi th back -up, and complete audit trail for use in 
clinical trials.  PETMAX facilitates user interaction for visual inspection and quality control at 
multiple stages in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], and streamlines the execution of the many steps (including SPM 
functions) em ployed in image preparation and analysis. Results are logged and saved under version

  There are two FDG -PET scans to be conducted per participant in this study. The scans will be done 
at the Screening visit for study eligibility, and at Week 24 visit for end of treatment scan and 
comparison.  
 
The scanning protocol and equipment qualificatio n requirements for this study will be consistent 
with those implemented in ADNI 2 (30). FDG -PET imaging data will be obtained at two sites:  the 
Cleveland Clinic facilities in Cleveland, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Each of these sites uses a 
Siemens Biogr aph PET/CT LSO 16 slice camera.   As part of site qualification, site practices will 
be reviewed, along with recent equipment calibration logs. If the site has a 3D -Hoffman phantom

checkup/calibration procedure guarantees optimum image quality by [CONTACT_705903] x -ray tube 
and should be performed at startup and within 1 hour prior to any scan. The water phantom provides 
quality measurements of 3 parameters. The parameters are the CRT value of water calculated in 
Hounsfield u nits (HU), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_705871] a standard deviation, and the tube 
voltages measured directly on the x -ray tubes. These three measurements should be determined for 
all available kVp values.  
 
Ideally, no hardware or software upgrades of t he PET imaging system will occur during the study 
duration.  If an upgrade needs to occur, ADMdx will be informed prior to the anticipated upgrade.  
Depending on the nature of the upgrade the site may be asked to repeat the phantom scans prior to 
scanning any additional subjects.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  37 of 54   Follow -Up Phone Call : 
A follow -up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted between [ADDRESS_959285] not been problematic in patients with 
selective MAO -B inhibitors, foods with particularly high concent rations of tyramine (aged cheese, 
sauerkraut, sausage, pi[INVESTIGATOR_705863]) will be avoided in the course of the study.  Similarly, 
sympathomimetic agents will also be avoided in trial participants.   
 
The most significant drawback to the use of nonselective M AOIs is the risk of hypertensive 
emergencies, which can occur when a patient is exposed to sympathomimetic drugs, foods 
containing tyramine, or dopamine. By [CONTACT_705904], 
catecholamine concentrations are increas ed; and, in extreme cases, a hypertensive crisis can 
potentially result in a cerebrovascular accident or death.  
 
The potential for tyramine interaction with rasagiline (doses tested, 0.5 -2 mg) was assessed in 5 
placebo -controlled clinical trials in healthy  volunteers and PD patients. The results of the formal 
tyramine studies indicate that rasagiline can be used safely without dietary tyramine restriction at 
a dose of 1 mg/day. These data allowed removal of the dietary tyramine restriction from the 
rasagili ne. This information was taken from the package insert of Azilect.

bodies in the brain or eye or cardiac pacemaker. There is a slight risk of anxiety due to 
claustrophobia. Any participant who experiences anxiety when placed into the MR scanner will be 
removed from the scanner, offered reassurance by [CONTACT_224179], and offered the 
option of conti nuing or terminating the scan. If the participant decides that the anxiety associated 
with MRI is uncomfortable for them and they wish to terminate the scan, then the examination will 
be ended at that time. There will be no attempt to coerce participants t o complete exams that they 
are uncomfortable with. Use of anxiolytic agents for completion of MRI scans is at the discretion 
of the principal investigator.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  38 of 54   10.3 [ 18F] -FDG -PET Scan Risk  
The primary risk related to PET is that of radiation exposure associated with the CT scan or 
transmission scan and the injected radiotracers. There is also minor risk associated with the 
venipuncture and radioisotope injection (pain and bruising or painful infiltration of a failed 
injection). The radiation dose is no t expected to produce any harmful effects, although there is no 
known minimum level of radiation exposure considered to be totally free of the risk of causing 
genetic defects or cancer. The risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure participants  
receive in this study is considered low and comparable to everyday risks. No PET studies will be 
performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women, as the protocol requires female subjects to 
be postmenopausal as a condition of participation.  
 
10.4 CT Scan Risk                                                                                                                             
Subjects will also receive radiation of approximately 1 mSv from a “low dose” computed  
tomography (CT) acquired al ong with each PET scan.  The low -dose CT will be used to align the 
position of the subject’s head for the PET image.  The radiation dose from 1 combined PET/CT is 
about 8 mSv which is significantly less than the dose considered safe by [CONTACT_705905]  (NIH)  for research studies.  However , this study will have 2 combined PET/CT scans during 
the study.  
 
10.5 18F-AV-1451 Tau PET Scan Risk  
18F-AV-1451  will be administered IV up to a radioactive target dose of 370 MBq with a maximum 
human mass dose (MHD) limited to 20 μg of compound by [CONTACT_8497]. This dose is 150 fold lower 
than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL 
observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies.  
 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective Dose of 
8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effecti ve dose 
of approved 18F -labeled compounds such as FDG and florbetapir F [ADDRESS_959287] acceptable image quality in 
preliminary human studies.  
 
       10.6 Radiation Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
One of the risks associated with radiation exposure is cancer.  The natural incidence of getting 
cancer in the [LOCATION_002] is about 40%.  In this research study, including  the companion protocol 
there will be four PET scans : FDG  PET scan at Screening and at Week 24; and 18F-AV-1451 TAU 
PET scan at Screening and at Week 24 .  The annual radiation dose from the combined 2 FDG 
PET/CT scans is 16 mSv.  The annual radiation dose from the combined 2 18F -AV-1451/CT scans

11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
11.1     Sample Size Determination  
A study population of 25 subjects per arm (placebo, drug) has been estimated to be sufficient to 
detect a significant drug effect. Further, depending upon the effect size, a study population of [ADDRESS_959289] 5% and 10% increases in prefrontal cortex in 
mild to moderate AD patients using a region of interest approach, and have also confirmed 
estimates through review of published effect sizes from stu dies of donepezil, phenserine, and 
galantamine in AD patients.    
 
11.2     Statistical Methods  
Intent -to-Treat ( ITT) - The primary FDG analysis will include all patients who received both a 
screening and end of study scan of acceptable quality. The primary clinical analysis will be a 
modified Intent -to-Treat (m ITT) approach including all patients randomized and receiving a t least 
one post -baseline assessment.  
Per-Protocol (PP) population – All Intent -to-Treat subjects who complete the study (Week 24) and 
have ingested between 80% and 120% of the protocol prescribed study medication as measured by 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692].  
Observed case – An observe d case analysis of all patients completing the study will be conducted.  
LOCF – Clinical data imputation will use the LOCF approach for missing patients  
Responder analysis – Responders will be defined as those that have a significant improvement on 
brain metabolism on FDG for the whole brain or for any of the pre -specified regions.  
A secondary analysis will compare the changes in FDG at [ADDRESS_959290] population of 10 patients per arm (placebo and treatment), Kadir et al detected a 
significant increase (p<0.05) in frontal, parietal, and parietotemporal glucose metabolism within 
the treatment group, and a signific ant difference between placebo and treatment arms in 
parietotemporal glucose metabolism (26).   The percent changes associated with these increases 
ranged from 5.5% to 8%.   In two different studies of donepezil (27 , 28), the change in glucose 
metabolism was  measured in subjects who improved, rather than declined, in cognitive 
scores.   Using region of interest analysis, Shimadai found significant differences (p<0.05) in frontal 
regions when comparing the ratio of pre -treatment to post -treatment in [ADDRESS_959291] to 
ADAS -J cog score to that of 4 non -responders. Using voxel -based analyses, Mega et al found a 
significant difference in anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and parietotemporal cortex between

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  40 of 54   6 cognitive responders as compared to similar untreated subjects, even after applying a Bonferroni 
correction for random effects.  
 
Evaluation of the FDG PET scans of 70 mild AD subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database indicates that, based upon mean and standard de viation 
of glucose metabolism in prefrontal cortex, a change in mean Standardized Uptake Value ratio 
(SUVr) of 5% could be statistically significant between two independent groups (drug, placebo) at 
70% power (p<0.05, two -tailed) with 26 subjects per arm, or at 80% power with [ADDRESS_959292], as a change of 10% would 
require only 8 subjects per arm to achieve 80% power if variance within the study group is 
comparable to that within the mild A D ADNI population (greater variance would increase the 
number of subjects required or decrease the power).   Region of interest evaluation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_705874] -based analysis because effects common across subjects often involve sub -
regions and measurement of change may be diluted by [CONTACT_705906] -determined 
measurement areas.   Use of voxel -based approaches, and in addition, multivariate methods and a 
pattern -based classification approach, are expected to increase statistical pow er as they improve the 
signal to noise ratio and are not limited to predefined regions.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_959293] will be evaluated using ADMdx’s dementia 
classifier, to assess whether the subject expresses a pattern consistent with AD or alternatively, that 
of other dementias. The classifier has developed machine learning me thods and a comprehensive 
set of reference data from ADNI and other sources.  The FDG PET scan of a subject will be 
independently compared to a set of canonical variant patterns that in combination characterize the 
patterns of relative hypometabolism cause d by [CONTACT_705907]. A probability will be 
assigned to determine whether the subject is “AD -like” or better characterized as a different 
dementia.  
 
In addition, hypometabolism will be assessed in frontal cortex and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067], and parie tal 
asymmetry checked, to identify possible atypi[INVESTIGATOR_705875].  The AD -like or non -AD-like status of each subject will be reported back within

to a set of canonical variant patterns that in combination characterize the patterns of relative 
hypometabolism caused by [CONTACT_705908]. This numeric 
score will be used to project likely cognitive trajectory for comparison to actual results. It can also 
be used to stratify groups for sub -analyses, creating more homogeneous analysis groups at baseline.

12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definitions  
International Conference o n Harmoni sation (ICH) guidelines define an adverse event ( AE) as any 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example) symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal 
product whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any medical occ urrence or effect that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148244]  
 Results in persistent or a significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is cancer

risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.

immediately in the source document,  and also in the appropriate AE section of the case report form 
(CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will also 
be recorded in the source document.  
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are 
still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any

Technical Description of FDG PET Acquisition and Analy sis 
1). Imaging  Site Qualification and Preparation  
(Note that parameters and steps may be refined to align with the scanner model and practices at the 
Cleveland Clinic.)  
The scanning protocol and equipment qualification requirements for this study will be consistent with  those 
implemented in ADNI 2 (30). FDG -PET imaging data will be obtained at two sites:  the Cleveland Clinic 
facilities in Cleveland, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Each of these sites uses a Siemens Biograph PET/CT 
LSO [ADDRESS_959313] quality  assurance will be performed as recommended by [CONTACT_705902], and should typi[INVESTIGATOR_488680] a "checkup/calibration" procedure and a water phantom scan. The checkup/calibration procedure 
guarantees optimum image quality by [CONTACT_705903] x -ray tube and  should be performed at startup and 
within 1 hour prior to any scan. The water phantom provides quality measurements of 3 parameters. The 
parameters are the CRT value of water calculated in Hounsfield units (HU), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_705878] a s tandard deviation, and the tube voltages measured directly on the x -ray tubes. These three 
measurements should be determined for all available kVp values.  
 
Ideally, no hardware or software upgrades of the PET imaging system will occur during the study dura tion.  
If an upgrade needs to occur, ADMdx will be informed prior to the anticipated upgrade.  Depending on the 
nature of the upgrade the site may be asked to repeat the phantom scans prior to scanning any additional 
subjects.  
   
Quality control of blood glucose meter will be performed according to the manufacturer’s or institution’s 
procedure to ensure proper functioning.  Quality control of dose calibrator will be performed throughout 
the course of the study. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_705872], quarterly linearity and annual accuracy.

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  50 of 54   2)  Image Data Collection  
(i). Pre -Scan Subject Preparation  
All participants will be screened by [CONTACT_705916] (see Exclusion 
Criteria).  Scans should be scheduled at the same  time of day for a given subject – i.e., if in the morning for 
the baseline scan, then in the morning for any subsequent scans.  In order to reduce the potential for first 
scan effects, prior to the first scan, for example at the Screening visit, each subj ect will be introduced to the 
PET scanner, sequence of data acquisition events, and FDG uptake room and activity.  
 
Subjects to be imaged in the morning are asked to omit all food and fluids (except water) from midnight 
the night before the scan until after  the imaging is completed. Subjects scanned later in the day are asked 
to omit food and fluids (except water) for at least [ADDRESS_959314] elapsed, blood glucose levels will be 
measured.  If b lood glucose levels are not less than 180 mg/dL, then waiting an additional amount of time 
to recheck blood glucose levels will be needed.  Once blood glucose levels are below 180 mg/dL, the 
participant will be asked to use the restroom to empty his/her bl adder.  Then, the participant will be asked 
to sit or recline comfortably (but not in a position that will induce sleep) in a reclining chair in a room in 
which the ambient noise is minimal and the degree of lighting can be controlled and minimized.  
Blank ets/pi[INVESTIGATOR_705879].  Intravenous access using a small 
butterfly needle or angiocath will be done.  185 MBq (5mCI +/ - 10%) of [18F] -FDG will be drawn and 
assayed with a dose calibrator and assay time will be recorded t o the nearest minute.  The [18F] -FDG will 
be injected and the syringe and IV line will be flushed with 10mL of normal saline.  The injection time will 
be recorded to the nearest minute and the IV line may be discontinued.  The dose syringe will then be re -
assayed and if the residual activity is 0.1 mCi or greater, the amount will be recorded and the amount of the 
injected dose will be corrected for the residual activity.   
(ii)  Subject Management During FDG Uptake  
Control of the subject’s activity and envi ronment during the 30 minutes following tracer administration is 
essential. It is also necessary that the subjects’ position during the uptake period, their activity and focus, 
their visual, audio, and temperature environment, and the room’s ambient light conditions are consistent 
across all longitudinal scans.  
 
The subject will be asked to rest comfortably in the room with lights dimmed to a level similar to twilight 
for 30 minutes for incorporation of [18F] -FDG in the brain. The subject’s eyes will be ope n, away from 
any direct light, and the ears will remain un -occluded.  The participant will be directed to maintain their 
gaze on a constant object throughout the uptake period.  This point of focus (object) should be the same 
across subjects and across sca ns. The subject should also be instructed to avoid any motion, foot tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
or other variable activity. Comfort should be assured in order to reduce the likelihood of movement. The 
participant must be monitored frequently to be certain of compliance and t o ensure that the eyes do not 
close and they remain awake.  It is important that no sudden noises or environmental changes occur within 
or just outside of the participant’s room during [18F] -FDG uptake.  
 
Just prior to injection, and at the end of the uptake period, the subject will be asked to answer a short set of 
questions regarding their affect.  The clinician will also be asked to note the subject’s affect, and particularly 
whether the subject exhibits  signs of agitation, somnolence, or depression. These observations are important 
because differences between scanning sessions in the patient’s affect can impact measured signal, creating 
confounds in the measurement of treatment effects. If a subject is n otably agitated, the process should not

(iii)  Image Acquisition  
The participant will be positioned and secured i n the scanner.  Proper participant positioning and the 
prevention of subject motion during acquisition is critical for a reliable PET scan.  Excessive motion 
between the emission scan and the CT scan used for attenuation correction is the single most commo n cause 
of failed studies.  For this reason, the protocol includes several steps to reduce the likelihood of movement, 
as follows, and consistent with ADNI guidelines.  
 
Time will be taken to ensure the participant is properly positioned and can comfortably  maintain that 
position for 30 minutes during the scanning session.  Participants will remove any bulky items from their 
pockets and remove eyeglasses, earrings, hair clips/combs, and hearing aids (if possible).  The participant 
will be positioned so the h ead/neck is relaxed which may involve adding additional pads beneath the neck 
to provide sufficient support.  It will be verified that the participant’s ears are in a comfortable position, and 
not pi[INVESTIGATOR_218238], as this can cause movement to alleviate discomfort  during the scan. Lasers will be used to 
ensure that there is little or no rotation in either plane.  The head will be positioned parallel to the imaginary 
line between the external canthus of the eye and the external auditory meatus.  Supportive devices u nder 
the back and/or legs will be used to help decrease the strain on these regions and prevention motion in the 
lower body.  Once the participant is positioned, foam pads may be placed alongside the head for additional 
support.  Velcro straps and preferab ly easily removed tape will be used to secure the head position.  Vacuum 
bean bags may also be used in this process.  One of the most common forms of motion in PET scans is a 
downward motion that causes the subject’s head to move lower in the field of view , ultimately truncating 
the lower portion of cerebellum from view.  To minimize the possibility of this, a (comfortable) “rod” or 
other device may ideally be positioned just below the chin, serving as a reminder to the subject not to move 
downward. The sub ject will be offered a “panic button” or be reassured that someone will be watching or 
able to hear them at all times.   
 
Prior to initiation of the emission scan, a short “scout” scan is to be taken in order to verify that the subject’s 
head is correctly positioned.  
 
The subject’s head position and ability to remain still must be monitored continuously throughout the 
acquisition period. If the subject moves, acquisition should cease, the head should be repositioned, the time 
at which the repositioning occurred noted, and acquisition resumed.  It is imperative that if motion occurs 
between frames, the emission frames are correctly aligned with one another, and with the transmission scan, 
before attenuation correction is applied through the use of a trans mission scan. The handling of motion will 
be a topic for discussion with PET technologist and depends upon the scanner model and options available.  
 
A 30 -minute dynamic, 3D scan consisting of six 5 -minute frames (preferably ten 3 -minute frames to allow 
for additional motion correction) will be acquired <to be verified as ADNI has indicated that Siemens 
Biograph scanners cannot collect dynamic images>.  All images will need to be corrected using measured 
attenuation using standard CT acquisition parameters.  A check will be performed to ensure that the 
emission and transmission scans are properly aligned before the participant leaves the imaging session. 
Upon completion, the participant is to be removed from the scanner and encouraged to void.  The study 
participant will be instructed to drink fluids and to void throughout the day to help reduce radiation 
exposure.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  52 of 54   (iv).   Image Reconstruction  
Images will be reconstructed using parameters specific to the scanning system and will be reviewed to 
check for artifa cts and motion.  Sinogram data (projection data) will be stored in a separate file.  Iterative 
reconstruction will be performed, using the parameters recommended by [CONTACT_705917] [ref].  
(v).   Image De -identification and Transfer  
The PET imag e sets produced by [CONTACT_705918] a standard Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file format.  Image file naming will follow a standard format 
so that all scans can be easily identified.  The file ID will  be assigned by [CONTACT_705919].  Unless designated otherwise during study preparations, the naming convention will be XXX_S_#### 
where XXX is a three digit site ID determined by [CONTACT_705920] #### is the unique four digit 
number assigned to the subject by [CONTACT_779], followed by a sequence uniquely identifying the scan.   
 
All raw and processed study data including copi[INVESTIGATOR_705880].  
Image data will be transferred to ADMdx (Chicago,  IL), as soon as images have been acquired and 
reconstructed.  A secure image transfer program such as AG Mednet that ensures de -identification of the 
data prior to transmission will be employed.  Initial header checks may be performed using that software 
prior to image transmission.  
2)  MRI Scan  
A research grade (ADNI quality) MRI, acquired for each subject at the time of enrollment, will also be 
provided. T1, T2 and FLAIR or T2* sequence will be collected.

(i)  Image Quality Control  
All scans in this study will be evaluated using a stringent quality control procedure to ensure suitability for 
analysis.  Quality control will be performed within [ADDRESS_959317] to 
injected dose, injected volume, and start  time after injection, number of frames, scan duration, and 
reconstruction parameters.  Visual inspection will include checks for anatomical truncation (e.g. omission 
of lower slices of cerebellum), adequate image counts, image noise such as streaking, ima ge blur indicative 
of subject motion, asymmetry indicative of misalignment between emission and transmission scan, and 
other apparent artifacts. Quantitative motion measurement will involve calculation of the inter -timeframe 
translation and rotation, with preset thresholds above which a frame (or scan, if multiple frames) will not 
be accepted as suitable for analysis.  
 
ADMdx has developed and will utilize an automated image processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], PETMAX™, which has 
secure user access, version control with ba ck-up, and complete audit trail for use in clinical trials.  PETMAX 
facilitates user interaction for visual inspection and quality control at multiple stages in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], and

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  53 of 54   streamlines the execution of the many steps (including SPM functions) employe d in image preparation and 
analysis. Results are logged and saved under version control.   
(ii)  Image Processing  
Discrete timeframes for each scan will be aligned and an aggregate image created by [CONTACT_705921]. 
Each subject’s MRI will be co -regist ered to the baseline PET scan, and longitudinal PET scans will be co -
registered to the baseline PET scan, as well.  The MRI will be segmented into gray, white, and CSF tissue 
images. The MRI will be spatially transformed to a target template and the PET sc an(s) will be likewise 
transformed using the same parameters.  The spatially transformed images will be intensity normalized to 
a mean value of 1, and smoothing applied to achieve uniform resolution with other scanners for comparison 
to reference data and use in the dementia classifiers.  A set of template ROIs will be transformed back to 
the subject’s native (unwrapped) brain for signal measurement in unwrapped space, with individualized 
masking applied using the subject’s gray matter segment. The mean, st andard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum for each ROI will be measured, as well as those in different reference regions for comparison, 
including whole brain without ventricles, cerebellum, and pons. This is in order to examine consistency 
across reference r egions, and to determine whether treatment effects may influence one or more reference 
regions as well as target ROIs. Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVrs) will be generated by [CONTACT_705922] .

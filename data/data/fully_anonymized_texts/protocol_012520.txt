Version 09 6 1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
01/07/00  1.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1.1  To assess the feasibility and toxicities of tandem cycle high -dose melphalan and 
busulfan/cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_254902] 
(PBPC), alpha -interferon and pamidronate in patients with responsive, or stable “low bulk” 
multiple myeloma.  
 
1.1.2  To assess response r ate, progression -free and overall survival following treatment with 
tandem cycle, high -dose melphalan,  busulfan/cyclophos -phamide, PBPC and maintenance 
therapy with alpha -interferon and pamidronate in patients  with responsive, or stable “low bulk” 
multiple myeloma.  
 
1.1.3  To assess the feasibility of adding thalidomide to alpha -interferon and pamidronate in 
patients not in complete remission by 6 months following the second cycle of  high -dose therapy.  
 
1.1.4 To assess whether administration of thalidomi de can increase the complete remission rate 
(CR) in patients not in CR at [ADDRESS_309899] on progression -free and overall survival in this subset of patients.  
 
1.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.2.1 To perform cytogenetic, gene rearrangement and fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) studies on baseline and post -treatment bone marrow and blood specimens and correlate 
the presence/persistence of these features with treatment outcome.

01/07/00 2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 The incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) has been on the rise accounting for 
approximately 10% of all hematological malignancies.  Five in 100,000 Americans suffer from 
MM; the entire spectrum of plasma cell  dyscrasias affects an even greater percentage of the 
population.  These diseases include benign gammopathy, macroglobulinemia, solitary 
plasmacytoma and, within the category of MM,  smoldering and indolent forms as well as 
immunoblastic lymphoma and plasm a cell leukemia1.  Adverse prognostic factors such as high 
plasma cell labeling index, elevated beta -[ADDRESS_309901] 
clinical significance.2-4 Chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisone, a combination of 
alkylating agents, or vincristine, doxorubicin is effective in 50 -70% of patients wit h newly 
diagnosed MM; however, less than 10% of patients will achieve complete remission5,6.  
 
IRB #[ADDRESS_309902] -1 gene product7, or 
utilizing myeloablative therapy followed b y allogeneic, or autologous bone marrow, or 
peripheral blood progenitor cell rescue (PBPC).8 
 
2.2 High-dose chemo -/radiotherapy in the treatment of MM.  
 
Single agent high -dose melphalan therapy results in  response rates of > 80% with complete 
response rat es of > 30% as described in earlier studies without the use of stem cell support. In a 
recent update, 1/[ADDRESS_309903] received 
dose-intense bone marrow ablative therapy followed by [CONTACT_58112], or peripheral 
stem cell rescue, worldwide.  Complete remission rates of up to 50% have been reported in 
selected cohorts of patients with good performance  status and limited tumor burden resulting 
from a response to conventional doses of chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_309904] resulte d in similar outcome in a variety of phase II trials.11-16 A 
prospective randomized study comparing high -dose consolidation therapy and stem cell rescue 
following induction therapy vs. conventional chemotherapy alone, revealed complete response 
rates (22% versus 5%) and improved favorable progression -free and overall survivals following 
high-dose therapy; projected 5 year event -free and overall survivals were 28% and 52% versus 
10% and 12%.17 Comparison of early vs. late (at the time of progression) autolog ous transplants 
favor early high -dose therapy resulting in prolonged progression -free survival and quality of life 
while in response.18 Tandem cycle high -dose chemo/radiotherapy in the setting of “total therapy” 
in the largest series by a single institutio n suggested additional benefit associated with the second 
transplant in a series of 231 patients, independent of the presence of unfavorable cytogenetics 
and elevated beta 2 microglobulin; with a median follow -up of 4.2 years among surviving 
patients actua rial 5-year event -free and overall survivals were 58% and 42%, respectively.19  The 
benefits of double dose intense therapy need further confirmation in ongoing randomized 
prospective trials.  Preliminary data from one such French study suggests a possible  benefit 
favoring double transplant; similarly, EBMT data and preliminary analysis of an Italian 
randomized study comparing single versus tandem autologous transplant favors tandem 
therapy.20-22  
 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004  
Version 09 8 Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been associated  with a disappointing median overall 
survival of 13 months in a registry review by [CONTACT_254903], with  approximately 40% early, treatment -related mortality caused by [INVESTIGATOR_24858] -
related toxicities, infections, an d acute or chronic graft versus host disease.[ADDRESS_309905] diminished early mortality rates possible due to incorpotation of PBPC reinfusions in 
addition to ongoing assessment of the role of the so called mini transplants.23,24, 25,  
 
Early utilization of myeloablative therapy is recommended both with autologous and allogeneic 
bone marrow transplantation in order to consolidate complete or partial response to conventional 
treatment.  In addition, even patients with previously untreated or ref ractory disease may respond 
to high-dose therapy, with the possibility of long -term disease control.8 
 
2.3 Autologous CD34+ selected PBPC support following high -dose therapy in MM.  
 
Occult tumor involvement is one of the potential risks associated with the  use of a autologous 
stem cell products.  The percentage of myeloma cells contaminating the PBPC product and bone 
marrow were 0.0024% versus 0.74% using patient -specific oligonucleotide primers synthesized 
to identify patient specific Ig gene rearrangement s and than amplified by [CONTACT_954]; these data suggest 
a potential benefit when using PBPC.26  Methods of CD34+ selection for tumor purging might 
benefit patients without significant delay in hematopoietic recovery. However, the clonogenic 
potential and contribut ion to disease progression of MM cells residing in  the PBPC products in 
relation to the body’s total tumor burden is unknown. Indeed, more mature data comparing 
outcome in patients supported by [CONTACT_398]34+ selected versus standard PBPC following high -dose 
therapy for MM was not supporting the use of such technology in patients with advanced 
disease.27  In this study only in vivo “purging” with cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_254904].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_309906] prolonged disease -free and overall survival.28 
 
2.5 Pamidronate in the therapy of MM  
 
Bisphosphonates –presumably by [CONTACT_254905] -mediated bone resorption - are 
useful in reducing the incidence/complications of lytic metastases.  The bisphosphonate 
pamidronate, in a r andomized, prospective study  had been found effective in reducing the 
number skeletal complications; pamidronate may also alter the natural history of MM by [CONTACT_254906].29,30  
 
2.6 Thalidomide in the therapy of MM  
 
In bone marrow samples of patients with active MM  there is ample evidence for active 
angiogenesis;[ADDRESS_309907] one study diminished 
vascularity following high -dose therapy and PBPC seemed to be associated with better outcome.  
 
IRB #[ADDRESS_309908] the potential to inhibit angiogenesis through 
interfering with the effects of IL -6, TGF be ta and other, so far undefined pathways, leading to 
prolonged survival.28,34  More recently, thalidomide, and agent with possibly antiangiogenesis 
potential had been reported to induce tumor response -including short -lasting complete 
remissions - in heavily treated, relapsed patients with MM.35  
 
2.7 Chromosomal  abnormalities as prognostic indicators in MM  
 
Cytogenetic abnormalities can  be detected in significant numbers of  MM cases; the presence of 
11q, -[ADDRESS_309909] been associated with worse  survival;19  frequent abnormalities 
observed in MM include t(4;14) (p16;q32), t(11;14) (q13;q32), t(8;14) (q24;32), t(14;18) 9 
q32;q21), 13q14 (Rb loss) and others. 36 One of these translocations, t(4;14) may lead to 
dysregulations of two separate oncogen es providing one of many potential targets for specific 
interventions in the future.37 
 
Autologous stem cell transplantation following high -dose chemo -/radiotherapy may contribute to 
the development of  clonal hematopoietic evolution (or unmask/accelerate previously existing 
clonal abnormalities).  Hence,  we will apply  a unique assay (specific only in female patients) to 
detect the presence of clonal hematopoiesis prior to high -dose therapy as well as to monitor for 
the development of such clones followin g treatment, in female participants.  
 
2.8 Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) studies in multiple myeloma  
 
Classic cytogenetics and FISH analyses will be used to detect clonal aberrations in multiple 
myeloma.  Clonal aberrations will be used to monitor therapy and detect minimal residual 
disease levels at specified time intervals.   Classic cytogenetics will be performed on the baseline 
(pretreatment) bone marrow study using standard methods.  In addition, a unique system, which 
utilizes FISH for the simultaneous detection of multiple chromosome aberrations on a single 
slide with labeled chromosome probes, will be used at five -scheduled time points.  The 
Multiprobe is a disposable glass device consisting of a 3 x 8 array of raised bosse s; each with 
different chromosome specific probes reversibly bound to them.38 
 
In this study, two slides will be used per scheduled time point. One slide will be use the 
Chromoprobe  Multiprobe I System for the rapid evaluation of cell ploidy and to determine the 
chromosomal origin of small marker chromosomes. The probes used are pericentromeric repeat 
sequences and satellite probes; this is often the only portion of the original chr omosome 
constituting the marker. Using this technique, we will test for gains or losses of whole 
chromosomes with 8 to 10 different chromosome specific probes (1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 17, and 18) to 
identify and further characterize aneuploidy in patients with multiple myeloma.  The second slide 
has been customized to identify myeloma -specific cytogenetic aberrations.  Four translocations 
affecting 14q32 and two locus -specific deletions will be studied.  These non -random aberrations 
have been determined to be th e most common in multiple myeloma, namely, t(4;14)(p16;q32), 
t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(14;18)9q32;q21), 13q14 (Rb loss) with 13q telomere 
probe and TP53 loss with a chromosome 17 telomere probe.37  Multiprobe FISH complements 
conventional cyto genetics and can be used to screen normal, failed and poorly described cases of 
multiple myeloma.  Use of this approach will increase the identification of patients with multiple 
 
IRB #[ADDRESS_309910] either the maternal or paternal X chromosome 
inactivated.  This genetic concept is also known as the Lyon hypothesis.  In theory, all normal 
female tissue would be randomly methylated with 50% of cells having the paternal (pat) allele 
inactivated and 50% of the cells having the maternal (mat) allele inactivated; the ratio of relative 
methylation would be 50:50, or a ratio of 1. This pattern of inactivation is maintained faithfully 
in all progeny.[ADDRESS_309911] ed PCR amplification, according to Mach -
Pascual et al.41 and quantitated by [CONTACT_254907].42 The HUMARA assay is 
designed to amplify a ~250 to 300 base pair (bp) region of the first exon of the human androgen 
receptor. Two Hpa II methylatio n sensitive sites reside within 100 bp 5’ to the polymorphic 
CAG repeat. Primers flank the methylation sensitive restriction enzyme sites and the CAG repeat 
simultaneously.  Methylated enzyme ( Hpa II) sites correlate with X inactivation.  Unmethylated 
alleles (active X) are digested by [CONTACT_254908]. The methylated 
or inactive allele will remain intact after the Hpa II digestion and is the only allele amplified.  
After amplification, the maternal and paternal alleles are resol ved using a sequencing gel.  
Random inactivation will show both maternal and paternal alleles, signifying a polyclonal state; 
whereas a clonal population will be identified by [CONTACT_254909] a shift of greater 
than 3-fold, to control for ske wed X-inactivation over the other allele.   
The allele ratio is defined as the ratio between the two chromosome X -linked alleles in a given 
sample. The corrected ratio is determined by [CONTACT_254910] I-Hpa II by [CONTACT_254911] I alone. This corrects 
for preferential am plification of one of the two alleles. Those samples with a corrected ratio of 
less than 3 are considered within normal limits.  Those with a corrected ratio greater than 3 are 
consistent with either skewed X inactivation or clonal hematopoiesis.  Although  criteria for 
nonrandom X -inactivation are arbitrary, an allele ratio > 3:1, which corresponds to the 
expression of 75% of one allele, has been widely accepted in the literature.42, 43  To normalize for 
excessive skewing, which occurs in ~20% of the female  population and appears to increase with 
aging,44 the ratio of the two alleles in the experimental tissue (polymorphonuclear cells) must be 
divided by [CONTACT_254912] (T -cells).  If the ratio 
remains great er than 3, the results are consistent with clonal hematopoiesis.

Version 09 11 2.10 COHNMC experience with tandem cycle high -dose therapy in MM  
 
Between 12/94 and 1/99,  [ADDRESS_309912] been enrolled on our prior 
tandem cycle high -dose chemot herapy trial.  Patients < 65 years, with a performance status of  
>70%, creatinine clearance of >70 cc/min, and with < 10% bone marrow  involvement in 
response, or with stable disease were eligible. The median age was 51 (range,38 -65), 23 (52%), 
16 (37%), and 5 (11%) patients received 1, 2, and 3 prior chemotherapy regimens;  Forty three 
percent of patients received prior radiation therapy; median time from diagnosis to high -dose 
therapy (HDCT) was 9.1 months (range,4.8 -73.4).  Three of forty four patients were in complete 
remission pre -high-dose threapy.  All patients underwent PBPC priming  with Filgrastim 5 μg/kg 
bid, sc to procure > 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and /or > 14 x 106 mononuclear cells /kg.  HDCT 
consisted of melphalan 150 mg/m2 (C1)  followed by  [CONTACT_254913] 4 mg/kg/day x 4 and  
cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day x 2 days (C2); each cycle was followed by [CONTACT_254914]. Alpha 
interferon 3 x 106 units /m2 three times a week, sc was then started for 2 years.  Four of 31 
patients (9%) did not receive C2 due to progress ion (n=1) deterioration in renal  function (n=1), 
dental abscess delaying admission (n=1) or psychosocial problems ( n=1).  C2 followed C1 in 
2.1 months (range, 0.9 -3.9). Two patients died of hepato -renal failure (VOD), [ADDRESS_309913] 27 pts treated with both C -s (85%); the median area under the 
curve (AUC) of busulfan in patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_254892]  (1150 uM*min, range, 788 -1323) was  
not higher then in pts  without VOD (1128 uM*min, range, 622 -1537). The number of days to 
absolute granulocyte recovery after C1 was 11.5 and after C 2 was 10, respectively.  Patients 
became platelet independent by [CONTACT_4475] 11.5  following C 1 and day 12 (7 -380+) after C2;  [ADDRESS_309914] -high-dose therapy were documented in ~ half of patients within [ADDRESS_309915] follow -up for live patients 
of 24.0 months (manuscript in preparation).45 
 
Based on the feasibility and possibly better CR rate and progression -free survival of tandem 
cycles of melphalan and busulfan/cyclophospha mide followed by [CONTACT_254915], survival data in this relatively “low tumor bulk” population with responding, or 
stable multiple myeloma we propose to treat a larger cohort of patients with exposure to < 3 prior 
treatment regimens with the same tandem regimen but with some modifications:  
 
Patients will be eligible with up to < 40% marrow involvement provided that they are either 
responding to induction therapy or have stable disease.  
 
We will incorporate cyclophosphamide b oth as a priming agent and to provide  in vivo purging 
prior to Filgrastim priming.  
 
Tandem cycles of high -dose melphalan and then busulfan/cyclophosphamide will be 
administered but  the dose of busulfan will be replaced with the IV preparation at 0.8 mg/ kg x [ADDRESS_309916] due to 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004  
Version 09 12 exposure to busulfan but possibly due to interaction between busulfan and cyclophosphamide 
metabolism/metabolites.  
 
02/22/01   Pharmacokinetic measurements of b usulfan will be carried out to correlate 
toxicities and outcome with drug kinetics.  
 
We will prolong administration of alpha interferon  for 3 years in view of preliminary data in our 
current cohort suggesting a “suppressive” effect of interferon on the de gree of myeloma protein 
production (manuscript in preparation).  
 
 
Pamidronate will be administered until progression at a dose of   90 mg every 4 weeks to all 
patients. 
 
For patients not in complete remission by 6 months (the majority of our patients in th e previous 
trial achieved a CR by [CONTACT_254916], or off interferon and pamidronate) thalidomide 400 
mg/day will be prescribed for a period of [ADDRESS_309917] an d FISH analysis to assess their role as predictors of 
response, monitors of residual disease and predictors of survival will be assessed.  In female 
patients the presence/evolution of clonal hematopoiesis will be monitored.  
 
3.0 THERAPEUTIC AGENTS   
 
3.1. Busulfan 
 
3.1.1. Therapeutic classification – Alkylating agent  
 
3.1.2 Mechanism of action – Interfere with DNA replication and transcription of RNA and 
ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid function.  
 
3.1.3 Animal tumor data – Busulfan has be en shown to be active against a variety of animal 
neoplasm in vivo, including mouse sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor.  
 
3.1.4 Animal toxicology – Busulfan fed to rats in an amount equivalent to about 0.5 mg/kg of 
final body weight per day slowed weight gain and produced bone marrow depression, 
pancytopenia and cataracts after about 10 weeks.  In rats, LD50 was found to be 34 mg/kg 
intraperitoneally.  When the drug was administered on day 13, 14, or 15 of gestation at a dose of 
10 mg/kg to rats, th e progeny were prematurely sterile.  
 
3.1.5 Human pharmacology – limited pharmacology data are available for the parenteral 
formulation to be used in this study and is given in above.  The pharmacokinetic data  suggests 
that the plasma decay of the formulat ion fits a two compartment model.  Busulfan is reported to 
be extensively metabolized, [ADDRESS_309918] been identified.  
The drug is slowly excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid.  Ten to 50% of a dose 
is excreted as metabolites within 24 hours.  
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004  
Version 09 13  
[IP_ADDRESS] Example: a 70 kg patient who is to receive a dose of 0.8 mg/kg of busulfan (6 mg/mL) 
would receive (70 kg) x (0.8 mg/kg) / ( 6 mg/mL) = 9.33 mL of busulfan injection.  
 
Calculate the amount of drug to be admin istered based on the dosage and the patient’s body 
weight.  
 
Prepare a solution of 0.09% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (normal saline) or 5% Dextrose 
Injection USP (D5W) that is 10 times the volume of the calculated busulfan dose in mL from the 
step above.   For example, if the dose of busulfan for injection is 9.33 mL, prepare an appropriate 
container with (9.33 mL dose) (10) = 93.[ADDRESS_309919] a suitable intravenous administration set into the outflow port of the bag containing the 
infusion solution.  
 
3.1.6 Route of Administration:  The drug will be given by [CONTACT_254917].  CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
Peristaltic pumps or syringe pumps may be used with the busulfan solutions as prepared above.  
Prior to and following each infusion, clear the catheter line with normal saline (approxima tely 6 
mL).  DO NOT infuse concomitantly with another intravenous solution of unknown 
compatibility.  
 
3.1.7 Pharmaceutical data: Busulfan injection is a sterile, pyrogen -free solution provided in a 
mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethylengegycol 400 (PEG400).  It is supplied in 
10 mL single use ampules at a concentration of 6 mg Busulfan per mL.  Each ampule contains 60 
mg of Busulfan in 3.3 mL of DMA and 6.7 mL of PEG400.  When diluted in normal saline or 
D5W to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL , the  resulting solutions must be administered within eight 
(8) hours of  preparation including the 2 hour infusion of the drug.

and can result in significant hepatic toxicity which can be fatal.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Temporary hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_254894] b e changes.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Grand mal seizures which can be prevented by [CONTACT_254920]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Edema: Seventy -nine percent (79%) of patients exhibited some form of edema, 
hypervolemia, or weight increase: all events were reported as mild or moderate.  
 
3.1.11 Supplier: This drug is commercially available.  
 
3.2. Cyclophosphamide  
 
3.2.1 Mechanisms of Action: This drug is biotransformed principally in the liver to active 
alkylating metabolites which prevent cell division by [CONTACT_254921].  
 
3.2.2 Human Toxicity:  Toxicity from cyclophosphamide includes bone marrow suppression 
which usually occurs ten to twelve days after administration, nausea and vomiting, reversible 
alopecia, hemorrhagi c cystitis which can frequently be prevented with increased hydration and 
co-administration of MESNA, and sterility and decreased gonadal function.  There are isolated 
reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration, and jaundice.  
 
3.2.3 Pharmaceut ical Data:  Formulation; Cyclophosphamide is supplied in 100 mg, 200 mg, 
and 500 mg vials as a white powder.  The drug can re reconstituted in either normal saline or 
D5W. 
 
6/14/99   3.2.4 Administration:  The drug should be dissolved in about 500 cc of 
D5W and it is infused IV over 2 hours.  An added dose of IV fluids may help prevent bladder 
toxicity.  Cyclophosphamide 1.5 gm/m2 (based on actual body weight) will be administered for 
mobilization, prior to apheresis.  During cycle 2 of the treatment  phase  the drug will be 
administered on Days -3 and -2 at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day IBW.  There will be no correction for 
extremely obese patients.  It will be dosed by [CONTACT_254922].  In order to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, 
vigorous hydration and diuresis together with ME SNA will be employed.

Version 09 15 3.2.5 Supplier:  This drug is commercially available for purchase by [CONTACT_31403].  
 
3.3 Melphalan  (L-phenylalanine mustard, L -PAM, Alkeran)  
 
3.3.1 Mode of Action:  In common with other nitrogen mustards, melphalan reacts with DN A 
to produce either DNA -DNA or DNA -proteins cross -linked products probably by [CONTACT_46599] 
N-7 position of guanine.  
 
3.3.2 Supply, Reconstitution and Administration:  Melphalan is commercially available by 
[CONTACT_254923] v ials containing 50 mg lyophilized drug as the 
hydrochloride salt.  It is formulated with 20 mg povidone per 50 mg vial.  Sterile diluent is 
supplied which contains per 10 ml: sodium citrate 0.20 g, propylene glycol 6 ml, ethanol (95%) 
0.526 ml, sterile wat er q.s. 10 ml. Reconstituted vials (undiluted solutions) are stable for 90 
minutes.  Melphalan diluted in NS to 0.1 -0.45mg/ml is stable for only 60 minutes.  Melphalan is 
unstable when diluted with NS to 2mg/ml.  The rate of infusion should be 30 minutes o r less.   
 
3.3.3 Toxicity:  The dose -limiting toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression.  Other toxicities 
after IV melphalan include mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Alopecia is generally seen 
only with high doses associated with bone marrow tra nsplant settings.  Rarely reported reactions 
include pulmonary fibrosis, skin rash, vasculitis, and allergic reactions.  With high dose 
chemotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity becomes dose -limiting.  At such high doses, elevated 
transaminases, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, depression, interstitial 
pneumonitis, and hepatic veno -occlusive disease have been reported.  Acute nonlymphocytic 
leukemia and myeloproliferative syndromes may occur as secondary cancers from any alkylating 
agent such as melphalan.  Amenorrhea, permanent in many cases, have been noted when 
melphalan was used in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.  
Azoospermia would be expected, but is not well documented in the literature.  
 
3.4 Filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF) 
 
3.4.1 Description  
 
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF), produced by [CONTACT_114474].  NEUPOGEN® is the [COMPANY_010] Inc. trademark for Filgrastim, recombinant 
methionyl human granulocyte colony s timulating factor (r -metHuG-CSF).  
 
Approximately 6,[ADDRESS_309920] participated in clinical 
trials of Filgrastim to date, and the worldwide commercial populations receiving Filgrastim 
totaled approximately 190,000.   The drug has been found to be well tolerated at dosages up to 60 
μg/kg/day given IV or SC, with no toxic effects attributable to Filgrastim. A maximum tolerated 
dose has not yet been determined.

3.6 Interferon -Alpha-2b 
 
3.6.1 Mechanism of action :  Alpha-2b interferon has a wide variety of antiproliferative, 
antiviral and immunomodulatory effects.  The major mechanism of effect in multiple myeloma is 
 
IRB #[ADDRESS_309921] which has been 
documented by [CONTACT_254925].  However, both immunomodulatory and antiviral effects cannot 
be excluded in the clinical setting.  
 
3.6.2 Human toxicity :  The major toxicity of alpha -2b interferon is a "flu -like" syndrome, 
which occurs in a dose dependent fashion and consists primarily of fever, chills, myalgias, 
arthralgias and headache.  At the three million unit dosage schedule the syndrome is minor or 
non-existent.  Fatigue with decrease in performance status is also usually mild at thi s dosage as is 
the objective toxicity such as neutropenia, anemia and reversible liver transaminase elevations.  
Autoimmune thyroid disease has been observed in patients receiving alpha -interferon.  
 
3.6.3 Pharmaceutical data :  Alpha-2b interferon will be s upplied in vials containing a sterile 
lyophilized powder.  The 5 million and 10 million IU vials are for use by [CONTACT_254926] 5 x 106 IU of interferon activity when reconstituted.  
 
3.6.4 Storage:  Lyophilized Powd er - Vials must be stored in a secured refrigerator at 2º - 8ºC 
(36º - 46ºF). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reconstituted Solution  
 
The reconstituted solution should be refrigerated at 2º - 8ºC (36º - 46ºF) and used within 24 
hours or frozen at –20ºC. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reconstitution  
 
Each 5 x 106 IU vial requires 1.0 ml of preservative -free sterile water for reconstituting the 
lyophilized powder into solution for injection.  Each 10 x 106 IU vial requires 2.0 mls of diluent.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to supply the s terile water.  Each vial may be used once 
only; any unused material will be discarded.  
 
3.6.5 Supplier:  Alpha-2b interferon is commercially available for purchase by a third party.

erythematous skin eruptions, peripheral neuropathy, increased appetite, weight gain, loss of 
libido, edema of face and extremities, galactorrhea, dry skin, leukopenia, menstrual 
abnormalities, pruritis, alopecia, eosinophillia, somnolence, depression and of course, teratogenic 
effects. 
 
3.7.8 WARNING : There is an extremely high risk that a deformed infant will result if 
pregnancy occurs while taking  thalidomide even for short periods.  Therefore, this teratogenic 
action of thalidomide necessitates:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Female patients having any chance of becoming pregnant must have a pregnancy test 
performed within [ADDRESS_309923] 4 weeks of treatment, 
and then evry 4 weeks if the patients periods are regular or every 2 weeks if they are not.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Female patients mus either abstain from all reproductive sexual intercourse or use [ADDRESS_309924] 1 hi ghly active method ( e.g. intrauterine device [IUD], 
hormonal [birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, or implants], tubal ligation, or partner’s vasectomy ) 
and 1 additional effective method ( e.g. latex, condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap ) at [ADDRESS_309925] 24 consecutive 
months. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Male patients must be counseled about the possibility that thalidomide may be present in 
semen.  Men must use a latex condom every time they have sexual intercourse with a woman 
during therapy and for [ADDRESS_309926] had a 
successful vasectomy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The bottle label will bear:“Warning: This product is contraindicated in men and women 
of childbearing age.  Thalidomide is an investigational new drug that can only be prescribed by a  
physician.”  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If secondary re -packaging is necessary then all bottles should bear a warning similar to 
the following:  “Thalidomide must not be used by [CONTACT_254928].”  
 
     [IP_ADDRESS] In addition, all bottles should have a ffixed a warning label similar 
to the following:  “This medication may cause drowsiness, alcohol may intensify this effect.  Use 
caution when driving or operating machinery.”  
 
3.8 Pamidronate  
 
3.8.1 Mechanism of Action :  Pamidronate is an inhibitor of bone  resorption and, in addition 
may interfere with the release, deposition of metastatic tumor deposits.  
 
3.8.2 Toxicity:  Fatigue, fever, diaarhea, nausea, arthralgias, and rarely hypocalcemia, phlebitis 
at the site of injection have been observed. In patients with multiple myeloma, the risk of renal 
dysfunction may be increased when a bisphosphonate is used in combination with thalidomide  
 02/03/04 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004

Version 09 31 9.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
 
The following definitions will be used for this study.  Response can be defined as a 50% or better 
reduction in serum myeloma protein production and further categorized as completed and partial.  
(Adopted from the ongoing Intergroup Study)  
 
9.1 Response Gradations : 
 
9.1.1 Complete response : Defined as the absence of bone marrow or blood findings of multiple 
myeloma on at least [ADDRESS_309948] disappear on electrophoresis as well as by 
[CONTACT_254933].  The follow -up bone marrow may not cont ain more than 3% plasma 
cells on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_58099].  Skeletal X -rays must 
either show recalcification or no change in osteolytic lesions.  
 
9.1.2 Partial Response :  Sustained decrease of the monoclonal serum prot ein by > 50% 
reduction) on at least two measurements of at least 6 week interval.  A response is clear -cut for 
patients who achieve a 75% or greater reduction in the serum myeloma protein concentration 
without evidence of increasing anemia.  Responding pat ients must also have a sustained decrease 
in 24-hour urine M -component to less of the initial prestudy value, and to less than 0.2 gm/day 
on at least two measurements at three -week intervals.  For a response to be confirmed, a marked 
reduction in both seru m myeloma protein and in Bence -Jones protein excretion must be present.  
Bone marrow plasma cells should be reduced by [CONTACT_2669] 50% from the pretreatment level.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_309949] remain normal.  Any of the following ancillary 
data will support the conclusion that an objective response has occurred, but are not required to 
confirm response:  1) recalcification of lytic skull or pelvis l esions (occurs in about 20% of 
responding patients with lytic lesions); 2) significant increase in depressed normal 
immunoglobulins, as in lgM increments exceeding 20 mg%, lgA exceeding 40 mg%, and lgG 
exceeding 400 mg% (occurs in about 15% of responding p atients); 3) fall in the level of the 
serum beta -2 microglobulin to the normal range (less than 1.0 mg/dl).  However, it is well 
established that IFN can increase the B 2M levels, which does not signify relapse.  
 
9.2 Stable:  Patients with 25 - 49% tumor ma ss regression without new symptoms or signs of 
myeloma with declines in the serum myeloma protein production of less than 25% of the 
pretreatment level will be considered to have no response.  
 
9.3 Plateau State :  Is defined as a lack of progression (change  of < 25% myeloma protein) for 
a minimum duration of 3 months.  
 
9.4 Progression :  Patients with a > 25% increase in myeloma protein production or other 
signs of disease such as hypercalcemia, etc.  
 
9.5 Relapse:  This is defined by [CONTACT_254934] e evidence and constitutes the 
earliest of any of the following:  1) an increase by [CONTACT_726] 100% from the lowest level of the 
serum myeloma protein production; 2) an increase above the response level of the myeloma peak 
(i.e., relapse to more than 25% of  the baseline myeloma protein production); 3) reappearance of 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004  
Version 09 32 the myeloma peaks that had disappeared with the treatment; 4) definite increase in the size and 
number of lytic bone lesions recognized on radiographs.  Compression fractures per se do not 
constitute a relapse.   
 
9.6 Performance Status :  Karnofsky Performance status will be recorded.  
 
10.0 REPORTING DATA  
 
All primary data will be maintained by [CONTACT_204105], City of Hope National 
Medical Center. This includes on study flow shee ts, consent forms and off -study forms.  
 
01/07/00 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size  
 
The primary goal of this phase II study is to assess the feasibility and toxicities of administering 
two cycles of sequential high -dose chemotherapy consis ting of melphalan and subsequent 
busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_254935], alpha interferon, and 
thalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma.  Feasibility will be defined as the ability to 
receive all IL -2 
01/07/00    treatments.  The secondary objectives are to analyze response rate, 
progression -free and overall survival following receipt of this treatment regimen; and to assess 
the feasibility of adding Thalidomide for patients not yet in complete response (CR) at 6 months 
and the subsequent CR rate received.  
 
03/13/[ADDRESS_309950] error of  
01/07/00    7%.  Based on our past experience,  it is estimated that approximately 18 
patients (35%) will have achieved a CR by 6 months, so that approximately 32 patients will go 
on to receive Thalidomide.  
 
Based on the current referral patterns to the Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow 
Transplantation, it is expected that approximately 20 patients per year  
03/13/02   will be eligible for this study.  With a goal of 70 patients, approximately 3 
½ years of accrual will be required.  As the majority of relapses are expected to occur within 3 
years or less, the study will continue for 3 -4 years to allow sufficient follow -up for the secondary 
goal of analyzing disease progression and survival as well.  
 
11.2 Toxicity Grading  
Hematologic suppression has traditionally been accepted as a primary endpoint  for analysis of 
toxicity in investigational agents and novel drug combinations in oncology.  Nevertheless, 
autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation has ameliorated this toxicity significantly, 
allowing for high -dose chemotherapy.  We will utilize t he Division of Cancer Treatment 
(DCT)/National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for evaluating toxicity of all 
organ systems, with the exception of the hematologic and gastrointestinal system, where we will 
follow the modified guidelines for  studies involving bone marrow transplantation as 
recommended by [CONTACT_254936] (CTEP)  (Appendix D).  
 
 
IRB #[ADDRESS_309951] monitored the rate of treatment related death and so far, such death rate is 1.8% afte r 
treating 54 patients.  The study statistics call for a total of 70 patients for accrual.  Hence, if there 
is more then one additional VOD related treatment associated mortality in the next 10 patients, or 
if there are more then two cases within the next 20 patients who’s demise is related to VOD 
associated treatment related side effects, this study will be stopped.  
 
At the same time we will monitor the study for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_254897].  Historically the ov erall feasibility rate with IL -2 treatment has been 
estimated to be 65%.  Inability to receive the full treatment regimen may be due to any of the 
following causes:  grade 3 or greater toxicities, intolerance, or disease progression within one 
year.  If at  any point in the monitoring process there is a 95% or greater probability that the true 
feasibility rate is less than 65%, then the trial will be stopped early.  This would occur if the 
following numbers of inability to tolerate treatment regimen were obs erved: 
 
11.4 Criteria for Success  
 
03/13/02   If the study accrues to the full 70 patients, the trial will be considered a 
success on the primary endpoint if an overall feasibility rate of 65% or greater is observed.  If the 
estimated feasibility rate in t he study group is equal to 65% then the 95% confidence interval 
would range from 52% to 78%, so that a minimum feasibility rate of 52% is ensured with 95% 
confidence.  
  
01/07/[ADDRESS_309952] observed that approximately 10% of those patients 
who are not in CR at 6 months reach a CR after 6 months without administration of Thalidomide.  
If 10 out of the 32 patients (31%) receiving Thalidomide on the current study can be converted to 
CR after 6 months, then this approach will be considered a success , with the 95% confidence 
interval for late CR conversion ranging from 15% to 47%.  
 
03/13/[ADDRESS_309953] 50 patients, the actual number requiring thalidomide 
is only 46%.  In order to achieve the initial targeted number of 32 patients, not in CR, and 
requiring thalidomide (thereby [CONTACT_254937] -interferon as well as the ability of thalidomide to induce complete response 
conversion).  We request that the targeted accrual be increased to 20, hence, an additional 9 
patients, not in CR, can be treated with thalidomide for a total of 32 patients.  
 
11.5 Analytic Plan  
 
The primary endpoint of feasibility will be estimated as a proportion along with the 95% 
confidence interval for t he binomial.  If our accrual goal is met with no premature termination 
due to significant toxicity, a secondary goal of assessing response, progression -free survival 
(PFS), and overall survival (OS) will be carried out.  Survival estimates will be made usi ng the 
product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier, with 95% confidence limits calculated using the logit 
transformation.  These estimates will be contrasted with the historical rates of 81% PFS and 85% 
OS at two years, although formal hypothesis testing will  not 
01/07/00   be conducted.  It is hoped that PFS and OS will be further improved with 
the addition of Thalidomide.  10/10/02 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]  February 03, 2004  
Version 09 34  
While the primary estimates will be for the entire study group, survival estimates will also be 
carried out for subgroups stratified by b one marrow involvement (<=10% versus >10%), by 
[CONTACT_254938] (CR/PR versus Stable Disease), and by [CONTACT_254939] (yes versus no), 
as these are known to be important prognostic factors.  Additional descriptive analyses assessing 
the incidence o f hepatic and other toxicities was a correlate of busulfan and( if feasible) 
cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics will also be carried out.  
 
01/07/[ADDRESS_309954] fi ve years with the same primary site of disease 
targeted for this protocol (breast).  Our goal is to maintain our high accrual of women while 
continuing to increase the accrual of minority subjects.

Samples of 7.5  mL of blood in green top tubes will be submitted for flow cytometric analysis 
with special emphasis for CD3, CD8, CD4, CD16,  CD56 and CD57 marking.  Samples will be 
obtained pre -interferon, at 6 months from day 0 of cycle 2 (pre -thalidomide) , and 12 months 
from day 0 of cycle 1.  Details of NK cell functional analysis are still being worked out, and will 
be incorporated once the logistics (technician becomes available) are in place.  
 
2. A total of [ADDRESS_309963] dose of busulfan.  Five (5) milliliters of peripheral blood 
will be collected in green -top (sodium heparin) tubes at the following times; pre -dose, just prior 
to the end of the infusion, then [ADDRESS_309964] of  centrifugation at 500xg

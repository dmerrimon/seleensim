transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190845] a single center study.  
 
Study Duration:   [ADDRESS_1219792] 10 years.  
 
Primary Study Objectives  The primary objectives of this trial are:  
 
1.) To remove all immunosuppressive therapy from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -identical sibling renal 
transplants within 24 months of transplantation.  
2.) To detect and follow cellular (macro) chimerism of donor hematopoietic stem cell 
(DHSC) lineages and the generation of T -regulatory cells using specialized 
immunomonitoring assays for these donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873250].  
3.) To investigate the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen consisting of induction 
therapy with Campath -1H and steroid -free low dose maintenance immunosuppression, 
consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/Myfortic and tacrolimus converted to siroli mus.  
This is to be  followed by [CONTACT_873358], 
at a minimum, post -transplant, in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873251]34+ stem cells (DHSC).  
 
Primary Outcomes  The primary endpoints are:  
1.) Patient and graft survival measured at the one -year timepoint post -transplant.  
2.) The ability to withdraw immunosuppression as above [ADDRESS_1219793] -transplant with 
follow -up to 10 years.  
 
Secondary Outcomes      Secondary safety and efficacy endpoints are as follows:

     1 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Background  
 
1) HLA -Identical renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873261] a ten -year actual (death -
uncensored) graft survival of 65 -70% (Cecka JM, UCLA, National Transplant Registry, 
1993 -1994 to 2003 -2004). This 10 -year data -point is on a slope that has a (late) downward 
curve, in all probability reflecting the cumulative effects of immunosuppressive therapy 
[since close to 20% mortality has occurred by 10 years with a median recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873262] 40±10.8 (S.D.) years], as well as chronic allograft nephropathy/rejection and (a 
few) disease recurrence s.   
 
Even in this most recent era immunosuppressive therapy continues to be the main cause of 
early and late morbidity and mortality, in this most favorable group of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. These data 
contradict the ethical argument against immunosuppressive withdrawal “because such 
favorable matches do so well ”. They override considerations supporting the continuous 
expense and the greater susceptibility to opportunistic infections, cancer, accelerated 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and blindness, as well as (in over 50 % of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) the 
lack of rehabilitation to societal norms, so as to maintain long -term graft survival, which still 
results in chronic deterioration and loss of life.  
 
2) In preliminary observations, we are now following [ADDRESS_1219797] -operatively, who received the two -
dose Campath -1H induction regimen on (steroid -free) maintenance half -dose tacrolimus 
(Tacro) converted to sirolimus (Siro) at [ADDRESS_1219798] 
occurred.  
 
3) This principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_873263] (University of Miami Medical Center) based on living -related 1 -
haplotype -matched renal transplant donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873264]-operatively, with a boost infusion three to four months postoperatively using Campath -
1H induction and (steroid -free) one -half dose Tacro with conversion to Siro (before the boost 
infusion), and one -half dose MMF maintenance conditioning befo re the withdrawal phase. 
Immunosuppression is being withdrawn over 30 months [beginning at 12 months 
postoperatively -Siro and at 24 months postoperatively -MMF]. Renal transplant biopsies are 
being performed at surgery and at 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1219799] any evidence of 
cellular or humoral rejection. Such adverse findings would eliminate the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873265] (see current ITN protocol 
#022ST). Four patients have been transplanted and infused with DHSC and five controls 
have been transplanted who have been given the same immunosuppressive regimen without 
DHSC. (No drug withdrawal was performed in the controls.)  Clinical follow -up in the 
controls have demonstrated [ADDRESS_1219800] of 
these recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873266] -fold more chimerism than seen in our bone marrow infused kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873267]1,2 as well as (twofold) higher numbers of 
CD4+CD25+ T regs and Fox -P3 mRN A copi[INVESTIGATOR_873268]3+ cells in peripheral blood.  For the 
more recent result update in the DHSC infused patients see Section 2.1.5.

     4) Campath -1H is a humanized mAb directed to CD52 determinants on the surface of human 
leukocytes, of which there are an estimated 400,000 binding sites per cell. Waldmann found 
that optimal T -cell depletion was attained with the IgG1 isoform (1H).[ADDRESS_1219801] disease (GVHD) was extremely low in this and other recent series, 
suggesting that Campath -1H treatment was protective against this complication.8 
This antibody has been particularly effective in control of autoimmune diseases, including 
acute vasculitides9, multiple sclerosis10, and in autoimmune cytopenias11, 12  
Although not FDA approved for renal transplantation, this agent has been used in an 
estimated 2000 renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (off label) over the last 10 years in the United 
States and elsewhere.  
 
5) It is a well -known phenomenon transcending phylogeny in several inbred experimental 
animal species enabling defined immune studies (fetal and adult inbred mice, rats, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]), 
that the lesser the immunogenetic disparity, the greater the feasibility of  inducing donor -
specific immunological tolerance to transplanted organs and tissues. Mixed or total DHSC -
derived chimerism has been a basic component of the majority of these most robust tolerance 
states. There is also less likelihood of GVH reactions, the  closer the donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873269]. Both of these (tolerance and lack of GVH) have indeed proven to be the 
case in the myeloma human renal failure recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -identical donor bone marrow and 
kidneys in the [LOCATION_005] General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_873270].13 
 
1.2 Hypothesis : 
It is our hypothesis that a four -dose (peri -operative and 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1219802]) DHSC 
infusion protocol using two -dose Campath -1H induction combined with transient 
(conditioning) Tacro/Siro and MMF therapy will result in a high degree of macrochimerism 
(>10%), and a robust prolonged donor -specific (post -thymic) immunoregulatory condition 
that will allow renal transplant survival in the absence of permanent immunosuppression.  
 
Innovative mechanistic studies will include a novel HLA -identical chimeric PCR -Flow serial 
analysis based on non -HLA (cytokine gene) polymorphisms, other marker detection, split 
tolerance ELISPOT and micro -CML assays, in -vivo delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), 
amplified HLA -identical mixed lymphocyte dendritic cell assays and molecular and flow 
cytometric analysis for T -cell and dendridic cell regulatory markers in peripheral blood and 
iliac crest marrow performed in our laboratories. These will be comple mented with sensitive 
newer assays for donor -specific and non -specific (HLA and non -HLA) antibody studies in 
serial long -term follow -up.

1.3.1  Donor Stem Cells  
This section briefly describes the collection, processing and delivery of the CD34+ enriched 
cells, and refers to the included SOPs and other appropriate documents in the Northwestern 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_873271].  These SOPs, etc., are what wi ll be used for every 
procedure step, and are included at the end of the entire protocol.   
These are numbered RWC 2.2.04, BC GEN 1.2.13, BC GEN 1.2.12, BMT 3.1.02, BMT 
3.1.03, BMT 3.1.10, BMT 4.1.01, BMT 5.1.02, BMT 10.1.01, HSCT 3.[ADDRESS_1219804].  Briefly, these stem cell procedures, as 
mentioned, are divided into three sections:  1.  Collection; 2.  Processing; 3.  Delivery.   
1.  Collection and 2.  Processing of Iliac crest bone marrow cells.  
Iliac crest bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) will be harvested and/or 
processed for the following purposes:  
a. Donor BMCs to infuse into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873272] [ADDRESS_1219805] bone marrow will be harvested under general 
anesthesia in a surgical suite from the donor after the donor transplant nephrectomy.  A 
bone marrow mononuclear “buffy coat” will be prepared using the GAMBRO Spectra 
apheresi s instrument equipped with bone marrow buffy coat software set -up.  The 
allogeneic progenitor cells (buffy coat cells) will be further processed to isolate CD34+ 
progenitors using the Miltenyi CliniMACS system.  The isolated CD34+ cells are the 
investigati onal drug (cellular product) that will be tested in this protocol.  
 
MILTENYI CLINIMACS CD34+ CELL SELECTION  
Both sources of donor stem cells (intraoperative iliac crest bone marrow and HPC -A 
(leukapheresis) cells) will be positively selected for CD34+ cells prior to patient 
administration according to manufacturer’s instructions using the Miltenyi CliniMACS 
instrument.  Breifly, according to manufacturer instructions for operation of the CliniMACS 
device:  
 
1. HPC collection(s) will be washed with a phosphate buffered saline solution containing 
0.5 percent human serum albumin (HSA) and ethylene diamino -ethyl -tri-acetic acid 
(EDTA) to remove most of the platelets from the product and to reduce the product 
volume.  
 
2. Following the platelet wash step, the cells will be incubated with the CD34 monoclonal 
antibody -super -paramagnetic particle reagent supplied in the kit for 30 minutes and 
washed to remove unbound CD34 labeling agent.  
 
3. After cell labeling, the cells will be transferred to a sterile transfer pack, connected to the 
Miltenyi CliniMACS Selection device and an automated CD34 Selection program will be 
initiated.  The selection medium used throughout the procedure will be the 
manufacturer’s PBS/HSA/EDTA medium.  
 
4. At the completion of the selection process, an aliquot of the cells will be analyzed to 
determine the quantity and purity of the CD34+ cells and to assess the log depletion of

     donor CD3+ T-lymphocytes.  The desired composition of the donor graft is: CD34+ cell 
dose > 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  T -lymphocyte cell dose < 5 x 104 CD3+ cells/kg.  
 
5. Specific details of the CD34 selection procedures can be found in the standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) located in Appendix II.  
 
b. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873273] [ADDRESS_1219806] will serve as a frozen “back -up” rescue source of au tologous stem cells in the 
event that graft vs. host disease occurs in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873274] .  
c. Donor Mobilized HPCs  
Approximately 250 mL of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) will be harvested 
from the donor following  the harvest of the donor bone marrow cells.  The PBPCs will 
be collected using the GAMBRO Spectra apheresis instrument following standard 
HPC -A collection procedures currently in use at NMH Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
Transplantation Program.  Briefly, a stan dard volume leukapheresis  (~ 12 L) will be 
performed on two successive days between two to three months postoperatively to 
obtain sufficient PBPCs  to permit isolation of peripheral blood CD34+ cells.  
(Mobilized by [CONTACT_873360]).  The first day’s leukapheresis  
CD34+ product is to be administered to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873275] (freshly) after the 
CliniMACS separation.  The second day’s leuk apheresis product, after CliniMACS 
purification, will be divided into two equal aliquots to be administered after 
cryopreservation and thawing (at the bedside) at month 6 and 9 respectively.  The 
Miltenyi CliniMACS system is to be used for C D34+ isolation.  The isolated CD34+ 
cells are the investigational drug (cellular product) that will be tested in this protocol.   
 
3.  Delivery and Infusion of the Product  
These two methods are also described in the accompanying documents (#BMT 10.1.[ADDRESS_1219807] 3.04) as mentioned at the end of the entire protocol consistent with methodology 
performed for stem cell patient delivery at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
In addition, a plan of action for all positive test results during the aforementioned procedures 
is included in these documents. Please refer to the QAP for a description of the notification 
of a positive test result following the QAP plan.  Adverse event reporting and corrective and 
preventive action plans will be used to notify the patient’s physician or study PI, investigate 
the incident and take appropriate corrective and preventive actions.  The incident (s) is to be 
reported to appropriate local, stat e or federal agencies as required.  This plan includes a 
mechanism to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_873276] a positive result is reported, in the event of 
positive microbial cultures, notification of manufacturing deviations, or in the event of post 
transfusion reactions.  Specifically, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_873277], the NIDDK sponsor, the Data Safety Monitoring Board and the FDA in an 
appropriate time sequence defined by [CONTACT_873361] (included 
previously in this IND application).  
These products have been used 7 times in a NIAID, VA Merit Review, ITN and FDA 
approved study being conducted in 1 Haplotype matched, DHSC infused renal transplant

of bone marrow non -T and T cell subsets, stem ming from the sur prising finding, after bone 
marrow infusion, of the significant increase in chimeric (donor) cells in the se questered en -
vironment of th e recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873278], as opposed to periph eral blood.  The fol -
lowing summaries therefore also include these published studies, as well as our initial 
Campath -1H (unpublished) w ork within the past year.  
 
2.1 Summary of Clinical Experience  
2.1.1 Campath -1H and Cyclosporine in Renal Transplantation  
Watson, CJ 14 used Campath -1H for induction prophylaxis in 31 participants undergoing 
renal transplantation. Campath -1H was administered at a dose of 20 mg on Day 0 and 
repeated on Day 1, and after a 72 -hour delay cyclosporin (target trough level 75 to 125 
ng/mL) was i nitiated without glucocorticoids and without any other maintenance drug 
therapy.  At a follow -up of five years, there has been a 22.6% incidence of acute rejection 
(16.1% at 1 year with 79% graft survival at five years and 88% participant survival at five 
years) Watson, CJ, Calne R, et al. Am J Transplant 2005;5:1347 -53.  There was prolonged 
and profound depletion of circulating lymphocytes with a mean lymphocyte count at 1 -year 
follow -up of approximately 800/mm.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_873279], there ha s not been 
an increased incidence of infection or malignancy compared to conventional therapy.  In this 
series, Campath -1H did not prevent recurrent disease, [ADDRESS_1219809] had recurrent IgA 
nephropathy, and 1 participant had recurrent membranous glom erulonephritis.  This 
observation is similar to conventional therapy.  
 
2.1.2 Campath -1H and Sirolimus in Renal Transplantation  
Data on the use of Campath -1H in renal transplantation were reported by [CONTACT_873362].15  This 
trial was designed to determine whether pretransplant administration of Campath -1H would 
allow allotransplantation without maintenance immunosuppression. Eight living related -
donor renal -allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283283] 3 doses of Campath -1H (0.3 mg/kg ), initiated 
before transplantation. There was rapid clearance of T cells from circulation, which persisted 
beyond [ADDRESS_1219810] and CAD renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379370] -HLA Identical    version date: 25 Sep  2020

     by [CONTACT_873363], et al. using a two -dose Campath -1H induction regimen and continuous 
sirolimus therapy.16 
 
2.1.3 Campath -1H, Tacrolimus and MMF in Renal Transplantation  
At Northwestern University/Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a single intraoperative dose of 
30 mg Campath -1H was used in combination with tacrolimus (trough levels of 4 -6 ng/mL), 
and MMF (1 gm daily), beginning after September 2001.  In May 2002, [ADDRESS_1219811] infection. Campath -1H was associated with prolonged 
lymphophenia lasting 4 to 6 months.17   Kaufman et al recently reported o n Northwestern’s 
single center experience with Campath 1H induction in 123 renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 18. 
Again a single intraopertive dose of Campath 1H was used with prednisone -free maintenance 
immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus and MMF.  One year acute rejection rate was 
15.4%. Patient and graft survival at [ADDRESS_1219812] -transplant were 95.9 and 91.9  %, 
respectively.  Infectious complications in Campath 1H patients were not qualitatively 
different from an historical cohort of patients receiving a non lymphocyte depleting induction 
agent (Simulect).  Currently, over 1000 renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873280] e been treated with 
Campath 1H induction at Northwestern.  
 
2.1.4 Campath -1H Experience in Transplantation at the University of Miami  
 
The use of Campath -1H as induction therapy in renal transplantation: preliminary 
results.19 In attempt to reduce both initial and long -term (nephrotoxic) calcineurin inhibitor 
maintenance dosage and totally eliminate maintenance corticosteroids.  In Miami, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_873281] (Campath -1H) as induction therapy in first cadaver and non -HLA identical 
living donor renal transplantation.  Forty -four de novo renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873282] -1H (0.3 mg/kg) on day 0 and day 4 postoperatively preceded by 
[CONTACT_873364]. Maintenance target 12 -hour Tacrolimus trough levels of 5 -7 
ng/ml were operational from the outset as well as (reduced) mycophenolate mofetil dosage of 
[ADDRESS_1219813] week 
postoperatively.  With a median follow -up of 9 (range 1 -19) months, patient and graft 
survival were each at 100%.  Biopsy -proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 patients.  A 
total of 4 patients developed infections that required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n.  Thirty -eight recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873283] -term corticosteroid therapy.  In an early assessment, the 
combination of Campath -1H, low dosing of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, and 
avoidance of maintenance corticosteroid use appears to  be safe and effective for kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Long -term outcomes will be reported in the future.  
 
A randomized trial of three renal transplant induction antibodies: early comparison of 
tacrolimus, MMF and steroid dosing, and newer immune -monitoring by [CONTACT_978].19,[ADDRESS_1219814] renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873284], Group A received Thymoglobulin, Group B received 
Alemtuzumab, and Group C received Daclizumab.  Maintenance immunosuppression  
included tacrolimus and mycophenolate in all three arms, and methylprednisolone in Grou ps 
A and C only (standard clinical institutional practice).  The targeted trough level of 
tacrolimus was between 8 and 10 ng/ml for Groups A and C, respectively, with a targeted 
mycophenolate dose of 1 gm twice daily.  However, in Group B, target tacrolimu s trough

     level was 4 -7 ng/ml to reduce long -term nephrotoxicity, with 500 mg twice -daily doses of 
mycophenolate, without steroid maintenance. In this 15 -month median postoperative interval 
report, there were no notable differences in demographics and patient and gr aft survival.  
Acute rejection rates at one year were equivalent, i.e., 5/30 in all three groups (~16.6%).  In 
Group B, there was slightly lower renal function at one month, but no difference at one year.  
There was also significantly more leukopenia, but a greater percentage of T regulatory cells 
and number of Fox -P3 mRNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_873285], by [CONTACT_873365] -quantitative 
PCR analysis in Group B.  This preliminary  analysis has indicated that in Group B 80% of 
these patients remained steroid -free at  1-year postoperatively, with lower tacrolimus trough 
levels, and no difference in other adverse events.  
 
Campath -1H does not alter bone marrow cell regulatory function.20,[ADDRESS_1219815] 
previously reported in laboratory volunteers ( in vitro ) and renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( ex vivo ), 
that bone marrow cells (BMC) are potent down -regulators of the immune response.  Also, the 
use of alemtuzumab (Campath -1H, C1H) for immunodepletion is associated with the most 
potent lasting effects yet seen on T cell immunity in renal transplantation. We questioned if 
the administration of C1H to kidney allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873286] (DBMC) 
infusions would lead to stronger or weaker immunoregulatory effects.   In vitro  Human BMC 
depleted of T cells (nT -BMC) were either untreated or treated with C1H and rabbit 
complement, and compared for their ability to down -regulate autologous or allogeneic T cell 
responses, and to generate T regulatory (T reg) cells.  The proliferati ve responses to anti -CD3 
monoclonal antibody of T cells derived from co -cultures with C1H -treated or untreated 
autologous nT -BMC were equally suppressed , i.e., an equivalent alteration in CD3 complex 
signaling, not regained by [CONTACT_873366] -2.  ATP levels were also markedly reduced in T 
cells both from C1H -treated and untreated nT -BMC co -cultures. The ability of C1H -treated or 
untreated nT -BMC to sup press autologous T cell cytotoxic function was also equivalent, with 
a marked, but equivalent, capacity to induce CD4/CD25high T regs from CD3+ cells, which 
effectively down -regulated cytotoxic T cells.  To mimic the clinical infusion of DBMC into 
(allogen eic) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], PBL were also cultured with allogeneic C1H -treated and untreated nT -
BMC.  T cells derived from these cultures secondarily stimulated with the same donor mature 
APC, showed suppressed cytotoxicity by 85% and 54%, respectively.  These in vitro  studies 
suggest that C1H does not abrogate BMC immunoregulation and thus may allow its lympho -
depleting effect to be synergistic.  
 
2.1.5 DBMC Experience in Transplantation  
In the PI’s experience at the University of Miami between September 1994 and May 1998, 
63 CAD renal transplant recip ients of either one or two postoperative vertebral DBMC 
infusions were pro spectively compared with 219 demo graph ically equivalent (non -
randomized) non -infused con trols given equiva lent OKT3, tacrolimus, MMF, and 
methylprednisolone immuno suppression. There was at least a [ADDRESS_1219816] antigen match pres -
ent between donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873287].  Clinical follow -up ranged from 2.9 -6.3 years 
(mean, 4.7 years).  Only 2/63 (3.2%) DBMC recipi [INVESTIGATOR_873288] -proven chronic rejection, 
whereas 41/219 (18.7%) showed chronic re jection in the con trols (p = <0.01).  If death with a 
functioning graft was excluded, graft sur vival was 94.1% in t he DBMC group and 79.8% in 
the con trols (p=0.039). Forty controls had deteriorating renal function compared with 2 in the 
DBMC group (p=0.04). In the DBMC group, chimerism in iliac crest marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_873289] -Flow mea surements between 1 and 4 years

Patient and Graft Outcome:   As a brief summation of that study, similar findings have been 
present in three other stem cell -infused patients —now all over one -year post -transplant, but 
one (DHSC Patient  #2, a 20 year old Latin female; RO) has had a rapid recurrence of focal 
segment al glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that occurred  in the native kidney.  Although she is 
not yet on dialysis, she is nearing this point with a serum creatinine of  >5.0 mg/dl.  
 
DHSC patient #1, (a 28 -year old Latin female) has a serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dl, due to a 
recurrence of Type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in the transplant, 
which has been very slowly progressive but in which allograft rejection has not been present 
on biopsy. (now [ADDRESS_1219820] -transplant).  
 
Patient #3, (a 30 -year old Latin male) is now two years after transplantation with a serum 
creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl.  He is about to be totally withdrawn from sirolimus (now on .5 
mg/day) to convert solely to MMF.   
 
Patient #4, (a 62 -year old Caucasian male) is now [ADDRESS_1219821] transplant with a serum 
creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl and is being slowly withdrawn from sirolimus, with MMF to remain 
for the additional several months after sirolimus withdrawal as per the ITN pr otocol.   
 
Patients #3 and #[ADDRESS_1219822] also had no evidence of acute or chronic rejection clinically or on 
biopsy, but Patient #3 is very susceptible to dehydration, with having had some proteinurea 
attributed to sirolimus therapy, which has subsided as the drug has been  slowly withdrawn.  
 
Treatment Received (Brief Summary):   Patients #1, #3 and #4 all received the DHSC 
infusions and planned immunosuppression of the protocol described in Section 1.1 - i.e., two 
doses of Campath and half dosing of tacrolimus switched to sirolimus.  However, Patient #1, 
because of her recurrence  of MPGN, has not had immunosuppression withdrawn and actually

2.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
2.3.1  Potential Benefits  
Renal transplantation using Campath -1H induction combined with DHSC infusions from the 
same HLA identical sibling donor has the potential to allow acceptance of a donor renal 
allograft without chronic immunosuppression.  This treatment is believed to cause  a greater 
degree of tolerance of the transplanted kidney by [CONTACT_10489], thus, avoiding rejection and 
perhaps allowing the partial or even total withdrawal of the need for continuous use of anti -
rejection drugs.  This therapy has been undertaken in an attemp t to offer renal transplantation 
and hence freedom from dialysis without the complications of long -term immunosuppressive 
drug administration.  Long -term complications of continuous immunosuppression   can 
include cataracts, osteoporosis, diabetes, atheros clerosis, hypertension, malignancy, plus the 
risk of chronic allograft rejection/nephropathy.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Graft Versus Host Disease  
GVHD (graft versus host disease) although considered to be unlikely might occur, with the 
possibility of the donor bone marrow cells reacting against the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  This has been seen 
in patients who have received bone marrow transplants to treat other di seases, such as 
leukemia, in which there has been an ablative procedure to totally knock out the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
own marrow.    However, in this protocol, the patients are not to receive the marrow 
destroying therapy, which is probably a prerequisite for the d evelopment of graft vs. host 
disease.  Nonetheless, one unit of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s own marrow and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s white cells will 
be stored before transplantation to treat GVHD.   
T-cell depletion (TCD) of the infused marrow derived cells, a strategy to decrease GVHD, is 
under investigation in stem cell transplantation for hematologic, oncologic and 
immunodeficiency diseases.  T his technique effectively decreases the incidence and severity 
of acute GVHD, but with increased problems with graft rejection33-37 and relapse.  Methods of 
graft manipulation may be based upon removing T lymphocytes (TCD) by a variety of 
antibody mediated approaches or physical methods of separation. Most rece ntly, positively 
selected CD34+ progenitor cells are commonly used. Transplant related mortality outcome 
appeared to be predominantly affected by [CONTACT_873370][INVESTIGATOR_873295] 2 x 105 CD3+ T cells/kg.  In patients receiving more 
than 2 x105 CD3+ cells/kg, the incidence of Grade II -IV GVHD was 55%. It is important to 
note that in all these studies, patients receive myeloablative regimens.  Perhaps the largest 
experience of TCD transplants occurring w ithout preparative chemotherapy is in the setting 
of severe combined immune deficiency. In this disease, children often receive TCD 
haploidentical parental marrow. In most cases, GVHD that developed after the administration 
of TCD depleted marrow was mild (grade I or II) and required no treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Campath -1H 
Infusion -related events have been associated with the use of Campath. These events include 
rigors, fever, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, hypotension, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, 
chills, pruritis, headache, diarrhea, and urticaria and/or rash. In patients  using Campath for 
oncology indications, Campath has been found to induce profound lymphopenia in patients 
given many -fold higher dosing than in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86570].  Campath 
therapy has been associated with the opportunistic viral, b acterial, and fungal infections, 
some of which were fatal.  Leukemia and lymphoma patients receiving Campath have 
experienced severe, prolonged, and in rare instances fatal myelosuppression.  Bone marrow 
aplasia and hypoplasia have been observed, as well a s severe and fatal autoimmune anemia 
and thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.38

Transplantation      Although Campath -1H therapy may lead to prolonged suppression of CD4+ cells, this has 
not been found to be associated with clinical infection in humans who have suppressed CD4+ 
cells following lymphoid irradiation or bone marrow transplantation.  Research participants 
in the Campath -1H trial in England (31 subjects) have not experienced any serious or life 
threatening infections following renal transplantation. Two subjects experienced 
opportunistic infections (systemic cytomegalovirus infection and an abdo minal abscess 
attributed to reactivation of a prior tuberculosis infection) that responded to therapy.[ADDRESS_1219828] only been seen in a single trial of 
participants with multiple sclerosis, where 1/[ADDRESS_1219829] not observed any cases of Graves disease in patients 
receiving Campath 1H as induction for solid organ transplantation.  
 
Patients with Graves disease will be excluded unless previously adequately treated with 
radioiodine ablative therapy.  This trial was unique in that very high doses of Campath -1H 
were given (100 mg given over 5 days) and Graves disease did not occur until [ADDRESS_1219830] use approved 
methods of birth control for the duration of their participation in the study.   
 
In some oncology subjects treated with Campath, profound and long -lasting lymphopenia 
(decreased CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts) was observed, and total lymphocyte counts 
did not return to baseline levels even after [ADDRESS_1219831] -therapy.  CBC and platelet counts will 
be monitored frequently if worsening anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, or 
neutropenia is observed on study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tacrolimus  
Tacrolimus administration will be based on trough blood levels (AM) to provide levels of 
between 4 and 7 ng/ml during its administration course.  These levels will be obtained daily 
as inpatients and with each clinic visit as outpatients (see calendar).  T he tacrolimus dose 
should be decreased in the presence of adverse events as clinically warranted.   Risks 
associated with the administration of tacrolimus include hypertension, hyperkalemia, 
nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, posttransplant insulin -independent  diabetes mellitus, 
myocardial hypertrophy (in most cases reversible upon dose reduction), and increased risk of 
renal insufficiency in patients with hepatic impairment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sirolimus  
Sirolimus dosage, when instituted (2 to 3 months postoperatively) will be based on AM 
trough levels of 8 to 12 ng/ml.  These levels will be obtained with each clinic visit (see

clinically warranted. Risks associated with the administration of sirolimus include

MMF  
Other than the experiences cited 40 above, no information to date is available on the 
combination of DHSC and Campath -1H given together with either tacrolimus, sirolimus, or 
MMF.  Thus, at this time the risk profile of the combination of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_873298].  
Potential risks may i nclude increases in the incidence or severity of adverse events currently 
experienced when these agents are administered, in addition to other adverse events that are 
unforeseeable at this time.  Also, as with any immunos uppressive regimen, this combination 
may result in increased susceptibility to infection and the development of lymphoma and 
other malignancies.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Risks   
The subject may experience some pain and bleeding at the site of the kidney transplant 
biopsy, discomfort, and/or blood in the urine following the biopsy. Additional risks of biopsy 
include bleeding in or around the kidney that can lead to a fall in blood pressure and rise in 
heart rate.  In the event that significant bleeding is suspected, either through clinical 
observation or a significant decrease in hemoglobin, a blood transfusion will be administered 
as necessary or the patient will be taken to the op erating room for direct control of bleeding.

administered intravenously (I.V.), followed by [CONTACT_60801] 0.3 mg/kg of  Campath -1H over 
2 hours, which will be completed about the time the clamps are released on the renal vascular 
anastomoses. At clamp release: 500 mg of methylprednisolone is administered. MMF (500

0.3 mg/kg.  A change in the Campath 1 -H dosage is allowed upon the Principi[INVESTIGATOR_873309]’s judgment to meet specific clinical needs of subjects.  This is preced ed by 500 
mg of hydrocortisone I.V., 50 mg Benadryl® and 6 50 mg (2 tabs) Tylenol® by [CONTACT_873372] (package insert).  Using this regimen,  a 
Campath -1H functional half -life of ~[ADDRESS_1219836] -operatively (assuming a normal rejec tion-free clinical course), tacrolimus 
will be withdrawn over 2 weeks, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_873310] 8 -15 ng/ml. (usually between 2 -5 mg/day), MMF 500 mg 
twice daily will be maintained as tolerated.  
Note:  None of these agents are considered investigational.  Although Campath -1H is used 
clinically in organ transplantation (over [ADDRESS_1219837] 
five years), it is not used routinely for this purpose, but has been i ndicated to date in the 
treatment of hematologic malignancies.  The decrease in dosing of Tacrolimus and MMF 
accompanying Campath -1H usage has been routine for those centers using Campath -1H in 
renal transplantation, as well as the absence of corticosteroi ds maintenance therapy (over 
1000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] with more than 1 year of follow -up).

with PBL for PCR -Flow analysis, the mar row will be purified by [CONTACT_941] C liniMACS® (CD34+ 
selection) 300i System.  From our previous experience in the Diabetes Research Institute at 
the Univer sity of Miami and in this NU/NMH stem cell processing unit in other protocols, 
approximately 1 -2 x 106 cells/kg body weight can be expe cted as an in fusion dosage with a 
CD34+ cell purity of ~75%, with ~0.5% T cell contamination. The cells will be cryo -
preserved, thawed, and ad ministered at the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873312] (as in previous studies).  
 
4.6.[ADDRESS_1219839], and Fourth Infusion  
The second infusion of donor per ipheral blood -mobilized stem cells, purified similarly, will 
be administered to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (as a patient in the CRU for <12 hours) 2 to 4 weeks after the 
initiation of Sirolimus therapy (between [ADDRESS_1219840] operatively), once sirolimus 
trough levels have reached 8 ng/ml.  
Donors as outpatients will undergo standard 10 -12 liter pheresis, at this time using peripheral 
access whenever possible. Donors will be admin istered G -CSF (filgrastim) subcutaneously 
for four consecutive days prior to pheresis with dose according to b ody weight (10 mcg/kg). 
A CD34+ cell assay of the product after CliniMACS® selection will be carried out.  The 
donors will then re ceive one more dose of G -CSF and undergo a second pheresis the 
following day, and CD34 selection performed. The plan is to ad minister at least 2x106 
cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873313], after pre medication with 
Benadryl® and hydrocortisone, but without additional Campath -1H treatment.

thawed and infused into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873314] 6 months and 9 months postoperatively, if 
clinically stable.  
 
4.7 Withdrawal of MMF/Myfortic  
One month after the fourth infusion (after 1 year posttransplant), participants will be 
evaluated for eligibility for MMF/Myfortic withdrawal.  To be eligible for withdrawal of 
MMF/Myfortic, participants must meet the following criteria:  
• Stable renal function, as defined by [CONTACT_873373] (GFR) > 50 mL/min/1.73 
m2. 
• Absence of biopsy -proven or clinically presumed acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_873315].  
• Absence of histologic evidence of acute or chronic rejection, as determined by [CONTACT_873374] (acute rejection/Banff Grade IA or high er) obtained within two weeks prior to 
commencing withdrawal.  
• Total lymphocyte count > 400/mm3. 
• Completion of all pre -withdrawal tolerance assay studies.  
For participants who meet the eligibility criteria MMF/Myfortic  will be withdrawn beginning 
no earlier than 1 year posttransplant .  MMF/Myfortic will be withdrawn in a stepwise fashion 
over a minimum withdrawal period of two months at an approximate rate of 50% of the pre -
withdrawal dose per month.  Clinic visits and frequency are described in the accompanying 
calendar and its footno tes. 
 
4.7.1  Monitoring During and After MMF/Myfortic Withdrawal  
For participants who are withdrawn from MMF/Myfortic, additional laboratory assessments 
(hematology and chemistries) will be obtained according to the following schedule:  
• At the beginning of  withdrawal; then  
• Weekly until MMF/Myfortic is completely withdrawn; then  
• Every other week for the first 6 weeks after complete withdrawal of MMF/Myfortic; then  
• Monthly thereafter.  
A protocol  biopsy will be obtained within 2 weeks prior to commencement of 
MMF/Myfortic withdrawal.  “For -cause” biopsies will also be obtained in the event of a 20% 
increase in serum creatinine that is unexplained and unresolved within 24 hours.  
MMF/Myf ortic withdrawal will be halted and/or immunosuppressive medications will be 
reinstituted if any biopsy reveals acute or chronic rejection, or (in the case of protocol 
biopsies not associated with clinical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities) the presence  of 
tubulitis.  If a protocol biopsy reveals normal histology or lymphocytic infiltration without 
tubulitis, withdrawal and/or continued absence of immunosuppressive medications will be 
permitted.  
4.[ADDRESS_1219842] -transplant, a second postoperative transplant biopsy will be performed 
(research) and  participants will be evaluated for eligibility for Sirolimus withdrawal.  To be 
eligible for withdrawal of Sirolimus, participants must meet the following criteria:  
• Stable renal function, as defined by [CONTACT_873373] (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 
m2 (24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance corrected for body surface area, 
microalbumin, and protein).

• Total lymphocyte count ≥ 400/mm3. 
• Completion of all pre -withdrawal tolerance assay studies.  
For participants who meet the eligibility criteria, Sirolimus will be withdrawn beginning no 
earlier than [ADDRESS_1219843] -transplant.  Sirolimus will be withdrawn in a stepwise fashion 
over a minimum withdrawal period of 6 months at an approximate rate of 1 5-20 % of the 
pre-withdrawal dose per month.  Clinic visits and frequency are described in the 
accompanying calendar and footnotes.   
 
4.8.1  Monitoring During and After Sirolimus Withdrawal  
For participants who are withdrawn from Sirolimus, additional laboratory assessments 
(hematology and chemistries) will be obtained according to the following schedule:  
• At the beginning of Sirolimus withdrawal; then  
• Every other w eek until Sirolimus is completely withdrawn; then  
• Every other week for the first 4 weeks after complete withdrawal of Sirolimus; then  
• Monthly for [ADDRESS_1219844] 10 years.  
Biopsies will be obtained within 2 weeks prior to commencement of Sirolimus withdrawal 
and at 12 months after completing withdrawal from Sirolimus.  “For -cause” biopsies  will 
also be obtained in the event of a 20% increase in serum creatinine that is unexplained and 
unresolved within 24 hours .  Sirolimus withdrawal will be halted and/or immunosuppressive 
medications will be reinstituted if any biopsy reveals acute or chronic rejection, or (in the 
case of biopsies not associated with clinical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities) the 
presence of  tubulitis.  If a biopsy reveals normal histology or lymp hocytic infiltration without 
tubulitis, withdrawal and/or continued absence of immunosuppressive medications will be 
permitted.  
Note:  It will be  the practice to follow renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873316] 150 mL  and yearly clinic visits (or more frequent if 
necessary) for the life of the transplant.

7.1 Protocol and For -cause Biopsies  
Protocol biopsies will be obtained 2 weeks prior to commencement of MMF withdrawal, 2 
weeks prior to Sirolimus withdrawal, and 1 , 2, and 5  years after Sirolimus withdrawal.  “For -
cause” biopsies will also be obtained in the event of a 20% increase in serum creatinine that 
is unexplained and unresolve fd within 24 hours.  Withdrawal will be halted and/or 
immunosuppressive medications will be reinstituted if any biopsy reveals acute or chronic 
rejection, or (in the case of protocol biopsies not associated with clinical symptoms or 
laboratory abnormalities ) the presence of tubulitis.  If a protocol biopsy reveals normal 
histology or lymphocytic infiltration without tubulitis, withdrawal and/or continued absence 
of immunosuppressive medications will be permitted.

7.3 Guidelines for Treating Neutropenia  
If a patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <700 cells/µL, the following guidelines are 
recommended:  
• Reduce the prophylactic dose of valganciclovir.  
• Stop administration of Septra SS and replace with inhaled pentamidine.  
If the participant’s ANC is <500 cells/µL, the following guidelines are recommended:  
• Consider discontinuation of valganciclovir.

7.[ADDRESS_1219854] Disease  
In the current Campath -1H induc tion protocol, by [CONTACT_873379] -
life of 12 days with effects felt up to one year, it is conceptually highly unlikely that in the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873324] -myeloablated environment that contaminating donor pos t-thymic T cells can do 
this.  Furthermore, it is perhaps more likely that a mixed (mutually tolerant) chimeric state 
could ensue if macrochimerism of >10% donor immu nohematologic cells would occur.  
GVHD would be especially unlikely under recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873325], 
essentially for 2 years after the second stem cell infusion.  Additionally, by [CONTACT_873380]34+ 
cells post -thymic, T cells in the inoculum are minimized.  
 
Nonetheless, as a safeguard, it is planned to store one unit of iliac crest recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873326] -1H is started, so that it can be re -infused 
any time during the long observation period in order to reverse GVHD if  needed.  In 
addition, our collaborator [CONTACT_873401], Director of Immunotherapy at Northwestern, will 
be following these patients and has diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in place that 
incorporate the following.

The clinical appearance of GVHD may be mimicked by [CONTACT_873382].  Therefore, 
documentation by [CONTACT_873383].  Liver biopsy can be helpful but often 
cannot be done because of clinical contraindications such as thrombocytopenia.  
 
7.4.2  Treatment of GVHD  
Grade I – II GVHD will be treated with Solumedrol (2 mg/kg) and Prograf.  In cases of 
moderate to severe GVHD, Zenapax and anti -TNF antibody (Remicade) will be utilized.

Biopsy -proven rejection: a renal biopsy demonstrates acute cellular or humoral rejection of 
Banff Grade IA or greater; or  
Presumed rejection: in the absence of biopsy -proven rejection, the participant is treated with 
augmentation of immunosuppression for an unexplained 20% increase in serum creatinine.     
Graft loss is defined as the institution of chronic dialysis (at least 6 consecutive weeks, 
excluding participants with delayed graft function), transplant nephrectomy, or 
retransplantation.  
 
For this study, severe acute rejection is defined as that which is histologically evaluated as 
Type IIA or greater utilizing the Banff criteria.  
 
Renal function will be evaluated through the measurement of serum creatinine monthly 
posttransplant.  
 
Adverse events to include infections and malignancies and participant information to include 
participant weight and resting blood pressure will be collected on study case report forms 
throughout the study. For purposes of this protocol, rejection, graft lo ss, and status of graft 
function will not be recorded on the adverse event case report form. These events will be 
collected on specialized case report forms.  
 
[ADDRESS_1219857] be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_873328].  This section provides definition of the types of adverse events an d outlines a process 
for the appropriate reporting and follow -up procedures.  Information in this section was 
obtained from the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (mentioned previously), ICH 
Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions  and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, and the Common Toxicity Criteria Manual Version 3.0 (August 9, 2006).  
 
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, 
symptom (including an abnormal laboratory finding), or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicin al product. 
Throughout the study -defined collection period , the Investigator must record all adverse 
events on the appropriate adverse event form, regardless of the severity or relationship to 
study medication or procedure. The Investigator should treat participants with adverse events 
appropriately and observe t hem at suitable intervals until the events resolve or stabilize.  
Adverse events may be discovered through:  
• Observation of the participant;  
• Questioning the participant;  
• Unsolicited complaint by [CONTACT_2299]; or  
• Discovery of abnormal clinical laboratory values or abnormal results of other evaluations 
(radiographs, ultrasound, ECG, etc.).  
In questioning the participant the questioning should be conducted in an objective manner.

normal or can be explained and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  Clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities as determined by [CONTACT_873384], as well as recorded on the appropriate laboratory evaluation form(s).  
As indicated in the Appendix I, AEs will be collected from the start of the study through 
Month 36 . AEs that are unresolved at the time that the participant completes this period of 
the study will be followed until they resolve or for a maximum of 30 days.  
 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is defined as any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. This 
includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events:  
• Death: A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the 
Investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of therapy, 
whether or not considered treatment -related, must be reported;  
• Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy experience that places the patient or participant, in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred;  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Other conditions as specified in the protocol;  
• An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. An 
important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
SAEs will be collected from the time informed consent is obtained, to [ADDRESS_1219859] be reported 
as a serious adverse event if it meets any of the above criteria.  
 
9.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered unexpected when the nature (specificity) or severity of the 
event is not consistent with applicable product information, such as safety information 
provided in the package insert, investigational plan, investigator’s brochure , protocol or 
informed consent document.

(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) for application in adverse event reporting.  The 
purpose of using the NCI -CTC system is to provide a standard language to describe 
toxicities, to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data, and to facilitate the assessment of 
the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTC provides the following  grades 
and descriptions in the NCI -CTC Manual (Version 3.0, dated 8/9/06).  Adverse events should 
be recorded and graded 1 to 5 according to the NCI -CTC grades provided below:  
Grade 1 = Mild adverse event.  
Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event.  
Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event.  
Grade 4 = Life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
Grade 5 = Death.  
Note: In contrast to the CTC guidelines provided in the NCI -CTC Manual (Version 3.0) all 
adverse events are to be reported and graded, whether or not related to disease progression or 
treatment.   
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1219861] is 
determined by [CONTACT_873385] -Investigator and recorded on the appropriate Case 
Report Form and/or SAE Reporting Form. The NCI -CTC provides the followin g descriptors 
and definitions (one category classified as unrelated [Code 1] and 4 categories classified as 
related [Codes 2 -5]) for assigning an attribution to each adverse event as described below:  
ATTRIBUTION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Code  Descriptor  Definition  
“Unrelated” Category Code (1 Category):  
1 Unrelated  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent(s)  
“Related” Category Codes (4 Categories):  
2 Unlikely  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent(s)  
3 Possible  The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s)  
4 Probable  The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s)  
5 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s)  
 
The Investigator’s determination of drug -relatedness (attribution) for each adverse event 
should be recorded in the source documentation.

Transplantation      9.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The following process for reporting a serious adverse event will ensure appropriate reporting 
compliance with the ICH guidelines.  
 
9.3.1  Serious Adverse Event Identification and Determination of Reporting Timeline  
When an Investigator identifies a serious adverse event (as defined above), the Investigator 
must notify the NU IRB and/or other  Reporting Centers (the NU CRU , FDA, DSMB , and 
NIDDK) of the serious adverse event within [ADDRESS_1219862] be entered on the Serious Adverse Event Form and the Adverse Event CRF.  
Three possible reporting scenarios (to the appropriate health authorities) could arise after 
assessment of the event:  
No requirement to report.  This would occur if the adverse event is deemed not serious by 
[CONTACT_653497].  
 
Standard reporting is required (report in IND annual report).  This would occur if the adverse 
event were classified as one of the following: (a) serious, expected and drug related; (b) 
serious, expected and not drug related; or (c) serious, unexpected and  not drug related.  
Expedited reporting is required.  This would occur if the adverse event is considered serious, 
unexpected and drug related.  These events must be reported by [CONTACT_873386] [ADDRESS_1219863] (DSMB) will be provided listings of all 
SAEs on an ongoing basis. Further, the DSMB will be informed of expedited SAEs at the 
same time as regulatory authorities.  
 
9.4 Pregnancy (SAE Reporting Requirements)  
Any pregnancy that occurs during a clinical study with an investigational drug must be 
reported as an SAE for tracking purposes only. All pregnancies that are identified during this 
study need to be followed to conclusion and the outcome reported. Female p articipants 
should immediately inform the Investigator of any pregnancies and should be instructed by 
[CONTACT_571658].  The Investigator should report all 
pregnancies within 24 hours (as described above in SAE Reporting) us ing the SAE form. The 
Investigator should counsel the participants and discuss the risks of continuing with the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the participants should 
continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy, and a fol low-up SAE Reporting Form should 
be submitted detailing the outcome.  
 
9.5 Updating Source Documentation  
Documents describing the safety profile of a drug, such as the investigator’s brochure, should 
be amended, as needed, to ensure that the description of safety information adequately 
reflects any new clinical findings. Until these documents are updated, exp edited reporting is 
required for additional occurrences of the reaction.

10 Tolerance Assay Studies  
A series of assays of chimerism analyses and tolerance mechanism are to be performed.  
10.1 Cytokyne  Gene Polymorphism (CGP) -PCR -Flow Measurements of DHSC 
Chimerism  
Hypothesis:  We propose that macrochimerism brought about by [CONTACT_873387], 
together with Campath -1H treatment for making “space” in recip ient central and peripheral 
immune com partments, will be a reflection of the development of donor -specific 
unres ponsiveness. Thus, after treatment with Campath -1H, these assays (and other 
measurements of DBMC chi merism) should demonstrate significantly higher levels of 
chimerism (macrochimerism) than in our pre vious DBMC protocols1,2,41, especially si nce 
CD34+ cells are not sensitive to Campath -1H lysis.  
 
Plan:  The CGP -PCR -Flow assays42,43 (using cytokine polymorphism) as well as VNTR 
assays of PBMC subsets will be used to sequen tially measure donor immuno hema topoiet ic 
cell chimerism in peripheral blood and iliac crest marrow, i.e., of donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240037]3+, 
CD4+, CD8+, CD34+, CD19+ , CD16/56+, and CD14+ cells, according to the following 
time-table:  
1. Intraoperatively (baseline control values), before Campath -1H administration, but after 
anesthesia induction in: (a)  donor peripheral blood and donor iliac crest marrow, and (b)  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873329].  
2. In (a) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873330] -operative days 4, 6 ([ADDRESS_1219864] -DBMC in fusion), 
21 and 28, then monthly for months 2 -12 and every six months thereafter, and (b) 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873331] [ADDRESS_1219865] to determine with the CGP -PCR flow assay whether or not the relatively 
more rapid return of certain recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873332], i.e., rela tively Campath -
1H resistant CD14+ and CD16/56+ cells, influences the pres ence of specific donor chi meric 
subsets, i.e., CD34+ cells or CD3+ cells, as they regenerate (compared with DBMC -infused 
recip ients tested in previous studies).  
 
Alternatively:  If there is no difference using CGP -PCR -Flow analysis between the DHSC -
infused Campath -1H group and patients in previous studies, there may well be a greater 
difference in the ratio of  CD34+ to CD3+ donor chimeric cells in the stem cell -infused 
group .1,[ADDRESS_1219866] for possible future protocol design and other 
mechanistic ex vivo  assays.  
 
Alternatively:  If significant macrochimerism (>10%, vide supra ) does not develop under 
Campath -1H treatment, the assays and clinical studies described in the succeeding sections 
may well show differences between this stem cell -infused group and those previously 
reported, so at to test whether immunosuppressive withdr awal is still be possible.

Ex vivo  immune assessment:  Such cells in the peripheral blood and (bone marrow)  at 6, (12),

Transplantation      Hypothesis :    Regulatory cells of donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873333] a result of 
chimerism in the DBMC -infused group of renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873334] s equentially as a 
means of assessing the effect of immuno suppressive with drawal.  We will use ELISPOT 
assays, flow cyto metric analysis, and the micro -CML that requires fewer cellular reactants.  
We will monitor the renal trans plant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s from the DBMC -infused groups for their anti -
donor immune status and T cell reg ulatory func tion.  Greater immunoregulatory activity is 
expected in the Campath -1H donor stem cell infu sion group than tested in previous DBMC -
infused patients.  Studies b y Heeger and colleagues have sug gested that IFN -
 or Granzyme -
B producing cells, as detected by [CONTACT_873388][INVESTIGATOR_840], pro vide an ex vivo  
reflection of the evolving in vivo  donor reactive immune response.44 The anti gen specific 
production of t hese cytokines in this short -term assay represents the fingerprint of a pre -
viously primed T cells of the CD45RO+ and CD45RA - memory phenotype, i.e., a putative 
escape from the regulatory or clonal deletion effects of the tolerance protocol.  However, 
production of IL -4, IL -10 and other TH2 cytokines may represent the presence of regulatory 
cells.  
 
10.2.1  ELISPOT  
Plan:  Ninety -six-well ELISPOT plates (Cellular Technology Ltd, Cleveland, OH) are coated 
with 100 
 l per well of capture anti bodies for IFN -
, Granzyme -B, IL -4 or IL -10 (BD 
Sciences) in PBS overnight at 4ºC.  The plates are then blocked with 150 
 l of PBS -1% BSA 
(Sigma) per well and washed three times with PBS.  Usually 300,000 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873335] 300,000 (donor) stimulator cells per well.  
Phytohemagglutinin is added to selected wells as a positive con trol. Fina l volume for all 
assays is 200 
 l per well.  Con trol wells contain responder cells or stim ulators plus medium 
alone.  After incubation at 37ºC for 24 hr, the plates are washed three times with PB S, then 
four times with PBS -Tween (0.025%).  Next, 100 
 l of biotinylated detection antibodies for 
IFN-
, Granzyme -B, IL -4 or IL -10 (BD Sciences) in PBS -Tween -1% BSA are added to the 
wells over night at 4ºC.  On the fol lowing day, the plates are washed three times with PBS -
Tween. Streptavidin -HRP (Phar Ming en) is plated at optimal dilution in PBS -Tween -BSA for 
90 min at room tem perature. The spots are developed using 800 
 l of 3 -amino -9-
ethylcarbazole (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835]; 10 mg/mL in N, N -dimethyl formamide) fresh ly diluted into 24 mL 
0.1M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), filtered through a 0.45 -mm filter and mixed with 12 
 l of 
H2O2 (200 
 l/well).  After the plates are dried, the result ing spots are counted on a computer -
assisted ImmunoSpot image analyzer in use in our lab oratories (Cellular Technology 
Ltd),that has 100% re producibility when repeatedly counting the same well using si ngle, 
defined criteria.  Results are pre sented as mean values of ELISPOT detected in tripli cate 
wells containing responder PBL plus mitogen or donor stimulator cells, after subtracting the 
response of wells with responder cells or donor cells alone (<15 spots per 300,000 cells in 
each case).

presence of “infectious tol erance”. The presence of this regulatory activity will be confirmed

responses will be indica tive of linked sup pression.  
 
For each of these assays, 40 ml of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873337] 20 ml of bone marrow are needed at 
each testing interval.  They will be performed at the time of the PCR -Flow assays when bone 
marrow is obtained (5 ml of marrow).

10.3 Donor Reactive Cells or Regulatory Cells in the Kidney Allograft  
Hypothesis :    Either donor reactive or regulatory cells may be sequestered in the allograft 
itself. Reg ulatory reactivity can be assessed with more frequency in the peripheral circulation 
(or bone mar row), using the approaches described above, and (less fre quen tly) in the 
allograft by [CONTACT_873389]. With the se quen tial (yearly) renal trans -
plant biopsies assessing the effect of im munosuppressive with drawal, it will be possible to 
assay this graft -associated l ymphoid compart ment for such reac tivity.  
 
Plan:   Protocol renal transplant biopsies will be taken at yearly intervals, i.e., before, during 
and after planned immunosuppressive therapy withdrawal.  In addition to histo pathological 
exam ination, a portion of the biopsies will be placed in culture in  medium contain ing 50  
U/ml rIL -2 and 50% MLR super natant. [ADDRESS_1219871] 1 week, and 
characterize them for donor vs. recip ient HLA  genomic DNA by [CONTACT_954] (or even by [CONTACT_873390] -Flow) at 48 hr, 72 hr, or 7 days after the initi ation of the biopsy culture.  If sufficient 
numbers of cells are available, their ability to kill donor cells or regulate killing in a modified 
micro -CML assay an d to produce Granzyme -B, IFN -
, IL-4 and IL -10 in the ELISPOT 
assay will be monitored.  
 
For PCR amplification and reverse probe hybridization of CGP profiles using the Inno -
genetic LIPA (Line Probe Assay), approximately 100 cells will be needed for the gen omic 
DNA extraction and purification. If a mixed genotype is resolved, a quan titation  analysis will 
be ac complished by [CONTACT_873391] (SSP) of mismatched donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353333].  
The re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_873339] a standard to ascertain the quantity (%) 
of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873340].  From as few as 10 00 of these cells, the profile of mes sen-

IFN-
 producing cells and/or a high ratio of donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873341], and the pres ence of IL -4 or IL -10 producing cells will be indicative of 
regulatory cells.  
 
Alternatively:    If no cells grow out (and no histopathology is present), this will be an even 
clearer sign of alloimmune non -reactivity.  
 
10.4 Absence of Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873342] -reactive Cytotoxic T cell Precursors and/or the 
Presence of Regulatory Cells in the Peripheral Circulation  
If the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873343] -specific un respon siveness in the ELISPOT and micro -
CML assays, limiting dilution analysis for the enumeration of CTLp will be performed. A 
precursor frequency of less than 10 donor reactive CTLp in 1x106 responder PBL will be 
taken as unresponsiveness.  Additionally, the shape of the limiting dilution analysis curve 
would also indicate the presence of regulatory cells in the responding PBL.  
 
10.5 Mixed Lymphocyte (Dendritic ) Cell Culture (ML (D)C), Treg MLR,  and In-vivo 
DTH Reactions  
These assays are to be performed on the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_873344].

processed and sent to our collaborators at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, [LOCATION_004] for 
genomic assays on biopsy material already obtained.  
 
The purpose of the additional genetic studies on paraffin embedded transplant biopsy 
samples is to obtain a biomarker that is indicative of kidney tolerance compared to kidney 
rejection in renal transplant patients.

13 Access to Source Data / Documents  
The investigational site participating in this study will maintain the highest degree of 
confidentiality permitted for the clinical and research information obtained from participants 
and donors participating in this clinical trial.  Medical and research r ecords should be 
maintained at each site in the strictest confidence.  However, as a part of the quality 
assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, the investigational site must permit 
authorized representatives of the sponsor(s) and regulat ory agencies to examine (and when 
required by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance 
reviews, audits and evaluation of the study safety and progress.  Unless required by [CONTACT_93261], only the coded identity associated with documents or other 
participant data may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (obscuring any personally identifying information).  
Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of 
medical and research inf ormation that may be linked to identified individuals.  The 
investigational site will normally be notified in advance of auditing visits.  
 
[ADDRESS_1219877] of the trial, for verifying 
adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency and accuracy of 
all documented data.  
 
To ensure the reliability of the data recorded in the database, double data entry will be used 
for all fields on the CRF.  The data will be verified by a series of computerized edit checks, 
and all relevant data queries will be resolved on an ongoing basis . When the CRFs are 
complete, they will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_737].  All data from the original 
signed CRF will be entered in the database, and a comparison program will be run again. All 
discrepancies will be reviewed, and any resulting qu eries will be resolved with the 
Investigator and amended on the database.  All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, 
verbatim text and the person performing the data entry) are recorded in an electronic audit 
trail to allow all data changes in the data base to be monitored and maintained in accordance 
with federal regulations.

15.1 Statement of Compliance  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP), adopting the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
Prior to study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_785788] 
(IRB).  Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must also be approved before 
they are implemented.  
 
15.2 Informed Consent  
The informed consent form is a means of providing information regarding the trial to a 
prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study.  
All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) must read, s ign and date a consent 
form prior to participation in the study, taking study drug and/or undergoing any study -
specific procedures.  If a participant does not speak and read English, the consent materials 
must be translated into a language understandable t o the subject.  
The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety 
information is available, whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new 
information becomes available that may affect a patients’ participation in the trial.  
A copy of the informed consent will be given to a prospective participant for review.  The 
Principal Investigator, Co -Principal Investigator, Sub -Investigator and/or research nurse, will 
review the consent and answer questions. The participant will be info rmed that their 
participation is voluntary and they may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to their ongoing care.

16.1.6  Isolation of CD34 -Positive HPC  
 
Growth factor mobilized (G -CSF) donor peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products will be 
collected by [CONTACT_16166].  Depending upon the success of the mobilization, a second PBPC collection may 
be required to obtain sufficient PBPCs to perform the CD34+ cell selection step to recover sufficient 
donor CD34+ target cells.  
 
CD34+ cell selection of the mobilized PBPC collection or iliac crest bone marrow will be performed on 
the Miltenyi Biotec CliniMACS selection device.  The CliniMACS device features an automated, 
computer -driven program utilizing a closed system (sterile pathway ) with a sterile, disposable plastic 
processing set and sterile buffer solutions for ease of cell processing.   The CliniMACS has been 
approved for clinical trials.  Approved materials and reagents that will be used with the CliniMACS 
device are indic ated in Table 1 below.  This cell enrichment method results in greater than 60% CD34+ 
cell recovery and approximately 80 -90% CD34+ cell purity with a > 3 log depletion of T -cells.  The 
PBPC products will be processed according to the Operator’s Manual for the CliniMACS selection 
device.  Refer to the standard operating procedure (SOP): CTL 2.[ADDRESS_1219890]/P Manufacturing: CD34 
Positive Cell Selection using Clini MACS.  The following steps will be performed to select the CD34+ 
cells and deplete the CD3+ cells:  
 
1. Donor PBPCs will be washed by [CONTACT_873398]  
 
2. PBPCs will be incubated with the CD34 monoclonal antibody/super -paramagnetic particle 
conjugate to label the CD34+ cells.  Labeled cells will be incubated for 20 minutes at room 
temperature on a rocking platform to facilitate labeling of cells  
 
3. Labeled cells will be washed twice by [CONTACT_68016] 10 -20 times labeling volume of phosphate 
buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% HSA and 2mM EDTA.  The mixture will be centrifuged 
at 300 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature using a COBE 2991 Cell Washer.  The supernatant 
will be removed and discarded  
 
4. Selection of CD34+ cells is accomplished by [CONTACT_873399]34+ cell/antibody/bead mixture 
in a magnetic field and, washing the unbound (by -pass cells) CD3+ cells, and other cellular 
elements, from the column containing the magnetically bound CD34+ cells.  
 
5. After the unbound CD3+ T-cells and other unwanted cells have been removed, the CD34+ cells 
will be released from the column by [CONTACT_873400].  
 
6. The resulting enriched CD34+ cell product should contain a minimum of 1 -2 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205074] < 5 x 104 CD3+ T-cells/kg for bone marrow selected products, and 
> 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205074] < 5 x 104 CD3+ T-cells/kg depending upon the 
unfractionated CD34+ cell content of the HPC -A product.  
 
7. After completion of the CD34+ cell selection step, the CD34+ enriched product will either be 
administered immediately following CD34+ cell analysis or it will be cryopreserved in 10%

 3 I. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with and 
without diabetes is well established (1-5). Extensive data from observational and prospective 
randomized  controlled  trials in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800746] d a strong association between 
hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcome s, such as mortality, morbidity, length of stay  (LOS) , 
infections and overall complications (1, 4, 6-8).  Most clinical trials in critically ill and general 
medicine and surgery patients have reported that improvement of glycemic control red uces LOS, risk 
of multi -organ failure and systemic infections (9-11), as well as short - and long -term mortality (6, 11) 
in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes .   
 
Clinical guidelines from professional organizations (12-14) recommend the use of 
subcutaneous (SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and 
surgical patients with  type 2 diabetes  (T2D).  Prospective, randomized multi -center trials have shown 
that basal bolus insulin regimens improve glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449523] (SSRI) (15-18).  In the Rabbit -2 medicine trial  
(18), patients with T2D were randomized to receive glargine once daily and glulisine before meals or 
SSRI four times daily.  Patients treated with basal bolus  had greater improvement in glucose control 
than SSRI  (18). The Rabbit Surgery trial compared the safety and efficacy of a basal bolus insulin  
regimen to SSRI in patients with T2D undergoing general surgery.  We observed a lower mean daily 
glucose concentration and a reduction in the frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800747] (17).  However, t he use of basal bolus approach is labor intensive , 
requiring multiple daily insulin injections (4 to 6), and h as a significant risk of hypoglycemia (17, 19) 
reported in up to 32% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D in non-ICU settings .   
 
Increasing evidence indicate s that the administration of native GLP -1 infusions and glucagon -
like peptide -1 receptor agonists (GLP -1 RA) are safe and effective for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800748] T2D.   The use of GLP -[ADDRESS_1105322] a beneficial cardiovascular profile , improving functional status and endothelial 
function (20), increas ing left ventricular function in patients w ith heart failure (21) and in CABG 
surgery patients (21, 22), and reduc ing infarct size and preserving left ventricular myocardial 
performance  in ischemic models  (23, 24).  The beneficial cardiac effects , low risk of hypoglycemia 
and the overall tolerability of the GLP -1 RA make them attractive considerations for use in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].    
 
Exenatide is a GLP -1 analogue ap proved for the treatment of T2D. It has been shown to lower 
blood glucose (BG) , stimulate e ndogenous insulin secretion , decrease plasma glucagon levels, inhibit 
gastric emptying, inhibit food intake, decrease body weight and improve beta -cell function (25, 26).  
Exenatide  increases insulin secretion in a glucose -dependent manner (i.e., only when plasma glucose 
levels are elevated), resulting in low -risk of hypoglycemia when use d as monotherapy. When 
compared to insulin glargine therapy, the use of GLP -1 has resulted in comparable reduction in HbA1c 
level, lower rates of hypoglycemia and less weight gain  (27).  No prospective randomized studies , 
however, have compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide  alone or in combination with basal 
insulin in non-ICU patients or afte r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
II. Specific Aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine whether in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289682], as measured by [CONTACT_800785], is different between 
treatment with  exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) alone , exenatide  in combination with basal insulin (glargine  
or detemir ),  and basal bolus regimen in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D. In this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], patients with T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), or with low -dose 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 4 insulin (total daily dose < 0.5 units/kg) will be randomized to receive exenatide  once daily (group 1), 
exenatide plus basal insulin (group 2), or basal bolus regimen  (group 3).  If needed, patients in all 
treatment groups will receive supplemental (cor rection) doses of rapid -acting insulin (lispro or aspart) 
before meals for BG > 140 mg/dl.   
Hypothesis: Treatment with exenatide  alone or in combination with basal insulin will result in a 
similar glycemic control and in a lower frequency of hypoglycemia than treatment with basal bolus in 
general non-ICU patients with T2D.   
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether treatment with exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) will result in similar 
glycemic control compared to treatment with basal insulin (glargine or detemir ) after ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_800749] T2D. Patients who participate in the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Aim 1) arm with an 
Hb1C> 7% will be followed  in the open label prospective outpatient study.  The total duration of this 
outpatient part  is 3 months.  Patients will be disc harged on their outpatient treatment  of OAD  plus 
exenatide  or basal insulin  once daily  depending on the randomization group during the admission part .  
Hypothesis: Treatment with exenatide  will result in a similar improvement in HbA1c levels and in 
lower number  of hypoglycemic events compared to  treatment with basal  insulin in patients with T2D 
after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] .  
 
III. BACKGROUND AND STATUS  OF WORK IN THE FIELD.  
 
A large body of evidence suggests that in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800750], the 
presence of hyperglycemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes (1-6, 28-31).  Evidence from 
obser vational studies indicates that development of hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk 
of complications and mortality, a longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], a higher admission rate to the ICU, and a higher 
likelihood that transitional or nursing home care aft er hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289685] (1, 2, 6, 32-
36).  Recent prospective, randomized multi -center trials have shown that basal bolus insulin regimens 
result in improved glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800751] (SSRI) in general medical and surgical patients with T2D (15-18).  In the Rabbit -2 
medicine trial, insulin naïve patients with T2D were randomize d to receive glargine once daily and 
glulisine before meals or SSRI four times daily.  Patients treated with glargine + glulisine had greater 
improvement in blood glucose control than SSRI (18).  The Rabbit Surgery trial compared the safety 
and efficacy of a basal bolus insulin regimen with glargin e once daily and glulisine before meals to 
SSRI in patients with T2D undergoing general surgery.  We observed a lower mean daily glucose 
concentration after the 1st day and a reduction in the frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800752] (17).  The use of basal bolus approach , however, is labor 
intensive , requiring multiple daily insulin injections (4 to 6), and has a signi ficant risk of hypoglycemia 
(17, 19), reported in up to 32% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D.   
 
Hospit al Use of native GLP -1 infusion .  Increasing evidence indicate s that the administration of 
native GLP -1 infusion  is safe and effective for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289691] T2D.   The use 
of GLP -1 has been shown to improve glycemic control and to hav e a beneficial cardiovascular profile 
improving functional status and endothelial function (20), increas ing left ventricular function in 
patients with heart fai lure (21) and in patients undergoing CABG  surgery  (21, 22), and to reduc ing 
infarct size and preserving left ventricular myocardial performance  in ischemic models  (23).  These 
potentially  beneficial cardiac effects and low risk of hypoglycemia of GLP -[ADDRESS_1105323] reported on the 
use of exenatide for the management of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients in the ICU. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_330621] -
randomized, uncontrolled, prospective, open -label study evalu ated the safety and efficacy of glucose 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 5 control with IV exenatide in cardiac ICU patients with admission glucose between 140 -400 mg/dL 
(37). A total of 40 patients (age 65 years, 83% male, 63% acute coronary syndromes, 75% T2DM) 
received an initial bolus of 0.05 µg/min fo r 30 min followed by a fixed infusion of 0.025  µg/min for 
24-48 hours.  Compared to historic controls treated with IV insulin with a target 90 -120 mg/dl (n=94) 
and 100 -140 mg/dl ( n= 39), the administration of IV exenatide resulted in similar glycemic contr ol and 
in a lower, but non -significant  difference in hypoglycemic events in the cardiac ICU setting.  The mean 
BG in the group treated with exenatide (139±41 mg/dl) was similar to those treated with IV insulin 
infusion with a target of 90 -120 mg/dl (115±36  mg/dl) and a target of 100 -140 mg/dl (147±52 mg/dl).  
Hypoglycemia BG <70 mg/dl was reported in 10% of patients treated with exenatide compare d to 21% 
and 15% in patients treated with insulin to a target BG of 90 -120 mg/dl and 100 -140 mg/dl, 
respectively (p=0.27).  A total of 8 patients (20%) experienced nausea due to exenatide and 6 patients 
(15%) requested early termination due to severe nausea.  
 
In one small open -label  study of 24 severely burned pediatric patients randomly assigned to 
receive exenatid e (n=6) or IV insulin infusion for glycemic management, similar levels of glycemic 
control were achieved in both groups (38). Daily average glucose was 130 ± 28 mg/dl in the exenatide 
group and 138 ± 25 mg/dl in the insulin group (p= 0.31); however, administered insulin was 
significantly lower in the exenatide group (22 ± 14 unit/patients/day vs. 76 ± 11 unit/patients/day in the 
insulin group (p= 0.01). The incidence rate of hypoglycemia was similar in both groups (0.38 
events/patient -month). The authors of this study report ed that exenatide was well tolerated and may 
offer an alternative to insulin therapy in pediatric patients in a critical care setting.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800753] -4 Inhibitors .  We recently completed ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) a randomized two -center 
open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_800754] 
T2D (39).  In this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 90 general medicine and surgery patients with a BG between 140 -400 
mg/dl treated with diet, oral antidiabetic drugs or low -dose insulin were randomized to sitagliptin once 
daily  (n=30), sitagliptin and basal insulin (n=30), or basal bolus in sulin (n=30).  All groups received 
correction doses of lispro before meals and bedtime for BG >140 mg/dl.   Patients in the sitagliptin 
group received a single daily dose of 50 -100 mg based on kidney function. The use of s itagliptin alone 
or in combination  with basal insulin was well tolerated and resulted i n no significant differences in  
daily BG, frequency of hypoglycemia or in the number of treatment failures compared to basal bolus 
regimen.   
 
Exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) is a human GLP -1 analogue approved for t he treatment of T2D. Exenatide  
has been shown to lower blood glucose, stimulate e ndogenous insulin secretion , decrease plasma 
glucagon levels, inhibit gastric emptying, inhibit food intake, decrease body weight and improve beta -
cell function when administe red subcutaneously (25).  Exenatide  increases insulin secretion in a 
glucose -dependent manner (i.e., only when plasma glucose levels are elevated), resulting in l ow-risk of 
hypoglycemia when use as monotherapy.   In addition, during hypoglycemia exenatide  does not impair 
glucagon action or the general counter -regulatory response, indicating a low risk of hypoglycemia  
(27). When compared to insulin glargine therapy, the use of GLP1 has resulted in comparable 
reduction in HbA1c level, lower rates of hypoglycemia and less weight gain  (27).  No  prospective 
studies however, have compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide  in general non -ICU setting s or 
after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Innovation and Rationale  
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_800755] , alone or in combination with basal insulin, in patients with T2D admitted to 
general medicine and surgery wards  will be randomized to basal bolus insulin regimen (standard o f 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 6 care) or to exenatide alone or in combination with low -dose basal insulin ( glargine  or detemir) .  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_800756] -ICU setting, this regimen 
requires frequent injections, BG testing, and is ass ociated with a risk of hypoglycemia (5% - 30%).  
Extensive preliminary data indicate s that the administration of GLP -[ADDRESS_1105324] a beneficial cardiovascular profile improving functional status and left 
ventricul ar function in patients with heart failure (21) and in surgery patients undergoing CABG  
surgery  (21, 22). These potentially beneficial effects and low risk of hypoglycemia of GLP -[ADDRESS_1105325] investi gated the use of GLP -1 
receptor agonists in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], but we anticipate that treatment with exenatide SC  alone or in 
combination with basal insulin  will result in similar improvement in glycemic control and in lower 
rates of hypoglycemic events  compared to the use of basal bolus insulin therapy in patients with 
uncontrolled  T2D.  If effective, the use of exenatide will facilitate care by [CONTACT_800786] r ates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800757].   
 
IV. PRELIMINARY RESULTS:  
 
We recently reported the results of 3 prospective, 
randomized multi -center trials comparing the efficacy 
and safety of basal/bolus insulin regimens to SSRI and 
split-mixed regimen with NPH/regular in T2D patients.   
 
In the Rabbit  medicine  trial (Fig 1), 130 nonsurgical 
insulin naïve patients were randomized to receive 
glargine once daily and glulisine before meals or SSRI 
before meals and at bedtime (16).  Patients treated with 
glargine/glulisine had greater improvement in BG 
control than SSRI with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia 
(3% of patien ts in ea ch group had a BG <60 mg/dL). A 
BG target of <140 mg/dL was achieved in 66% of 
patients treated with glargine/glulisine whereas only 
38% of those treated with SSRI achieved target 
glycaemia .   
 
In the Rabbit Surgery trial (17), we reported on the 
efficacy and safety of improving glycemic control with 
basal/bolus  insulin  compared to SSRI in general 
surgery  patients . The Rabbit Surgery trial included 211 
patients with T2D undergoing general surgery and 
compared differences in daily BG and  a composite of 
complications including wound infection, pneumonia, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], renal failure, and bacteremia. The 
basal bolus regimen resulted in significant redu ction s  in daily BG as well as in the frequency of the 
composite outcome  compared to SSRI  (8.6%, and 24.3% p= 0.003), Table 1.  
 
Sitag liptin Inpatient Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (39).  In a two -center open label randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we recently 
determined differences in glycemic control b etween sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal 
insulin and basal bolus regimen in medicine and surgery patients with T2D.   In this study, 90 patients

 7 with a BG between 140 -400 mg/dl treated with diet, 
OAD or low -dose insulin (≤ 0.4 U/kg/day) were 
randomized to sitagliptin once daily (n=30), sitagliptin 
and basal insulin (n=30) or to a basal bolus (n=30) 
regimen. Patients in the sitagliptin group receive d a 
daily dose of 100 mg or 50 mg as per renal function. 
Those in the sitagliptin plus glargine received 
sitagliptin and glargine starting at  0.25 U/kg once 
daily. Patients in the basal bolus group were started at 
0.5 U/kg, given half as glargine once dail y and half as 
lispro before meals.  All groups received correction 
doses of lispro before meals and bedtime for BG >140 
mg/dl.  We found that t reatment with sitagliptin alone 
or in combination with glargine resulted in similar glycemic control compared to basal bolus regimen 
(Figure 2). There were no differences in mean daily BG, number of BG readings within target, 
hypoglycemia, frequency of treatment failures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800759].  In addition, treatment 
with sitagliptin had less daily insulin r equirements and lower number of insulin injections, both, 
p<0.001.  
 
Transition of Care after Discharge.   In a recent ly 
published  study (40), we assessed the  efficacy of an 
HbA1c based algorithm for the management of patients 
with T2D (Fig. 3). Patients with an HbA1c <7% were 
discharged on their outpatient antidiabetic regimen.  
Patients with an HbA1c between 7% and 9% were 
discharged on a combination of OAD a nd basal insulin 
at 50% -80% of total daily hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124037]. Patients with an 
HbA1c ≥ 9% were discharged on a combination of OAD 
and basal insulin at 80 -100% of total daily hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800760] a basal bolus regimen. The overall admission 
HbA1c of 8.75% decrea sed to 7.9% and 7.35% after 4 
and 12 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (p<0.01). A total of 
29% of patients experienced ≥ 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_800761] (Table 2).  A 
higher frequency was observed in patients 
discharged on a combination of basal 
insul in and metformin (30%) and basal 
bolus regimen (44%).  The frequency of 
severe hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dl) was 
low (3%).  These data indicate that the 
admission HbA1c is beneficial in designing 
the discharge treatment algorithm for non-
ICU patients with T2 D. 
 
In summary , these  preliminary studies 
indicate that 1) treatment with basal bolus 
regimen results in better metabolic control 
and in a lower rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800762] I in patients with T2D, and 2) the 
use of a DPP -4 inhibito r alone or in combination with basal insulin may represent effective alternatives 
to a basal bolus insulin regimen for the management of h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D.

V. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN.  
 
Aim 1. To  determine whether  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289682], as m easured by [CONTACT_289735], is different between 
treatment with  exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) alone , exenatide  in combination with basal insulin 
(glargine  or detemir ), and basal bolus therapy  in general med icine and surgery patients 
with T2D.  
 
V.a. Rationale.  The result of several observational and interventional studies indicate that 
hyperglycemia is associated with poor hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289694], increase d 
rate of wound and syste mic infections, disability after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and death (1, 34).  Clinical 
guidelines from professio nal organizations (12-14) recommend the use of subcutaneous (S C) insulin as 
the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with T2D. The use 
of basal bolus , however, is labor intensive requiring multiple daily insulin injections, and has a risk of 
hypoglycemia (17, 19) reported in up to 32% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D.  Increasing evidence 
indicate s that the administration of G LP-1 and glucagon -like peptide -1 receptor agonists (GLP -1 RA) 
are safe and effective for the hosp ital management of patients with T2D  (27).  The use of GLP -[ADDRESS_1105326] a beneficial profile 
improving endothelial function (20), increas ing left ventricular function in patients with heart failure 
(21) and in CABG surgery patients (21, 22), and reduc ing infarct siz e and preserving left ventricular 
myocardial performance  in ischemic models  (23).  The potentially beneficial cardiac effects and low 
risk of hypoglycemia make them attractive for its use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].   Accordingly, this study 
will compare the efficacy and safety of exenatide  alone or in c ombination with basal insulin  to a basal 
bolus regimen on glycemic control in the inpatient setting and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
V.b. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
A total of 150 subjects with T2D treated with diet, OADs or with low -dose insulin (<0.5 unit/ kg/day) 
prior  to admission will be included in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], open -label trial to compare the efficacy of 
exenatide twice  daily (group 1) , exenatide plus basal  insulin (group 2), or basal bolus regimen (group 
3) in general medicine and surgery pati ents with T2D.  If needed, patients in both groups will receive 
supplemental (correction) doses of rapid -acting insulin (lispro, aspart) before meals for BG > 140 
mg/dl.   
 
The primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control as  measured by [CONTACT_800787] (average of all blood glucose values by [CONTACT_2929] -of-care and laboratory  testing ) 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (up to 10 days) between exenatide arms and basal bolus therapy.    
 
The s econdary outcome is to compare differen ces between groups in any of the following measures:  
Mean daily fasting and premeal glucose value up to 10 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Number of hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe hypoglycemic events (<40 mg/dl).  
Number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_105312] (BG  > 300 mg/dl) after the first day of treatment.  
1. Total daily dose of insulin.  
2. Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
3. Need for ICU care (transfer to ICU)  
4. Differences between groups on a composite of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800763], bacteremia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute renal 
failure, and wound infections  (surgery patients) .

6. Difference in gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  
 
V.c. Overall Design and Study Interventions  
 
 This open -label randomized clinical trial will include male or female subjects with known 
history of type 2 diabetes , age  18-80 years  admitted to general medicine and surgery (non -ICU) 
services .  Due to the design of this study (i.e. enrollment of subjects in need of acute care), there will 
be no run -in period.  Upon arrival to the Emergency Department or general medicine or surgery 
services, subjects will be screened for the study.  Patients with a known history of T2D treated with 
diet alone, with any combination of oral hypoglycemic agents prior to admission, or low -dose insulin 
with total daily dose <0.5 units/kg  will be considered potential candidates in this study .  The primary 
care physician will be approach asking for authorization to approach the study candidate.  Then, a 
research coordinator and/or investigator will present the study details, review consent form, and 
discuss benefits and risk with participation in the study.  When the patient has agreed to participate in 
the study, the research pharmacy will be notified and will proceed with randomization.  A research 
pharmacist at each institution will follow  a computer -generated block randomization table based on 
glucose lev els (BG ≤200 or BG >200). The goal of therapy is to maintain fasting and pre -meal BG 
between 80 and <180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia.  Diabetic patients will be r andomized 
consecutively to receive:  
 
 Group 1.  Exenatide twice daily* (n=5 0).

Aim 2. To determine whether treatment with exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) will result in a similar 
glycemic control and in a lower rate of hypoglycemic even ts compared to treatment with Basal 
(glargine or detemir ) in patients with T2D after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
VI.a. Rationale.    Our preliminary stud ies indicate that the use of basal insulin alone or in 
combination with OADs  are effective in improving glycem ic control  after discharge with an HbA1c 
reduction ~1.5% in general medicine and surgery patients.   We observed; however, a high rate of 
hypoglycemia (29%) during the following 12 weeks after discharge, with a higher frequency observed 
in patients dischar ged on the combination of basal insulin and metformin (30%) and basal bolus 
regimen (44%).  Exenatide  has a unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that makes it 
an attractive agent for the treatment of inpatients with T2D  including its rapid -onset of action in 
improving glycemic control  without weight gain and its  low risk of hypoglycemia.  Based on the 
proven efficacy of exenatide  in improving glycemic control, we believe that exenatide  represent s an 
excellent alternative to insulin therapy aft er discharge in subjects with T2D.    
 
Study Outcomes:  
 
The primary outcome  of the study is to determine differences in HbA1c concentration  at 12 weeks 
from discharge between exenatide  and basal insulin  therapy .    
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 13  
The s econdary outcome  is to compare diff erences between treatment groups in any of the following 
measures  during the 12 weeks following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800764] T2D:  
1. Fasting and mean daily BG concentration  
2. Incidence rate and n umber of h ypoglycemic events (<70 mg/d l) and severe h ypoglycemic 
events (<40 mg/dl).  
3.  Percent of patients with  12 week  HbA1c <7.0% and no weight gain  
4.  Percent of patients with 12 week HbA1c <7.0% and no hypoglycemia  
5. Change in body weight and BMI  
6. Cardiovascular risk factors including changes i n blood pressure  and heart rate  
7. Total daily dose of insulin  
8. Incidence rate and n umber of emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394]  
9. Acute renal failure during the 12 week follow -up defined as a clinical diagnosis with 
documented new -onset abnormal ren al function (an increment > 0.5 mg/dL from baseline)  
10. Number of gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea  
 
VI.b. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

IX. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES   
 
IX.a.  Admission Laboratory St udies   
Standard of care laboratory studies including glucose, HbA1C, chemistry, hematology, and urine will 
be measured on admission and as determined by [CONTACT_1963].   
IX.b. Treatment of Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL)  
Hypoglycemia, defined,  as a bl ood glucose level < 70 mg/dL will be treated following standard 
hypoglycemia protocols available at all institution.  
IX.c.    Assessment and Monitoring of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800775] .  Information on the attending physician’s summary of events surrounding subject’s 
demise will also be documented.    
IX.d. Assessment and Monitoring of Nosocomial Infections  
Nosocomial infections will be diagnosed base d on standardized CDC criteria (42).  New nosocomial 
infections will not be diagnosed until 48 hrs. After study initiation to minimize the chance that the 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 23 infection was actually present (but undiagnosed) prior to study initiation.   
The investigators will review each subject’s records regarding potential new infection diagnosis daily 
on each weekday from Monday to Friday. Data from the weekends will be collected on the following 
Monday.  The coded infection diagnosis and the presumed c ausative microorganism will be 
determined daily on a Monday to Friday basis, with weekend data entered on the following Monday by 
[CONTACT_289743].   
 
X. Statistical Analysis   
AIM 1.   This study is a three-arm randomized multicenter, open -label controlled trial. The overall 
hypothesis is that treatment with exenatide  alone or in combination with basal insulin  will result in a 
similar improvement in inpatient glycemic control and in a lower frequency of hypoglycemic events 
than treatment with basal bolus ins ulin regimen  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D .   
X.a.   Sample Size and Power Calculations:  
Sample size calculation is based on the plan to use average mean daily BG concentration as the 
primary measure for glycemic control. To show the non -inferiority o f exenatide alone or in 
combination with basal insulin compared to basal bolus insulin regimen in terms of glycemic control, 
we set the equivalence margin as 20 mg/dl, from a view that a BG difference less than 20 mg/dl is 
usually not considered as clinica lly significant (15, 17, 18). Based on the prelim inary data from Rabbit 
studies, it is reasonable to assume the standard deviation of mean daily BG is bounded above by 45 
mg/dl. Assuming the true BG difference between the treatment groups is zero, and using a one -sided, 
two-sample t -tests, we require 81 subjects for each treatment group to achieve 80% power. Accounting 
for 10% attrition rate, we would need 90 patients per treatment group, which means 270 subjects in 
total, to achieve >80% power in Aim 1.   
X.b. Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary en dpoint for Aim [ADDRESS_1105333] perform cross -sectional analyses using nonpar ametric Krusta l-Wallis tests (or 
Wilcoxon tests) or one -way ANOVA, followed by [CONTACT_800792]. A mixed effect  model may be used to further account center effect or 
other potential confounders for the BG outcome. Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection 
strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard 
diagnostic  and model checking procedures will be applied to examine the fit of the developed models.  
X.c. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
Secondary endpoints for Aim 1 in this study include incidence  of hypoglycemia, number of 
hypoglycemi c events, number  of severe h yperglycemia,  mean daily fasting BG, daily insulin dose,  
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], acute renal failure and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]. Blood glucose will be measured 
before each meal and at bedtime.  For discrete  outcomes  (such as hypoglycemia outcomes) , if the 
outcome is binary (e .g. with or without hypoglycemia), we will first conduct nonparametric 
comparisons based on a two -sided Chi -square test (or Fisher’s exact test in the presence of low 
incidence rates), followed by [CONTACT_25549] -Mantel -Haenszel test, which ad justs for the potential center 
effect. If the discrete outcome is a count outcome (such as the number of hypoglycemic event), we will 
perform univariate Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial regression) to assess the difference in the 
count outcome amon g the three treatment groups . We will further conduct multivariate Logistic 
regression, Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial regression) to account for the effects of relevant 
covariates on the discrete outcomes.  Stepwise, backward, or forward model se lection strategy will be 
adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 [ADDRESS_1105334], will be applied to 
examine the fit of the developed m odels. For continuous outcomes that are not repeated measures 
(such as length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]), we will use two -sample t -tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests to 
compare them between groups. Transformations will be applied if normality violation is detect ed.  
Multivariate linear regression will be further conducted to assess the difference in continuous 
secondary outcomes between the two groups while other relevant covariates. We will use standard 
model selection and model checking procedures for linear re gression to decide the final models and 
assess their fits to the data.  
 
Aim 2: To determine whether treatment with exenatide  (By[CONTACT_28557] ®) will result in lower number of 
hypoglycemi a and similar glycemic control  compared to treatment with  basal insulin  [glargi ne or 
detemir ) after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800776] T2D.  
X.d. Sample Size and Power Calculations:  
The primary endpoint in Aim 2 is difference in the frequency of hypoglycemic events after discharge 
between treatment groups. Based on the results from  the Basal Plus study (reference 40), we anticipate 
about 30% subjects in the Glargine +/ - OAD group would experience hypoglycemic events after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Treatment with GLP1 -RA including exenatide as monotherapy is not associated 
with hypoglycemi a.  We estimate that the rate of hypoglycemia in the exenatide group after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800777] 10% if we avoid the use of sulfonylurea/insulin secretagogues agents 
(21,38) . Given the sample size targeted by [CONTACT_177612][INVESTIGATOR_799], 150, accountin g for 10% attrition rate, we 
would have 67 subjects per group for Aim 2.  Based on two -sided Fisher’s Exact test with alpha=0.05, 
we would have 79%, 92% and 97% power to detect the group difference in the occurrence rate of 
hyperglycemia events, when the e vent rate in exenatide group is assumed to be 10%, 7% and 5%.  
 
X.e. Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint in this study is the rate of hypoglycemia after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800778] [ADDRESS_1105335] compare the primary outcome using two -sample t -tests (or 
Wilcoxon tests) or one -way ANOVA, followed by [CONTACT_800793]. Transformations will be applied if normality violation is detected . Stepwise, backward, or 
forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final 
model. Standard diagn ostic and model checking procedures will be applied to examine the fit of the 
developed models.  
 
XI. Potential Risks to the Subject:  
Hypoglycemia.     It is possible that following the proposed protocol, patients receiving basal insulin or 
exenatide in comb ination to OAD will develop hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL). We expect that 
approximately 20%  to 40%  of subjects t reated with basal insulin  will experience one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_800779] -up.  The frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D treated with 
exenatide  is expected to be < 10% .   
The number of reports of hypoglycemia will be analyzed statistically.  For the purpose of this 
analysis, hypoglycemia is defined as a capi[INVESTIGATOR_124054]/or laboratory BG < 70 mg/dL.  Severe 
hypoglycemia is d efined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia in which the subject 
required the assistance of another person and blood glucose less than 40 mg/dL.  
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 [ADDRESS_1105336] been few reported events of acute pancreatitis. Subjects should be informed of the 
characteristic symptoms of acute  pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, exenatide  and other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued. If the 
investigator suspects acute pancreatitis, all suspected drugs should be discontinued u ntil confirmatory 
test have been conducted and appropriate treatment should be initiated. Subjects diagnosed with acute 
pancreatitis (as a minimum 2 of 3: characteristic abdominal pain, amylase and/or lipase >3x  UNR or 
characteristic findings on CT scan/ M RI should be withdrawn from the study.  
XII. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicina l) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investig ational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:  
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the 
AE.  
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means ther e is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regardi ng 
the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
XII.a. Serious  Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE  
below)  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical a nd scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g. medical, surgical] to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, 
but are not limited to, intensive treatme nt in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 26 induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event. (See Section 1.6 for the 
definit ion of potential DILI.)  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g. pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is 
an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not always 
serious by [CONTACT_169687] y definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 1.4 for reporting 
pregnancies).  
NOTE :  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
 elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/t rending of health status (e.g., routine 
colonoscopy)  
 medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
 admission encountered for another life circumsta nce that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
XII.b. Serious  Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
The collection of AEs will start after the signing of the informed consent.  A ll SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected t hat occur during the screening period and within 30 
days of discontinuation of dosing. The investigator should report any SAE that  occurs after these time 
period  and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.   
An SAE rep ort should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or  a complication of a study procedure ), 
the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours. SAEs mus t be recorded on an SAE Report Form or similar form (e.g. CIOMS, 
MedWatch); pregnancies on a BMS Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Reports are to be transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:  
SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_661]  
SAE Facsimile Number: [PHONE_3354]  
If only limited  information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE 
reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion becomes 
available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or designee) u sing the 
same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.   
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 27 All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
XII.c. Nonserious  Adve rse Events  
A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious AE 
information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period or  other observational 
period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become 
serious (see Section 1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious  AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. All 
identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the CRF.  
Completion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are 
reported/identified during the course of the study.  
XII.d. Laboratory  Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page 
or SAE Report Form as appropriate:  
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
 Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued or 
interrupted  
 Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (e.g., anemia versus low hemogl obin value).  
XII.e. Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject 
is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including during 
at least [ADDRESS_1105337] will be permanently 
discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).  
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be  performed on the subject 
unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up 
procedures should be considered if indicated.  
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event and 
complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1105338] be r eported as an 
SAE (see Section  1.1.1 for reporting details.).  
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 28 XII.g. Potential  Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should occur 
prior to the reporting of a potential DILI  event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section  1.1.1 for reporting details).  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  AND   
Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1105339], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),  AND  
No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, 
but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of 
other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
XII.h. Other  Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiogram, x -ray 
filming, any  other potential safety assessment required or not required by [CONTACT_35869] a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.  
XIII. Protection against Risks:   
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our  subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 
response to medical treatment every [ADDRESS_1105340] and every 3 months during clinic 
visits , b) women of reproductive age who are sexually active will undergo a urine pregnancy tests prior 
to participati on in the study , c) patients with significant comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease 
greater than stage III, cirrhosis, gastroparesis, and pancreatic disease will be excluded from the study.  
Hypoglycemia:  We expect that approximately 20%  to 30%  of subjects treated with basal insulin will 
experience one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_289712] 10 % of exenatide treated  patients will 
experience hypoglycemia  during follow -up.  Patients will receive diabetes education prior to discharge 
and will be  instructed on hypoglycemia sign/symptoms and treatment.  Patients will be asked to call 
the diabetes center and/or PCP in the event of hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the 
dose of OAD will be reduced and the daily dose of insulin will be reduced by 10% to 30% .     
Gastrointestinal side effects  including nausea and vomiting may be expected, more commonly in 
patients treated with exenatide.  If necessary, patients may receive treatment of nausea and vomiting 
with anti -emetics .  In subjects wi th suspected acute pancreatitis exenatide and other potentially suspect 
medicinal products should be discontinued until confirmatory tests have been conducted and appropriate 
treatment initiated.  
 
XIII.a. Treatment of Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL)  
Hypoglyce mia, defined as a BG < 70 mg/dL will be treated following standard hypoglycemia 
protocols available at both institutions.   
 
Patients with hypoglycemia will be treated as per protocol:  
For BG < 70  mg/dL, follow hypoglycemic orders below:  
 If patient is ale rt and can tolerate oral intake, give [ADDRESS_1105341] -acting carbohydrate (6 oz. 
fruit juice or regular soda, crackers).  
 If patient is not alert and cannot tolerate oral intake, give1ampule (50 mL) of D 50. 
 Check finger stick BG q 15 minutes and repeat abo ve treatment until BG > 100 mg/dL.  
 Once BG > 100 mg/dL, repeat finger stick BG 1 hour later and treat as follows:  
 If BG < 70 mg/dL, call MD and follow y hypoglycemia orders (above)  
 If BG 70 – 100 mg/dL, give snack/scheduled meal and check BG q1 h until BG >100 mg/dl  
 If BG > 100, no further treatment needed.  
 
Exenatide Inpatient Trial ( 10.04. 2017 ) 
 
 [ADDRESS_1105342]:  
We believe that all subjects will benefit greatly from this study.  Improved  glycemic control 
may significantly reduce complications after discharge and reduce th e risk of hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia.   
 
 
 
 
XV. Potential Benefits to Society:  
This study will provide important information on the benefits of exenatide and insulin therapy 
after discharge for the  management of patients with type 2 diabetes.  We will determine whether 
glycemic control is different among insulin and exenatide  therapy  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . 
 
XVI. Risk/Benefit Assessment:  
Insulin therapy is the mainstay of diabetes management in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284716].   
There are no prosp ective, randomized studies to assess the efficacy and safety of exenatide  for the 
management of diabetes  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . This study will test the efficacy of exenatide versus 
insulin therapy in combination to oral antidiabetic agents after hospit al discharge in medicine and 
surgery patients with type 2 diabetes.    
 
 
 
 
XVII. Therapeutic Alternatives:   
Patients can be treated with other insulin formulations (regular insulin, NPH, glargine, lispro, 
aspart or glulisine ) and oral agents (glyburide, g lipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 analogs)  currently 
available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.   
 
XVIII. Inclusion of women.  
We anticipate that ~50% of the study subjects will be female.  No patients under the age of [ADDRESS_1105343] be demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_124097] (in female subjects of childbearing  potential only).    
 
XIX. Inclusion of minorities.  
Patients will not be excluded based on race or ethnic origin.  We anticipate that half of patients 
will be African Americans, 10% Hispanics, and the rest Caucasians.   
 
XX. Inclusion of children . 
No patients under the age of [ADDRESS_1105344].   
Every potential participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the important and key points 
of the study.   One of the investigators or research coordinators will obtain a witness ed informed 
consent prior to inclusion of a patient into the study.  Data collection records with personal identifiers 
will be stored in locked file cabinets.    Presentation of the study results at regional or scientific 
meetings or in publications will n ot identify subjects.  Access to research and confidential records will 
be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, and the IRB at Emory University.

The numbers in each column indicate the number of units of lispr o or aspart insulin per dose.  
“Supplemental” dose is to be added to the scheduled dose of lispro  or aspart insulin.  If a patient is able 
and expected to eat all or most of his/her meals, supplemental insulin will be administered before each 
meal followin g the “usual” column dose .  
If a patient is not able to eat (NPO), supplemental insulin will be administered every 6 hours (6 -12-6-
12) following the “sensitive” column dose.  Example, a patient kept NPO with blood glucose of 180 
mg/dl will receive 2 U of s upplemental insulin.

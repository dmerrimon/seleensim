BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581866] common autoimmune cytopenia in children, and causes an often 
severely reduced platelet count, variable bleeding symptoms, and health -related 
quality of life (HRQoL) reductions due to factors such as activity restrictions, frequent 
medical visits and interventions, and fatigue.1-[ADDRESS_581867] 
(TPO -RA). The drug initiates thrombopoietin -receptor signaling by [CONTACT_455148], thereby [CONTACT_455149].  Eltrombopag is a drug that has 
the potential to change the landscape of newly diagnosed ITP for both children and 
adults. While there are myriad drugs avail able to choose amongst for treatment of 
chronic ITP, including immunosuppressants and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, 
the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP is generally limited to three first -line 
medications: corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG), and anti -D globulin.  
Each of these agents has either undesirable side effects, undesirable logistics of 
administration, or both. Additionally, each of these agents acts only transiently to 
raise the platelet count, and in children with continued ac tive ITP, the platelet count 
will decrease days to weeks after the medication is given. As a once daily, non -
immunosuppressant, oral agent, eltrombopag offers the possibility of a sustained 
platelet response over weeks to months with continued use . This co uld result in 
improved HRQoL and reduction in fatigue, as well as other benefits.5 
 
Eltrombopag is an established therapy for pediatric patients with chronic ITP. Safety 
and efficacy were established in the PETIT6 and PETIT27 trials, and the drug was FDA -
approved for children with chronic ITP in 2015.  
 
Off-label use for adults with newly diagnosed ITP has been described in two small 
single -center trials. A single -arm study of dexamethasone in combination with 4 
weeks of eltrombopag used upfront in adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP 
produced 100% response (platelets >30 x 109/L) at completion of therapy, and 66.7% 
relapse -free survival at 1 year, better outcome s than expected for comparable 
patients treated with steroids alone.8 In a second study, 76% of steroid -
nonresponsive patients had a durable response to eltrombopag after 3 months of 
therapy.9 Based on data from ICON2, pediatric hematologists are already using TPO -
RAs in some cases of newly diagnosed ITP. Of 79 patients described in the ICON2 
retrospective review who were prescribed a TPO -RA, 18% had newly diagnosed ITP.[ADDRESS_581868] -line therapy for newly diagnosed ITP patients 
who require treatment.

ITP11, other biologic factors that predispose some patients to resolution of their ITP 
and others to a more chronic course are not known. It is also not known whether the 
develop ment of chronic ITP could be prevented by [CONTACT_455150]’s course. A subset of patients with chronic ITP has been reported to have 
resolution of their disease after treatment with TPO -RAs, which was sustained after 
discontinuation of t he medication. One postulated mechanism is immune tolerance 
by [CONTACT_455151], a hypothesis supported by [CONTACT_455152] -platelet antibody in one patient who resolved.12 Another 
proposed mechanism is the increase in Treg functionality due to increased TGF -[ADDRESS_581870] persistent or chronic disease.  Additionally, there are likely other 
biological factors which influence response to TPO -RA and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_455118]. Identification of these biomarkers coul d lead to a more 
personalized approach to therapy, targeted to an individual patient’s disease biology.

3 of 4 platelet measurements  with platelets >50 x109/L at Weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12  of 
therapy, without rescue)  is a measurable outcome  clinically equivalent to the

 doses to achieve  the same exposure. Pediatric dosing is now established, and there is 
an FDA label for use in pediatric patients > 1 year of age with chronic ITP. This study 
will use manufacturer label dosing for drug initiation. Dose adjustment after a 
platelet response is modified from the label based on abundant clinical experience 
with rebound thrombocytopenia when eltrombopag is held in this setting. Details for 
dose reduction are outlined after a sustained response after week 12 is prescribed, 
given reports15 of adult patients with sustained responses after discontinuation in the 
setting of “persistent response despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a reduction in dose over time.” As we expect 
the majority of newly diagnosed patients to have resolu tion of ITP within 1 year, we 
outline standardized discontinuation of drug even in the absence of thrombocytosis.  
 
2.3 Safety Considerations  
Two pediatric trials (PETIT6 and PETIT27) investigated the use of eltrombopag in 
pediatric patients aged 1 -17 years with persistent or chronic ITP. The PETIT trial 
established dosing in an open -label dose -finding phase and then randomly assigned 
patients to receive eltrombopag vs placebo. 62% of patients receiving eltrombopag 
vs. 32% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.011) achieved the primary endpoint of 
platelet count ≥50 x109/L at least once in the first 6 weeks of the study without 
rescue. In PETIT2, 40% of patients receiving eltrombopag vs. 3% of patients receiving 
placebo had a sustained platelet response, wi th primary outcome of platelet count 
≥50 x109/L during 6 of 8 of weeks 5 -12 of the study.  
 
Hepatobiliary events: Mild reversible elevations of alanine aminotransferase ≥3x ULN 
occurred in fewer than 10% of pediatric patients and were not associated with 
clinically significant symptoms. However, 3% of patients in the two studies were 
unable to continue eltrombopag.  
 
Marrow fibrosis: There were no findings of bone marrow fibrosis in either pediatric 
trial.14  
 
Thromboembolic events: There were no thromboembolic events in either pediatric 
trial.  
 
Cataracts: In an adult randomized controlled trial (RAISE), there was no difference in 
cataract development between the eltrombopag group and the placebo group. In 
two open label studies (REPEAT and EXTEND), there was a comparable frequency of 
cataract incidence or progression.[ADDRESS_581873] event (one development of a new cataract, and one progression of a pre -
existing cataract).[ADDRESS_581874] is not higher than basel ine during eltrombopag 
treatment.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, open label, randomized, two -arm, multi -center Phase 3 trial.  
Patients with newly diagnosed ITP are randomized 2:1 to receive the experimental 
treatment, eltrombopag, or investigator’s choice of [ADDRESS_581883] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Randomization at study enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_455155], using a block size of 3. 
 
a) Age at enrollment  
b) Whether  the patient has received a first -line treatment (as defined in inclusion 
criteria):  
o 1) Upfront treatment : Patients within [ADDRESS_581884] 
not received previous treatment  
OR 
o 2) Treatment failure : Patients who have failed standard management 
(observation or treatment with one or more first -line standard agents)

Patients randomized to the eltrombopag arm will be eligible to continue the 
treatment throughout the 1 -year duration of study participation, with guidelines 
given for dose adjustments.  
 
A total of up to 162  patients will be enrolled. The required sample size is 147 
“informative” patients  (as defined below) , with 104 (estimated 98 informativ e) in the 
experimental treatment arm and 52 (estimated 49 informative)  in the standard 
treatment arm. A conservatively high estimate of  9% of patients are anticipated to 
withdraw from the study prior to the 5 -week platelet assessment ; these patients will 
be classified as non -resp onders, and will make a non -informative contribution to the 
analysis response rate for the primary objective. Therefore, to obtain at least 147 
informative randomized patients , we plan to enroll and randomize up to an 
additional 15 patients ( [ADDRESS_581885] treatment arms, 
respectively) for a total of 1 62.  
 
 
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is binary, with each patient classified as either a platelet responder 
or a platelet non -responder.  Platelet respon ders  are defined as  patients with  ≥3 of 4 
platelet measurements  >50 x109/L between Weeks 6-12. All platel et counts will be 
reported, and the four measurements closest in time to  Weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12  will be 
selecte d for the determination of the primary endpoint.  Within a sliding one -week 
window, only one mea surement can be selected .

 Other medications besides prednisone, IVIg, and anti -D thought to be 
active in the treatment of ITP  
 
The use of these medications/procedures after week 12 for patients not currently 
taking eltrombopag (patients in the standard treatment arm, or patients in the 
eltrombopag arm who are non -responders and have been taken off 
investigational  drug)  is at the discretion of the treating physician, but must be 
reported on appropriate CRFs.  
 
7.2.2 Other non -platelet -enhancing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (other than those described in   
          section  7.1.2) are not allowed in weeks 1 -12 and would be a protocol  
          violation if used:  
 Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP)  
 Recombinant Factor VIIa  
 Platelet transfusion  
 
7.2.3 Patients taking anti -platelet agents (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NSAIDs, or  
   clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) or anticoagulants (including heparin, warfarin, or direct  oral 
   anticoagulants) are prohibited from enrolling, and these medications are  
   not allowed during the study.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_581898] be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of the study treatment. Site study personnel should verify 
that there are no interactions with protocol therapy, as described in this section  of 
the protocol. If an adjustment in eltrombopag dose is required due to a concomitant 
medication, that should be noted on the eltrombopag dosing CRF.  
 
Any medications  administered during the study  given for the purpose of treating or 
preventing bleeding (such as hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_455119]), or that 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024

 are prohibited due to antiplatelet or antithrombotic effects (such as NSAIDs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
or anticoagulants), or that are thought to have effect in ITP must be listed on the 
Concomitant Medicati ons eCRF.  
 
HMG -CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins)  
Patients will be permitted to use HMG -CoA reductase (3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl -
CoA) inhibitors during the study, but these drugs should be used with caution and a 
50% dose reduction of the HMG -CoA reduct ase inhibitor is recommended, with close 
monitoring for safety, such as liver chemistry and signs and symptoms of myolysis, 
and efficacy, such as cholesterol and triglycerides (refer to individual product 
information for monitoring recommendations).  
 
Poly valent Cations (Chelation)  
Eltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as aluminum, calcium, iron, 
magnesium, selenium and zinc. Eltrombopag should be taken at least two hours 
before or four hours after any products such as antacids, dairy products, or mineral 
supplements containing polyvalent cations to avoid significant reduction in 
eltrombopag absorption.  
 
Food Interaction  
The administration of a single [ADDRESS_581899] that included dairy p roducts led to reduced eltrombopag 
exposure . Foods low in calcium (defined as <50 mg calcium per serving) including 
fruit, lean ham, beef and unfortified (no added calcium, magnesium, iron) fruit juice, 
unfortified soy milk, and unfortified grain did not s ignificantly impact plasma 
eltrombopag exposure, regardless of calorie and fat content. To avoid significant 
reduction in eltrombopag absorption, eltrombopag should be taken at least two 
hours before or four hours after food containing > [ADDRESS_581900] one 
hour before to two hours after food containing little (< 50 mg) (or preferably no) 
calcium.  
 
Patients must abstain from using investigational or not marketed drugs without a 
well-known safety profile and from using prohibited prescription or nonprescription 
drugs within 7 days or 5 -half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study 
treatment and until completion of follow -up procedures unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16205], the medication will not interfere  with  the study (see 
Section 6.2  Exclusion Criteria).   
 
Patients must abstain from taking herbal supplements within 7 days (or 14 days if the 
drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 -half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the 
first dose of study treatment u ntil completion of the 30 -day follow -up period , unless 
the Investigator and Sponsor agree that the medication will not interfere with the 
study treatment.

 Any other TPO -R agonists are prohibited for patients on eltrombopag  (e.g. 
romiplostim).  
 
Substrates of OATP1B1 or BCRP  
Concomitant administration of eltrombopag and other OATP1B1 or BCRP substrates 
should be undertaken with caution.  
 
Examples of OATP and BCRP substrates  
  
OATP  Substrates  
aliskiren, ambrisentan, anacetrapib, atenolol, atrasentan, atorvas tatin, bosentan,

 1 year, or at unscheduled visits and at early termination when applicable , and 
updated throughout study participation as indicated .  Dose, route, unit frequency 
of administration, and indication for administration and dates of medication will 
be captured.  
 
9.1.2 Demographics  
Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race) will be rec orded at 
Baseline/Screening.  
 
9.1.3 Medical History  
Relevant medical history, including history of current disease, other pertinent 
medical history, and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded 
at Baseline/ Screening and updated throughout stud y participation as indicated . 
 
9.1.4 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_41845] a 
subinvestigator who is a physician at Baseline/Screening. Qualified staff (MD, NP, 
RN, and PA) may complete the abbreviated physical exam at all other visits.  New 
abnormal physical exam findings must be documented and will be followed by a 
physician or other qualified staff at the next scheduled visit. Exam findings 
consistent with bleeding will be noted on bleedin g assessment CRF.  Partial 
physical exams as able may be performed via telehealth if associated study visit is 
performed remotely due to pandemic -related safety or research restrictions.  
 
9.1.5 Bleeding Assessment  
An in -person bleeding assessment will be performe d at Baseline/Screening, at 
Study Visits Week 1, Week 4, Week 12, and 1 year, at unscheduled visits, and at 
early termination when applicable. Assessments will be performed via telehealth 
if associated study visit is performed remotely due to pandemic -related safety or 
research restrictions.  A telephone bleeding assessment will be performed at 
weeks 2 and 3. (See Appendix for details of WHO Bleeding Scale and modified 
Buchanan Scale) .  
 
9.2 Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
9.2.1 Hematology  
Blood will be obtained and  sent to each site’s clinical hematology lab for a 
complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood 
cell count, white blood cell differential, and platelet count). Interval platelet 
counts (between study visits) may be run at  the site’s clinical hematology lab or 
at an outside facility.  
 
9.2.2 Blood Chemistry Profile  
Blood will be obtained and sent to each site’s clinical chemistry lab for 
determination of aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine

achieved menarche prior to their participation in the study.  
 
9.3 HRQoL Tools  
The Kids ITP tool (KIT) will be performed at Baseline/Screening, at Study Visits Week 
1, Week 4, Week 12, and [ADDRESS_581923] disease -specific health related 
quality of life measure developed for ITP, specifically for use with children. It con tains 
a child self -report version (to be complet ed by [CONTACT_332389] 7 and older), a parent 
proxy version (to be completed by [CONTACT_455158] 2 and older), and parent 
version (to assess parental impact of ITP - all ages). Each version c onsists of 26 items, 
and a single overall score is obtained. Scores range from 0 to 100: a higher score 
represents better quality of life or, as with the parental impact version, less burden. 
Response options are on a 5 -point Likert -type scale ranging from  “never” to “always”, 
and the timeframe of interest is the “past week”. KIT will be administered in English, 
Spanish, or Quebec French.  
 
Assessment of global change will be performed at Week 1, Week 4, Week 12, and 1 
year using the Parent Proxy -Report and Child Self -Report Change Scales.  
 
Assessment of fatigue will be performed at Baseline/Screening, at Study Visits Week 
1, Week 4, Week 12, and 1 year using the Fatigue Scale -Child (FS -C to be 
administered by [CONTACT_332389] 7 to 12 years), the Fatigue Scale –Adolescent (FS -A 
teens ages 13 and older), and the Fatigue Scale -Parent (FS -P to be completed by 
[CONTACT_455159]). Each item has a 5 -point Likert -type format; total scale 
intensity ratings have ben rescaled so that they range from 0 (no fati gue symptoms) 
to 100 (highest possible fatigue score). All of the tools have been evaluated for face, 
content, and construct validity and for internal consistency. The tools take five 
minutes to complete. Fatigue scales will be administered in English.  
 
The National Institute of Health funded and developed the web based patient -
reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS®).  PROMIS® contains 
a number of pediatric self -report short items that each assess domains of physical and 
emotional functi on in general and over a seven -day time interval 20-23. Patients (age  7-
18 years) will complete PROMIS® global health pediatric measures (Appendix A 2c).  
These measures have been tested and reliability of each is ≥0.[ADDRESS_581924] 7 days. Responses utilize a 5 -point Likert 
scale ranging from “excellent” to “poor” or “n ever” to “always” 21,24. The PROMIS®

 measures will be scored in accordance with their scoring manuals 24-27.PROMIS  will be 
administered in English and Spanish.  
 
Patients  may be excluded from participation in Patient Reported Outcome Measures 
(PROMIS, KIT, Change Scale, and Hockenber ry Fatigu e Scale) if a translated tool is not 
available.  
 
HRQoL surveys may be completed remotely and emailed, mailed, or faxed to study site 
if associated study visit is performed remotely due to pandemic -related safety or 
research restrictions.  
 
9.4 Research Laborato ry Measurements   
(see the study Manual Of Operations for sample s and processing details)  
9.4.1 Regulatory T cells  
Whole  blood in EDTA will be sent to [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /Baylor College of 
Medicine  for quantification of CD4+25+Foxp3+ regulatory T -cells.  
This is a non -CLIA approved test, and results will not be made available to 
individual investigators or patients.  
 12 ml (two 6 ml EDTA  tubes) will be collected unless there are volume 
restrictions for smaller children.  
 For smaller children  a minimum of 6 ml will be collected. To avoid clotting in 
cases like this smaller tubes may be used (e.g. three 2ml EDTA  tubes).  
 
Blood for the Research Laboratory Measurements  will be collected at the 
following time points:  
i. Day 0 ( Baseline ), prior to rec eiving study drug  
ii. Week 12  
iii. End of study  (1 year)  
iv. In the event of sample processing failure or inadequate yield, the site 
will be asked to collect a new sample at the time of a blood draw 
during a later study visit . 
 
9.5 Optional Research Studies  
If consent is obtained for optional studies, baseline and serial blood samples will be 
sent to [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ Baylor College of Medicine for banking and for 
future correlative biology studies.  
 DNA: 6 ml whole blood collected in EDTA tube  
 RNA: 2.5 ml whole blood collected in PaxGene RNA tube . (At [LOCATION_007] Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455129], 6mL EDTA tube will be collected as well. )  
 
Blood for the Optional Research Studies  will be collected at the following time

10. SAFETY  
10.[ADDRESS_581925]/ALT/Tbili will be monitored every [ADDRESS_581926] risk will be completed by [CONTACT_455160]. Patients at 
elevated risk (due to history of radiation, prolonged steroid use, or diabetes) should 
be referred to an ophthalmologist for baseline exam. For patients at standard risk, 
investiga tor should perform ophthalmologic exam, and if there are any findings of 
concern for cataracts, patient should be referred to ophthalmologist for baseline 
exam. For patients continuing on eltrombopag >[ADDRESS_581927] for moni toring, especially if receiving other medications (such as 
steroids) contributing to cataract risk.  
 
10.3 Pregnancy Testing  
Women of child -bearing potential (achieved menarche) must have a negative serum 
or urine pregnancy test to be eli gible.  Pregnancy te st must be checked every [ADDRESS_581928] dose of study 
treatment.  Follow up information may be obtained via phone call or email.  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
of a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether 
or not related to that investiga tional product.   
 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ZIP_CODE]  
31 
 An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 
the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected 
based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Information regarding occurrence of adverse events will be captured throughout the 
study.  The collection period for all AEs will begin after informed consent is obtained 
and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed, or thirty days  
after the subject takes the last dose of study drug, whichever is later.  
 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Advers e events will be recorded in the patient CRF. Adverse events will be described 
by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and 
relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results occ urring after informed consent 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, require therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that 
requires transfusion or other support), or require changes in  study medication(s).  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after first dose of study drug should be 
recorded in the Adverse Events CRF. Conditions that were already present at the time 
of informed consent should be recorded in the Medical History page of th e patient’s 
eCRF. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_581929] be made at each visit (or more 
frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the 
study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course  of therapy, only the most 
severe grade of the event is reported. If an adverse event progresses through several 
grades during one course of therapy, only the most severe grade is reported.  An 
adverse event that persists from one course (cycle) to another  is only reported once 
unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse event 
which resolves and then recurs during a different course (cycle), is reported each 
course (cycle) it recurs.  
For reporting purposes, the duration of the AE  should be the duration of the highest 
(most severe) grade of the toxicity. The resolution date of the AE is defined as the 
date at which the AE returns to baseline (note that the resolution date may therefore 
be different from the date at which the grade of the AE decreased from its highest 
grade). If the AE does not return to baseline the resolution date is recorded as 
“ongoing”.  Dates used in adverse event reporting for laboratory test abnormalities 
should be the date the sample was collected (not the d ate the sample was processed 
or the date the results were reported).  Toxicities reported from off site laboratories 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581930] and/or research chart, as applicable.  
The completed CRF summarizing the non -serious AE should be reviewed and signed 
off by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7516].  
 
 
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 5.0 should be used to assess and grade  any AE or SAE, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. Events grade 3 or higher 
should be collected and documented and rep orted as indicated. The modified criteria 
can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified 
criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 11A below should be used to grade severity.  It 
should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
 
Table 11A.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be 
aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate li mitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse  experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following 
the guidelines in Table 11 B. 
 
Table 1 1B.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows  a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_455161].  
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ZIP_CODE]  
33 
 Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_455130]; and that is  unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that 
suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to 
the study drug.  
 
 
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and unanticip ated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865])  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 death  
 a life -threatening adverse experience  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]++ 
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require interven tion to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
++ Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455131]:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in cond ition  
 Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing 
the informed consent  
 Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_447144]’ s general condition  
 Note that treatment on an emergency outpatient basis that does not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217912] 
a SAE given above is not a serious adverse event  
 
Any serious or immediately life-threatening adverse experience, including those 
resulting in death, occurring while the subject is receiving study drug, or within [ADDRESS_581931]’s last dose of protocol therapy, regardless of the treating

e-mail (within 24 hours of the event) to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_455133].  
 
 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) 
per IRB Guidelines . The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been 
completed, or thirty days after the subject takes the last dose of study drug, 
whichever is later.  
 
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site 
investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.   
 
SAEs (as well as reports of drug exposure during  pregnancy and reports of study drug 
misuse or abuse) will be forwarded to [COMPANY_001] within one business day of Study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_455134].

9739) within [ADDRESS_581933] be reported as follow -up to the original 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An 
SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered  completely 
unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new 
event.  
Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day safety evaluation follow -up period should only 
be reported to [COMPANY_001] if the investigator suspects a causal relationshi p to the study 
treatment.  
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581934] as the original SAE Report. Each 
re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported 
as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. T he follow -up information 
should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was 
treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or 
withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously docu mented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package 
Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study treatment, 
an oncology [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department associate 
may urgently require further information fr om the investigator for Health Authority 
reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all 
investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been 
reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Rea ctions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees 
in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries.  
 
To ensure patient safety, each pregna ncy occurring while the patient is on study 
treatment must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous 
or voluntary termination, details of the birth , and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancy should be reported by [CONTACT_267237][INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E) by [CONTACT_6791] (fax: 8 77-778-9739). Pregnancy 
follow -up should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the 
[investigational/study treatment] any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced 
during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes mu st be collected for the female partners of any males who 
took study treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these 
pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother.

16 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Overview  
This is a prospective, open label, randomized, two -arm, multi -center Phase 3 trial. 
Enrolled patients with newly diagnosed ITP are randomized at enrollment 2:1 to the 
experimental treatment arm (eltrombopag) and standard treatment arm 
(investigator’s choic e of [ADDRESS_581941] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]); randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_4676]’s age at enrollment and up -front treatment status, with block size of 3. Each 
stratum will be limited to a maximum of 2 7 patients. Hence, the age distribution of 
the final accrued coho rt may not be representative of the patient population. This is 
appropriate in the context of this study to ensure sufficient number of patients to 
study treatment effects in each age group. The primary objective is to determine 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581942] therapy arm  using a one -
sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH)  test at alpha=0.025 (see section 16.b) . 
 
Intent -to-Treat and Evaluability  
For the primary objective, all randomized patients will be included in an intent -to-
treat (ITT) analysis. Evaluability for the secondary and exploratory objectives: In the 
experimental treatment arm, patients will be considered evaluable if they receive at 
least one dose of eltrombopag. In the standard treatment arm, patients will be 
considered evaluable if they receive at least one dose of one of the standard of care 
treatments.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
a. Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics  
 Patient demographic a nd clinical characteristics at study enrollment will be 
 summarized using descriptive statistics, including frequencies and proportions for 
 categorical measures, and means, medians, ranges, and standard errors for 
 continuous measures.  
 
b. Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
To address the primary objective,  we will first test for normality of the 
distribution of the proportion of platelet respon ders.  If the assumption of 
normality is upheld,  a one -sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH)  test, at 
alpha=0.025,  will be used to compare the proportion of platelet respon ders  
between the two arms. If the normality assumption is violated, then a one -sided 
Fisher’s exact test will be used.  The monitoring boundaries and levels of 
significance for the interim and final ana lyses of the primary endpoint are 
detailed in Table 16A.  If a monitoring boundary is crossed in an interim analysis, 
an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will make  a non -binding  
recommendation regarding trial conduct or potential closure.  In  the final 
analysis,  we will reject the null hypothesis if the upper (efficacy) boundary z -value 
of 1.[ZIP_CODE] is crossed; in that case, it will be reasonable to conclude that the rate 
of platelet response is significantly greater in patients treated with elt rombopag 
than standard first -line treatments.  Otherwise , we will conclude that there is 
insufficient evidence to support superiority of eltrombopag over standard first -
line treatments.  All randomized patients will be analyzed in the ITT analysis.  
 
Select ion of platelet measurements for the determination of platelet response .  
All platelet counts will be reported, and the four measurements closest in time to 
Weeks 6, 8, 10, and [ADDRESS_581943] <3 platelet measurements due to missing data will 
be classified as non -responders.  
 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581944] s of missing data, sensitivity analyses will be 
performed using two approaches: a) assuming missing at random; and, b) 
assuming missing not at random.   For each secondary endpoint, the assumption 
of normality will be tested.  If violated for binary endpoints, a Fisher’s exact test 
will be used.  If violated for continuous endpoints, a Wilcoxon rank -sum test will 
be used.  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.1, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be 
used to compare the proportion of patients with poor WHO Bleeding Score and 
poor Modified Buchanan Score between the two arms.  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.2, an ANCOVA model  will be used to compare 
the number of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_455144].  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.3, the observed proportion and 95% 
confidence interval of platelet respon ders  will be calculated in the subset of 
patients who required a rescue treatment during weeks [ADDRESS_581945] will be 
used to compare the proportion of patients with a treatment response at one 
year between the two arms.  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.6, an ANCOVA model  will be used to compare 
the number of 2nd-line therap ies between the two arms  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.7, an ANCOVA model  will be used to compare 
the absolute change from baseline in percentage of regulatory T cells at 12 weeks 
and 1 year between the two arms  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.8,  KIT scores will be calculated as per the 
methods described in Klaassen et al.28 Spaghetti plots will be used to visualize the 
KIT scores over time per patient by [CONTACT_2939]. An ANCOVA model  will be 
used to compare the absolute  change from  baseline in KIT overall score at 1 
week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year between the two arms.  An ANCOVA model  
will be used to compare the Change Scale  score at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 
and 1 year between the two arms.

 To address secondary objective 3.2. 9, fatigue scores will be calculated as per the 
methods described in Hockenberry et al.29  All measures will be rescaled from 0 
(no fatigue) to 100 (high fatigue) for consistency in scoring.  Spaghetti plots will be 
used to visualize the fatigue scores over time per patient by [CONTACT_2939]. The 
PROMIS tired question: “My child (I) got tired easily never to almost always” will 
be used as an anchor with severe fatigue defined as “often” or “ alm ost always” 
with moderate fatigue being “sometimes”.  An ANCOVA model  will be used to 
compare the absolute  change from baseline in fatigue at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 
weeks, and 1 year between the two arms.  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.10, an ANCOVA model  will be used to 
compare iron indices at 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year between the two arms  
 
To address secondary objective 3.2.11, the frequency and proportion (with 95% 
confidence interval) of patients with abnormal LFTs will be calculated.   Adverse 
event rates will be coded by [CONTACT_374640].  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_455169], the rate of 
occurrence, and the se verity and relationship to study drug.  If a patient 
experiences the same toxicity multiple times, a patient will be counted only once 
for a given toxicity at the maximum grade.  
 
d. Analysis of Exploratory Objectives  
Exploratory objectives are hypothesis -generating only. Any exploratory findings 
need to be confirmed in an independent study.  
 
To address the platelet exploratory objectives 3.3.1, a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test will be used to compare the proportion of patients between treatment ar ms 
with: (1) specific platelet -defined treatment response at 12 weeks, (2) extreme 
thrombocytosis, and (3) loss of treatment response (in the subgroup of patients 
who achieved treatment response during the first 12 weeks. Cumulative 
incidence curves by [CONTACT_455170]: (1) time to 
response and (2) time to platelet and bleeding response. Gray’s test will be used 
to compare the cumulative incidence between treatment arms.  
 
To address the patient -reported outcomes exploratory objectiv es 3.3.2, KIT 
scores and fatigue scores will be calculated as described. Spaghetti plots will be 
used to visualize the scores over time per patient by [CONTACT_2939]. An ANCOVA 
model  will be used to compare the absolute change from baseline at [ADDRESS_581946] (for categorical outcomes) or an ANCOVA model  (for 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581947] of therapy ) wil l be use d to compare the the 
two arms.  
 
To address the survey -related aspects of exploratory objectives 3.3.3, the 
PROMIS® measures will be scored as according to the described approach 22. 
Mixed -effects model and the generalized estimating equations (GEE) allow for 
covariate adjustment and can model both within group effects (time) and 
between group effects 30. The results will be summarized with adjusted means 
with associated 95% confiden ce intervals at each time point for each treatment 
group. For the primary analysis, these models will include the main effect of time 
(T0-T2). PHIS is a confidential database that allows use among the [ADDRESS_581948] -baseline survey are 
submitted. If the observed response rate for a given survey falls below 33%, the 
study team may consider halting the collecti on of that survey from subsequent 
patients, as it is an inappropriate use of resources, and unfair to patients, to 
continue to require survey submission if the survey data will be too sparse to 
address the study objective.  
 
 
e. Interim Analysis  
Interim analysis for efficacy a nd fu tility  
To monitor for early evidence of efficacy or lack of efficacy (futility), we will 
perform group sequential analyses for a total of three “looks” at the data.  Power 
calculations were performed using PASS 14 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003]). We 
will conduct two interim analyses using a two -sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  
test to compare the proportion of platelet responders between the two 
treatment arms, after 33 % and after 67% of randomized patients are accrued. If 
the trial has not been terminated due to efficacy or futility, the third and final 
analysis will be conducted after accrual of all randomized patients at the end of 
the trial.  We used the O’Brien -Flem ing spending function to determine the 
monitoring boundaries for these three group sequential tests (Table 16A, Figure 
1).  For interim analysis 1, significant evidence that the experimental drug is more 
efficacious than the standard of care will have been  provided if we observe a z -
test statistic ≥ 3.[ADDRESS_581949] been provided if z ≤ –3.71.  For 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581950] been provided if z ≥ 2.51 or ≤ –2.51, respectively.  For the final 
analysis, significant evidence of the efficacy of the experimental drug will have 
been provided if z ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_581951] (DSMB) will make  a non -binding  recommendation 
if/when it is appropr iate to close the trial early on the basis of the statistical 
evidence.

f. Sample Size and Study Duration  
Power Calculations for the Primary Objective  
147 “informative” (as defined below) patients , randomized 2:[ADDRESS_581953] treatment arm, will be required to 
provide 81.4% power to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the proportion of 
patients who are platelet responders, assuming the response rate is 75% in the 
experimental treatment arm and 50% in the standard treatment arm, using a 
one-sided Cochran -Mant el-Haenszel (CMH)  test and a type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_581954] time point at which the primary endpoint, platelet response, will be 
assessed is 5 weeks after enrollment.  A small number of patients, approximately 

Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ZIP_CODE]  
46 
 9%, are anticipated to withdraw from the study (i.e., withdraw from protocol 
therapy AND data submission) prior to the 5 -week platelet assessment. It is 
reasonable to assume that the stud y withdrawal rate will be similar across the 
treatment arms. These patients are non -informative for the primary objective to 
assess the efficacy of eltrombopag; such patients dilute the treatment effect and 
as a result the power is diminished.  These “non -informative” patients will be 
classified as non -responders and included in the ITT analysis. We will assume that 
9% of randomized patients, a conservatively high estimate, will be non -
informative. To account for the diluting effect the non -informative pati ents have 
on the comparison of response rates, we plan to enroll and randomize up to an 
additional 15 patients (~ 9%). 
 
Total sample size and study duration  
In summary, a total of up to 162  (estimated: 147 informative + 15 non-
informative ) patients will be enrolled and randomized  2:1 to the experimental 
treatment arm (N=10 8) and standard treatment arm (N=5 4). All randomized 
patients will be included in the ITT analysis of the primary objective.   
 
We anticipate enrolling 45 patients per year  (3.7 patients per month) .  The total 
accrual duration is expected to be about [ADDRESS_581955]’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report 
Form (eCRF) when the information corresponding to that visit is available.  
Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_455171] (or designee), but will be identified by 
a site number, subject number and initials.  
For eCRFs: If a correction is required for an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track 
the person entering or updating eCRF data and creates an elect ronic audit trail.   
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled 
in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed 
and verified for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_737].  A c opy of the 
CRF will remain at the Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.  
 
b. Data Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated database.  The Data Management group 
will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with pro cedural 
Protocol Version: 6.0 26June2024  
BCM IRB: H -[ADDRESS_581956] unauthorized access by [CONTACT_82984]; appropriate backup copi[INVESTIGATOR_123809].    
At critical junctur es of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final 
reports), data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
 
d. Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the m onitor, other 
authorized representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory 
Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request.  A file for each subject must be 
maintained that includes the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and 
Assent  Form (if applicable) and copi[INVESTIGATOR_41837].  The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source 
documents from which the information on the CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], 
Study File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years 
following marketing of the investigational product or for two years after centers 
have been notified that the IND has been discontinued .  There may be other 
circumstances for which the Sponsor is required to maintain study records and, 
therefore, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_41852].  
 
e. Monitoring  
1. Monitoring of Coordinating Center at BCH

The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312).  
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and 
other records will be identified by a coded number and initials only.  All study records 
will be kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s na me to a 
patient identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  
Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, 
except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1622].  The Investigator must also  comply 
with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).  
 
a. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by [CONTACT_10597].  Protocol amendments 
cannot be implemented without prior written IRB/IEC approval except as 
necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol 
amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients 
may be implemented immediately, provide d the IRBs are notified within five 
working days.  
 
b. Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by a central IRB, 
and reliance agreements with participating sites will be utilized . For any sites that 
do not have or choose not to use reliance agreements with the central IRB, the 
IRB/IEC of that participating center will be utilized. Serious adverse experiences 
regardless of causality will be reported to the central IRB/IEC and singl e site 
IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the 
IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC informed as to the progress of 
the study. The Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB/IEC compliance with 
regulati ons.

 Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as 
protocol, protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, 
information concerning patient recruitment, payment or compensation 
procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The 
IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed 
consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is 
initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approva l statement will be transmitted by 
[CONTACT_455172].  This 
approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_38123].  
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated 
without prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical 
or administrative aspect s of the study.  Such modifications will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC and written verification that the modification was submitted and 
subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents originally 
submit ted for review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring 
during the study in accordance with the standard operating procedures and 
policies of the IRB; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the 
patients of the conduct of th e study; an annual update and/or request for re -
approval; and when the study has been completed.  
 
c. Informed Consent Form

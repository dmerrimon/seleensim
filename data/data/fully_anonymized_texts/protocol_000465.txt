 PROTOCOL SUMMARY   
 
Purpose and Knowledge t o be 
Gained  
 • The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of 
combined oral contraceptive (COC) use on serum  relaxin 
levels, ACL laxity, and rate of ligamentous injury among 
collegiate female athletes  
• Previous research suggests COC use may decrease serum 
relaxin levels, which could decrease ACL laxity and 
potentially protect against ACL injury (which is 
disproportionately higher in female athletes vs male 
athletes)  
Research Procedures  
 • Assessment of baseline contraceptive status and initiation 
of study COC if participant desires  
• Participants  will undergo the following assessments at 
baseline and at the four -month time point  
(1) Serum relaxin level  
(2) Knee joint anterior and posterior  laxity will be tested 
using a KT-2000 arthrometer (Medmetric Corp, San 
Diego, CA)  
(3) Motion Tracking Analysis  
(4) Reported knee injury during study time period  
Subject Population  • 150 female collegiate athletes competing in sports 
considered high -risk for ACL tears (basketball, soccer, and 
volleyball)  
• Recruited from surrounding universities (Loyola 
Marymount, Pepperdine)  where Cedars -Sinai Kerlan Jobe-
affiliated  orthopedic surgeons  practice  
• Participants who want to remain on no hormonal 
contraception or want to take study COC   
Duration  • The study includes 2 in-person  visits and one phone 
follow -up.  
• The total study duration i s 12 months

Page [ADDRESS_987105] revealed anatomic, neuromuscular and hormonal differences play a role,3, 6, 7 one 
question that has not fully been addressed is the possible protective role of combined oral 
contraceptives ( COCs).  
 
Prevalence of COC use among female athletes has been estimated at 40% to 50%, showing a 
significant acceptance of COC use by [CONTACT_722781].2, 12  Previous literature suggests that 
fluctuating hormones not only play a role is weakening the structure of the female ACL but also 
increase knee joint laxity , leading to poorer lower extremity biomechanics during sports and 
activities.5, 6 While some risk factors are not modifiable, such as the size of a woman’s ACL or 
femoral notch, the ability to safely alter a female’s hormonal profile to confer a more protective, 
favorable environment may theoretically provide a viable intervention for the female athletic 
community in ACL injury prevention as well as in post -ACL reconstruction rehabilitation.  
 
Thus, advancing our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ACL 
injuries will further the development of prevention, rehabilitation and training strategies to 
reduce the risk of sport -related injury, thereby [CONTACT_722782]'s health for all ages. With 4 out of 5 heterosexually active women in the U.S. 
using COC in their lifetime, this research may also contribute to growing evidence of non -
contraceptive benefits of COCs. 
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
We p lan to investigate the hypothesi s that combined oral contraceptives ( COCs) reduce serum 
relaxin levels and ligament laxity  in collegiate female athletes . Though this study cannot prove 
causality, we will also observe if rate of ligamentous injury in female athletes is reduced among 
women taking COC. Our specific aims are as follows:  
 
Aim 1: To evaluate relaxin levels  in female athletes on COC or no hormonal contraceptive  
 
Aim 2: To quantify anterior and coronal plane (varus/valgus) knee laxity between female athletes 
using combined  oral contraceptives and those who are not using any hormonal treatment.   
 
Aim 3: To track the rate of ACL and other ligamentous injuries (ruptures / sprains) among 
female athletes and determine if COCs have a protective effect.

 3.0 STUDY POPULATION   
 
3.1 Selection of the Study Population  
• We aim to recruit a convenience sample of 150 female collegiate athletes competing in 
sports considered high -risk for ACL tears (basketball, soccer, and volleyball)  
• Participants will be from surrounding universities (Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine ) 
• These female collegiate athletes will be English -speaking, so there is no need for non -
English speaker consent considerations. If, however, a subject wishes to discuss anything 
in another language, CSMC interpreter services will be requested.  
 
3.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Female  
• 18 years of age or older  
• Currently playing basketball, soccer, or volleyball  at Loyola Marymount or Pepperdine  
• If not currently on COC, regular menstrual cycle  occurring every  21-35 days  
 
3.3 Exclusion Criteria  
• Previous ACL injury  (Previous ACL injury, on the same knee or the contralateral knee, 
places you at a significantly increased risk of subsequent ACL rupture which would 
provide a confounding effect in our study.  Subsequent treatment of that ACL injury, 
whether with surgery or  non-operative management, would also affect subsequent ACL 
injury risk. ) 
• Underlying neuromuscular disease  
• For COC use group only: Medical contraindication to COC use  
• History of pregnancy  (Excluding previous pregnancies eliminates a potential confounder 
--- women may have lasting changes from carrying a pregnancy in the past .) 
• Desire to conceive in the next year  
 
3.[ADDRESS_987106] Recruitment  
Female athletes will be recruited via two pathways:  
(1) Approached by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Trentacosta, who along with other Cedar Sinai Kerlan -Jobe doctors, 
serve as the team physician for the schools.  
(2) Self-referral via recruitment materials posted in training facility  
 
3.[ADDRESS_987107] in participation. They will then be asked to 
complete a screening questionnaire  evaluating medical, surgical, reproductive, and injury history . 
This screening questionnaire will be returned via email to the study coordinator.  
 
Those meeting above enrollment criteria will continue participation  and onboarded for the study 
by [CONTACT_9137] .

4.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Data will be collected prospectively throughout participant intake and study progression . 
Given the personal  nature of women’s contraceptive preferences, we will enroll three categories 
of female athletes:  
(1) Women who are not on hormonal contraception and have no plan to start in the next year  
(2) Women who are not on hormonal contraception and would like to initiate study COC  
(3) Women who are currently on hormonal contraception and would like to switch to study 
COC  
For those participants who would like to start study COC, women will be prescribed a daily oral 
contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 20mcg/norethindrone 1mg.  
 
Women will maintain a contraceptive compliance diary  via paper or Word document which they 
can submit to us in person or electronically . Orthopedic te sting will start during the fourth 
menstrual/ COC cycle due to delay in COC effect and theoretical cumulative protective effect of 
COC use . All three  groups will undergo below testing to evaluate primary and secondary aims.  
 
Serum Relaxin (Aim 1):   
• Participants  will have about 2ccs of blood drawn to measure  serum relaxin levels at two 
time points : 
1. Baseline  
2. Fourth month of study participation  - menstrual cycle -specific timing:  
▪ Participants not on COC:  
• Luteal phase of their menstrual cycle ( Days 14 -28) 
• This is when peak relaxin levels are noted to occur  
▪ Participants on COC  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722779] 14 -28 
• Women on C OC have suppressed ovulation and thus no true luteal 
phase, but will undergo testing during the same time period  
Joint Laxity (Aim 2):  
• Joint laxity will be tested at two separate time points:  
1. Baseline  
2. Fourth month of study participation – synced with serum collection for relaxin 
level testing.    
• Joint Testing:   
o Each participant’s bilateral knee joint laxity will be tested using a KT -2000 
arthrometer (Medmetric  Corp, San Diego, CA) for anterior and posterior laxity.   
o Laxity and biomechanical testing will be done in the athletes’ training room on 
campus.  
o To eliminate inter -rater differences in the laxity measurement, only one examiner 
will conduct all knee laxity measurements.    
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_987108] at 67N and 87N, an average 
displacement  (mm)  for three cycles will be determined.    
o A Beighton score will be calculated with goniometer by a one examiner to assess 
generalized hypermobility at each time point.  
 
Motion Tracking Analysis (Aim 2):   
• Participants will be kinematically evaluated using a portable , non -invasive,  3-
dimensional motion capture system (Awinda, Xsens  Technologies, The Netherlands).   
• Each athlete will be asked to perform a singled -legged drop while  the motion tracking 
system collects and records  trunk flexion  angle (degrees) , hip adduction  (degrees) , and 
internal/external and coronal plane rotation (both in degrees) of the knee.  
• Data will be collected and averaged over three trials at each of the two time points  – 
baseline and 4th month of study participation.  
 
Interval Injury Assessment  (Aim 3):    
• Ligamentous injury will be monitored over the entire length of the study, tracking the 
date, location, and mechanism of injury for each event  by [CONTACT_163400] . Follow -ups 
to ask about any injury will occur weekly at each training room session, or sooner if we 
are contact[CONTACT_722783] a more significant injury that needs to be seen 
urgently in the office by [CONTACT_215480].

HRP-652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_04 -28-25 
 6.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
• Only listed study staff will have access to the processed data gathered from the visits.  
• Any analysis of the data will be performed on the de -identified dataset.  
• As above, data from the samples will be kept and stored in the Kerlan Jobe secure 
network only.  
 
6.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
• [CONTACT_722786] will be responsible for the evaluation, analysis, and reporting of the data 
among the co -investigators.  
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
7.1 Study Outcome Measures  
• Data Analysis:  Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS statistical software (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) with significance set at p<0.05.  Differences in the two 
timepoints will be evaluated between the two groups. Multiple regression will be used to 
analyze rate of injury as a function of OC use (group), joint laxity, motion analysis, and 
serum relaxion, and additional demographic data. Post -hoc ANOVA, or non -parametric 
alternative, will be used to evaluate continuous variables (joint laxity, motion anal ysis, 
and serum relaxin levels) between groups.  
• Serum relaxin -2 level will be measured  using a Quantikine Human Relaxin -2 
Immunoassay  (DRL200). All samples will be run in duplicate and  relaxin -[ADDRESS_987109]  curve. The intra -assay and inter -assay 
coefficients  of variation and minimum detection limit will be determined and reported.  
• Joint l axity measurements will be evaluated using the KT -2000 and the Beighton Score.  
The KT -2000 measures anterior and posterior displacement (mm) of the tibia relative to 
the femur when an anterior and posterior load are applied to the tibia. The amount of 
tibial displacement provides information  on ACL laxity. The Beighton score is screening 
technique for measuring generalized joint hypermobility.1 It requires the performance of 
5 maneuvers, four passive bilateral and one active unilateral performance : 
1. Passive dorsiflexion and hyperextension of the fifth MCP joint beyond 90°       
2. Passive apposition of the thumb to the flexor aspect of the forearm   
3. Passive hyperextension of the elbow beyond 10°   
4. Passive hyperextension of the knee beyond 10°   
5. Active forward flexion of the trunk with the knees fully extended so that the 
palms of the hands rest flat on the floor   
The Beighton score is based on a 9 -point scale with ≥ 4 considered hypermobile.  
• Continuous measures of t runk flexion hip adduction, and internal/external and coronal 
plane rotation of the knee measured during a singled -legged drop using the motion 
tracking equipment mentioned above in section 4.0 (Aim 2). These outcomes measures 
are all in angles (degrees).  Increased valgus knee motion (in the coronal plane) and 
landing with the femur in  adduction and internal rotation  has been suggested to 
predispose athletes to  injury when landing from a jump.10

 7.1 Sample Size Considerations  
The primary outcome measure of this study is the rate of ligament injury.  Therefore , our sample 
size requirements were based on this measure.  Previous research indicates female athletes’  risk 
of injury is sport  dependent.  In Dragoo et al. ’s 2011 analysis, they report a 60% rate of ACL 
injury among basketball players, and a ~30% injury rate among soccer, gymnastics, and lacross e 
female athletes.4  Whereas field hockey and volleyball had a reported  0% rate of injury.  Thus, 
we believe it is reasonable to estimate that females not taking oral contraceptives will have an 
estimated 30% risk of ligament injury, which we aim to demonstrate a 20% absolute reduction to 
10% risk of injury among females taki ng OCs.  Assuming equal sizing, based on previous 
studies that demonstrate approximately have of female athletes are on OCs,2 we estimate a  total 
sample size of 140 will provide  approximately 80% power to detect an ACL Injury rate 
difference of 10% (OC) versus 30% ( non-OC).

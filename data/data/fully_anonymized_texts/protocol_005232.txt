Investigational 
Products:  • CSF-1: pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% 
[high dose]) and diclofenac sodium (0.006%) 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% [high 
dose])  
• Diclofenac sodium (0.006%)  
Study Phase:  2b 
Primary Objective:  • To evaluate the efficacy of  CSF-1 for the treatment of presby[CONTACT_608177]:  • To evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of CSF-1 versus 
the individual components for the treatment of presby[CONTACT_19555]  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (onset and 
duration) of 2 concentrations of CSF-1 ([0.2%/0.006%] and 
[0.4%/0.006%]) for the treatment of presby[CONTACT_608178]:  
Structure:  Multi-center, randomized, double- masked, parallel -group, safety, and 
efficacy study  
Duration:  Approximately 2 to 4 weeks (4 study visits)  
Controls: Individual components of the combination therapy (pi[INVESTIGATOR_608152]) 
Treatment plan:  Visit 1: Qualified subjects will receive 1 drop of Refresh Classic® 
(placebo) instilled to each eye.  
Visit 2: Following the pre-treatment assessments, qualified subjects 
will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of the following treatment arms: CSF -1 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] [0.2%] /diclofenac sodium [0.006%] ), 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.2%) alone, or diclofenac sodium (0.006%) alone . All 
subjects will dose twice daily  
 in both eyes with a single 
drop for approximately 1 week. 
Visit 3: Following the visit 3 assessments, subjects will continue BID 
dosing  
in both eyes for approximately 1 week. Subjects 
initially randomized to the CSF -1 arm will now receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_553907] (0.4%)/diclofenac sodium (0.006%); subjects randomized to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.2%) alone arm will 
now receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.4%) alone; and subjects 
randomized to the diclofenac sodium alone arm will continue dosing 
with diclofenac  sodium (0.006%) alone.

Study Treatments  • CSF-1: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% 
[high dose]) and diclofenac (0.006%) 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% [high dose]) 
• Diclofenac sodium (0.006%) 
All patients will dose BID  
in both eyes with a single drop of 
IP.

General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses 
Analysis Sets:  
• Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set – The Intent-to-Treat analysis set ( ITT) will include all 
randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Set – The per -protocol (PP) set will include subjects in the ITT who do not 
have significant protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint. Protocol deviations

 will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set will be 
analyzed as treated.  
•  
 
 
 
 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of 
the IP. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated. 
Unit of Analysis: 
The study eye will be used for all monocular analyses. The fellow eye will inherently be 
included in all binocular analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic safety variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that meets all enrollment criteria.  If both eyes meet all 
enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 (Day 1) BCVA at [ADDRESS_805953] the same BCVA at 40 cm , the right eye will be the study eye.  
General Considerations:  
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and max imum). Qualit ative/categorical data will be summarized 
using frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level.

 Safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population.  
Hypothesis: 
H01: The difference, between study eyes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium (0.006%) , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at [ADDRESS_805954]- treatment = 0.  
H11: The difference, between study eyes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium (0.006%) , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at [ADDRESS_805955]- treatment ≠ 0.  
H02: The difference, between study eyes  treated with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40cm, 1-hour post- treatment = 0.  
H12: The difference, between study eyes treated with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40cm, 1-hour post- treatment ≠ 0.  
The study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses, H 01 or H02, are rejected 
in favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or H12. The overall Type I error of 
the 2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of Bonferroni correction procedures 
testing each hypothesis at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05. 
If H01 is rejected and CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) is considered a success, then CSF-1 
(0.2%/0.006%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
Similarly, if H02 is rejected and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.4%) is considered a success, then Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] 
(0.2%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Within 
these hierarchical framework s, these hypothese s can be tested at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 while 
still preserving an overall Type I error of alpha = 0.10.

Sample Size:  
Fifty subjects per each of the 3 treatment arms (150 total), yields an 85% power to establish 
superiority of CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 4%) to diclofenac sodium 0.006%

Primary Efficacy Analysis: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for each time point by [CONTACT_1570]. Testing of the percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) improvement from baseline will be completed 
accounting for the correlations between treatments and periods within a subject using a logistic (binomial error and logit link) model estimated by [CONTACT_355554] (GEE) 
methods. Aspects of the model include: 
• Response measure: indicator of whether the subject had a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) 
improvement from baseline in the assessment of BCVA at 40 cm in the study eye 
• Covariate: baseline BCVA at 40 cm in the study eye 
• Fixed effect explanatory measures: treatment

Safety Analysis:  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ) terms and be presented in a data listing. Treatment emergent AEs, those that occur 
after the first dose of IP, will be summarized by [CONTACT_608179] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within each SOC. Similar 
summaries will also be presented for treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs) related to IP and by 
[CONTACT_926]. When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever 
experience an event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the specific treatment period. AEs  will be reported separately by [CONTACT_6278].

approximately 50% of the population with presby[CONTACT_608180], 
resulting in some level of disability when performing tasks re quiring near visual acuity (VA) 
(Holden et al 2008) . This result ed in a global burden of presby[CONTACT_608181] 1.8 billion people 
in 2015 (Holden et al 2008) , and prevalence is increasing. The primary symptom of this 
condition is a progressive blurring of vision when performing near tasks such as reading, sewing, working at a computer, and using a tablet or cellular phone. Other symptoms include headaches and visual fatigue, which impair one’s quality of life ( Truscott 2009) .  
The underlying cause of presby[CONTACT_465025] (accommodation) (Donders 1864) . Accommodation is facilitated by [CONTACT_465026], 
which change the shape an d location of the crystalline lens of the eye. In response to near vision, 
the crystalline lens becomes thicker and more rounded in response to the actions of the ciliary muscle fibers (Garner and Yap 1997, Croft et al 2001, Glasser 2006) . As an individual ages, the 
lens becomes stiffer and less amenable to changing shape in response to ciliary muscle activity and this culminates in the symptoms of presby[CONTACT_19555].  
The neural mechanism of accommodation is the adjustment of the size of the pupil. Pupil size is 
determined by [CONTACT_465027][INVESTIGATOR_464996]. The pupil 
becomes smaller when the eye accommodates. This reduction in the size of the pupil (termed 
miosis) improves the resolution of the retinal image by [CONTACT_608182]. Miosis further increases the depth of field of the eye. A relatively small pupil offers increased depth of field in a way similar to that achieved by [CONTACT_465029] a camera.  
Current presby[CONTACT_608183]: corrective lenses with single vision or bifocal/multifocal lenses, corneal refractive surgery, corneal inlay procedures, and  intra-ocular 
lens surgery. Monovision correction improves the near vision of one eye (through the use of lenses, contacts, or surgery) while allowing the other eye to be used for distance vision. This approach has had variable results and may cause disturbances in depth-perception ( Fernandez et 
al 2013). Glasses consisting of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_608155] ( Emsley 1946, Borish 1975) . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_608156]’s peripheral vision placing the patient at risk while driving or performing other similar tasks. Lastly, surgical correction of vision in presby[CONTACT_608184], laser -assisted in -situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser -assisted epi[INVESTIGATOR_464997] (LASEK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), corneal inlays, and accommodative or multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). The results of these procedures are variable, at times inconsistent, and contraindicated in some patient groups (Moussa et al 2017) . 
The inconsistencies regarding the success of some of these procedures of presby[CONTACT_608185] a need for alternative strategies.  
The treatment proposed here repurposes a muscarinic receptor agonist to stimulate effects on iris and ciliary contractility via stimulation of Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], a 
muscarinic agonist, has been successful in treating cases of dilated pupil following ocular surgery (Patel et al 2002 ) and a broad spectrum of systemic conditions including botulism 
(Monaco et al 1998) , leprosy ( Lana-Peixoto et al 2014) , sarcoidosis ( Bowie and Givre 2003) , and 
Ross syndrome ( Weller et al 1992 , Chemman am et al 2007) . Low dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_608157]-1 Ophthalmic Solution

pharmacologically -induced anisocoria (Jacobson and Olson 1993) .

(those who have experienced menarche and who are not surgically sterilized [bilateral tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy , or bilateral oophorectomy] or post-menopausal [[ADDRESS_805975] 
menses]) and must use adequate birth control throughout the study period. Adequate birth control 
is defined as hormonal – oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives; mechanical 
– spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as condom or dia phragm; IUD; or surgical 
sterilization of partner. For non- sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an 
adequate method of birth control. 
In the event a female has a positive urine pregnancy test at visit 4, the subject will be withdrawn 
from the study and the investigator  will notify  and the sponsor within [ADDRESS_805976]  number (a five -digit number sta rting 
with the 2 -digit site number followed by a sequential three -digit number starting with 001). Once 
a subject meets all qualification criteria  at visit 2, he/she will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio via 
an interactive response technology system to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1: CSF -1, 2: pi[INVESTIGATOR_608166], 3: diclofenac sodium alone, and stratified by [CONTACT_60245] (brown  versus light 
[i.e. blue, green, gray, and hazel]) and by [CONTACT_465037] (-4.5 D 
to <-0.5 D, -0.5 D to +0.75 D, and >+0.75 D to +2.0 D) ; randomization will not be stratified by 
[CONTACT_3725].  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes ( e.g. iris color and baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  Double-masked treatment will be used to reduce 
the potential of bias during data collection and the evaluation of clinical endpoints.

 8.9 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
During the course of the study an  monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, asse ss IP accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, and   quality assurance and /or 
its designees may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits that  may include source data checks. 
Therefore,  direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. 
All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
[ADDRESS_805984] medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP- related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise from any use of the IP 
(e.g. off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the subject’s source document and e CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in 
clinical finding is considered an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by [CONTACT_465038]. All AEs will be collected from the time a subject signs the ICF through the subject’s study exit 
visit. 
9.1.1 Severity 
The severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE 
as determined by [CONTACT_608188]/her by [CONTACT_102]/subject.  The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  

Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 33 of 86 
 • Severe: Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_805985] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_459742]: 
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. 
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
“Suspected adverse reaction ” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE  include: a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure ( e.g. angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (e.g. 
tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control 
group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IP using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected: an AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
• Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological (or other) properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the part icular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE . The medical monitor will 
review and determine the expectedness of any serious adverse event (SAE) following the investigator’s assessment. The  final classification  of an AE is subject to the sponsor’s 
determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 34 of 86 
 Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
< 24 hours). For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241525]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/ Phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608167].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
Note: An SAE specifically related to visu al threat would be interpreted as any potential 
impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g. intra-ocular hemorrhage, retinal 
detachment, central corneal ulcer , or damage to the optic nerve). 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a SAE (i.e. resolution, 
change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE  Report Form must be completed and 
faxed/emailed to  and/or the study sponsor within 24 hours. The original SAE Report Form is 
not to be altered.  The SAE Report Form should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues and how the event was treated. 
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 General Considerations  
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation [ SD], median, minimum, and max imum). Qualitative/categorical data will be

Page 36 of 86 
 summarized using frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, 
will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. 
For all variables, baseline is defined as the pre-randomization measurement taken at Visit 2 (Day 
1). If the measurement is not available  from Visit 2 (Day 1) , then the measurement from 
screening Visit 1 (Day -1 to -14) will be used as baseline for all treatments/visits. Change from 
baseline will be calculated as follow -up measure minus baseline measure.  
The primary analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted in the PP, 
include observed data only, and use st atistical models , which adjust for the correlation between 
treatments within an eye and/or subject.  
The secondary analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted in the ITT, 
include observed data only, and use similar statistical models as the primary analyses.  No subject 
data will be excluded from the ITT due to protocol violations/deviations.Sensitivity analysis on 
the primary efficacy variable will be performed on both the PP and ITT imputing missing data as 
failures;  
 
 
 
 
Safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population.

gain in BCVA at [ADDRESS_805993]- treatment ≠ 0.  
The study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses , H01 or H02, are rejected in 
favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or H12. The overall Type I error of  the 
2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of Bonferroni correction procedures testing each hypothesis at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05. 
If H
01 is rejected and CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) is considered a success, then CSF-1 (0.2%/0.006%) 
will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Similarly, if H02 is 
rejected and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.4%) is considered a success, then Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.2%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Within these hierarchical

10.3 Study Populations  
• Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set – The ITT will include all randomized subjects. Subjects in 
the ITT will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Set – The PP set will include subjects in the ITT who do not have s ignificant 
protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint. Protocol deviations will be assessed 
prior to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set will be analyzed as treated. 
•  
 
 
 
 
 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
the IP. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated. 
10.4 Unit of Analysis 
The study eye will be used for all monocular a nalyses. The fellow eye will inherently be 
included in all binocular analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic safety variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that meets all enrollment criteria. If both eyes meet all enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 (Day 1) BCVA at [ADDRESS_805994] the same BC VA at 40 cm, the right eye will be the study eye.

10.7 Sample Size  
Fifty subjects per each of the 3 treatment arms (150 total), yields an 85% power to establish 
superiority of CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 4%) to diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone 
in the percentage of study eyes demonstrating a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) gain in BCVA at [ADDRESS_805996] at a 2 -sided 
alpha = 0.05 assuming that the diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone response is 5% and the CSF-1 
response is 27%, resulting in an overall 2 -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_805997] approximately 30% of subjects will have light ( i.e. blue, green, gray, and hazel ) iris and 
at least approximately 30% will have a brown iris . The actual percentages will vary based on 
enrollment.  
10.[ADDRESS_805998] demographics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and iris color will be presented using summary statistics  (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median) .

 10.9 Efficacy Analysis 
10.9.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy variable in this study is the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line 
(15-letter) gain in BCVA at [ADDRESS_805999]- treatment at visit 3 and/or visit [ADDRESS_806000] ment to maintain the 
overall Type I error  as detailed in the hypothesis section with statistical inference made on the 
comparisons between CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) versus diclofenac sodium 0.006% and  between 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 4%) versus diclofenac sodium 0.006% Again as detailed in the hypothesis section, 
only if the higher dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0.4%/0.006%) and/or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.4%), 
respectively, are successful will the corresponding lower dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0.2%/0.006%) and/or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 2%), respectively, have inference made on the statistical 
test.

10.10 Safety Analysis 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ) terms and be presented in a data listing. Treatment emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , those 
that occur after the first dose of IP within each period , will be summarized by [CONTACT_608189] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within 
each SOC. Similar summaries will also be presented for TEAEs related to the IP and by [CONTACT_926]. 
When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever experience an event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the specific treatment period. AEs  will be reported separately by [CONTACT_6278].
 
  
 
 
Full details of the safety analyses will be specified in the formal SAP.

 10.11 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis may be provided when approximately 50% of the subjects have completed 
the study. If an interim analysis is completed, O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function will be 
used to specify the interim boundaries for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_608168]- binding futility as 
well as adjusting the final 2 -sided alpha level.  
10.12 Missing Data 
Sensitivity analysis on the primary efficacy variable will be performed on both the PP and ITT 
imputing missing data as failures; additional sensitivity analyses such as pattern mixture model 
multiple imputation methodologies and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_608169]. 
10.13 Adjustment for Multiplicity  
For the primary hypotheses, the study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses, H
01 or H02, are rejected in favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or 
H12. The overall Type I error of the 2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of 
Bonferroni correction procedures testing each hypothesis at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
Again as detailed in the hypothesis section, only if the higher dose concentrations, for CSF-1 
(0.4%/0.006%) and/or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0.4%), respectively, are succes sful will the corresponding 
lower dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0. 2%/0.006%) and/or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (0. 2%), respectively, 
have inference made on the statistical test.  Within these hierarchical frameworks, these 
hypotheses can be tested at a 2 -sided alpha = 0 .05 while still preserving an overall Type I error 
of alpha = 0.10. 
There will be no adjustment for multiplicity for testing of secondary endpoints.

Phase:  2/3
Study Objective(s): 
To evaluate the safety andtolerability of the following doses and dose regimens of AGN-241689 (10 -mg once 
daily [QD], 30-mg QD, 30 -mg twice daily [ BID], 60-mgQD,and 60-mg BIDforthe prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_41989].
To characterize the dose/response relationship across the follow ing doses and dose regimens (10-mg QD, 
30-mg QD, 30 -mg BID, 60 -mg QD, and 60 -mg BID) for the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
To prospectively test for superiority of the following doses and dose regimens of AGN -241689 (10 -mg QD, 
30-mg QD, 30 -mg BID, 60 -mg QD, and 60 -mg BID) versus placebo for the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_613113].
Clinical Hypotheses:  In individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564] m igraine, at least one active treatment arm, 60 mg QD or 60 
mg BID is superior to placebo as measured by [CONTACT_613128]/probable 
migraine (MPM) headache days across the 12-week treatment period .
AGN-241689has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
Study Design
Structure:  Multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study
Duration:  The study will consist of a [ADDRESS_812839] : AGN-24168910-mg tablets , AGN-24168930-mg tablets , AGN-24168960- mg tablets . 
Investigational product will be over -encapsulated to maintain the blind.
Control:  AGN-241689placebotablets. Placebo tablets w ill be over -encapsulated to maintain the blind.
Dosage/Dose Regimen :  10-mg AGN-241689 QD, 30-mg AGN-241689QD, 60-mg AGN-241689QD, 30-mg 
AGN-241689BID, and 60-mg AGN-241689BID will be administered for 12 weeks duration
Randomization/Stratification :  Patients will be randomized to the following 6 arms  in a 2:1:2: 1:2:1 ratio:
Placebo (n =180)
AGN-241689 10- mgQD (n=90)
AGN-241689 30- mg QD (n=180)
AGN-241689 30- mg BID (n=90)
AGN-241689 60- mg QD (n=180)
AGN-241689 60- mg BID  (n=90)
To maintain the blind, investigational product will beover-encapsulated and administered orally for 12 weeks to 
all patients. Patients, therefore, w ill receive eith er placebo twice daily, a morning dose of AGN-241689with an 
evening dose of placebo, or AGN -241689twice daily.  
No stratification will be performed.

General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses:   All safety analyses will be performed using th e safety 
population, consisting of all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment.  For safety analyses, 
the patients will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received at the first study treatment visit(rather 
than as randomi zed).  All efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population, consisting of all randomized patients who received at least [ADDRESS_812840] -baseline 4 -week (Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, and 
9-12) of diary data.   For efficacy analyses, the patients will be analyzed according to randomization assignment, 
regardless of actual treatment received.
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in meanmonthly MPM headache days across the 12
-
week treatment period .  Comparisons between each dose group and placebo will be done by a mixed-effects 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) of the change from baseline .  The statistical mod el will include 
treatment group, visit and treatment group by [CONTACT_160415].  It w ill also include 
the baseline score and baseline
-by-visit interaction as covariates.  Pairwise contrasts in the MMRM model will 
be used to ma ke the pairwise comparisons of dose to placebo.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the 
primary endpoint to assess the robustness of the MMRM analysis to possible violation of the missing -at-random 
(MAR) assumption.  Th esensitivity analysis will be done using a pattern -mixture model (PMM) , under which 
data could be missing -not-at-random (MNAR), with repeated analyses combined via the multiple imputation 
(MI) procedure. An additional sensitivity, MIin conjunction w ith robust regression, will be performed in case 
of non-normality for the primary efficacy endpoint.     
Secondary efficacy endpoint s include:(1) Change from baseline in meanmonthly headache days across the 12-
week treatment period ; (2) Proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in meanmonthly MPM days 
across the 12-week treatment period ; (3) Change from baseline in meanmonthly acute medication use days 
across the 12-week treatment period . 
Summary tables for each treatment and for each measurement time will include the number of patients and 
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) and/or response frequencies.
For continuous variables, pairwise comparisons will be analyzed using MM RM.  For variables where data is 
binary, comparisons between treatment groups will be done by [CONTACT_613129] .
The overall type I error rate for multiple comparisons across a
ctive treatment doses and the primary and 
secondary efficacy parameters w ill be controlled at the 0.05 level using a graphical approach by [CONTACT_613130]
(2011). The weighting strategy of the multiple comparisons is designed to allocate initial alpha equally to the 
QD and BID dose regimen s. Within each dosing regimen, individual AGN-241689doses will be tested in a
hierarchical order from high to low  dose, i.e. for primary efficacy endpoint, low dose can be tested only if high 
dose comparison shows statistical significan ce. In addition, for a given dose comparison versus placebo , the 
strategy has the primary endpoint as gatekeeper to the secondary endpoints so that secondary endpoints can be 
tested only if primary hypothesis of the corresponding dose comparison reaches statistical significan ce. 
Weighted Bonferroni testswill be used for testing the hypotheses .A complete decision-flow graph and details 
of the graphical multiple comparison procedure will be presented in the statistical analysis plan of this study.
Sample Size Calculation :  
The assumptions and corresponding pow er assessments for the primary efficacy endpoint are shown in the table 
below. The treatment difference assumption is b ased on results from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_613115]:
the placebo -adjusted reduction in monthly migraine days ranged from 1.1 to 2 days (topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] [Silberstein et

161. Background and Clinical Rationale 
1.1Background
Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the [LOCATION_002] with peak prevalence 
occurring between the ages of [ADDRESS_812842] ( Liptonet al, 2005, Lipton et al, 2007 ). In the US alone, work loss due to 
migraine is estimated to cost ~ $13 billion annually( Hu et al, 1999). Prevalence is similar in 
Europe, with migraine headache affecting on average 17.6% of women and 8% of men 
(Stovner, 2010).It is curre ntly ranked by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) as 19th 
among causes of disability (Katsarava et al, 2012).
Migraine is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_502149], unilateral headache of moderate 
or severe pain int ensity, associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).  In about 25% of individuals, the migraine 
headache is preceded b y focal neurological d ysfunction (aura). I
mproving diagnosis and 
optimizing treatments for migraine have been recognized as critically  important to 
overcoming current barriers to reduc e the global burden of migraine.
Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history , 
exam, and the exclusi on of other headache disorders. Physicians appl y clinical criteria to 
guide diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) is a syndrome diagnosis 
applied to patients with migraine (with or without aura)who have 1- 14 headache day s per 
month. Chronic migraine (CM) is a specific ICHD-3 beta version diagnosis applied to a 
subset of patients with ≥15 headache day s per month (Katsarava et al ,2011; Olesen et al, 
2006; ICHD-3 betaversion, 2013).This study  will evaluate the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability  of AGN-241689 in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
1.2Overview of AGN-241689
AGN-241689is a potent, selective oral calcitonin gene-relatedpeptide (CGRP)receptor 
antagonist being developed for migraine prevention. CGRP is aneuropeptide implicated in
thepathophysiology ofmigraine. CGRPlevelsinthecranialvenous outflow (i.e, external 
jugular vein) areincreased during a migraine attack and exogenous lyadministered CGRP
hasbeenshown to triggermigraine-likeheadache in migraineurs. The majority(80to 90%)
oftrigeminal Aδfibersthatinnervate theduracontainCGRP, suggesting that thesefibers
may beinvolvedinsterileneurogenic inflammation andmigraine pain transmission.
Furthermore, the CGRP receptoris present on humanmeningeal andcerebralbloodvessels.  
Theseobservations suggestthatactivation of the trigeminovascular s ystem, with release of 
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment 2
17CGRP, mayplay a key roleinmigraine pathogenesis andthatinhibition ofCGRPmay yield
anoveltherapeutic approach totreating migraine.
Theability ofCGRPi[INVESTIGATOR_613116] (IV) formulation ofolcegepant (Olesen et al,
2004),andreplicated by [CONTACT_44873] & Co.,Incwithanoralformulation ofMK-0974
(telcagepant ), ahighlyselective CGRPreceptorantagonist (CGRPRA).  In phase 3
studies,telcagepant wassuperiorto placebointhe primary  endpoints of 2-hourpain
freedom, 2-hour pain relief, andthe absence of associated sy mptoms(photophobia,
phonophobia ,andnausea),aswellasthekeysecondaryendpointof 24-hour sustained pain
freedom(Connor, 2009).However, serum alanine aminotransferase (AL T) increases were 
observed with telcagepant
.  For this reason, the development of these oral CGRP  antagonists 
was stopped.
Recently, several phase [ADDRESS_812843] been published thatfurther establish proof -of-concept of 
CGRP as a therapeutic target in the prevention ofepi[INVESTIGATOR_33176] 
(DodickDW, Goadsby  [CONTACT_33263], Silberstein SD, et al ,2014; Bigal et al ,2015; Dodick DW, 
Goadsby [CONTACT_33263], Spi[INVESTIGATOR_229483] ,et al, 2014).  Specifically , TEV-[ZIP_CODE], LY-[ADDRESS_812844] thought to be involved 
in migraine pathophy siology. AGN-241689was chemically  designed to minimize the 
potential for reactive metabolites, thereb y reducing the risk of liver toxicity  that has been 
observed with telcagepant, and MK-3027.  An extensive Phase 1 program, including a 28 -
day multiple dose study  ofdoses up to 170 mg QD, has been c onducted to assess hepatic 
effects of AGN-241689. To date, no safety  signal in hepatic lab parameters has been 
observed in either preclinical or clinical studies conducted with AGN-241689.
The purpose of this stud y is to prospectively assess the safet y, tolerability and efficacy of 10-, 
30-and 60-mg once daily (QD)and 30-and 60-mg twice dail y (BID) doses of AGN-241689
compared with placebo in the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], in a randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2/3study.  This study is designed to be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], and 
will be used to support registration applications.
Additional information on non -clinical pharmacology , toxicology , and pharmacokinetic 
properties of AGN-241689 can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812845] to block capsaicin induced increases in dermal blood flow 
has been used as a pharmacod ynamic assay  to determine doses which inhibit peripheral 
CGRP function and estimate potential ly effective clinical doses in migraine (Hewitt et al ,
2011; Li et al, 2014) . Based on this model, doses of AGN-[ADDRESS_812846] the possibility  that a BID dosing regimen may  
provide better 24 -hour CGRP  inhibition than does a QD regimen. Based on these 
considerations, this study will investigate doses of AGN-241689 10 mg, 30 mg ,and 60mg 
QD and doses of 30 mg and 60 mg BID for 12 weeks.  
Prior testing in the P hase 1 program suggests that the range of doses tested will be well-
tolerated and safe in humans.  Dail y dosing of170 mg per day  was studied in healthy  
subjects for 28 day s; this waswell-tolerated with an unremarkable AE profile and no 
significant elevations of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed.  R esults 
from the 28 -day multiple dose study  and other Phase 1 studies support the safet y and 
tolerability  of the dose range tested in this protocol. 
2. Study Objectives and Clinical Hypotheses
2.1Study Objectives
To evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of the following doses and dose regimens o f 
AGN-241689 (10- mg QD, 30-mg QD, 30 -mg BID, 60-mg QD, and 60 -mg BID)for the 
prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730]. 
To characterize the dose/response relationship across the following doses and dose regimens 
(10 mg QD, 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID, 60 mg QD, and 60 mg BID) for the prevention of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
To prospectivel y test for supe riority of the following doses and dose regimens of 
AGN-241689 (10- mg QD, 30- mg QD, 30 -mg BID, 60- mg QD, and 60 -mg BID) versus 
placebo for the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_613117]
2.2Clinical Hypotheses
In individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], at least one active treatment arm, 60 mg QD or 60 mg 
BIDis superior to placebo as measured by  [CONTACT_613131] 12- week treatment period .
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment 2
19AGN-241689has an acceptable safet y profile and is well tolerated in patie nts with epi[INVESTIGATOR_41989].
3. Study Design
3.1Structure
This isa multi-center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study  
conducted at approximately  75 sites in the [LOCATION_002].   Approximately  810 patients will 
be randomized to one of six treatment arms (placebo, 10 -mg QD, 30-mg QD, 30-mg twice 
daily, 60-mg QD, and 60 -mg twice dail y) in a 2:1:2: 1:2:1 ratio as follows ::
oPlacebo (n =180)
oAGN-241689 10- mg QD (n=90)
oAGN-241689 30- mg QD (n=180)
oAGN-241689 30- mgBID (n=90)
oAGN-241689 60- mg QD (n=180)
oAGN-241689 60- mg BID  (n=90)
More patients will be allocated to the 30-mg QD and 60- mg QD arms to maximize the power 
to detect a difference from placebo in the primary endpoint.  Although fewer patients are 
allocated to the BID regimen arms and the [ADDRESS_812847] will be administered orally  twice dail y for 
12 weeks to all patients. Patients, therefore, will receive either placebo twice daily , a morning 
dose of AGN-241689with an evening dose of placebo, or AGN-241689twice daily.  
Patientparticipation will begin with a4-weekScreening/Baseline P eriod.  Patients who 
complete the 4 -week Screening/Baseline Period and meet all entry  criteria will be 
randomized to the double -blind treatment period of the study  at Visit 2 (random ization visit).  
The double -blind treatment period will last 12 weeks, with a subsequent Safety Follow-up 
Period of4 additional weeks. There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits:  Visit 1 
(Screening /Baseline), Visit 2 (Randomization), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 
(Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7/ET(Week 12), and V isit 8 (Safet y Follow-up). For details, 
please see Table1–1, Schedule of Visit and Procedures.
3.2Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy assessments will be based on information recorded by  [CONTACT_102].  An eDiarywill 
be used dail y at home to collect data on headache duration, headache characteristics, 
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812848] (D SMB) will be established to review 
unblinded safet y data and summary reports, identify  any safety issues and trends, and make 
recommendations to the Sponsor , including modification or early  termination of a trial, if 
emerging data show unexpected and clinically significant AEsof treatment. 

Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812849] operational procedures for data 
monitoring/review , frequency  of review , and other pertinent details will be provided in a 
separate D SMBCharter.

before the prohibited medication/treatment is administered.
4.4.3 Definition of Females of (Non -)Childbearing Potential and/or 
Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
For purposes of this study , females will be considered of childbearing potential unless they  
are naturall y postmenopausal (ie, no menses for 2 y ears) or permanently  sterilized (ie, 
bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y, bilateral oophorectom y,or hysterectom y).  
For women of childbearing potential who may  participate in the study , the following methods 
of contraception, if properly used, are generall y considered reliable: hormonal contraceptives
(ie, oral, patch, vaginal ring, injection, implant) , male condom with in travaginal spermicide, 
diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, vasectomized partner ,or 
sexual abstinence.
For males who may participate in the study , the following methods of contraception, if 
properly used, are generally  considered reliable: post-bilateral vasectomy , barrier 
contraception or sexual abstinence. Male participants must also refrain from donating
sperm during the course of the study .
The investigator and each patient will determine the appropriate method of contracepti on for 
the patient during the participation in the study .
If a female becomes pregnant during the stud y, the investigator will notify  Allergan
immediately after the pregnancy  is confirmed and the patient will be exited from the study  
after appropriate safety  follow-up.  The investigator will (1) notify the patient’ s physician 
that the patient was being treated with an investigational drug AGN-241689and (2) follow

5.3Methods for Masking/Blinding
All study treatments will be provided in identical blister cards to maintain masking of the 
study.
Over-encapsulation will also be implemented to maintain study  masking, and all patients will 
be instructed to take investigational product twice daily (one capsule in the morning and one 
capsule in the evening) at approx imately the same times each day .  Patients, therefore, will 
receive either placebo twice daily , a morning dose of AGN-241689with an evening dose of 
placebo, or AGN-241689twice daily .  
5.4Treatment Allocation Ratio and Stratification 
Patients will be rando mized to the following 6 arms  in a 2:1:2:

standing pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], temperature, body  weight, and height (at Visit 1 only), 
will be performed at every  visit. Sitting and standing BP and pulse rate will be determined as 
follows: BP  and pulse measurements will be performed after the patient sits quietly  for 
5minutes, followed by  a second set of measurements taken after the patient stands for at 
least 3minutes (but no longer than 1 0 minutes).
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment 2
376.4.5 Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the visits outlined in Table1–1. A 
professionall y trained physician or healthcare professional licensed to performed physical 
examinations wi ll examine the patient for an y detectable abnormalities of the following bod y 
systems:  general appearance; neck (including thyroid); head, ey es, ears, nose, and throat; 
lungs; heart/cardiovascular; abdomen; neurologic; extremities; back; musculoskeletal; 
lymphatic; skin; and other . The neurologic examination should be conducted to detect the 
presence of an y significant sensory /motorabnormalities.
6.4.6 Electrocardiograms
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at the visits outlined in Table1–1. All ECGs should be 
performed after the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_812859]. The overall interpretation of the clinical significance of the ECG will 
be determined b y the investigator and recorded in the patient’ s eCRF.
6.4.7 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The C-SSRS is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severit y of both suicidal ideation 
and behavior . Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5 -item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 
2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not 
plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without 
specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). The C -SSRS also 
captures information about the intensity  of ideation, specifically the frequency , duration, 
controllability , deterrents, and reasons for the most severe t ypes of ideation. Suicidal 
behavior is classified on a 5 -item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 (preparatory  acts or 
behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt). More than 
1classification can be selected provided they  represent separate epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. For actual attempts 
only, the actual or potential lethality  is classified for the initial, most lethal, and most recent 
attempts. The C-SSRS will be completed at all study  visits. At Visit 1(Screening) the 
C-SSRS will be completed for the patient’ s lifetime history  of suicidal ideation and behavior . 
At all other visits the C -SSRS will be completed for ideation and behavior since the previous 
visit. The C-SSRS will be completed on the eTabletby [CONTACT_613134]. A patient should not be released 
from the study  center until the results of C -SSRS are r eviewed and it is confirmed that the 
patient is not considered to be at risk.

6.6Summary of Methods of Data Collection
An IWRS will be used to randomize patients and manage investigational product inventory . 
All office visit data (ie, non- diary data) for this study  will be collected by  [CONTACT_287444] 
(eg, questionnaires for patient reported outcomes) or eCRFs via an electronic data capture 
system. Source documents will be used at the sites and may  include a patient’ s medical 
record, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, the investigator ’s patient study  files, as wel l as the 
results of diagnostic tests such as laboratory  tests, ECGs, etc. A centralized clinical 
laboratory  will be used for the anal ysis of all blood and urine samples , and for ECG 
assessments . Additional information on the collection and handling of samples is detailed in 
the Lab Procedure Manual.
Patients will use an eDiary dail y to record the daily total duration of headache, headache 
characteristics, associated sy mptoms, the worst pain severity , and acute medication use both 
in the Screening/Baseline P eriod and double -blind treatment period until Visit 8.  Training for 
the eDiary  will be provided for qualified patients during the Screening/Baseline visit 
(Visit1).
7. Statistical Pr ocedures
7.1Analysis Populations
All safety analyses will be performed using t he safety population, consisting of all patients 
who received at least one dose of the study  treatment.  For safet y data analyses, the patients 
will be anal yzed according to actual treatment received (rather than as randomized).  The 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all randomized patients. All efficacy analyses 
will be performed using the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population, consisting of all 
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812860]- baseline 4- week (Weeks 1-4, 
5-8, and 9-12) of diary  data.  For efficacy  data analy ses, the patients will be anal yzed 
according to randomization assignment, regardless of actual treatment received.
7.2Collection and Derivation of Primary and Secondary Efficacy 
Assessments
For analy sis purposes, four weeks (28 day s) will be considered as one month. On a daily 
basis during the 28-day  baseline period and throughout the double -blind treatment period, 
patients are to record into an eDiaryinformation on the daily total duration of headache, 
headache specific characteristics and s ymptoms,the worst pain severity ,and use of an y acute 
headache pain medication.  Patients will be able to report headache data, including absence 
of headache, for the day  of the diary  report and for the day  immediatel y prior to the day  of 
the diary report, as long as information reported is for a time subsequent to the patient’ s most 
recent report.  This is defined as a one -day “missing -recall” window .  
Following randomization on Day  1, there are 4 visits at 2 -week intervals, followed by  2 visits 
at 4-week intervals; altogether encompass ing a 12-week double -blind treatment phase of the 
study and a 4-week safety  follow-up phase. In practice, there may  or may not be exact 2 -
week or 4 -week durations between two consecutive visits and the visits might not align with 
each 28-day period recorde d in the eDiary  (ie, weeks 1 -4, 5-8 and 9-12, corresponding to 
days 1-28, 29-56 and 57- 84).  Therefore, for data anal ysis purposes, the number of 
migraine/probable migraine headache day sduring the first 28 day s of the baseline phase, 
starting with the day of the screening visit, will serve as the “baseline”, and change from 
baseline will be calculated for consecutive [ADDRESS_812861] 20 day s (including missing recall) during the 28- day 
baseline period.  If less than 28 day s of baseline data are reported, the number of headache 
days and other such counting variables for “baseline” will be prorated to standardiz e the 
count to a 28 -day equivalent.  Subsequent to treatment start, the number of headache day s 
will be counted in successive and non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 4 -week (ie, 28 -day) windows.  Headaches 
that continue into a subsequent 4 -week period will be counted (with re corded severit y and 
duration) as occurring in each period.  
If any diary window for a patient has at least 12 but less than 28 day s of reported data, the 
prorated approach will be used.  If a patient reports less than 12days of headache data, the 
patient’s observed countsin that particular [ADDRESS_812862] 28 day s of the screening/baseline period, starting with the day  of the 
screening visit.   
7.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables
The 3secondary  efficacy variables include:
Change from baseline in mean monthly  headache day s across the 
12-week treatment 
period
.
Proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly  MPMheadache 
days across the 12-week treatment period .

Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812863] than placebo.  
The primary  comparison between treatment groups will be done by  a mixed-effects model for 
repeatedmeasures (MMRM) of the change from baseline.  The statistical model will include 
treatment group, visit and treatment group b y visit interaction as categorical fixed ef fects.  It 
will also include the baseline score and baseline -by-visit interaction as covariates.  Pairwise 
contrasts in the MMRMmodelwill be used to make the pairwise comparisons of each dose 
to placebo . 
  

Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment 2
42Asensitivity  analysis will be performed on the primary  endpoint to assess the robustness of 
the MMRM analy sis to possible violation of the missing -at-random (MAR) assumption.  The
sensitivity  analysis will be done using a pattern- mixture model (PMM), under which data 
could be missing -not-at-random (MNAR), with repeated anal yses combined via the 
reference-based multiple imputation (MI) procedure. An additional sensitivity , MIin 
conjunction with robust regression, will be performed in case of non -normality  for the 
primary efficacy endpoint.      
7.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary  efficacy variables are identified in rank order in Section 7.2.2.  The overall
type I error rate for multiple comparisons across active treatment doses and the primary  and 
secondary  efficacy parameters will be controlled at the 0.05 level using a graphical app roach 
by [CONTACT_613130] (2011).  The weighting strategy of the multiple comparisons is designed to 
allocate initial alpha equally  to the QD and BID dose regimens . Within each dosingregimen, 
individual AGN-241689doses will be tested in a hierarchical order from high to low dose, 
i.e. for primary  efficacy endpoint, low dose can be tested only
 if high dose comparison shows 
statistical significance. In addition, for a given dose comparison versus placebo, the strate gy 
has the primary  endpoint as gatekeeper to the secondary  endpoints so that secondary  
endpoints can be tested only  if primary  hypothesis of the corresponding dose comparison 
reaches statistical significance. Weighted Bonferroni tests will be used for test ing the 
hypotheses.A complete decision- flow graph and details of the graphical multiple comparison 
procedure will be presented in the statistical anal ysis plan of this study .
For continuous variables, pairwise comparisons will be anal yzed using MMRM , with
baseline covariate .  For variables where data is binary , comparisons between treatment 
groups will be done b y pairwise contrasts usinglogistic regressions for variables with only  
one postbaseline assessment or using generalized linear mixed model for var iables with 
multiple postbaseline assessments.

52Patients may  voluntaril y withdraw from the stud y at any time. Notification of earl y patient 
discontinuation from the study  and the reason for discontinuation will be clearl y documented 
on the appropriate case report form. All randomized patients who prematurely  discontinue 
from the study , regardless of cause, should be seen for final study assessment s. The final 
assessment s will be defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled for V isit 7/Early 
Termination and Visit [ADDRESS_812867] dose of I P.
8.9Withdrawal Criteria
Women who become pregnant (Section 9.4) and patients who meet investigational product 
discontinuation criteria related to abnormal liver function tests (Section9.5) and advised not 
to be re-challenged will be withdrawn from the study and should refrain from taking 
investigational product. The patient should return to the clinic for earl y termination
procedures (V isit 7)and the Safet y Follow-up Visit 8. Patients who reply  with “yes” to 
questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section or “y es” to any  question in the suicidal 
behavior section of the C- SSRS at Visits [ADDRESS_812868] be withdrawn from the study and 
should receive appropriate follow -up as in routine clinical practice , including the Early 
Termination Visit 7and the Safet y Follow-Up Visit 8.
A patient with a condition and/or a situation that, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may  put the 
patientat significant risk, may  confound the study  results, or may  interfere significantl y with 
the patient's participation in the study  may be withdrawn from treatment.
8.10Withdrawal from Future Biomedical Research
A patient who initially  consents can withdraw th at consent at an y time and have his or her 
sample destro yed, including an y by-products of the sample whenever possible. If a patient 
withdraws consent, their phy sical sample will be destroy ed and no new health information 
identifying the patient will be ga thered after that date. However , once the genetic data is 
anonymized and placed into the biorepository  database after stud y database lock, the 
information cannot be withdrawn .
8.11Study Termination
The study  may be stopped at his/her study  site at any  time by [CONTACT_6962] .  Allergan 
may stop the study  (and/or the study site) for any reason, with appropriate notification.
9. Adverse Events
AEs occurring during the studywill be recorded on a n AEcase report form .  If AEs occur, 
the first concern will be the safety of the study participants.
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812869] a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AEcan therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  In addition, duringthe screening period, AEswill be assessed 
regardless of the administration of a pharmaceutical product .
Note:  AEsmust be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of 
whether or not the patienthas been administered study  drug.
Progression of treatment indication including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs 
or symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy  variables and assessed as unequivocall y 
associated with the disease p rogression and /or lack of efficacy , should NOT  be reported as 
AEsunless the disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the 
disease.
AEs will be assessed,documented , and recorded in the e CRFthroughout the study (ie, after 
informed consent has been obtained ).  At each visit, the investigator will begin by  [CONTACT_613137], non-directed question such as “ How have you been 
feeling since the la st visit?”  Directed questioning and examination wil l then be done as 
appropriate.  All reported AEs will be documented on the appropriate case report form.
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is a ny AEoccurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following outcomes: 
death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity , or a congenital anomaly /birth 
defect.Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227334] a SAEwhen, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  (See Section 9.3for procedures for reporting a n
SAE.)
Allergan considers all cancer adverse events as SAEs. In addition, Allergan considers an y 
abortion (spo ntaneous or nonspontaneous) as an SAE.
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment 2
54Pre-planned surgeries or procedures for pre -existing, known medical conditions for which a 
patientrequires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358174] a n SAE.
Any pre-planned surgery or procedure should be clearl y documented in the site source 
documents by  [CONTACT_358226]’s entry into the 
study.  If it has not been documented at the time of the patient ’s entry into the study , then it 
should be documented as a SAEand reported to Allergan.
9.1.[ADDRESS_812870] be completed using the following definitions as guidelines:
Mild Awareness of sign or s ymptom, but easily  tolerated.
Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe Incapacitating with inability  to work or do usual activity .
9.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug or Study Procedure
A determination will be made of the relationship (if an y) between an AEand the study  drug
or study procedure , as applicable .  A causal relationship is present if a determination is made 
that there is a reasonable possibility  that the AEmay have been caused by  [CONTACT_591219] .
9.2Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events
Any adverse event must be recorded on the appropr iate case report form.
All SAEs that are drug -related and unexpected (not listed as treatment -related in the current 
Investigator's Brochure) mustbe reported to the governing Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC)as required b ythe IRB/IEC, local 
regulations, and the governing health authorities.   Any adverse event that is marked ‘ongoing’  
at the exit visit must be followed- up as appropriate.
9.3Procedures for Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
Any SAEoccurring during the stud y period (beginning with informed consent) and for at 
least [ADDRESS_812871] be reported to Allergan (or Agent of Allergan) 
Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812872] supply 
the sponsor and the IRB/IEC with an y additional requested information (eg, autopsy  reports 
and discharge summaries ).
In the event of a nSAE, the investigator must:
1.Notify Allergan immediately  by [CONTACT_613138](contact [CONTACT_502172] 1 of the SAEform); phone numbers and relevant Allergan 
personnel contacts are also o n the front page of protocol and Study  Contacts Page.
2. Obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of 
the patient .
3.Provide Allergan with a complete, written description of the adverse event(s) on the 
SAEform describing the event chronologically , including an y treatment given (eg, 
medications administered, procedures performed) for the adverse event(s).  
Summarize rele vant clinical information about the event:  signs, s ymptoms, 
diagnosis, clinical course and relevant clinical laboratory  tests, etc.  Include any  
additional or alternative explanation(s) for the causality  which includes a statement as 
to whether the event was or was not related to the use of the investigational drug.

local regulations, and the governing health authorities.
9.4Exposure to Investigational Pr oductduring Pregnancy
Study center personnel must report every  pregnancy  from the time he or she signs the ICF for 
the trial until [ADDRESS_812873] on 
the Pregnancy  Form as 
soonas possible ( within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy  tothe SAE/pregnancy fax 
number, ) even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of 
male patients must also be reported. The pregnancy must be followed to term and the 
outcome reported b y completing a follow -up Pregnancy  Form. If, howev er, the pregnancy is 
associated with a SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), in addition to the 
Pregnancy  Form, a separate SAE Form must be filed as described in Section 
9.3with the 
appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated.

Allergan Confidential Protocol CGP -MD-01, Amendment [ADDRESS_812874] ≥ 3xULN is considered an Event of Clinical I nterest.  
Any patient with this lab oratory result after investigational product was taken must have 
repeat testing within [ADDRESS_812875] be drawn: hematology and chemistry  panels, international normalized 
ratio (INR), and a toxicology  screen for acetaminophen. In addition, the investigator will 
perform a complete history  and exam to evaluate for possible liver disease. 
All Events of Clinical I nterestmust be reported to Allergan using the AE of Interest form and 
submitted within [ADDRESS_812876] elevation ≥ [ADDRESS_812877] is confirmed and the patient meets any of the 
following criteria, close medical follow -up is required:
Patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3xULN and ≤[ADDRESS_812878] to possible liver disease (ie. No fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever , rash or eosinophilia (> 5%))
Patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3xULN and ≤[ADDRESS_812879] and(total bilirubin
<[ADDRESS_812880] and INR<1.5)
Patients who meet these criteria must be followed clinically  and further medical ev aluation 
will be done per the judgment of the investigator and in conjunction with medical personnel 
at Allergan. The Chemistry panel will be repeated 1 to 2 times per week to follow the course 
of ALT/AST elevation. An extra blood serology  sample mustbe collected and sent to the 
central laboratory  for further diagnostic testing at a later date if needed.
If an ALT or AST elevation ≥ [ADDRESS_812881] is confirmed and the patient meets any of the 
following criteria, close medical follow -up is also r equired:

93Section Revision Rationale
7.3.1 Primary Efficacy 
Analysesof migraine/probable migraine headache days per 4 
weeks, the primary measurement time is the 28 days 
ending with diary week 12, and the primary analysis 
is on the change from baseline .  Comparisons 
between each dose group and placebo will be done 
by a mixed- effects model for repeated m easures 
(MMRM) of the change from baseline.  The 
statistical model will include treatment group, visit 
and treatment group by [CONTACT_160473].  It will also include the 
baseline score and baseline -by-visit interaction as 
covariates.  Pairwise contrasts in the MMRM model 
will be used to make the pairwise c omparisons of 
dose to placebo. A sensitivity analysis will be 
performed on the primary endpoint to assess the 
robustness of the MMRM analysis to possible 
violation of the miss ing-at-random (MAR) 
assumption.  The sensitivity analysis will be done 
using a pattern -mixture model (PMM), under which 
data could be missing -not-at-random (MNAR), with 
repeated analyses combined via the multiple 
imputation procedure (MI). An additional 
sensitivity, multiple imputation in conjunction with 
robust regression, will be performed in case of non -
normality for the primary efficacy endpoint.      
Protocol Summary, 
General Statistical 
Methods Revise the secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
separately for the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe 
(EU) submissions. Secondary efficacy endpoints for 
the US include: (1) Change from baseline in mean 
monthly headache da ys across the 12-week 
treatment period Change from baseline in number of 
headache days to the last 28 days of the treatment 
period ending with week 12 ; (2) Proportion of 
patients with at least a 50% reduction in mean 
monthly MPM days across the 12-week treatment 
period migraine/probable migraine headache days in

Protocol Summary, 
General Statistical 
MethodsRevise the multiple comparisons procedure: 
The overall type I error rate for multiple 
comparisons across active treatment doses and the 
primary and four secondary efficacy parameters will 
be controlled at the 0.05 level using a graphical 
approach by [CONTACT_613130] ( 20112009).  The weighting 
strategy of the multiple comparisons is designed to 
allocate initial alpha equally to the QD and BID 
dose regimen s. Within each dosing regimen, 
individual AGN-241689 doses will be tested in a 
hierarchical order from high to low dose, i.e. for 
primary efficacy endpoint, low dose can be tested 
only if high dose comparison shows statistical 
significance. In addition, for a giv en dose 
comparisonversus placebo, the strategy has the 
primary endpoint as gatekeeper to the secondary 
endpoints so that secondary endpoints can be tested 
only if primary hypothesis of the corresponding 
dose comparison reaches statistical significance.   
allocates ¼ weight to each of 30 mg QD, 30 mg 
BID, 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID comparisons versus 
placebo for the primary hypothesis.  If any of those 
comparisons is rejected, 20% of the corresponding 
weight will be propagated to test 10 mg QD versus 
placebo for the primary hypothesis and 80% of the 
weight will be propagated to test the first secondary 
hypotheses in the corresponding dose versus 
placebo. Then for the comparison of each dose 
versus placebo, 100% of the weight will be 
propagated sequentially for t he remaining secondary 
endpoints. Finally, if for one of the doses efficacy 
can be shown for primary and all the secondary 
endpoints, the associated weight is passed on to 
other doses. This weighting strategy implies that the 
[ADDRESS_812915] results across different 
endpoints. A complete decision -flow graph and 
details of the graphical multiple comparison 
procedure will be presented in the statistical analysis 
plan of this study.

The assumptions and corresponding power 
assessments for the primary efficacy endpoint are 
shown in the table below(Note: the revised table is 
not included here) .The treatment difference 
assumption is based on results from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_613126]: the placebo -adjusted 
reduction in monthly migraine days ranged from 1.1 
to 2 days (topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] [ Silberstein et al. 2004 and

versus placebo and 30 mg or 60 mg BID versus 
placebo, respectively. The differences between 
treatment groups in the mean number of 
migraine/probable migraine headache days change 
from baseline at the primary timepoint (Week 12) is 
assumed to be 1.5 fo r the comparison of 30 mg or 
60 mg QD versus placebo (assumed equally 
effective for 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD), and be 1.75 
for the comparison of 30 mg or 60 mg BID versus 
placebo (assumed equally effective for 30 mg BID 
and 60 mg BID). With the allocated ¼ we ight, each

Secondary Efficacy 
AnalysesRevise this section: 
The secondary efficacy variables are identified in 
rank order for the US and EU, respectively, in 
Sections7.2.2 and 7.2.3.  Tocontrol the type 1 error 
rate for multiple secondary endpoints, a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_613127] (week 12) according to the rank 
order specified.  
Specifically, t The overall type I error rate for 
multiple comparisons across active treatment doses 
and the primary and secondary efficacy parameters 
will be controlled at the 0.05 level using a graphical 
approach by [CONTACT_613130]. (2011) .  The weighting 
strategy of the multiple comparisons is designed to 
allocate initial alpha equally to the QD and BID 
dose regimen. Within QD or BID dose regimen, 
AGN-241689doses will be tested in a hierarchical 
order from high to low dose, i.e. for primary 
efficacy endpoint, low dose can be tested only if 
high dose compariso n shows statistical significance. 
In addition, for a given dose comparing versus 
placebo, the strategy has the primary endpoint as 
gatekeeper to the secondary endpoints so that 
secondary endpoints can be tested only if primary 
hypothesis of the correspondi ng dose comparison 
reaches statistical significance. allocates ¼ weight to 
each of 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID, 60 mg QD and 60 
mg BID comparisons versus placebo for the primary 
hypothesis.  If any of those comparisons is rejected, 
20% of the corresponding weight w ill be propagated 
to test 10 mg QD versus placebo for the primary 
hypothesis and 80% of the weight will be 
propagated to test the first secondary hypotheses in 
the corresponding dose versus placebo. Then for the 
comparison of each dose versus placebo, 100% of 
the weight will be propagated sequentially for the 
remaining secondary endpoints. Finally, if for one 
of the doses efficacy can be shown for primary and 
all the secondary endpoints, the associated weight is

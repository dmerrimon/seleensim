Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Précis
We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic 
exercise for patients who have interstitial lung disease (ILD) uncomplicated by [CONTACT_554205]. Aerobic exercise training (AET) based rehabilitation has become a standard of care 
for patients with pulmonary diseases such as COPD. In an uncontrolled study, we have observed 
more efficient cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], increased physical work capacity, and improved health 
related quality of life (HRQoL), following AET, in patients who have ILD without pulmonary 
hypertension. We have also observed in a RCT, similar findings in patients who have pulmonary 
hypertension complicated by [CONTACT_554206]. Serious adverse events resulting from AET 
were not observed in these studies. Our work to date has established plausibility for the efficacy 
of AET and its safety for patients with ILD. A RCT is now needed to determine the efficacy of 
AET as a medically prescribed and supervised intervention in patients who have ILD. Our research 
team is uniquely qualified to undertake this research and is one of the few teams possessing the 
experience and background necessary for contributing to this novel, understudied, yet critical field 
of rehabilitation research.   
Subjects will be over the age of 21 years and living within a reasonable travel distance from the 
greater Washington D.C. area.  All tests will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and subjects 
will receive AET or a control regimen of patient education at either Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554147]. The staffs at both sites are well experienced in providing exercise therapy for 
patients with ILD. 
There will be two primary treatment conditions. Patients with ILD will be randomized to either an 
intervention consisting of AET plus patient education (AET+) or a control condition that includes 
patient education only (CON).  AET will consist of a 10-week regimen of supervised treadmill 
walking three times a week.  The duration of the exercise sessions will progress from 30 minutes 
to 45 minutes per session over the 10 weeks as tolerated.  The intensity of the exercise will be 
between 70 and 80% of the patient’s heart rate reserve. Those randomized to control will not 
engage in AET. There will, however, be a secondary study: a crossover design in which subjects 
in the CON group will subsequently complete the AET regimen.  
The primary outcome measure for our trial will be 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD).  
Secondary outcome variables will include treadmill cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554148] (tCPET) results 
with, pulmonary gas exchange, central circulatory function, and muscle oxygenation. A number 
of questionnaires will also be completed including: St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015], 
Fatigue Severity Scale, SF-36v2 Health Survey, Human Activity Profile, Profile of Mood States, 
and King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Health Status Questionnaire. All of this data will be 
obtained before and after the AET+ and CON regimens and in both of the secondary studies. 
AET is generally safe, inexpensive, and can easily be made available and accessible to almost 
everyone. It requires no approval by [CONTACT_554207] a medically 
prescribed and supervised intervention almost immediately following confirmation of its safety 
and efficacy. Six-minute walk distance is associated with improved HRQoL in patients with ILD 
and in specific subsets. Effective use of AET as a rehabilitative intervention could have a high 
degree of impact on personal and public health outcomes in this advanced lung disease subset.

Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Background
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the result of over 200 etiological pathways arising from several 
different insults to the lung parenchyma: inhaled substances, drug side effects, connective tissue 
disease, infection, and malignancy.1 The disease can also be of idiopathic origin. If prolonged, the 
resulting inflammation causes permanent and progressive fibrotic reorganization of the 
parenchyma and small airways, which reduces the distensibility of the lung and impedes O 2 and 
CO 2 exchange. 
In addition to diminished longevity, patients with ILD experience low physical work capacity 
(PWC).[ADDRESS_728245] (6MWT) is the most frequently used 
measure of PWC in patients with chronic lung diseases including both chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH).  6MWT distance is almost always 
reduced in patients who have ILD due to significant exertional dyspnea or increased fatigability. 
Du Bois and associates3 reported that in the subset of patients who have idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF), a 26-meter reduction in 6MWT distance over a 24 week period predicted decreased 
survival at 1-year and a 24-week decline of 50-meters or more predicted a 4-fold increase in the 
risk of death at 1-year.  
Aerobic exercise training (AET) is well known to improve cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554149],[ADDRESS_728246] suggested that outpatient AET may increase 
6MWT distance,18-22 reduce exertional dyspnea,19,21-24 and improve overall HRQoL19-21, 23,24 in 
patients with ILD. Two20,21 of the three prospective studies were small, randomized trials but only 
118 subjects were included in the interventional and control arms of all three of these studies 
combined. Similar findings were observed in a retrospective study of patients with ILD admitted 
for specialized inpatient AET rehabilitation25 and in a prospective study of outpatient AET in 
subjects referred for lung transplantation.26 
In our ongoing study of patients with PAH,5 patients were randomized to either a group receiving 
AET plus education (AET+) or education only (CON). We observed improved 6MWT distance 
and HRQoL following a 10-week, medically supervised, outpatient AET rehabilitation program.  
Significant improvements were not observed in the CON group over baseline. Many of these 
patients had PAH secondary to ILD.  We therefore initiated a parallel study in patients who have 
ILD without PAH. This study serves as preliminary work for the proposed RCT.
In this on-going preliminary study, we are using a prospective cohort design in which 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], physical performance, and HRQoL comparisons are made for data 
obtained before and after 10 weeks of AET compared to base line.  Subjects are free of ischemic 
heart disease; cor pulmonale; dilated, hypertrophic or non-idiopathic cardiomyopathy, and had 
normal ejection fraction and pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469]. None of the subjects have 
hepatic or renal failure; metastatic cancer with a life expectancy less than 6 months; history of 
disabling stroke; any severe psychiatric condition; active tobacco or substance use; uncontrolled 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 6
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021diabetes mellitus; any form of mitochondrial disease; pregnancy; or antiretroviral therapy.  
Additionally, subjects’ medical regimens are required to be stable for at least three months prior 
to participation in the study.  Subjects in the study are sedentary and have not participated in a 
routine aerobic exercise or pulmonary rehabilitation program that includes aerobic exercise for at 
least six months prior to their enrollment. All subjects receive a physical examination by a 
Rehabilitation Medicine Department physician prior to enrollment to verify the medical 
appropriateness of their participation, meeting the inclusion criteria, and the absence of exclusion 
criteria.  The study is being carried out in the RMD and at Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554150]. . NIH  Institutional Review Board will be the relying IRB for both sites. 
(NIH: 08-CC-0133; Inova: 08.129;) will be obtained before any recruitment of subjects or other 
study activity occurs.   
At enrollment, blood samples are obtained and subjects undergo baseline research testing, which 
includes tCPET, 6MWT, muscle oxygenation tests, measurement of cardiac output and 
questionnaires to assess their perception of fatigue, daily physical activity, and general HRQoL. 
Subjects then participate in 10-weeks of AET with face to face supervision for each session in an 
outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation center. Following AET, all of the research tests and 
questionnaires completed at baseline are repeated, and post-AET values of the outcome variables 
are compared and assessed for significant differences. 
Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554151]. Subjects whose arterial hemoglobin desaturates rapi[INVESTIGATOR_554152] a hyperoxic condition in which FIO 2 is maintained at 40%. The 
principal pulmonary gas exchange measures include oxygen consumption (VO 2) at volitional 
exhaustion, peak respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER), end tidal partial pressure of CO 2 and O 2 
(PETCO 2 and PETO 2), expi[INVESTIGATOR_554153] (Ve), tidal volume (Vt) and breathing frequency 
(ƒ).  We also use iterative methods of evaluating cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554154] (AT-time), time duration of tCPET to volitional 
exhaustion (tCPET-time), and determination of the time required to achieve one half of the peak 
VO 2 (VO 2-halftime). Heart rate is determined from continuous electrocardiography. Cardiac 
output (Qt) and stroke volume (Vs) are measured by [CONTACT_554208].  Measures of 
muscle oxygen extraction capacity include peak arteriovenous O 2 difference (a-vO 2peak) and 
hemoglobin saturation indices obtained by [CONTACT_554209]. 
Measures of PWC are peak work rate (WR) and 6MWT distance. Peak WR is calculated from 
treadmill speed and percent grade at peak exercise tCPET, and body weight. The 6MWT is 
performed on an 80-meter circular track according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic 
Society.27 
Several questionnaires are used to examine patient reported health-related quality of life, including 
the SF-36 Version 2 (SF-36v2), Profile of Mood State (POMS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and 
Human Activity Profile (HAP).  The SF-36v2 and POMS are multidimensional instruments that 
provide measures of fatigue severity and physical functioning in the overall context of health 
related quality of life. Specifically, fatigue severity is determined from the Vitality domain of the 
SF-36v2 and the Fatigue-Inertia scale from POMS, while physical activity is evaluated using the 
Physical Functioning domain of the SF-36v2 and the Vigor-Activity scales of POMS. One-
dimensional instruments, including the FSS and HAP, are also used to capture patient-reported 
fatigue severity and physical activity. 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 7
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021All subjects participate in an AET program comprised of treadmill walking for 30-45 minutes per 
session, 3 sessions per week, for 10 weeks.  A minimum of 24 out of the 30 possible AET sessions 
is required to maintain participation in the protocol.  Treadmill speed and grade are continuously 
adjusted to keep subjects’ heart rates as close as possible to a target zone corresponding to 70-80% 
of subjects’ heart rate reserves, determined from tCPET.  The target zone is determined using the 
method of Karvonen28 in which the resting heart rate is subtracted from the peak heart rate and 
multiplied by 0.[ADDRESS_728247] once again 
attained their respective target heart rate zones.  All subjects requiring supplemental oxygen during 
training are given an adequate flow rate to keep subjects’ SpO 2 ≥ 85%. 
Preliminary Results
Thirteen patients with ILD (Table 1) were studied. Participants had a variety of underlying causes 
of their ILD, but all were either [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Functional Classification 
(NYHA)/WHO Functional Class II or III and 38% required supplemental O 2. Overall attendance 
of the exercise sessions averaged 90% (Table 2). Five subjects spent less than 70% of the targeted 
30-45 minutes in their training heart rate zone, while 8 subjects spent 70% or more of the time in 
the zone (Table 2). No serious adverse events were reported during the aerobic exercise training 
intervention. No significant changes in subjects’ body weight (81.5 ± 16.4 vs. 81.1 ± 17.1 kg, p = 
0.200) or gastrocnemius skin fold (23 ± 11 vs. 21 ± 11 mm, p = 0.239) were observed during the 
study period.

Leighton Chan 07.12.2021A statistically significant increase in peak VO 2 was observed after training, but the increase was 
deemed to be too small to be clinically relevant.22,23,43-46  Resting HR and Qt were significantly 
reduced in the trained condition, however no other differences in resting cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554156] (Table 3). While values for peak Qt, stroke volume, and heart rate were similar; a-
vO2 was 16% higher in the trained condition which was statistically significant. Additionally, the 
change in amplitudes for [deoxy-Hb/Mb] and [diff-Hb/Mb] were increased without a significant

delivery and peripheral O 2 extraction.4  In our study of patients with ILD, peak VO 2 increased only 
by 4.6% after AET despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 16.3% increase in peak a-vO 2. An increase in peak Qt was not

Research Objectives:
The objectives of the work proposed are, in patients who have ILD, to:
1. Determine the safety and tolerability of exercise training in patients with ILD to determine 
appropriate pulmonary rehabilitation exercise guidelines.
2. Examine responses and adaptations to exercise at quantifiable target intensities that 
correspond to energy expenditure requirements.
3. Understand changes in the symptom limited exercise test results, using training-specific 
testing modalities.
4. Examine the effects of exercise training on physical activity functioning.  
5. Determine the relationships between patient’s ability to achieve and maintain an aerobic 
steady state and to sustain physical activity.
6. Determine the effect of aerobic exercise training on psychosocial and behavioral 
functioning and other HRQOL components.
7. Based on the progression in training volume, delineate the time course of improvement in 
work capacity across an aerobic exercise training program.
8. Explore the relationships among measures of aerobic metabolic function and potential 
mechanistic factors that may limit oxidative metabolism.
9. Examine the relationships among indices of aerobic metabolic function and the 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_554211].
To accomplish these objectives, we will perform a RCT comparing a 10-week, interventional 
regimen of AET plus patient education (AET+) to a control condition of patient education only 
(CON) that does not include AET.  A secondary study will also be conducted using a single  
“crossover” design in which the patients randomized to the control arm of the main study will 
receive AET after they are finished the 10-week education only regimen.

Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Our Specific Aims are:   
1. “Determination of the Influence of AET+ on PWC in Patients with ILD”. 
Specific Hypothesis:  AET+ will improve measures of PWC, including our main outcome 
variable 6MWT distance, and peak WR, as well as performance and perceived fatigability 
over controls. 
“Sub-study On Crossover:” After completing the education-only regimen and 
subsequently completing the AET regimen, improvements similar to AET+ will be 
observed in 6MWT distance, peak WR, and fatigability.

Specific Hypothesis: After AET+, significant increases in AT-time and muscle 
oxygenation will be observed over control. 
“Sub-study On Crossover:” After completing the education-only regimen and 
subsequently completing the AET regimen, improvements similar to AET+ will be 
observed in AT-time and muscle oxygenation capacity.
3. Determination of the Influence of AET on Patient-reported Measures of Fatigue, Physical 
Activity, and Other HRQoL Domains in Patients with ILD.”
Specific Hypothesis: After AET+, patients will report decreased fatigue severity measured 
by [CONTACT_554212], increased physical activity measured by [CONTACT_554213], and improvement in other HRQoL domains measured by [CONTACT_6016]. Georges 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_554160]-36v2 over control.
“Sub-study On Crossover:” After completing the education-only regimen and 
subsequently completing the AET regimen, improvements similar to AET+ will be 
observed in fatigue severity, physical activity and other HRQoL domains.  
4. “One-year Follow Up on Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Lung transplant, and Mortality.”
This is a descriptive analysis to examine health outcomes of frequency, length and severity 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], acceptance onto a lung transplant waiting list, and mortality occurring 
over the year after completion of the main study.

Leighton Chan 07.12.2021To qualify for participation, subjects will undergo physical evaluation by a credentialed member 
of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department’s medical staff to determine if they meet the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  At this time, subjects must answer “no” to the question “do you currently 
participate, or within the past six months have you regularly participated, in a structured exercise 
program greater than 30 minutes a day for 3 or more days a week.”  Subjects answering “no” to 
this question, and meeting other inclusion/exclusion criteria will then undergo an EKG and 
Doppler echocardiography to rule out pulmonary hypertension and right and left ventricular 
dysfunction. In addition, they will have pulmonary function testing with DLCO to rule out COPD 
and to assess lung diffusion capacity. Subjects will also undergo a blood draw for two tests:  Nt 
ProBNP and Complete Blood Cell Count with Differential.  Qualified participants will then receive 
the baseline research test battery, which includes 6MWT, tCPET with cardiac output and muscle 
oxygenation measurements, and questionnaires to measure patient-reported fatigue severity, 
physical activity, and other HRQoL domains. 
After completion of the baseline research test battery, subjects will be randomized to one of two 
groups. The randomization design will be a 2x2 block randomization in which subjects will be 
randomized in pairs.  The first subject will be assigned to either a control group that receives 10-
weeks of patient education lectures (1 day per week, 1 hour each lecture) with no AET or an 
intervention group participating in AET, 3 days per week for 10 weeks, in addition to the 
educational lectures (AET+). The second subject of the pair will be assigned to the opposite group. 
After completion of the AET+ or control regimens, subjects will undergo the follow up research 
test battery.  The follow up battery consists of echocardiogram, pulmonary function test, arterial 
occlusion muscle oxygenation test, 6MWT, tCPET, and questionnaires identical to those included 
in the battery at baseline. Subjects in the control group will subsequently participate in a 10-week 
AET regimen identical to AET+ except without the educational lectures, since participation in the 
lectures was completed as the control condition. A second identical, follow up test battery will be 
completed by [CONTACT_554215]. After completion of their 
AET+, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_554216], the frequency, 
length, and severity of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or acceptance to a lung transplant waiting list. Mortality 
will also be assessed at this time.
Specific Aim 1:  “Determination of the Influence of AET+ on PWC in Patients with ILD”. 
The main outcome variable for this project is 6MWT distance, which is the most frequently used 
measured of physical performance for evaluating patients with ILD and other advanced lung 
diseases. A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for 6MWT distance has been 
determined to be approximately 30 meters in ILD 2. Additional measures of PWC used in this study 
are peak WR on the tCPET, and performance and perceived fatigability as measured by a 
modification of the method used by [CONTACT_554217]. We will measure 
all 4 of these variables at baseline and after the AET+ and control regimens, as well as after the 
crossover regimen. We hypothesize that:
1.1.  An increase in 6MWT distance of at least 30 meters longer than control will be observed 
after AET+.
1.2.  A significant increase in peak WR will be observed after AET+ compared to control.
1.3.  A significant decrease in performance fatigability will be observed after AET+ compared 
to control.
1.4.  A significant decrease in perceived fatigability will be observed after AET+ compared to 
control.
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728255] including 6MWT, peak WR, and performance and 
perceived fatigability that are similar to AET+.
Specific Aim 2:  “Characterization of the Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554161].”  Measures of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554162]. Our measures of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554163]-time, 
and muscle oxygenation capacity. Neither of these physiological measures is influenced by 
[CONTACT_554218]. We will measure AT-time during tCPET and muscle oxygenation by [CONTACT_554219]+ and control regimens. We will also measure Qt, 
peak VO2, PETO2 and PETCO2 during tCPETs at baseline and after the AET+ and control 
regimens. We will measure all of the variables again after the group initially completing the control 
regimen completes the crossover AET regime. We hypothesize:
2.1.  After the AET+ regimen, AT-time will be significantly prolonged over controls.
2.2   After AET+, a significant increase in muscle oxygenation capacity will be observed over 
controls.
2.3   Qt, peak VO2, PETCO2 and PETO2 will remain unchanged following both AET+ and 
control regimens.
2.[ADDRESS_728256] including AT-time and muscle oxygenation that 
are similar to AET+.  We also hypothesize that Qt, peak VO2, PETO2 a PETCO2 will 
remain unchanged over baseline after AET.
Specific Aim 3:  “Determination of the Influence of AET on Patient-reported Measures of Fatigue, 
Physical Activity, and Other HRQoL Domains in Patients with ILD.” We will use the Fatigue 
Severity Scale (FSS) to assess fatigue severity, Human Activity Profile (HAP) to assess 
participation in physical activities, SF-36v2 to assess general HRQoL, Profile of Mood States 
(POMS) to assess changes in mood, and Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Health Status 
Questionnaire (K-BILD) to assess HRQoL specific to ILD.  We will also use the St. Georges 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_554164]. Subjects will answer the 
questionnaires before and after the AET+ and control regimens. Subjects in the group receiving 
the control regimen will again answer the questionnaires after completing the crossover AET 
regimen.  We hypothesize 
3.1. After AET+, fatigue severity will be diminished over control.
3.2. After AET+, participation in physical activity will be increased over control.
3.3. After AET+, overall mood will be increased over control.
3.[ADDRESS_728257] including fatigue severity, physical activity, mood 
state, and HRQoL that are similar to AET+.
Specific Aim 4:  “One-year Follow Up on Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Lung transplant, and Mortality.” In this 
follow up sub-study, patients will be contact[CONTACT_554220]+ 
regarding frequency and type of exercise subjects have continued; number and nature of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; and the severity of their condition causing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Subjects’ acceptance onto transplants lists and patient mortality will also be 
determined. We will examine potential associations among these variables and our variables of 
interest to determine plausibility of relationships between study outcomes and clinical endpoints. 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 18
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Two corollary hypotheses will be examined: i) poor clinical outcomes are associated with the 
severity of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_88739], and ii) AET-induced improvements in these outcomes 
are associated with improvements in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554165]:  
The following tests will be performed to determine a subject’s eligibility for this study: 
Electrocardiogram:  All subjects will be screened for signs/symptoms of coronary artery disease, 
cardiomyopathy, or any other underlying cardiovascular diseases that may increase the subject’s 
risk of performing an exercise based intervention by [CONTACT_554221] a 12 lead 
electrocardiogram (EKG).  This will be performed in the National Institutes of Health 
Electrocardiography Laboratory prior to the subject’s inclusion in the study.  Subjects will be 
required to lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_554166] [ADDRESS_728258]’s chest 
and then connected to an electrocardiogram by [CONTACT_554222].  A cardiologist will interpret 
all electrocardiograms prior to the performance of any exercise testing.
Blood Draw:  Patients will undergo a blood draw in the National Institutes of Health Phlebotomy 
Laboratory or the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine.  Two tests will be run with 
approximately [ADDRESS_728259] blood draw technique.  1) Nt ProBNP: 
N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide assays will be performed before and after the intervention 
period to objectively monitor for potential myocardial damage.  Recent data suggests that high 
levels of NT-proBNP indicate acute heart failure.  As studies have not yet demonstrated the safety 
of exercise in patients with ILD, this assay may be informative.  This test is used as a standard of 
care in many emergency departments when patients exhibit symptoms of heart failure such as 
shortness of breath and fatigue. 2) Complete Blood Count with Differential:  Using the same 
sample of blood we will perform a test to separate the red blood cells, white blood cells and 
platelets from the plasma which will help us learn more about the oxygen carrying capacity the 
blood.   3) Glucose (diabetic subjects only):  [ADDRESS_728260]’s glucometer to be used before and after NIH testing and training sessions. 
Pregnancy Testing:  Female patients of childbearing potential will undergo urine dip stick 
pregnancy testing at the National Institutes of Health Phlebotomy Laboratory during baseline 
testing following blood draw.  Follow-up pregnancy tests will be performed at subsequent testing 
visits to the National Institutes of Health.  In order for a patient to be enrolled or continue with this 
study, this test must be negative.  
Echocardiogram:  Cardiac echo is required for this protocol.  Subjects must be without a pulmonary 
hypertension (PH) diagnosis and have an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 
≥50%.  To evaluate both of these measures, all subjects will be required to undergo a Doppler 
echocardiogram prior to inclusion in the study.  This may be performed at the National Institutes 
of Health Echocardiogram Laboratory.  A transducer placed on the subject’s chest will allow us to 
measure the subject’s right ventricular size/thickness and systolic pressure.  1) PH causes a 
retrograde flow of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the right ventricle which, when chronic, 
results in ventricular remodeling, increasing the size and thickness of the myocardium, thus 
increasing the chronic RV systolic pressure.  To determine the probability of pulmonary 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 19
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021hypertension we will use the guidelines as presented in the 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.  These guidelines suggest using tricuspid 
regurgitation velocity (TRV) at rest and the presence of additional pre-specified echocardiographic 
variables suggestive of PH.  The probability of PH may then be judged as low, intermediate, or 
high (Table A).  Echocardiographic ‘PH signs’ used in addition to criteria based on TRV provide 
an assessment of the RV size and pressure overload, the pattern of blood flow velocity out of the 
RV, the diameter of the PA and an estimate of RAP (Table B).   Based on echocardiogram 
interpretation, the patient will be admitted to the study if the probability of pulmonary hypertension 
is low or intermediate 57.

Leighton Chan 07.12.[ZIP_CODE])  LVEF will be estimated through echocardiogram volumetric measurements of the left ventricle.  
Placing the transducer over the subject’s left ventricle allows for the measurement of the chamber’s 
size in end -systolic and end-diastolic states thus giving an estimation of LVEF by [CONTACT_554223].  Subjects in this protocol will be required to have an estimated LVEF of ≥50%, 
because a decreased LVEF will increase the risk of exercise testing/training in this study 
population.  Additional follow-up echocardiograms will be performed following completion of the 
exercise training for the AET group and following both the education phase and exercise training 
phase for the ED-only group. 
Pulmonary Function Test:  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV), 
and Diffusion Capacity (DLCO) tests will be assessed for all subjects.  These tests will be 
performed at the National Institutes of Health Pulmonary Function Laboratory prior to inclusion 
in the study.  FVC is used to evaluate the degree of obstructive and restrictive lung disease.  MVV 
is used to evaluate the subject’s ventilatory limitation.  Both tests will be obtained while the subject 
is at rest.  We will determine whether subjects’ exercise capacity is limited by [CONTACT_554224][INVESTIGATOR_554153] (Ve) measured at maximum exercise and 
MVV (Ve / MVV must be 0.90 or greater).  To perform the FVC and the MVV test the subject 
will be instructed to stand, plug their nose with their free hand (or wear a nose clip) and create an 
airtight seal over the mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  For the FVC, the subject will be asked to take in three regular 
breathes, followed by a deep inhalation and a quick and complete exhalation, blowing air until 
there is nothing left to expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312].  This test will be performed 2-[ADDRESS_728262] results are within 5% of each other.  For the MVV, the subject will be asked to

required to inhale air containing a small amount of carbon monoxide and then exhale rapi[INVESTIGATOR_470830] 
[ADDRESS_728264]’s diffusion capacity.  Additional 
follow-up pulmonary function tests will be performed following completion of the exercise 
training for the AET group and following both the education phase and exercise training phase for 
the control group.
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728265] will undergo 
the following tests: 
Six-minute Walk (6MWT) and Fatigability Tests:  Subjects will rest in a seated position for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_728266] using a portable pulse oximeter.  Oxygen 
saturation, pulse rate, rating of perceived dyspnea, rating of 
perceived exertion will be recorded upon completion of each 
lap of the walking course. Distance covered will be recorded 
at 1.5 minutes and the end of 6 minutes. The 
Fatigue/Fatigability Scale30 will be completed before the test 
begins and immediately after. Immediately upon completion 
of the six minutes the subject will be asked to stop and immediate post-exercise pulse rate and 
oxygen saturation will be recorded.  The subject will then be asked to rest in a seated position and 
pulse rate will be recorded during each minute of recovery for a total of ten minutes to evaluate 
the subject’s ability to recover from intense activity.  Supplemental oxygen will be provided for 
those patients that require supplemental oxygen while exercising and/or resting.  Those subjects 
requiring supplemental oxygen will be provided supplemental oxygen with the same delivery 
device and flow pre/post intervention to maintain consistency.  The target endpoint for this test is 
the completion of the six minutes of walking however symptomatic endpoints for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_554168].  Additionally 
should any subject’s oxygen saturation desaturate to ≤80% the patient will be required to stop 
walking at this point with or without the presence of symptoms of severe dyspnea. The patient will 
rest, while the timer continues to run, until oxygen saturation returns to baseline values or above 
90% at which point the patient will resume walking again.  The main outcome variable for this 
project is the change in 6MWT distance from before to after the AET+ and control regimens.  The 
performance fatigability index will be calculated as the ratio of the 1.5-minute walking speed to 
the walking speed calculated over the entire [ADDRESS_728267] rating 
their feeling of tiredness prior to the 6MWT and measuring the change in tiredness after the 
6MWT.  The change in tiredness divided by [CONTACT_554226].30 
Blood glucose of diabetic patients will be monitored before and after testing, and as clinical 
necessary.  Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_554227]’s own 
glucometer.  In order to use patient’s own glucometer, it must first be validated for accuracy 
through the NIH Department of Laboratory Medicine.  

14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728268] (tCPET):  Subjects will complete a tCPET using the 
standard modification of the Naughton protocol for individuals with low oxidative capacity.31-[ADDRESS_728269] methods, and we are well 
experienced in treadmill testing in this patient subset.  Treadmill walking is also task specific to 
the exercise training protocol and similar to the 6MWT.  Supplemental oxygen will be provided 
through a Rudolph valve using a Douglas reservoir bag and high flow regulator for those patients 
that require supplemental oxygen while exercising and/or resting.  Those subjects requiring 
supplemental oxygen will be provided supplemental oxygen with the same delivery device and 
flow pre/post intervention to maintain consistency.  
Primary data obtained from the symptom limited treadmill exercise tests includes VO 2 from 
pulmonary gas exchange analysis, heart rate (HR) from EKG, cardiac output from bioelectrical 
impedance cardiography (ZCG), and muscle oxygenation from near infrared spectroscopy (NIR). 
Additional supporting data will also be available from these devices.  Infrared pulse oximetry and 
blood pressure will also be monitored during the treadmill tests. Data from the pulmonary analysis 
system, EKG, ZCG, and NIR will be collected continuously throughout the tests.  This is a 
symptom-limited test in which the target stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_554169], defined as the 
subject’s expressed desire to stop despi[INVESTIGATOR_554170].  Other 
symptomatic endpoints for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_554171].  Additionally should any subject’s oxygen saturation desaturate to ≤80% the 
test will be terminated at this point with or without the presence of symptoms of severe dyspnea.   
Blood glucose of diabetic patients will be monitored before and after testing, and as clinical 
necessary.  Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_554228]’s 
own glucometer.  In order to use patient’s own glucometer, it must first be validated for accuracy 
through the NIH Department of Laboratory Medicine.  
Pulmonary Gas Exchange Analysis:  Pulmonary gas analyses will be performed using 
computerized system including rapid response oxygen and carbon dioxide analyzers, and a 
pneumotachometer interfaced with a microprocessor will be used for measurement of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554172]. Subjects will interface the system using a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_554173] a plastic pneumotachometer.  A plastic tube connects the pnemotachometer to 
the gas analysis system. When using a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], subjects will also wear a nose clip to prevent 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_554174].  Gas exchange variables measured during the tests 
will be measured continuously, on a breath-by-breath basis. Data reduction methods may utilize 
numbers bin or serial rolling averages.  The dependent variable of interest obtained from gas 
analyses is VO 2. VO 2 will be determined from the Haldane equation.  Volume of expi[INVESTIGATOR_554175] (VCO 2) will also be measured and used in the calculation RER, where RER = VCO 2/VO 2.  
Attainment of an RER of at least 1.10 is one of criteria indicating that oxidative metabolism is 
approaching a physiologically maximum level at volitional exhaustion34,35.
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 23
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Heart Rate Measurement:  Heart rate will be obtained from EKG recordings.  Electrodes will be 
placed on the subjects’ chests in the standard Mason-Likar exercise-testing configuration.  EKG 
will be monitored and recorded continuously throughout the maximum exercise test. 
Near Infrared Spectroscopy:  Muscle microcirculatory reactivity and muscle tissue oxygen 
extraction will be measured by [CONTACT_554229] (NIRS). Near Infrared 
(NIR) light is emitted into the muscle tissue at known distances from a sensor by a NIR emitting 
diode.  The amount of NIR light returning to a photo-sensing diode is measured and processed 
according to two wavelengths of the NIR spectrum, and the absorption and scattering coefficients 
of the medium are calculated. Oxygenated ([O2-Hb]) and de-oxygenated hemoglobin ([H-Hb]) 
concentrations are then determined as an interaction between their corresponding wavelengths and 
the amount of light that is collected by [CONTACT_554230].  These calculations are however influenced 
by [CONTACT_554231], which in this project may introduce 
some conservative bias.  In general, oxy and doxy hemoglobin and myoglobin dynamics tend to 
fluctuate in the same direction, often making the influence of myoglobin on the analysis 
superfluous.  Myoglobin concentration in muscle is small compared to hemoglobin and most 
accounts have indicated that the myoglobin signal accounts for less than 10% of the total NIR 
absorption, rendering its influence less confounding.  Spatially resolved measurements of total 
tissue hemoglobin, ([Tot-Hb], [O2-Hb] and [H-Hb] are absolute measures and desaturation rates 
are time constant based kinetic indices.  A single infrared transducer containing both infrared laser 
emitting diodes and frequency specific light sensors will be attached to the gastrocnemius muscle 
and worn by [CONTACT_554232].  The lasers are cool 
lights and will not be felt by [CONTACT_748].  Reports of burns or other tissue damage occurring with 
the use of these devices are not found. NIR measurements of muscle oxygenation will be made 
during tCPET as well as during an arterial occlusion test.  
Bioelectrical Impedance Plethysmography:  Measurements of cardiac output will be made using a 
bioelectrical impedance cardiograph (ZCG).  Silver/silver chloride electrodes are placed on the 
subjects’ chests at known distances and the electrocardiographically-gated rate of change in 
electrical conductance is measured. This produces a waveform that is the inverse of the pulse 
tracing obtained from Doppler ultrasound analyses.  The first derivative of the waveform is then 
used to estimate cardiac output.  This can occur because air in the lung provides no resistance to 
electrical current leaving impedance to vary only with changes in fluid volume.  Additional data 
accurately obtained by [CONTACT_554233]-ejection period, dz/dt, which is analogous to the dv/dt of 
the Doppler blood flow graph, the dz/dt second derivative, an index of cardiac inotropi[INVESTIGATOR_554176], and left ventricular ejection 
time.  Changes in total peripheral resistance can be determined when brachial artery blood pressure 
is measured (TPR= [1/3(SBP-DBP)+DBP]/cardiac output). 
Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxygenation Capacity Test:  NIR light source and receiving sensors 
will be placed on the belly of the dominant gastrocnemius muscle to record muscle oxygen-
hemoglobin flux.  A blood pressure cuff will be placed around the distal hamstrings of the 
dominant leg. Using a Hokanson® rapid inflation vascular testing system, the cuff will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_554177] a pressure that totally occludes blood flow into the gastrocnemius, typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 60 
and 80 mmHg above systolic pressure. The occlusion will be maintained for up to 10 minutes and 
tissue saturation will be measured over the time course. The tissue saturation index will be 
calculated as STI= [O2-Hb] / Tot-Hb. The rate of decline in STI will be the main muscle tissue 
saturation measure.

Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Health Related Quality of Life:  Overall, improvement in HRQOL is one of the primary goals of 
rehabilitation and a clear understanding of the relationships amongst HRQOL, exercise, and 
psychosocial health is essential in a clinical practice.  The proposed research addresses this 
information by [CONTACT_2329] a battery of quantitative, objective and subjective measures to examine 
physical activity and a range of psychosocial and behavioral patient characteristics.  Below is a list 
of the self-report tools that will be utilized in the proposed research.  Associations among these 
and the measured physiological data will also be examined to determine on the effect of aerobic 
exercise training on psychosocial and behavioral functioning and other HRQOL components. The 
tools to be used include:
St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] – Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Specific Version 
(SGRQ-I):  The SGRQ-I is an IPF specific version of the original SGRQ designed to measure 
and quantify health-related health status for patients with chronic airflow limitations.  It has 
been shown to correlate well with established measures of disability, disease level, and 
symptom level.36
Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS): The FSS can be used to monitor change in fatigue in response 
to therapeutic interventions. The Fatigue Severity Scale is composed of nine items with a 
seven-point response format.  Clinical improvements in fatigue were associated with 
reductions in scores on the FSS.  The FSS is also a practical measure due to its brevity and 
ease of administration and scoring.37
Human Activity Profile (HAP): The HAP was designed to measure activities of patients in 
rehabilitation programs.  It is a self-report measure of energy expenditure or physical fitness.  
The Human Activity Profile appears to be a useful indicator of physical activity levels in 
people with various neurological and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_14437], as well as in healthy older 
people.38
Short Form 36-Item Health Survey Version 2 (SF36v2):  The SF36v2 is widely used 
throughout the world as an instrument to measure general HRQOL. It assesses HRQOL in 
eight scales or domains. It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, 
disease, or treatment group.39
Profile of Mood States (POMS):  The Profile of Mood States (POMS) measures present 
mood state by a list of adjectives. POMS measures six dimensions of affect or mood, 
including tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-
inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. 40
King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Health Status Questionnaire (K-BILD):  The K-BILD 
is designed to measure health status in patients with interstitial lung disease through three 
domains (breathlessness and activities, chest symptoms, and psychological).  The 
questionnaire has 15 items in total.41    
Randomization: Once the subjects have completed baseline testing they will be randomized to one 
of the two conditions:  AET+ or CON.  We will use block randomization to keep groups as equal 
in number as possible and to avoid early filling of one of the groups. An independent randomizer 
(Diane Brandt, P.T., Ph.D., RMD, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_554178]) who is not affiliated 
with this study in any other way, will perform randomization of subjects. The AET+ and CON 
procedures will occur in the Clinical Center at The National Institutes of Health. The education 
regimen will be conducted at separate times for the AET+ and CON groups to avoid cross 
contamination.
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 25
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Educational Sessions:  The education portion is comprised of 13 separate lectures.  Subjects in 
the AET+ arm will receive 1-2 lectures per week as needed following their exercise session to 
fulfill the education requirement within 10 weeks.  Subjects in the CON arm will receive the 13 
lectures within the 10-week education period. Many classes will take more than one class session 
to cover the material.  For example, inhaler use/lung medications will require at least 2 sessions to 
cover.  
The lectures will include the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: 
Lung Anatomy/Physiology/Breathing Retraining
Lung Diseases and Medications Part 1
Lung Diseases and Medications Part 2
Oxygen Therapy/Sleep Disorders
Preventing Infection/Airway Clearance
Diagnostic Testing
Advance Care Planning/Energy Conversation 
Emotional/Social Well Being
Panic Control/Relaxation
Nutrition/Fall Prevention
Benefits of Exercise/Disease Management/Community Resources
Home Recommendations (excluding exercise recommendations)
Exercise Training:  The AET+ regimen will consist of [ADDRESS_728270] intervals until the total time of the exercise 
bouts equals the 30-45 minute total exercise time target.  The intensity of the exercise will be 
between 70 and 80% of the heart rate reserve, defined as 0.70 and 0.80 (maximum heart rate – 
resting heart rate) + resting heart rate, as determined during the baseline tCPET. Should the target 
heart rate range be considered insufficient (i.e. subject stopped the CPET prematurely due to 
dyspnea and/or O 2 saturation <80%, or subject achieved a higher heart rate on the 6MWT than on 
the CPET), an RPE of 4 to 6 can be used to progress exercise intensity. ECG monitoring will be 
used as appropriate to ensure proper RPE rating for the heart rate response in these subjects. The 
frequency of the sessions will be three times per week, unless make up sessions are needed in order 
to attend 80% or [ADDRESS_728271]’s oxygen saturation desaturate to ≤80% the patient will be 
required to stop walking at this point with or without the presence of symptoms of severe dyspnea.  
The patient will rest until oxygen saturation returns to baseline values or above 90% at which point 
the patient will resume walking again.  The session timer will be stopped during rest breaks and 
will only resume once the patient returns to their target heart rate zone.  Those patients requiring 
supplemental oxygen will continue to use their supplemental oxygen throughout the duration of 
exercise training.  Additionally those patients who previously did not require supplemental oxygen 
prior to exercise training but deteriorate to the point of requiring supplemental oxygen at any point 
during the training will be allowed to begin supplemental oxygen use based on their oxygen needs.  
However regardless of whether or not any changes were made to the patient’s supplemental oxygen 
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728272]-training 
exercise tests will be performed with the same oxygen device/flow used in the baseline testing to 
maintain consistency between tests.
Blood glucose of diabetic patients will be monitored before and after training, or as clinically 
appropriate.  If training at NIH CC, glucose monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_554234]’s own glucometer (if first validated for accuracy through the NIH 
Department of Laboratory Medicine).    If training at Inova Fairfax, blood glucose monitoring will 
be performed per Inova policy.
The locations for this intervention will be Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554179].    At NIH, the 
intervention will take place in the Clinical Center Fitness Center located in room 7-3551 on the 7th 
floor of the Clinical Center and will be led by [CONTACT_554235].  This room has three treadmills 
that are currently used for aerobic training of CC patients.

Monitoring Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal from the Study:  Subjects will be followed 
carefully during the study.  At the start of each study day, subjects will be asked whether they are 
experiencing any unusual symptoms, and vital signs will be measured (pulse rate, oxygen 
saturation, resting blood pressure).  All subjects will undergo EKG and echocardiography before 
and during the symptom limited exercise test.  We will monitor heart function in the rehabilitation 
medicine exercise lab during exercise, and stop the exercise if there are any signs of heart 
problems. 
Subjects enrolled who subsequently meet the exclusion criteria above at any time during the 
protocol will be excluded (off-study exclusion criteria). 
[CONTACT_554254], as the Principal Investigator, will make the decision to include or exclude

Analysis
Our statistical model for specific Aims 1-[ADDRESS_728279] between and within 
the AET+ and CON groups at baseline and post-intervention with a 2-way mixed model analysis 
of variance (2-way ANOVA). Should there be baseline differences in the specific variable of 
interest or in demographic characteristics, we will use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to 
control for the group equality, but the study will be powered under the assumption that no 
informative covariates are identified and using 6MWT as the primary outcome. 
In Specific Aim [ADDRESS_728280] the hypothesis that AET+ will improve scores on measures of PWC. 
The dependent variables for this Aim include total distance covered and fatigability index on the 
6MWT, and peak WR achieved on the tCPET.  6MWT distance is the primary outcome variable 
for this RCT and thus our project is powered on the sample size estimated to achieve a significant 
outcome on this variable (See Sample Size below).   
In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that after AET+, significant increases in AT-time 
and muscle oxygenation will be observed over CON.  The main dependent variables for this aim 
are AT-time and measures of muscle oxygenation which include [Tot-Hb], [O2-Hb], [H-Hb], and 
StO2 measured during tCPET and muscle arterial occlusion cuff tests.  Additional dependent 
variables will include Qt and its components HR and SV measured during tCPETs.  
In Specific Aim [ADDRESS_728281] the hypothesis that patients will report decreased fatigue severity, 
increased physical activity, and improvements in other HRQoL.  The dependent variable score for 
fatigue severity will be the Fatigue Severity Scale score.  The dependent variable score for physical 
activity will be the Human Activity Profile maximum and average scale scores, and the scores for 
HRQoL will be composite and domain scores for the SGRQ-I, SF-36v2, and K-BILD.    
In the crossover sub-study, we will determine if AET+ induces significant improvements in the 
variables of interest in the CON group.  For this analysis we will use repeated measures ANOVA’s 
to determine differences in the variables of interest among baseline, 10-week post control, and 2-
week post crossover AET data points.  Dependent variables will be those in each of the specific 
aims characterized above.
In Specific Aim 4, relationships between the post-study physiological variables and health 
outcome variables will be determined using Pearson product moment correlations and appropriate 
nonparametric procedures. 
In all of the analyses, statistical significance will be interpreted as the probability of making a 
type 1 error equal to or less than 5% (p<0.05).  
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 30
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Sample Size: 
The broad objective of the proposed work is based on identifying effects of exercise on, and 
relationships among, measures of physical work capacity, fatigability, oxidative metabolism, 
tissue oxygen extraction, and clinical outcomes.  The proposed study builds upon the PI’s 
preliminary study of the feasibility and safety of exercise treatment for patients with ILD in which 
the 6MWT was the primary improvement metric.  Many of the hypotheses proposed under this 
objective require measurement of variables not included in prior studies of the ILD population.  
Conversely, there are established standards for clinically relevant changes in the 6MWT and 
multiple studies of ILD patients with which to inform our sample size decisions and 6MWT is the 
primary outcome variable for the proposed study.  For these reasons we will power the study on 
6MWT. Specifically, changes in 6MWT distance between baseline and the second testing period 
are compared for ILD patients randomized to the AET+ and CON arms using a 2-way mixed model 
ANOVA.  From this, we have determined our goal is to recruit 60 patients with ILD (30 into each 
group) over the duration of this study, with details below. 
The prior information, assumptions, and calculation for the power analysis that was conducted are 
as follows.  An increase in 6MWT distance of [ADDRESS_728282] sizes in this range are associated with high-moderate to large 
differences.  
In order to translate the existing literature’s results into predictions of effect size of the 2-way 
mixed model ANOVA we will use as our primary statistical test, simulations were run in STATA.  
Simulations were drawn from normal distributions for each of control and exercise groups with 
equal mean and variance chosen as the average of the mean and variance observed in the control 
and exercise groups in Holland et al.[ADDRESS_728283] sizes are highly conservative.  With either correlation modestly above 0.40 
and 30 m improvement, correlation of 0.25 and 35 m improvement, or some point in between these 
two at a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_728284] a power above 80% at a significance 
level of 0.05.  Modestly higher improvement, in the range of 35-38 m, and correlation of 0.38-0.45 
will result in the study having a power of approximately 95%.  This range is compatible with the 
observed effect sizes in the literature in the moderate to large range, using Cohen’s conventions 
for effect sizes where these ranges are 0.25-0.[ADDRESS_728285] that 80 subjects may need to be consented and screened in order to achieve 60 
completed subjects. Therefore, the enrollment goal remains the same at 60 patients in total (30 in 
each group) over the course of the study as it ensures high power for comparison of 6MWT 
distance between AET+ and CON groups, with a buffer for moderate patient dropout.  However, 
recruitment will remain open until 30 subjects in each of the AET+ and CON cohorts have 
completed the entire protocol.  
Based on this recruitment goal we have agreed upon the following strategy to maintain an effective 
end power.  At which point we attain 45 completed subjects (total) an analysis of the standard 
deviations in 6MWD from pre to post will be determined in the control and intervention cohorts.  
To maintain the blinding controls of the study as much as possible, this analysis will be performed 
by [CONTACT_554238].  Based on this analysis our sample size will be adjusted thereafter to reflect 
a more accurate sample size needed to maintain an effective end power.  
Human Subject Research Protections (HSRP)
Subject Selection
Rationale:  Patients referred from the Baltimore/Washington/Northern Virginia area will be 
potential subjects for this study.  All subjects will be classified by [CONTACT_554239] (NYHA) in Class II or Class III, which relates symptoms of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_554186].   No participants will be excluded 
based on race, gender, or ethnicity.
Recruitment:  Subjects will be primarily recruited from the pool of subjects available at Inova 
Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Associate Investigators Drs. Nathan, Ahmad, Brown, Shlobin, and NIH 
Associate Investigators). 
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728286] presentations to ILD support groups and an 
introductory study letter for local private pulmonary practices.  We will also utilize NIH Clinical 
Center-sponsored digital media resources such as Twitter, Facebook, CC Radio, CC TV, Photo 
Gallery; databases such as NIH Search the Studies, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Research Match; and 
local newspapers such as the Washington Post to disseminate information about the study to 
potential participants and their healthcare providers.
Pre-screening at Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554187]. The 
NIH Associate Investigator and Study Coordinator will have physical access to the medical records 
of the Inova Advanced Lung Disease (ILD) Clinic and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Department 
referral patients for purposes of pre-screening Inova patients and patient referrals for this study.  
NIH investigators represent that (1) the use or disclosure of these records is solely to review PHI 
as necessary to aid study recruitment, (2) the PHI will not be removed from the covered entity 
(Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) in the course of review, and (3) the PHI for which use or access is 
requested is necessary for the research.
Pre-Screening Process in the Inova Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Clinic:
If NIH Associate Investigators are at Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554188]. Steven Nathan or his 
associates at the Inova Advanced Lung Disease (ALD) Clinic feel a patient would be a 
good candidate for enrollment into this study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, the NIH 
associate investigator will be introduced to the patient after a brief overview of the study.  
If the patient is interested, he or she will sign an Inova Authorization to Release and 
Disclose PHI form.   If the patient meets initial eligibility criteria, an appointment will be 
made for the patient to come to NIH for NIH consent and testing.
If the NIH Associate Investigator is not at the Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554189] a patient 
visit and [CONTACT_554255] or one of his associates at the Inova ALD Clinic feel a patient 
would be a good candidate for enrollment into the study based on the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, the ALD clinic research staff will introduce the patient to the study, and the 
research team will have the patient sign an Inova Authorization to Release and Disclose 
PHI form.   Once the form has been signed the NIH Investigator may contact [CONTACT_554240]-up. 
Pre-Screening Process in the Inova Pulmonary Rehabilitation Outpatient 
Department:
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728287] the patient by 
[CONTACT_554241].   The patient will be informed about the 
study and will be given the NIH Associate Investigator’s contact [CONTACT_554242].   The Inova Fairfax Pulmonary Rehabilitation registrar will state 
the following to the patient referral after beginning the process of registering the patient 
for pulmonary rehabilitation:
“You may be eligible for an NIH study examining the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation 
for patients with interstitial lung disease.  Would you like the contact [CONTACT_554243]?”
If the NIH Study Coordinator interviews a potential subject from any source the following 
script will be followed:
“Thank you for your interest regarding the research we are conducting to determine the benefits 
of a walking program for patients with interstitial lung disease.  We are accepting volunteers 
between the ages of [ADDRESS_728288] control over which group you are assigned to.  You will 
be put into a group by a process called “randomization” where you have a 50-50 chance of landing 
in either group.  Does this sound like something that you would like to participate in?”
If they answer “yes,” we ask if they have time to answer a short questionnaire that would allow us 
to evaluate their eligibility and safety for inclusion into the study.  (Please see Appendix 2 of the 
protocol to compare the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the questions we would be asking.)
If, based on this interaction, we think the subject might meet the inclusion criteria for the study, 
we will request medical records (recent history, medication list, pulmonary function test, resting 
EKG, six minute walk and echo) to further evaluate their eligibility for the study.  Potential 
participants can either send us their medical records or they can fill out a medical release document 
and we will request this information from their physician prior to their visit to NIH.  Their medical 
records will be reviewed and, if it appears that the patient meets the inclusion criteria, we will set 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 34
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021up an appointment for the patient to come to the NIH Clinical Center for consent and testing.  If, 
after obtaining a patient’s medical records it is clear that the patient does not meet inclusion 
criteria, the information may be used to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, these 
medical records will not be used for any research purposes.
To prepare for the visit, we will enter their personal information into the NIH Admissions Travel 
and Vouchers system and an NIH patient number will be assigned to them.  Upon arriving at the 
NIH, the patient will proceed through admissions and then consented to the study, followed by a 
history and physical, blood draw, ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, 
arterial occlusion muscle oxygenation capacity test, cardiopulmonary exercise test, questionnaires, 
and six minute walk test. 
Exclusions:
Exclusion of Children:  Individuals younger than [ADDRESS_728289] do not include establishing these 
normative reference ranges.  Moreover, far less is understood about advanced lung disease in 
children and the mechanisms by [CONTACT_554244]. This lack of information could introduce critical 
levels of bias into the interpretation and cause the interpretation of our results to be misleading.  
Exercise response and adaptation in children with advanced lung disease should be studied in 
separate and specific protocols.
Exclusion of Pregnant Women: 
 Women of childbearing age will undergo urine pregnancy testing during screening and follow-up 
visits and will be excluded from the study should results be positive.   Pregnant women will 
necessarily be excluded from the study for safety reasons.  Women who do not exercise before 
pregnancy should not begin a rigorous exercise during pregnancy and would not be able to achieve 
the target heart rate required as part of the testing and training.  
Exclusion of Those Who Are Unable to Obtain Informed Consent: 
 Individuals unable to give informed consent will necessarily be excluded from the study because 
of the risk to subject safety and the need to maintain integrity of the study.  Subjects must be able 
to comprehend and follow directions, and express their own needs adequately during all testing 
and retesting procedures, and exercise and educational training sessions.  
Benefits and Risks/Discomforts: 
 A previous study found that participation in an aerobic exercise training program improved 6MW 
distance, peak VO2, and resting pulmonary artery systolic pressure.  No less is expected for 
patients completing the proposed study.  In particular, 6MWD has been used as an endpoint in 
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728290], subjects diagnosed with severe Raynaud’s phenomenon will be 
excluded from participation in that test.  Otherwise, the risk of exercise in this population is similar 
as for other ILD patients.  These subjects were exercised safely with no adverse events in our 
previous study examining the benefits of exercise in patients with pulmonary hypertension.  
Included in that study were patients with ILD with connective tissue disorders who had Raynaud’s 
[56]. 
Subjects with uncomplicated diabetes will be monitored before and after exercise testing and 
training for glucose levels and glycemic responses to exercise.  Physical activity generally reduces 
glycemic levels and intense activity can cause transient blood glucose elevations in individuals 
with diabetes.  Thus, the risks of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are associated with exercise in 
individuals with diabetes.  The acute risks of exercise for individuals with diabetes must be 
weighed against the potential long-term benefits such as a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk 
and improved hemodynamic function.  In order to reduce risks and avoid the onset of diabetic 
symptoms during participation in the study, glucose monitoring will be performed per standard of 
care. 
Exercise is a very low risk intervention in this population.  The most serious risks for those 
participating in exercise are cardiovascular abnormalities. These risks are slight even in individuals 
with known coronary atherosclerosis during maximal exercise testing.  In studies that include 
known heart disease as well as patients in whom the presence of heart disease is unknown, 
morbidity and mortality during maximal exercise testing remains low at 0.0 to 8.3 per 100,000 and 
0.0 to 1.0 per 100,000 respectively[53-62]. Morbidity and mortality remain at similar lows for 
maximal exercise testing environments that are attended by a physician and those supervised by a 
physician but operated without physician attendance [54, 57, 60, 63, 64]. Exercising at sub-
maximal intensities carries with it even lower risk of adversity.  Therefore, we would consider a 
single study related death, myocardial infarction, or stroke to be a reason to consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_77474].  Should one of these unanticipated serious adverse events occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554190] 
14.-CC-0027- Version 13 36
Leighton Chan 07.12.2021Clinical Director, IRB, and our independent medical monitor within the time frame and according 
to the policies specified in the currently approved NIH OHSRP SOP  Policy 801 (“Reporting 
Research Events”).  Following the completion of the SAE review and the determination of the IRB 
we will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_554191].
To minimize risk and maximize safety, exercise tests and classes will be carried out in laboratories 
that are in clinical settings with immediate response backup at the NIH Clinical Center and Inova 
Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_554254], a physician board certified in 
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, will supervise the medical and safety aspects of the study 
and will be available should an emergent need arise.  If for any reason [CONTACT_299819] is not immediately 
available should an emergency arise then the RMD medically responsible physician of the day will 
be available to assist.  In addition, all subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_554245].  Subjects will be monitored during the exercise 
tests by [CONTACT_554246]. Subjects will be informed of the signs and symptoms of heart disease and 
questioned frequently during the test regarding the presence of symptoms of cardiovascular, 
neurological, or musculoskeletal conditions.  Subject’s oxygen saturation will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_554247].  Safety procedures will be rehearsed by [CONTACT_554248].  A fully equipped emergency response team 
will be readily available to respond to life threatening events.  The current response time is less 
than three minutes.  [CONTACT_299819] will be briefed frequently and routinely regarding all testing and 
training operations. As recommended by [CONTACT_554249], exercise will be overseen by [CONTACT_554250]43,44,46,54 for populations included in 
this study (non-cardiac disease).  Additional clinical consults, e.g, cardiology or pulmonology, 
along with laboratory testing may be performed in order to help ensure safety for exercise.    
Health risks during exercise are very small.   In fact may decrease the risk as we are doing intensive 
peak and submaximal exercise evaluations, performed under controlled and safe clinical 
conditions as well as other medical tests and examinations related to defining the seriousness of 
the patients’ conditions.  Improvement in aerobic capacity enables individuals to accomplish a 
given amount of activity or work at a lower percentage of maximum capacity and with less fatigue. 
Moreover, improvement of exercise tolerance generally increases quality of life by [CONTACT_554251].  It is anticipated that the potential 
benefits of participating in a program of aerobic exercise conditioning outweigh the minimal risks 
associated with exercise in this group of patients who have advanced lung disease. Thus, this 
protocol involves more than minimal risk to study patients, with the prospect of direct benefit to 
individual subjects.
Participants from Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Advanced Lung Disease Clinic will be identified and 
referred to the protocol by [CONTACT_554252].  the use and disclosure of 
patient medical records as an  “activity preparatory to research”, the NIH Associate Investigator 
and Study Coordinator may assist the Inova Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_554255], by 
[CONTACT_554253] (ILD) Clinic and Pulmonary 
Rehabilitation Department referral patients for purposes of pre-screening Inova patients and 
patient referrals for this study.  
Consenting:  NIH research staff will interview interested candidates.  Those deemed appropriate 
will both read and sign the NIH approved consent form.  A copy of the signed informed consent 
shall be given to the individual signing the consent and the original consent document will be 
14.-CC-0027- Version [ADDRESS_728291] will undergo a full examination 
by a physician, and a review of available medical records will be performed to confirm their 
suitability for the trial.  After this, they will begin the baseline research tests including: treadmill 
cardiopulmonary exercise test, arterial occlusion muscle oxygenation capacity test, pulmonary gas 
exchange analysis, heart rate measurement, bioelectrical impedance plethysmography, near 
infrared spectroscopy, six-minute walk and fatigability tests, and patient self-report instruments.  
All tests will be performed again post rehabilitation for outcome comparisons.
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: 
 As the PI, [CONTACT_299819] will closely monitor patient safety throughout the duration of the study.  
However, this protocol has several characteristics that suggest a more extensive data monitoring 
procedure.  First, the risk of performing several exercise tests on patients with interstitial lung 
disease is unknown.  We suspect that the risk is a minor increase over minimal risk, but we are not 
sure.  Second, the protocol involves randomization and blinding.  Patients will be randomized, to 
either education or exercise + education.  In addition, while the subjects will not be blinded to their 
treatment allocation, the study personnel will be blinded to the extent that is possible with exercise 
intervention trials.  Study personnel will be blinded through initial baseline screening/testing and 
randomization, however following randomization due to the nature of exercise training and the 
time points involved in this study the blinding process will no longer be possible.  Finally, this 
study involves one extramural site:  Inova Fairfax Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].. 
Given these additional factors, we feel that our plan may need more than just PI [CONTACT_10056], but 
fails to meet the criteria for the involvement of a full DSMB.  Therefore, we have enlisted the 
assistance of Matthew N Bartels, MD, MPH, Chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation at the Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New 
York, as the independent medical monitor (IMM) for this study. He will be apprised of all 
significant adverse events.  In addition, this monitor will also have access to the study data.   
RMD’s Epi[INVESTIGATOR_554192].  
If, at any point, they feel that the study should be stopped because of concern for safety of study 
subjects, they will inform the PI, the IRB, and the clinical and scientific directors of CC and 
NHLBI.  
Conflicts of Interest:  
This study does not include any commercial interests, technology transfer, or any products made 
by a commercial interest.  No conflicts of interest have been identified for any NIH employees 
associated with this study.
 Subject compensation: 
Subjects will be compensated $300 for each completed testing session at the NIH.  For those in 
the concurrent exercise and education group of the randomized trial, this will amount to $600 
because participants will come to the NIH for initial testing and again for retesting at the end of 
the study.  For those in the education only group the amount of compensation will be $[ADDRESS_728292] time after 10 completed weeks of 
exercise.   
Data Management Plan: 
 Data will be collected using appropriately calibrated computer-assisted instrumentation, 
commercial software programs, data collection sheets and self-reported outcome questionnaires.  
Clinical Trials Survey System (CTSS) will be used to manage data collection of the following 
subject self-reported outcome questionnaires and subjects will have the choice of using an NIH 
mobile device or paper format to complete the questionnaires.    All digital CTSS forms will be 
considered source documentation.
CTSS Source
Fatigue Severity Scale Digital or Paper
Human Activity Profile Digital or Paper
King’s Brief ILD Questionnaire (K-BILD) Digital or Paper
Profile of Moods Digital or Paper
St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_554193]-36 Digital or Paper
.
Clinical Trials Database (CTDB) will be used to manage data collection and tracking of the 
intervention through the use of an NIH mobile device.   Paper source may be used should capability 
of digital entry not be available.  All Digital CTDB forms will be considered source 
documentation.
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a protocol number that will be used as a subject 
identifier for all subject files and data collection sheets.  All computer software with associated 
data files is kept on password-protected computers that are off-network and are stored in a locked 
laboratory with restricted access.  Paper data collection sheets will be kept in de-identified subject 
folders in locked filing cabinets in secure areas.  Patient consent forms and other relevant medical 
records with patient names and other identifiable data are kept in separate folders and locked in 
separate filing cabinets.  No information will be kept in either folder that could be used to link a 
subject’s medical record file to a subject’s study data file.  
Electronic data collected in the laboratory will be transferred to a restricted access folder on the 
Clinical Center network with appropriate firewall protection.  Only study PIs and AIs will have 
access to this folder. A password protected USB device will be used to transfer data.  Email 
communication with patient information or data will be transmitted via encrypted email as per 
NIH guidelines.  Data will be analyzed as discussed in the Data Analysis section of this document.

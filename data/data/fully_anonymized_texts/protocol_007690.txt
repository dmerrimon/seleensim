Methodology:  This study will consist of two parts : 
Part A  is a parallel group, placebo- controlled single dose study to ascertain the 
PK profile, safety and bronchodilator effect of RPL554 administered via a DPI. 
There will be six treatment arms ; five will be double -blind and one will be 
single -blind (due to the different number of capsules administered).  
Part B is a placebo -controlled, complete block cross -over, repeat dose study to 
assess the bronchodilator effect of repeat doses of RPL554 delivered via a DPI.  
The treatments will be double -blind.  
S ubjects  will be sc reened for eligibility , including a reversibility test 
(spi[INVESTIGATOR_310813] - and post- 4 puffs of  albuterol)  between [ADDRESS_1041334] dose of study treatment.  
Part A: 
After passing screening and meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, 
approximately [ADDRESS_1041335] -dose. The data from Part A wi ll be locked, unblinded and 
analyzed prior to commencing with Part B. Safety , PK and 
efficacy/pharmacodynamic data will be assessed for each treatment arm to  
determine which dose levels from Treatment Arm s 1 through 4 will be 
evaluated in Part B.  
Part B: 
Patients f rom Part A will then be randomly assigned to one of  five treatment 
sequences in a crossover design, consisting of five 1-week treatment periods 
separated by a 7  to 10 day washout period. Each treatment sequence will 
include four dose levels of RPL554  administered by [CONTACT_162001]  (selected from Part A) 
and a double -blind placebo DPI [CONTACT_3148].  Each treatment  period consists of 6 
days of twice daily dosing, followed by  a morning dose administered only on 
Day 7. P atien ts will undergo study assessments over 12 hours on Days 1 and 7 
in each treatment period . Patients will return for an End of Study V isit 
approximately 7 days after the completion of the final Treatment Period (or 
sooner in the case of early termination) . 
The pre -dose FEV [ADDRESS_1041336] be 
within ±20% of the pre -dose FEV 1 on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 , in order to 
ensure consistent baseline FEV 1 for each study treatment.   
Patients will be dispensed rescue medication to be used as needed during the 
screening, treatment and washout periods .

1.1 Disease and Study Medication Review  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by [CONTACT_760355]. Chronic inflammation of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], acute 
exacerbations primarily caused by [CONTACT_760356]/or bacterial infections, airway remodeling, and 
excessive mucus production are believed to contribute to the airflow obstruction and lung parenchymal destruction. COPD is predicted to be the third leading cause of death and fourth most common cause of disability worldwide by 2030 and chronic tobacco smoke exposure is believed to be a key etiological factor [Stuckler 2008].  
Current standard of care treatments include inhaled short - and long -acting bronchodilators, 
inhaled corticosteroids and , more recently , the phosphodiesterase (PDE) [ADDRESS_1041352] that they can reduce exacerbation rates and improve quality of life [ Rabe 
2005; Calverley 2007; Rennard 2011; Singh 2015]. Approximately 30 to  40% of moderate to 
severe COPD patients on triple inhaled therapy ( inhaled corticosteroid [ ICS]/long acting 
muscarinic antagonists [ LAMA ]/long acting β
2-agonists [ LABA ]) remain uncontrolled and 
continue to experience airway obstruction, COPD symptoms and exacerbations [ Vestbo 2017] . 
Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need for drugs with novel mechanisms of action that c an 
be used by [CONTACT_760357][INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
RPL554, a small molecule isoquinolone derivative, is a dual inhibitor of two isoforms (type 3 
and 4) of the  PDE family of enzymes. PDE3 and PDE4 are known to have a role in modulating 
the infla mmatory airway response in respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748], including COPD, allergic asthma and 
allergic rhinitis. In general, PDE3 inhibitors act as bronchodilators (through interaction with smooth muscle cells), while  PDE4 inhibitors have anti -inflammatory properti es. T here is also 
evidence to suggest that combined inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 can have additive or synergistic anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects (reviewed by [CONTACT_69735] -Banner & Page,  2014). 
Pharmacological evidence from pre -clinical experiments with dual PDE3/[ADDRESS_1041353] potential therapeutic activity in COPD, cystic fibrosis and possibly asthma. 
PDE4 inhibitors (administered orally) have exhibited anti-i nflammatory actions; however, they 
have been associated with unfavorable gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, emesis, 
diarrhea , abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss [Harbinson 1997; 
van Schalkwyk 2005; Compton 2001; Rabe 2005; Rennard 2006; Calverley  2007 ; Gamble  2003; 
Grootendorst 2007] . Dual PDE3/PDE4 inhibitors (administered by [CONTACT_12699]) have exhibited 
both bronchodilator and anti -inflammatory actions, with a more favorable side effect profile 
[Ukena 1995] . It is plausible that increased efficacy with reduced side effects may be achievable 
with administration of a dual PDE3/[ADDRESS_1041354] when added to antimuscarinic agents, as well as additive properties with β
2-agonists [Calzetta 2013 ; Calzetta 
2015]. Therefore , RPL554  has the potential to benefit patients not satisfactorily treated with 
existing medicines. 
RPL554-DP -[ADDRESS_1041355] 
been evaluated in 12 completed clinical studies  involving over 730 subjects. Initially, five studies  
were done  in healthy subjects, patients with mild- moderate persistent asthma and those with 
allergic rhinitis and COPD , using a nebulized solution in citrate/phosphate buffered saline at pH 
3.2 [Franciosi  2013; summarized  in the Investigator ’s Brochure ]. 
RPL554 was subsequently re -formulated in a pH neutral suspension formulation for 
nebulization. This formulation has been tested in seven completed clinical studies:  
1. Study RPL554 -007- 2014 was a Phase I study in which single and multiple ascending doses
up to 24 mg were administered to healthy subjects and COPD patients. N o maximum
tolerated dose of RPL554 could be determined and there was a large bronchodilator
respons e observed . Pharmacokinetics demonstrated a terminal serum half -life of about 10
to 12 hours [ RPL554 -007-2014 Clinical Study Report 2016] .
2. Study RPL554-008- 2014 was a Phase II crossover study  that enrolled patients w ith mild  to
moderate chronic asthma who  received four single doses of RPL554 (0.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 6 mg
and 24 mg), two doses of nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg and 7.5 mg) and placebo. RPL554
produced a dose -dependent bronchodilation with a magnitude that was comparable to a
maximal dose of albuterol , but with fewer of the well described albuterol side effects (e.g.
hypokalemia, tachycardia, tremor and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]) [ Bjermer  2016].
3. Study RPL554-009- 2015 was a Phase II crossover study in moderate to severe COPD
patients who received albuterol (200 µ g), ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (40 µg) or placebo using a
pressurized  metered dose inhaler (pMDI) followed immediately by [CONTACT_685294]554
(6 mg) or placebo. RPL554 alone was as effective as standard of care bronchodilators, and
importantly produced significant additive bronchodilation. Indeed, there was an
approximately 60% additional increase in peak forced expir atory  volume in 1 second
(FEV 1) in COPD pa tients administered RPPL554 in addition to either albuterol or
ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] [ RPL554 -009-2015 Clinical Study Report 2017] .
4. Study RPL554- PK-101 was a Phase I study of the oral bioavailability of RPL554 in
healthy subj ects. Subjects were randomized  to RPL554 6 mg given with, or without, a
charcoal block. The study demonstrated a low oral bioavailability of 10.6% and a terminal
half-l ife of 11.9 hours [ RPL554 -PK-101 Clinical Study Report 2017] .
5. Study RPL554- CO-202 was a Phase II crossover study in patients with moderate to severe
COPD who received tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 18 µg once daily , plus RPL554 1.5 mg, RPL554 6 mg or
placebo twice daily  for 3 days. This study demonstrated a significa nt increase in peak
FEV 1 (103 mL and 127  mL for RPL554 1.5 mg and 6 mg, respectively) as compared to
tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + placebo. There was also significant improvement in both trough FEV 1 and

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 64 7. Study RPL554-010- 2015 was a Phase II  crossover study in adult patients with c ystic
fibrosis. Patient s received a single dose of RPL554, 1.5 mg, 6 mg, or placebo. This study
demonstrated a significant increase (6.6%) in peak FEV 1, as well as demonstrating
pharmacokinetic levels that were similar to that seen in patients with COPD. RPL554 w as
well tolerated in these patients [Clinical Study Report pending] .
RPL554 was well tolerated in all seven  studies, with adverse event  rates that were similar to the 
subjects treated with placebo. All clinical s tudies are described in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
A new formulation has been developed to allow for delivery of RPL554 using a dry powder 
inhaler (DPI). The current study will be the first clinical assessment of the DPI [INVESTIGATOR_760328]554 in humans. A non- clinical a ssessment of local and systemic toxic potential of a dry 
powder formulation of RPL554 was conducted in a [ADDRESS_1041356]  in previous studies. E arly results from this initia l bridging toxicology study 
with a lactose dry powder blend shows no new findings when this vehicle formulation is used. 
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of RPL554 
administered via DPI [INVESTIGATOR_760329]554 in a DPI [CONTACT_419110] .

The suspension formulation of RPL554 has favorable non- clinical toxic ology and 
pharmacokinetic data.  
While there ha ve been few adverse events related to the cardiovascular or gastrointestinal 
systems, small and transient  increases in heart rate at doses of  [ADDRESS_1041358]

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan Description 
This is a Phase II, randomized , double- blind, placebo-controlled, two-part study. Part A is a  
parallel group, single dose assessment of RPL554  administered by [CONTACT_162001] . Part B is a complete 
block crossover, repeat dose assessment of RPL554 administered by  [CONTACT_162001]. The study design is 
shown in Figure 1.

7- 14 days    Timing TBD    7-10 days  7-10 days 7-10 days 7- 10 days 4-10 days
Abbreviations: TP=Treatment Period  
In Part A, patients will be screened for eligibility, including a reversibility test with albuterol. 
Between 7 and 14 days later, a total of approximately 36 patients  will be given a single dose of 
RPL554 or placebo and will be assessed over 12 hours in the clini c. Patients will receive one 
inhaler and will be administered  either 4 or 8 capsules via DPI  (depending on t reatment arm 
assignment; see Section  5). Patients will return to the clinic the following day for a [ADDRESS_1041361]-dose assessment of PK and lung function. A t the conclusion of  Part A , the database will be 
locked and the data  unblinded and analyzed prior to commencing Part B  (see Section 9.4.9 for 
details on the unblinding of Part A).  Specific treatments are shown in  Table  1. 
In Part B, the patients from Part A  will be randomly assigned in crossover fashion to one of [ADDRESS_1041362] been selected to evaluate the 
safety, PK and efficacy/pharmacodynamic characteristics of this formulation over a dose range 
covering a 40-fold increase in dose s. A total of approximately 36 COPD patients aged 40 to 80 
years (inclusive) will be randomized. P atients in Part A will be randomly assigned to receive 
either RPL554 or placebo via DPI. Following an analysis of the safety, PK and 
efficacy/pharmacodynamics, four doses will be selected for Part B . Study medication  
administered via DPI [INVESTIGATOR_760331], except for the [ADDRESS_1041363] and safety.  
Part B is designed as a crossover study to assess the steady state efficacy/ pharmacodynamic 
effect of four dose levels of RPL554 administered by [CONTACT_162001] [CONTACT_3435] a week of twice daily dosing, and 
to compare that effect with placebo DPI . Steady state PK and safety will also be assessed.  One 
week of treatment was selected to evaluate efficacy/pharmacodynamics , PK and safety at steady 
state, as clinical data to date has shown that steady state PK is achieved after approximately 3 
days of twice-daily dosing with the nebulized formulation. 
In Part B, all patients from Part A will undergo f ive treatment periods  in a double- blind 
randomized, crossover design; therefore, each patient will act as his or her own control. This 
design makes it possible to obtain unbiased inferences about differences  between treatments, 
based on intra- patient differences.  
The washout period between the treatment  periods has been selected based upon the available 
PK of RPL554 in healthy volunteers, and patient s with asthma or COPD. Five half -lives is 
considered as the time for elimination of RPL554  from the body. In this study, a washout period 
of [ADDRESS_1041364] be within ±20% of 
the pre -dose FEV 1 on Day 1 of Treatment Period  1 in order to ensure consistent baseline FEV 1 
for each study treatment. If the FEV 1 varies by [CONTACT_56944] 20% , the start of the treatment period 
must be rescheduled. 
3.3 Planned Duration of the Study  
The approximate planned duration for each patient  (not counting the interim analysis period)  will 
be between 75 and 100 days: [ADDRESS_1041365] patient  to

5.9 Rescue Medications  
Short acting bronchodilators may be  used as rescue medication. A lbuterol is to be used for 
primary rescue use. Rescue medication will be sourced by [CONTACT_760361]: 1)  at the time informed c onsent is provided, and 2) on Day 2 at the end of Part A (in 
sufficient quantity to cover the discontinuation of COPD medications prior to Part B , as well as 
full duration of Part B ). See Section  5.8.[ADDRESS_1041384] be separately documented i n the eCRF 
(medication, dose, route, and date and time of each administration).  Rescue use between visits 
will be determined analytically, based on changes in the weight of the canister which will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
5.10 Treatment Compliance  
In Part A, the single dose of study medication  will be administered  in clinic by [CONTACT_3462]. 
In Part B, patients w ill also be dosed at the study center on the morning and evening of Day 1 
and on the morning of Day 7. P atients will self -administer study medication for the other dosing 
times (i.e. on Days 2 through 6).  The number of capsules dispensed  and returned will be 
recorded.  
The precise date and time of  dose administrations  performed in clinic at study visits, and in the 
evening prior to study visits, shall be documented in the eCRF.

Safety assessments (laboratory safety tests, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG and physical examination) 
will be performed at Screening as part of the eligibility assessment as described in Section  7.4.3 
to 7.4.6. 
7.1.1 Demo graphic Variables 
Demographic variables, including date of birth, sex, height, weight, 
BMI  (weight  [kg]/height [m]2), race and smoking status will be collected at Screening.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1041402]  
Reversibility in response to albuterol will be assessed at Screening as an eligibility measure. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (FEV
1 and FVC ) assessment before and after four puffs ( 400 µg) of albuterol , 
administered using a pMDI, will be performed.  
Three technically acceptable measurements should be made and recorded in the eCRF. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_685250] [ Miller 2005] . The highest reading from each assessment will be 
used for calculation of predicted values and increase from baseline.  
The following must be confirmed for inclusion: 
• Post-bronchodilator FEV
1/FVC ratio of ≤0.70 
• Post-bronchodilator FEV 1 ≥40 % and ≤ 80% of predicted normal * 
• Demonstrates ≥150 mL increase from pre -bronchodilator FEV 1  
*National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III [Hankinson 1999] will be 
used as a reference for normal predicted values.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1041403] X -ray 
At Screening, blood samples will be taken and analyzed for viral serology (human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C ). A serum pregnancy test will be performed 
on women of childbearing potential. A  FSH test will be performed, if required to confirm post-
menopausal status. Regarding viral serology, patien ts who received a hepatitis B vaccination and 
are positive for hepatitis B surface antibody, but are negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody, do not need to be excluded from the study. Samples will be taken 
and handled according to the laboratory manual and analyzed locally. 
A chest X -ray (post -anterior) must be performed at Screening or in the 12 months prior to 
Screening.

even if the FEV 1 and FVC values come from two different forced exhalations. 
7.2.2 Dyspnea  Scale  
Patients will be interviewed by a blinded member of study staff to assess their dyspnea. An 11-point Likert scale will be utilized , which will be anchored from 0 to 10 [ Davis 2006]. The 
interview will be worded as follows: “On a scale from zero to ten, please rate your current shortness of breath, with zero indicating no shortness of breath and ten indicating the worst shortness of breath you can imagine.” This scale will be an instantaneous measurement of their dyspnea at that moment, and not reflective.  
7.2.3 Rescue Medication  
The use of rescue medication will be assessed as follows: 1) during study visits, by [CONTACT_760366], and 2 ) between Days 1 and 7 of each treatment period, 
by [CONTACT_760367] e weight of the canister.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Samples of 4 mL per time point will be collected by [CONTACT_760368] (ice bath). The blood will be centrif uged within 15 minutes of collection. The plasma will be separated in a refrigerated 
centrifuge (about 4°C) at 1100g for 15 minutes and transferred into polypropylene tubes. After each blood collection, the plasma will be dispensed into two aliquots. After  appropriate labelling, 
the plasma samples will be stored at, or below - 20°C. The primary plasma samples from both 
Part A and Part B will then be transported in dry ice to the external laboratory  performing the

7.4 Safety Assessments  
7.4.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Definitions 
An adverse event  is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a patient, or worsening in 
a patient, during a clinical study, whether or not considered related to the study medication. An adverse event may be any of the following: 
• A new illness  
• An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a 
concomitant illness  
• Unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study medication  
• A combination of one or more of the above factors 
No causal relationship with the study medication is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse 
event.” An exacerbation of a pre- existing condition or illness is defined  as a more frequent 
occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre- existing condition or illness during the 
study. Planned or elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre -existing conditions that have 
not worsened are not adverse events. However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an adverse event (if the event fits the serious criteria, such as an extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , it will be considered to be serious). Conditions leading to unplanned surgical 
procedure s may be adverse events.  
An adverse reaction  is defined as all untoward and unintended responses to study medication 
related to any dose administered. 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse experience that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, OR  
RPL554-DP -201 
Version 2.0  
12 February 2019 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 64 • Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect 
• Other medical events * 
*Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40089] a SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgement, they 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
An unexpected adverse reaction  is an adverse reaction in which the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the Investigator Brochure.  
A suspected unexpe cted serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any suspected adverse reaction 
related to the study medication  that is both unexpected and serious. 
Standard procedures for emergency care should be followed for any individual adverse event, 
whenever clinically needed (decision to be taken by [CONTACT_737]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording and Assessing Adverse Events  
All adverse events, whether reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_102], in response to open 
questioning on treatment days or observed by [CONTACT_21438]/her staff, w ill be recorded 
from informed consent until the End of Study Visit. The start and stop time will be recorded and adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_685303]:

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causality 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between the study medication and each adverse 
event, and answer "yes" or "no" to the question, "Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7860]?"
 
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for study procedures, additional study medication, and other medication. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure , the causal relationship is implied as "yes".  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Section 14.2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedure for SAEs  
The Investigator must report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as practical, but in call cases within 
[ADDRESS_1041405] also be reported. 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be determined by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor. SAEs will be reported to the IRB and regulatory authority(ies) according to local requirements.  
All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has been 
reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the patient’s general physician or a medical specialist.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up procedures are performed. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1041406] (see Section  7.1.4), urine pregnancy tests will 
also be performed by [CONTACT_760370]

in the [ADDRESS_1041407] be informed immediately. The 
Investigator will report  this information to the Sponsor within 7 days of awareness. The 
Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to ascertain the progress and outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome meets the criteria for immediate classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, co ngenital anomaly, birth 
defect)  the Investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs.

may also be carried out by [CONTACT_471698]. Such audits or inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit  or inspection occurs, the 
Investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his time and the time of his staff to the auditor or inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
8.2 Monitoring  and Source Document Verification  
The study will be monitored by a monitor approved by [CONTACT_1034]. During these visits, all procedures will be monitored for compliance with the protocol. Source documents will be reviewed and compared with the data entries in the eCRFs to ensure consistency. The Sponsor will ensure that the study is monitored in accordance with the principles of ICH GCP. The frequency of monitoring visits will be determined, in part, by [CONTACT_685305]. 
The follow ing are examples of items that will be reviewed at these visits:  
• Compliance with the protocol 
• Consent procedure 
• Source documents 
• Adverse event procedures 
• Storage and accountability of materials 
The monitoring visits also provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to ensure that timely patient 
accrual and the other Investigator’s obligations and all applicable requirements are being fulfilled.  
The Investigator must permit the study monitor, the IRB, the Sponsor’s auditors and representatives from regulatory au thorities  direct access to all source documents for confirmation 
of the accuracy and reliability of data contained within the e CRFs (source document 
verification). Patient confidentiality will be protected at all times.  
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activities of a clinical investigation, including medical notes. All source documents produced in this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_7213]. The original signed informed consent form for each patient will be retained by [CONTACT_760371].

omissions.  
8.[ADDRESS_1041412] be reviewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. Data entered into the eCRF  will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. Validation 
includes, but is not limited to, validity checks (e.g. range checks), consistency checks and 
customized  checks (logical checks between variables to ensure that study data are accurately 
reported) for eCRF data and external data . A majority of edit checks will be triggered during data 
entry and will therefore facilitate efficient ‘point of entry’ data cleaning. 
Data management personnel will perform both manual eCRF  review and review of additional 
electronic edit checks to ensure that the data are complete, consistent and reasonable. The electronic edit checks will run continually throughout the course of the study and the issues will be reviewed manually online to determine what action needs to be taken. 
Manual queries may be added to the system by [CONTACT_685307]. 
Clinical data managers and study monitors are able to remotely and proactively monitor the patient  eCRFs to improve data quality. 
External data ( laboratory  safety , 12-lead ECG and PK  data) will be transferred electronically into 
the study database. Discrepancies will be queried to the site and/or the laboratory until the electronic data and the database are reconciled.  
RPL554-DP -[ADDRESS_1041413] been completed and locked, the Sponsor will authorize database 
lock and all electronic data will be sent to the designated statistician for analysis. Subsequent 
changes to the database will then only be made only by [CONTACT_760372]. 
Adverse events will be coded from the verbatim description (Investigator term) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Prior and concomitant medications will be cod ed according to the World H ealth Organiz ation drug code. An independent coding 
review will be performed by [CONTACT_1034].

In general, unless stated otherwise, continuous variables will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics (number of patients, mean, standard d eviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values) and for categorical (nominal) variables, the number and percen tage of patients will be 
used. 
All hypothesis testing will be done using two- sided alternative hypotheses. P -values less than 5% 
will be considered statistically significant.  
9.4.1 Patient Disposition  
The number of patients enrolled, randomized, completed or withdrawn (with reason for 
withdrawal) will be summarized . 
9.4.2 Protocol Deviations

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 64 9.4.5 Efficacy/Pharmacod ynamics 
FEV [ADDRESS_1041419] (average  FEV 1 AUC 0-t) will be calculated as the 
AUC divided by [CONTACT_760374]. For analysis  of the peak, average and 
trough FEV 1, the change from baseline will be expressed as the parameter divided by [CONTACT_760375]-dose Day 1 baseline value. In Part A, computed pharmacodynamic parameters for FEV
1 will be compared between the 
treatments using analysis of covariance models with fixed factor treatment, and using the pre -
dose baseline value as a covariate. In Part B, computed pharmacodynamic parameters (peak , 
AUC 0-4, AUC 0-12 and trough) for FEV 1 will be compared between the treatments using  analysis 
of covariance  models adjusting for treatment period and patient, and using the pre -dose Day 1 
baseline value as a covariate. FEV 1 will be analyzed using multiplicative models, which means 
that data (dependent and baseline) are logged prior to analysis and the result then trans formed 
back to the linear scale giving treatment differences as ratios of geometric means.  
Primarily , active treatments will be compared to placebo. For RPL554 DPI, the high dose will 
first be compared to placebo, and if found statistically significant the n the next lower dose will 
be compared to placebo, and if found statistically significant then the subsequent lower dose will 
be compared to placebo, and this procedure repeated for all doses. Secondarily, the different 
doses of RPL554 DPI [INVESTIGATOR_332748]. Results of the comparisons will be expressed as the 
mean geometric ratio with 95% confidence intervals and associated, 2 -sided, p- value.  
Onset of action will be calculated and summarized by [CONTACT_3148] . In Part B, a Kaplan -Meier plot 
illustrating time to o nset will be constructed  and f rom the survival curves the median time to 
onset will be estimated. Placebo will not be included i n summaries of onset of action.  
In Part B, the average use of rescue medication during the treatment periods  will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_2948]. In addition, all rescue medication used during the treatment visits (Day 1 in 
Part A and Days 1 and 7 in Part B) will be listed to assess the accuracy of the FEV [ADDRESS_1041420] non-compartmental methods. 
• Part A: AUC 0-t represents the area under the plasma concentration curve from time [ADDRESS_1041421] 
observed value above the lower limit of quantification  
• Part A : Half -life=ln(2)/λ z 
• Parts A and  B: AUC 0-12h represents the area under the plasma concentration curve from 
time [ADDRESS_1041422] plasma concentration 
measured  
• tmax denotes the time point corresponding to C max 
PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_45304] (n, geometric mean, 
coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, maximum and medi an for AUC parameters, C max, n, 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median for t max). 
In Part A, dose -normalized parameters (AUC  0-t and AUC  0-12h , C max) will be compared using 
analysis of variance  models with fixed factor treatment . In Part B, dose -normalized AUC 0-12h 
and C max will be compared using analysis of covariance models adjusting for  factor s treatment, 
period and patient 90% confidence intervals will be constructed for the geometric mean ratios . If 
appropriate, AUC 0-12h data from P arts A and B belonging to the same patient and the same dose 
of RPL554 may be combined to compute the accumulation index (repeat dose/single dose ratio). 
9.4.7 Safety  
Safety data including laboratory  safety  tests, 12 -lead ECG, vital signs and physical examinations, 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_760376], when appropriate , for each 
of the two parts separately . For continuous variables, the change from baseline (pre -dose at each 
treatment period) to each post -dose time point will also be calculated and summarized. Data will 
further be illustrated by [CONTACT_265558] (showing changes from low/normal/high) and shift plots for 
selected time points. Separate listings will be generated of abnormal values occurring after the first dose of study treatment. 
In Part A, change from baseline in peak pulse and peak heart rate  will be compared between the 
treatments using  analysis of covariance  models with fixed factor treatment, and using the pre -
dose baseline value as a covariate. In Part B, change from baseline in peak pulse will be 
compared between the treatments using  analysis of covariance models with fixed factors for 
treatment, period and patient, and using the pre -dose Day 1 baseline value as a  covariate.  
Additive model will be used for pulse and heart rate. Coded adverse event terms will be presented by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term 
and summarized by [CONTACT_460425] . Summary table s by [CONTACT_760377] r and number of patients with adverse events, SAEs, adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment, causally related adverse events and severe adverse events will be produced. Further SAEs, causally related adverse events and adverse event s of each intensity 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_9315] . 
9.4.8 Handling of Withdrawals or Missing Data 
In Part B, p atients withdrawn after only one treatment period will not be included in the 
efficacy /pharmacodynamic and PK analyses of parameters that can be computed in all planned 
treatment periods . Imputation of data for calculation of average (AUC) effects for FEV
[ADDRESS_1041423] of two separate and 
independent analyses. To avoid possible effects of the unblinding of data from Part A on the 
blinding in Part B, only aggregated data (i.e. treatment level , without individual patient 
identifiers) will be revealed at the time of the analysis of the Part A data . 
9.5 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size is determined for Part B. This is a complete block crossover study. Assuming a residual C V of 6 % for peak  FEV
1, 30 patients will give an 80% power to detect a pairwise 
difference in peak  FEV 1 of 4.6%. Assuming a  mean baseline FEV 1 of 1.5 L this will corre spond 
to a difference of about 70 mL. To account for withdrawals, 36 patients will be randomized to 
Part A.

14.1 Birth Control Methods for Women of Childbearing Potential Which May Be 
Considered As Highly Effective  
(Adapted from the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group, Heads of Medicines Agencies, 2014) 
I. Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing pot ential : 
1. Premenopausal female with one of the following: 
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Documentation can come from the study center  staff’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
2. Premenarchal  
3. Postmenopausal female Females who are postmenopausal (age- related amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months and 
increased FSH  >40 mIU/mL), or who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary to confirm postmenopausal 
status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening. 
Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt 
will be required to use one of the non- hormonal highly effec tive contraception methods if 
they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
II. Methods  
For the purpose of this guidance, methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per  year 
when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control  methods. 
Such methods include: 
• Combined ( oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation: 
- Oral 
- Intravaginal 
- Transdermal  
RPL554-DP -201 
Version 2.0

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 64 • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 1: 
- Oral 
- Injectable 
- Implantable 1 
• Intrauterine device  1 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  1 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  1 
• Vasectomized partner  1,2  
• Sexual abstinence [ADDRESS_1041430] low user dependency  
2 Vasectomi sed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual  partner of 
the trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success  
3 In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heter osexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the patient

The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable possibility” 
that an adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7860]. 
• Time Course. Exposure to suspect study medication. Has the  subject actually received the 
suspect study medication? Did the adverse event occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect study medication? 
• Consistency with known study medication profile. Was the adverse event consist ent with 
the previous knowledge of the suspect study medication (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? OR Could the adverse event be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?  
• Dechallenge experience. Did the adverse event resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_760349]? 
• No alternative cause. The adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_760379], other drugs, other host or environmental factors  
• Rechallenge experience. Did the adverse event reoccur if the suspected study medication was reintroduced after having been stopped  Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory 
investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship?  
A "reasonable possibility" could be considered to exist for an adverse event where one or more 
of these factors exist.  
In contrast, there would not be a "reasonable possibility" of causality if none of the above criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course, but any dechallenge 
(if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of the adverse events.  
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recognized feature of overdose of th e study medication? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a "reasonable possibility" of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under  study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no 
reasonable possibility.

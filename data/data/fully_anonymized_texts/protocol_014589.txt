ABSTRACT: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with the addition of a nasal cannula is a useful technique to pre-oxygenate and provide apneic oxygenation in hypoxic patients undergoing emergency airway management. This study aims to evaluate preoxygenation by [CONTACT_833180]-tidal oxygen (etO2) concentration resulting from nasal cannula placement underneath a noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) mask. This is a prospective randomized cross over study of healthy volunteers undergoing continuous positive airway pressure ventilation via a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) mask with and without the addition of nasal cannulas. End-tidal oxygen concentration will be measured by [CONTACT_833181] a nasal cannula, with each subject serving as his or her own control.    3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective is to compare end-tidal oxygen concentration among healthy volunteers undergoing NIPPV with nasal cannulas versus without nasal cannulas. We hypothesize that the use of nasal cannulas during NIPPV will not result in a significant decrease (a clinically significant difference of 5%) in end-tidal oxygen percent compared to no use of nasal cannulas.  4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE: Effective means to improve oxygen saturations is critical during emergency airway management in any setting, including the deployed and austere environments frequently encountered by [CONTACT_833182].   5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE.   Multiple pre-oxygenation techniques are utilized to provide safe intubation conditions during emergency airway management. In a subset of patients, standard techniques such as tidal volume breathing of high FiO2 source for three minutes or eight vital capacity breaths will fail to adequately pre-oxygenate and lead to early desaturation. Alternative pre-oxygenation techniques utilizing NIPPV or nasal cannula during the apneic period have been shown to benefit patients at risk for critical desaturation during intubation.1, 2, 3   Patients that fail to achieve oxygen saturations greater than 93% after tidal volume breathing from a high FiO2 source are at risk for critical desaturation during an intubation attempt4 and are likely exhibiting shunt physiology.[ADDRESS_1156963] et al, hypoxic ICU patients pre-oxygenated with pressure support ventilation via facemask had higher mean oxygen saturation prior to intubation when compared to patients undergoing pre-oxygenation with non-rebreather (98% vs 93%). Additionally, patients pre-oxygenated via non-rebreather desaturated to much lower levels during the intubation compared to the noninvasive group (81% vs 93%).1   However, many NIPPV machines (mainly BiPAP machines) do not supply continuous flow of oxygen during the apneic period. Oxygen administration via nasal cannula during the apneic period can increase the time to desaturation. In a study comparing apneic oxygenation with nasal cannula at 5L/min to patients on room air by [CONTACT_833183], patients placed on nasal cannula had significantly prolonged time of saturations above 95% (5.29 vs 3.49 min). Also, a greater number of patients with nasal cannula during the apneic period had saturations above 95% at the end of six minutes (8 vs 1).[ADDRESS_1156964]  HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH   PROTOCOL APPLICATION – Part B

RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a randomized cross over study. A convenience sample of staff and resident physicians and physician assistants from the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) Department of Emergency Medicine will be used to assess end-tidal oxygen saturations following a period of NIPPV using CPAP with and without nasal cannula. Volunteers will be solicited via weekly Emergency Medicine Grand Rounds and staff meetings at SAMMC. Subjects will undergo permuted randomization by [CONTACT_833184] 4 to randomize the order of intervention: NIPPV mask alone or NIPPV mask with nasal cannula at 15L/min of oxygen. An emergency medicine trained physician will place equipment and operate the ventilator. After placement of the NIPPV mask and prior to each study intervention period, appropriate adjustments to enhance mask seal will be made as would happen in a therapeutic setting and subsequently the volunteer will undergo three minutes of continuous NIPPV. End-tidal oxygen concentrations will be measured at the end of the three minute ventilation period using an oxygen sensor.   7.

Study Procedures/Research Interventions.  After obtaining consent, subjects will undergo randomization to order of intervention: NIPPV with (intervention) and without addition of nasal cannula at 15L/min of oxygen (control). Before the initial intervention, subjects will exhale through an oxygen sensor to determine baseline end-tidal oxygen concentration. For NIPPV without nasal cannula, subjects will have a CPAP mask placed and fitted appropriately. The NIV will be set to CPAP mode at 10cm H2O. During NIV with nasal cannula, subjects

For each trial, subjects will undergo three minutes of spontaneous restful tidal volume ventilation while on CPAP via NIV mask. At the end of three minutes, subjects will remove the NIV mask and immediately exhale through an oxygen sensor, avoiding inhaling room air. After completion of the first arm, subjects will be given at least five minutes of breathing room air before undergoing the second phase of testing. Before beginning the second phase, subjects will exhale through the oxygen sensor to ensure return to baseline end-tidal oxygen concentration. If baseline has not been met, subjects will be allowed to breathe room air until end-tidal oxygen concentrations return to baseline levels. Subjects will then repeat the procedure of three minutes of spontaneous restful tidal volume ventilation while on CPAP via NIV mask, followed by [CONTACT_833185]-tidal oxygen concentration.   7.3.1 Collection of Human Biological Specimens.

A clinically significant difference of 5% in etO2 was chosen to approximate an additional 30 seconds of safe apnea time ([5% etO2 x 2,500mL functional residual capacity] / 250mL/min oxygen consumption in 80kg man).6,8 34 subjects will be required to identify a difference of 5% etO2, with an alpha of .05, beta .1, and a standard deviation of 7.  10% are anticipated to withdraw.

The primary outcome variable is end-tidal oxygen concentration measured at the end of each intervention. The measured end-tidal oxygen approximates the alveolar concentration and is a common measure of preoxygenation.8 End-tidal oxygen concentration of 90% is achievable on an anesthetic circuit with a tight-fitting mask.9  Secondary outcomes: No secondary outcome will be measured.

Page 5 of 75 Study Des cription :  
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains the most prevalent 
mental health (MH) diagnosis for first responders involved with responding to the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) terrorist attacks, with rates of PTSD much higher than that of the general population. There are a number of evidence- based treatments (EBT) for PTSD, 
with the strongest evidence base for trauma focused therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which typi[INVESTIGATOR_776929]. This can be particularly difficult for PTSD patients for whom avoidance is a key symptom. Although these treatments are well supported, they are less effective in military and veteran populations in particular. Additionally, high dropout rates are observed across treatments for PTSD, with some studies yielding dropout rates of over 30%. Given the high rates of PTSD and the lower uptake of effect ive PTSD treatment among responders, there is a clear 
need to provide brief, easily accessible treatments to WTC responders 
to alleviate PTSD symptoms. There is a growing body of literature to 
support the use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a num ber of 
different disorders with promising animal model r esearch regarding 
the use of VNS to address some of the features of PTSD, specifically, due to the impact that VNS has on key areas of the brain that are associated with fear extinction and hyperarous al in particular. The 
current study aims to determine whether the use of a novel, safe, non-invasive form of VNS, transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS), would be acceptable and feasible for use with WTC responders who have PTSD, and whether the methodology involved with a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test taVNS efficacy would be acceptable and feasible. As such, the current study involves conducting a formative phase evaluation in the context of a focus group with WTC responders with elevated PTSD symptoms, in order to tailor the taVNS intervention and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_776930]’s relevant and acceptable for use. The taVNS intervention will then be pi[INVESTIGATOR_66376] a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled parallel-design study with [ADDRESS_1067021] advances in non-invasive, easy to use 
bioelectronic medicine technology to a population with  high rates of

Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 8 of 75 Endpoint s: The primary endpoint of this study will be the feasibility of the taVNS 
intervention. This will be measured at the 8- week follow -up. Feasibility 
will be evaluated as: (1) rates of recruitment (per month), (2) adherence 
to the taVNS intervention, (3) 8- week ret ention, and (4) duration and 
completion rate of study assessments. Feasibility is defined as the ability to recruit 75% of eligible participants who were approached, as well as to show adherence to the intervention and retention rates of 70% each.  
 The secondary endpoint of this study will be acceptability of the taVNS intervention. This will be measured at the 8 -week follow -up. 
Acceptability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_58833]: (1) the time to completion of questionnaires, (2) percentage of missing data from questionnaires, (3) the time to completion of the biological data and blood draw, (4) the  
rate of refusal of biologic measurements and blood draw, and (5) the score on the taVNS Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire.  
Tertiary endpoints of this study include multiple mental health and 
biologic potential endpoints to be measured at the baseline of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_776931] 8 -week follow -up time point. Tertiary 
outcome measures include potential taVNS endpoint measures. At the baseline and 8 -week follow -up visits, validated self -report mental health 
measures, biological measures, and the CAPS PTSD interview (at 
screener and follow -up) will be administered. To examine potential 
mechanisms of action and any acute and longer -term change in these 
mechanisms, all biological measures will be administered at the baseline visit [ADDRESS_1067023] 
to evaluate taVNS efficacy. We will assess measurement quality, 
amount of missingness/non- response, length of measurement collection, 
and costs. These measures will also be used to provide parameter 
estimates f or power calculations for a future RCT. 
  
 
Study Population:  WTCHP, over the age of 18, who agreed  to participate in research and  
has PTSD as per DSM criteria and has elevated PTSD symptoms as per PCL -3 S, PCL-5 and CAPS who do not fall into any of the 
exclusion criteria.  
 
Study Type : This work is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], since it is an initial, small -scale 
investigation to test new experimental designs, non-invasive physiologic monitoring equipment, and advanced analytic tools. Aim 1 consists of a one-time focus group. Aim 2 consists of a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_776932].

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
World Trade Center (WTC) Responders Continue to Experience Significant PTSD 19 
years after 9/11. The September 11, [ADDRESS_1067033] responders who provided emergency services at Ground Zero and were exposed to 
unprecedented traumatic events.1 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains the most 
prevalent mental health (MH) diagnosis for first responders and clean- up workers at Ground 
Zero, and continues to be undoubtedly higher than in the general population.2 One study found

Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 15 of 75 that the estimated lifetime PTSD prevalence in the general [LOCATION_002] population was 6.4%, 
however, 9.7% of WTC responders who were interviewed 11- 13 years after 9/11 met the criteria 
for current PTSD.3 In addition, a study of over 10,000 WTC responders found that, 8 years after 
9/11, 7% had delayed- onset of symptoms. Studies indicate that PTSD and its correlate symptoms 
can potentially be chronic in this population and can cause WTC responders to be at greater risk for triggering PTSD symptoms, even when they have been previously in remission, due to new traumatic experiences.
4  
 
Limitations of Current Treatments for PTSD.  There are a number of evidence- based 
treatments (EBTs) for PTSD, with the strongest evidence base for trauma-focused therapi[INVESTIGATOR_776933] (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR), which involve the need for patients to engage with the 
index trauma and the associated fears and cognitions. Although these treatments are effective and 
well supported, they are less effective in the military and veteran population, and are only marginally more effective than non -trauma focused treatments in that population.
[ADDRESS_1067034] responders are similar to the military and veteran 
population in terms of PTSD symptomatology and, as noted above, the WTC responder population demonstrate chronic symptoms of PTSD even when receiving treatment.
6  High 
dropout rates are observed across treatments for PTSD, with some studies yielding a dropout rate of over 30%, and an average of 18% observed in clinical trials. The true rate of dropout is likely 
even higher in “real world” clinical settings.
7,[ADDRESS_1067035]. In 2002, the WTC Health 
Program (WTCHP) was created to address both physical and MH needs of WTC responders. 
Responders who enrolled in the General Responder Cohort (GRC) of the WTCHP included 
traditional first responder professionals, such as police, paramedics and non- FDNY firefighters, 
as well as non -traditional responders like construction workers and vehicle maintenance workers. 
The WTCHP provides no- cost MH treatment, which alleviates the issue of financial burden, a 
common structural barrier for MH treatment. This can serve to increase access to MH services 
for this population, however, among the GRC only about 40% of responders who are certified 
for MH treatment received any form of MH care in 2017, and rates were even lower among 
FDNY responders (20%). The Northwell Health Queens WTC Clinical Center of Excellence is 
part of the WTCHP (referred to as Queens WTCHP). The Queens WTCHP partners with both 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776934]. Our published work indicates that the Queens WTCHP responders (n=129), who are certified for MH concerns and connected to MH treatment, were most frequently diagnosed with 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 16 of 75 PTSD (74.4%), while some had primary or co-morbid diagnoses of anxiety (24.8%) and 
depression (34.1%).14 The majority of those diagnosed with some MH concern (72.1%) attended 
individual therapy, but many (27.9%) did not consistently attend at least one appointment per week.  In our group’s evaluation of treatment data from community providers treating WTCHP 
responders, only 12.4% were assessed by [CONTACT_776961] a complete EBT protocol.
[ADDRESS_1067036] EBTs, such as PE, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 12 sessions in total.11  Additionally, 
penetration of EBTs for PTSD is challenging in many other settings as well, including in the 
Veterans Administration (VA) which invested heavily in a roll out of first line psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].[ADDRESS_1067037], and that providers are struggling to deliver them. This points to a need to develop 
additional treatment options including for those already engaged in MH care to reduce PTSD symptoms.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) as a Viable Option to Address PTSD Symptoms.  
Physiological Impact of Stress and PTSD : PTSD is categorized as a fear response to a 
traumatic event marked by [CONTACT_776962], difficulties 
with emotional and psychological regulation, becoming easily startled, avoiding situations which are connected to the trauma, emotional numbness, and detachment from others.
[ADDRESS_1067038] been associated with hyper-responsiveness of the hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -
adrenocortical (HPA) axis to cortisol feedback.[ADDRESS_1067039] current PTSD.
16,17 Research suggests that PTSD plays a role in excessive inflammation, increased 
plasma levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines such as TNF α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL -12, and IL-17 
as well as C Reactive Protein (CRP).15,18,19 Further, studies indicate that alpha amylase activity 
(as well as heart rate variability) is associated with aspects of PTSD including sympathetic arousal and experiencing intrusive memories, in particular.
20,21 There may be an increase in 
glucocorticoid activity as well.22,23 Neurotransmitter systems can be dysregulated, such as the 
noradrenergic system which is responsible for arousal-promoting effects that modify elevated 
arousal in stress.24 There is som e evidence that further connects the symptoms of PTSD, such as 
avoidance and re-experiencing, to the body’s reaction to hyperarousal. These physiological 
symptoms of hyperarousal and stress can be detected through changes in facial electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GRS), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), 
pupil diameter (PD), blood pressure (BP) and electroencephalography (EEG) features.
25,26 In 
addition, PTSD patients, in particular, demonstrate extinction learning impairments whereby 
[CONTACT_776963]-threatening situations.27–[ADDRESS_1067040] electrophysiological recordings, indicate medial prefrontal cortex involvement in extinction learning.
27–29  
VNS Mechanisms and Application to Treatment of PTSD: Neurostimulation techniques such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation (rTMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been utilized to address various MH difficulties with varying levels of invasiveness and pote ntial side effects.
30 VNS, in particular, has been shown to

Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 17 of 75 be effective in treating different disease states. VNS (delivered either transcutaneously or using 
implanted devices) has been used on more than 100,000 patients for treating diseases such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],
31 depression,32 headache disorders,33,34 rheumatoid arthritis35 and Crohn’s disease,[ADDRESS_1067041] recently demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled

demonstrated significant increases in extinction (i.e., fear  shown to a fear -inducing stimulus ) 
when VNS was utilized as compared to a sham simulation alone.[ADDRESS_1067044] of VNS, indicates that VNS holds 
promise as an additional therapy that could be applied in people with PTSD and other complicated systems of MH difficulties.

indicated that four years after the initial VNS implantation, 4 treatment- resistant anxiety patients

Page 18 of 75 were still utilizing VNS and seeing impro vements in their anxiety scores compared to their 
baseline levels on psychotropic medication alone.40 In terms of PTSD, specifically, recent 
studies60 involving humans showed significant impacts of VNS in facilitating fear extinction 
among healthy subjects,61 as well as significant impacts of VNS on both central and peripheral 
stress response systems in individuals with a history of psychological trauma.62 Bremner et al.62 
found decreased inflammatory markers, decreased sympathetic tone (increased tone is associated 
with increased stress), and in creased medial prefrontal function with VNS as compared to sham 
controls. These findings were replicated in double-blind, randomized, sham- controlled trials 
involving the application of transcutaneous cervical VNS (tcVNS) in patients with PTSD. In these st udies, stimulation blocked stress-induced increases in IL- [ADDRESS_1067046] of the aforementioned studies (both animal and human studies) utilized VNS devices that are surgically implanted at the cervical level  of the vagus nerve.

60,62,[ADDRESS_1067047] indicated that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) offers another means of non-invasive vagus nerve 
stimulation without surgical intervention. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve comes from 
the vagus and innervates cutaneous areas of the outer ear (Figure 1 ).
39,66,67 Our study proposes to 
use this novel, innovative technology that is non-invasive and easy to use. Our approach utilizes 
a device that involves a personalized electrode that supplies electrical signals to the cymba 
conchae region of the auricle, a region innervated exclusively by [CONTACT_776964].66 Transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch o f the vagus nerve has  
successfully treated refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]68,69 and shown promising results in inflammatory 
conditions70,71  as well as pre-diabetes, tinnitus, memory, stroke, oromotor dysfunction, and 
rheumatoid arthritis,72–[ADDRESS_1067048] for treatment of depression, 
stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. TaVNS also shows promise in treating PTSD; it is proposed that the mechanism includes down-regulation of the inflammatory reflex through adjustment of the microbiome -brain -gut axis (see Figure 1).

that VNS enhances memory consolidation and consolidation of extinction memory, and prevents reinstatement of conditioned fear in a single prolonged stress (SPS) rat model of PTSD.

blind placebo-controlled parallel design, as both the treatment and sham control will use the

there is no sensation perceived from the taVNS device, the two groups will appear identical. 
Additionally, given that many early studies were conducted utilizing invasive and implantable devices requiring surgery, there was considerable financial implications as well as the challenge 
of recruiting patients for this possibly anxiety-producing procedure.
30 One of the benefits found 
in an early randomized trial of taVNS for depression, was that patients could apply the unit 
themselves and did not need a physician to administer it for them, making it much more feasible to use with results comparable to results deriving from the implantable device.
79 Lastly, subjects 
reported that they felt a better placebo/sham needed to be found to limit the bias with potentially feeling the stimulation.

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
 
Aim1 : Potential loss of privacy and/or confidentiality is the main potential risk to subjects 
associated with this portion of the study. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_776965]’s 
Protected Health Information (PHI) protocol that includes storing data in Research Electronic 
Data Capture ( REDCap ), or within a locked electronic folder on a secure, HIPPA-compliant, 
institutional server. Data received from the WTC Data Center will be uploaded into the password- protected REDCap database. Only designated research study staff will have access to 
the study database, to further minimize risk. At the start of the focus group, participants will be reminded about confidentiality and how it is important not to discuss the focus group content outside of the focus group. Only first names (or pseudonyms if preferable) will be used during the focus group. To minimize the potential impacts of discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], a psychologist with qualitative research and a mental health care background will oversee qualitative da ta 
collection. The focus group will also occur at the site of the Queens WTCHP so that direct referrals to on -site WTC mental health staff can be made if necessary. The audio recordings will 
be stored in a password- protected file on the FIMR at Northwell H ealth’s (NWH)s secure 
network, and deleted from the audio recorder. Recording transcripts will be stored in a locked

Page 20 of 75 electronic folder on a secure, HIPAA -compliant, institutional server. If done remotely due to 
COVID-19 restrictions, only a Northwell approved platform will be used.  
 
Aim 2: Study Assessments   
There are no major risks around assessments. Potential loss of privacy and/or confidentiality is one potential risk to subjects associated with this portion of the study.  As stated above t his risk 
will be minimized by [CONTACT_776965]’s  PHI protocol that includes storing data in REDCap, 
or a locked electronic folder on a secure HIPAA -compliant institutional server. Only designated 
study staff will have access to the study database and locked electronic folder, to further minimize risk. A unique identifying number will be assigned to each subject at the time of randomization in order to safeguard the subjects’ PHI. Only the project coordinator will have access to the password -protected REDCap file tha t links the random identification number to the 
subject information.  There is a risk that some of the questions involved in the assessments could cause potential stress or discomfort. The investigative team will vigilantly observe each participant’s emotional 
reactions during all study procedures, and offer referrals when appropriate. If the mental health 
symptoms of any participant were to worsen, [CONTACT_777017] would be responsible for assessing and referring for treatment within the WT C Health Program. Given the exclusion criteria  (no 
signs of psychosis, mania, bipolar disorder, active substance dependence, or suicidal/homicidal intent) we hope to limit the likelihood of adverse events regarding mental health symptoms.  
Aim 2: taVNS  
The taVNS device is Nesos MAUI PROTECT System – a wearable, external stimulator that 
generates electrical pulses transcutaneously delivered to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve 
through the ear canal. The type of stimulation (including shape, frequency, pulse width, amplitude, total charge, and energy delivered to the subject) is comparable to the levels applied by [CONTACT_776966] (TENS) stimulators. The 
Nesos MAUI PROTECT System  is a type of TENS, classif ied as non-significant risk by [CONTACT_776967].  
 
Although highly unlikely, for participants with any severe or persistently worsening symptoms 
or adverse reactions, the taVNS therapy will be immediately discontinued, they will be removed 
from the study, considered treatment failures, and receive medical treatment as necessary. 
Participants will be taught safe practice with the use of a taVNS unit, such as checking and cleaning skin before starting a session, monitoring skin for signs of irritation, securing electrodes with even pressure distribution and full contact, and watching for signs of unit malfunction 
requiring maintenance.   
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-[ADDRESS_1067053] their provider and site coordinator if any occur: 
The Nesos  System exhibits a safety profile similar to that of commercially available TENS units. 
Possible, but rare, side effects may include: ● Bradycardia ● Skin erosion at electrode site ● 
Pressure sores ● Unbearable pain at the electrode site ● Undesirable sensation at electrode site ● 
Uncomfortable stimulation of tissue around the electrodes ● Uncomfortable heating effects, discomfort or burn ● Intermittent stimulation ● Tingling, prickling or numbness ● Tissue 
reaction to stimulation ● Tissue reaction or allergy to materials ● External sources of 
electromagnetic interference that cause the device to malfunction ● Failure of device components including breakage, hardware malfunctions, loose connections, electrical shorts or open circuits and insulation breaches ● Failure or malfunction requiring discontinuation of use  
 
Although the Nesos  device delivers  transcutaneous electrical stimulation, to date,  there are no 
FDA cleared devices  that use the auricular nerve of the vagus on the external ear to deliver 
stimulation therapy in the manner that we do. Based on safety data collected from all of the 
studies using the same device representing more than 200 patients and over 2500 hours of stimulation, including data from 15 patients who used the device for 12 months (daily). Nesos  
states they have also not had any reports of SAE or UADEs in any of our studies in rheumatoid arthritis, postpartum depression and migraine. This clinical data supports the risk  analysis in 
accordance with  the standard for risk management,   ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2019, that concludes that the 
risks related to the use of the Nesos  System are low.  
Aim 2: Biological Assessments 
There are no physical risks associated with the non-invasive physiological recording procedures. 
These tests are commonly used in clinical and research settings.  
For electroencephalogram ( EEG ), there may be some discomfort wearing the electrode cap; 
fortunately, only dry electrodes are used that require no gels to record a signal. Additionally, the size and tightness can be adjusted for each participant. The electrodes only record activity and do not produce any sensation.  
For electrocardiogram  (ECG ), only four electrodes will be connected to the participant’s body. 
There may be some discomfort or skin irritation at the sites of the electrode connections. However, this usually dissipates shortly after the electrodes are removed. 
The non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) system involves the use of a finger cuff to obtain a measurement. There may be some discomfort along the finger and wrist. However, this is remedied by [CONTACT_776968]. 
The galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors involve placing 2 electrodes on the fingertips of the 
participant, assessing skin conductance by [CONTACT_776969]. As a result, there may be some discomfort to participants.

glasses with unobtrusive design (no side or bottom frame) to provide a normal and maximal field of view. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_776935] e torso and can be adjusted to a comfortable 
setting for the participant. 
 
Aim 2: Blood Draw  
There are no major risks associated with the drawing of blood. However, blood draws may cause discomfort or bruising. In rare cases, it can also cause fainting or an infection at the site. Treatment of this complication, if necessary, usually involves a warm compress to the area for one to several days. Only trained staff will draw blood. This study consists of 2 blood draws, and it is considered minimal risk since the study will only involve the collection of approximately 12mL of blood at baseline and follow-up. This is below the maximum blood collection volume generally deemed minimal risk for this study population (i.e., no more than 50 mL in an 8- week 
period, with no more than two draws occurring in any 7-day period).    
2.3.[ADDRESS_1067054] advance s in non-invasive, easy to 
use bio-electronic medicine technology to a population with high rates of PTSD who experience 
barriers to treatment engagement and adherence.  Ultimately, the findings of the study can serve 
as a blueprint for the next stage of a large, randomized controlled trial research protocol, to 
assess the benefits of this novel and non-invasive approach to reduction of PTSD symptoms for 
WTC responders across sites. This could eventually be a successful approach to other responder 
populations in the [LOCATION_002] and internationally.

PTSD using a focus group of 10 WTC responders with elevated PTSD symptoms. 
Primary Study Endpoint:  
Feasibility  
Secondary Study Endpoint:  Relevance and acceptability  
 
Aim 2:   
The primary objective:  
To conduct a randomized, double blind placebo controlled parallel-design pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 30 
WTC responders affiliated with the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) who have PTSD to determine whether the taVNS intervention and efficacy study methodology are feasible for use with th is population.  
A secondary objective:  
To conduct a randomized, double blind placebo controlled parallel-design pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 30 WTC responders affiliated with the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) who have PTSD to determine whether the taVNS intervention and efficacy study methodology are acceptable for use with this population.  
Primary Study Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the feasibility of the taVNS intervention. This will be 
measured at the 8 -week follow-up. Feasibility will be eval uated as: (1) rates of recruitment (per 
month), (2) adherence to the taVNS intervention, (3) 8-week retention, and (4) duration and completion rate of study assessments. Feasibility is defined as the ability to recruit 75% of eligible participants who were approached, as well as to show adherence to the intervention and retention rates of 70% each. 
Secondary Study Endpoint:  
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 24 of 75 The secondary endpoint of this study will be acceptability of the taVNS intervention. This will 
be measured at the 8 -week follow-up. Acceptability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_58833]: (1) the time 
to completion of questionnaires, (2) percentage of missing data from questionnaires, (3) the time to completion of the biological data and blood draw, (4) the rate of refusal of biologic measurements and blood draw, and (5) the score on the taVNS Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire. 
 Tertiary endpoints of this study include multiple mental health and biologic potential endpoints 
to be measured at the baseline of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_776931] 8 -week follow -up time 
point. Tertiary outcome measures include potential taVNS endpoint measures. At the baseline and 8-week follow-up visits, validated self- report mental health measures, biological measures, 
and the CAPS PTSD interview (at screener and follow-up) will be administered. To examine potential mechanisms of action and any acute and longer- term change in these mechanisms, all 
biological measures will be administered at the baseline visit [ADDRESS_1067055] to evaluate 
taVNS efficacy. We will assess measurement quality, amount of missingness/non-response, 
length of measurement collection, and costs. These measures will also be used to provide parameter estimates for power calculations for a future RCT.  
 
We will also use the initial study results to understand signals that point to potential variables to 
include that best indicate taVNS efficacy, and potential mediators of the impact of taVNS on 
PTSD when implemented in a future RCT involving multiple WTCHP sites.  As such, 
preliminary efficacy of taVNS on PTSD symptoms will be assessed.  
Differences between baseline and post -treatment mental health measures will be used to generate 
hypotheses for a future larger RCT targeting PTSD symptoms as a primary outcome, and anxiety, depression, and sleep quality as secondary outcomes, in order to more robustly evaluate taVNS efficacy among a larger sample of WTC responders with PTSD  thereby [CONTACT_776970] . We will also use results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_776938] a ction including the various inflammatory, neural and cardiovascular 
changes that correlate with treatment outcomes.  
Blood will be drawn to assess markers of inflammation before using the device, and again at the 8-week follow -up visit. This allows us to collect data to understand potential acute and long term  
effects  based on these preliminary efficacy results. These tertiary outcome measures and 
potential mechanisms of action will be used to inform the design of a future, RCT to evaluate taVNS efficacy. Measurement quality, amount of missingness or non-response, length of measurement collection, and costs will be also assessed. These measures will also be used to provide parameter estimates for power calculations for a future RCT .

important to replicate the methodology that will eventually be used with a larger trial in order to 
truly assess whether the intervention and methodology are acceptable, feasible and efficacious. 
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains the most prevalent mental health (MH) diagnosis 
for first responders involved with responding to the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) terrorist 
attacks, with rates of PTSD much higher than that of the general popul ation. There are a number 
of evidence-based treatments (EBT) for PTSD, with the strongest evidence base for trauma 
focused therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which typi[INVESTIGATOR_776929]. This can be pa rticularly difficult for PTSD patients for whom 
avoidance is a key symptom. Although these treatments are well supported, they are less effective in military and veteran populations in particular. Additionally, high dropout rates are observed across treatments for PTSD, with some studies yielding dropout rates of over 30%. Given the high rates of PTSD and the lower uptake of effective PTSD treatment among 
responders, there is a clear need to provide brief, easily accessible treatments to WTC responders 
to alleviate PTSD symptoms. There is a growing body of literature to support the use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a number of different disorders with promising animal model 
research regarding the use of VNS to address some of the features of PTSD , specifically, due to 
the impact that VNS has on key areas of the brain that are associated with fear extinction and hyperarousal in particular. The current study aims to determine whether the use of a novel, safe, non-invasive form of VNS, transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS), would be acceptable and feasible for use with WTC responders who have PTSD, and whether the methodology involved

Page 26 of 75 with a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test taVNS efficacy would be acceptable and 
feasible. As such, the current study involves conducting a formative phase evaluation in the context of a focus group with WTC responders with elevated PTSD symptoms, in order to tailor the taVNS intervention and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_776930]’s relevant and acceptable for 
use. The taVNS intervention will then be pi[INVESTIGATOR_66376] a randomized, double-blind placebo 
controlled parallel -design study with [ADDRESS_1067057] may vary between each tested individual. The impedance of the electrode-skin interface, placement of the electrode on the ear, and unique anatomy between individuals makes it arbit rary to set a choice of specific stimulation  amplitude  
parameters. For example, a specific current may not be perceptive in one person but may be painful for another. By [CONTACT_776972] a one-size- fits-all parameter, we can establish similar levels of activation of the auricular branch of 
the vagus nerve. The min/max current range that the patient may receive during this study is [ADDRESS_1067058] session.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 Recruitment (Aim1):  
 The GRDC will provide a list of all Queens WTCHP responders who meet eligibility criteria, and their corresponding contact [CONTACT_3031], to the study team. A Collaboration Request Letter was granted by [CONTACT_776976], and will be executed upon Notice of Award . From this list, a rando m sample of 10 responders will be contact[CONTACT_3012], email, 
and/or mail for focus group recruitment. After [ADDRESS_1067063] consented, the focus group will be scheduled and conducted at the Queens WTCHP. Due to potential COVID-19 restrictions the focus group can be done remotely if necessary.   In order to maximize recruitment, mailings will be sent to all eligible Queens WTCHP responders (N=477) and the focus group will be advertised within the Queens WTCHP.   Recruitment (Aim 2):  
As per the GRDC, there are currently 477 Queens WTCHP responders who consented to be 
contact[CONTACT_776977] a PCL -S score ≥ [ADDRESS_1067064] of 477, 30 responders will be recruited over the course of 10 
months as follows: First, the list of responders that meet initial eligibility requirements will be 
randomly ordered. Next, the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_776978], in which the PCL- 5 will be administered to confirm current probable PTSD (score > 
33), so that the likelihood of bringing someone in for a diagnostic interview who does not 
currently meet criteria for PTSD is minimized. Then the coordinator will discuss participation in 
the CAPS interview, to determine fu rther eligibility for the study. If the responder agrees to 
come in for a CAPS assessment, Dr. McCann or [CONTACT_777018], [CONTACT_500190] or [CONTACT_777019]  will conduct a CAPS assessment and the standard MINI to assess for psychiatric exclusion. For the 
suicidality portion specifically , we will utilize the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -
SSRS) . Dr McCann, [CONTACT_777020] and [CONTACT_777019] will be trained and supervised on CAPS by 
[CONTACT_776979].  If the CAPS is indicative of a current diagnosis of PTSD and exclusion criteria are not met, [CONTACT_777018]  or [CONTACT_777019] will then come to the fitting appointment to 
consent and enroll the responder into the study if they continue to express interest. The consent form will be mailed or given a head  of time to review.

The responder will receive $20 and transportation costs, $25, for completion of the CAPS 
regardless  of whether or not he or she is eligible for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Based on our previous 
research,[ADDRESS_1067065] that of the 477 potential participants, approximately 182 will need to be 
called in order to reach a 33% screening participation rate, to yield [ADDRESS_1067066] that 66% (n=40) will meet criteria for PTSD as per the CAPS, and will therefore be eligible for the study based on [CONTACT_777017]’ s  previous study involving recruitment and 
enrollment of military Veterans with PTSD.
[ADDRESS_1067067] 75% (n=30) 
will agree to continue with study participation. 
In order to increase recruitment,  we are working with Mount Sinai WTCHP Data Center to 
identify additional eligible patients . These participants  previously consented to be contact[CONTACT_450987] .  
This information includes: names, contact [CONTACT_3031] (mailing address, phone numbers and email addresses) for members who scored ≥ [ADDRESS_1067068] recently completed PCL/PTSD checklist since 1/1/2019 who live within a 10 mile radius from the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research ([ADDRESS_1067069], Manhasset, NY [ZIP_CODE]).  
This will be provided to us from Mount Sinai WTCHP Data Center , we will not be giving any 
information to them.  
Even though we have a data use agreement in place, we are r equesting a HIPAA waiver of 
authorization to receive and possess the WTCHP PHI. Providers previously gave permission to 
be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] , but in order for us to only reach out to those potentially  eligible , we need to know 
additional information and it isn’t feasible to reach out to each participant for this information. All participants are consente d prior to  any research activity.

6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 
Aim 1:  A Focus Group Discussion Guide will be finalized by [CONTACT_776980] (see Appendix 1 for example blank focus group data collection instrument). It will 
include questions to understand the relevance, feasibility and acceptability of: (1) using a taV NS 
device generally, (2) using it as treatment for PTSD , (3) the implementation protocol of the 
device, (4) the pi[INVESTIGATOR_182239] (including the methodology details, timing, and both self-report, clinical, and biological assessments), and (5) the appropriateness of outcome measures. The estimated duration for the focus group is ≈ [ADDRESS_1067070] . Zanos and/or [CONTACT_777016] will demonstrate the device. Individuals will have the 
opportunity to handle the devices and there will be sanitizing wipes to be used in between. The 
focus group will be transcribed for qualitative analyses.   
Aim 2:  
 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 33 of 75 Procedure: After each of the 30 responders are enrolled 
(3 per month),  they will be scheduled within that same 
month for an appointment at FIMR to be fitted with a 
custom -made taVNS device, a wearable TENS unit 
called the  Nesos System . They will be compensated 
for their time/trans portation. We expect to  have 
approximately [ADDRESS_1067071] privacy. After the devices are 
customized and delivered to FIMR (within approximately 1 month), responders will be called 
to FIMR for a baseline visit . One of the researchers 
from the Feinstein Institutes  will assess the fit of 
the device and calibrate the level needed for each responder. At the baseline visit, responders will be given the device that matches their randomization sequence ID number. Each responder will also be given, along with the taV NS device, a locked -down 
Android Nexus 5X or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_776940]. Responders will then be given a self-report survey to complete that asks demographic information, MH treatment-related information, and validat ed measures of MH 
and sleep (Table 1). Appendix 1 contains blank, sample self -report/interview measures. A research 
nurse will also collect 12 mL of blood to assess baseline and follow-up levels of inflammatory 
markers including Tumour Necrosis Factor  alpha 
(TNF α), Interleukin (IL)-1β , IL-6, IL -10, IL -12, 
IL-17, C Reactive Protein (CRP), cortisol, and 
alpha amylase. During the baseline visit, responders will also be shown how to use the device by [CONTACT_6283]. Zanos or Debnath. The responders will use the device for one 15 -minute session under the 
supervision of Drs. Zanos or Debnath. Biological non-invasive measures (not blood draw) of autonomic nervous system function and balance, as detailed in prior studies from the our group
80 and 
others, will be assessed 10 minutes before using the taVNS device.  (see Table 1).   
 These non- invasive biological measures include: 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_263143], ECG, GSR, NIBP, EEG, Eye tracking. 

Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-[ADDRESS_1067072] sensor to be attached to the participant is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_776941]. It 
is tightened without discomfort such that breathing causes the belt to stretch, which provides inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (inhalation) and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (exhalation) times to infer respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. Next, the 6-lead electrocardiography (ECG) will be recorded from wires connected from a bio- amplifier, 
which gathers and increases physiologic signals, to four foam electrodes that are adhesively attached to the left shoulder, the right shoulder, the left ankle, and the right ankle. The right ankle provides a ground, while the remaining three leads provide recordings of the electrical potentials between different sites that represent the electrical activity of the heart in real -time.  
Additional sensors are placed on the wrist and hands of the participant. The first set records galvanic skin response (GSR) by [CONTACT_776981], metal electrodes with Velcro attachments on two fingers, preferably the pointer and ring fingers on the dominant hand. These electrodes 
measure the changes in skin conductance that can reflect changes in sweat gland activity. A wrist 
device will be placed to record non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) from the middle finger on the participant’s non-dominant hand. The wrist device is placed with a Velcro strap on the wrist, while a small cuff is placed on the middle finger. The wrist device provides air and power for the 
cuff to inflate and deflate to measure changes in blood pressure. A dry electrode 
electroen cephalography (EEG) cap will be placed on the head of the participant. This cap offers 
low noise and high signal quality of non-invasive brain recordings without an uncomfortable cap that may require conductive gels. This cap can be placed on the head of the participant and 
record comfortably through hair without any gel. The final device to be placed on the participant 
is the eye tracking glasses. These are easily wearable and mobile glasses with multiple small cameras to track gaze and pupil size. If the participant wears prescription glasses, these will be removed and replaced with the eye tracking glasses (with the appropriate prescription lenses) for this study." 
Responders will then be instructed to use the device once a day , every day at home, for [ADDRESS_1067073] a safety feature where they cannot be used for 
more than the intended timepoints daily and the stimulation parameter will be set by [CONTACT_776982]. The date and time stamp of each use will be recorded on the application. The application only assesses usage/compliance and has no ability to capture any personal or other information. All phones containing the Nesos  application is  
collected at the end of the study. Responders are requested to come in [ADDRESS_1067074]- baseline and 
the same measures will be recorded again (self -report, biological and blood draw; see Table 1).  
 
6.1.2  ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
The perceptual th reshold will be determined at the initial session for every participant. This is 
25% below the minimum amount of current required to perceive electrical stimulation on the skin at the target. Because of differences in the electrode- skin interface and anato my of each 
individual, stimulation parameters will be adjusted for each participant to establish similar levels of activation over all participants. 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 35 of 75  
A step -up and step-down binary parametric search will be used to establish the threshold and 
stimulation p arameters. While delivering one second trains of stimulation, we will ask the 
participant whether s/he felt the stimulation. If yes, we reduce the stimulation intensity by 50%, while if no, we increase the stimulation intensity by 50%. This enables us to e stablish the 
minimum threshold for perception. Sensation is generally reported as a “tickle” or “pricking” sensation. Since taVNS is targeting a sensory nerve, perception and sensation remains the main indication that we are stimulating the auricular branc h of the vagus nerve from locations on both 
the left and right ear.  
 
 
 
6.2 HANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
We will receive all taVNS devices at the Neural and Data Science Lab from Nesos  Corp., where 
they will be kept in locked drawers, until they are handed out to the participants. Drs. Zanos and Debnath will be responsible for the timely acquisition and proper storage of the devices.  
6.2.2  MANUFACTURING, PACKAGING, AND LABELING  
 
The devices and all necessary components (stimulators, phones, ear mold and electrode 
materials) will be shipped to the Neural and Data Science lab as an investigational supply 
provided by [CONTACT_7904]. The company is listed as a consultant on our grant and we will be 
setting up a purchase order to provide them with a flat fee of funds in both year 1 and year 2.   
The devices will bear the following labeling during the course of the study: “ CAUTION - 
Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use ” per [ADDRESS_1067075] STORAGE  
 
 
Information on each use of the device will be documented, and a Device Accountability L og will 
be maintained.

Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 36 of 75 Ear mold materials will be stored in a locked cabinet, inside a badge -access room of the Neural 
and Data Science lab. The ear molds will be fitted to the participants and each electrode will be 
connected to the external stimulator, and mobile app. The whol e Nesos  
System will be put together by [CONTACT_776983] (Visit 2) 
 
6.2.4  DEVICE RISK DETERMINATION  
 
Description of Transcutaneous Auricular  VNS (taVNS) Intervention: The taVNS device that 
will be used in this study is a wearable Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit 
called the Nesos System . The Nesos System , which is manufactured by [CONTACT_776984], [LOCATION_004], consists of a wearable, external stimulator, and a neural interface earpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] 
(Figure 2  below ). The device is considered a non-significant risk device not requiring an 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). The wearable, external stimulator generates electrical 
pulses that are transcutaneously delivered to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve through the 
ear canal. The external stimulator is made out of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic, which has a proven history of safe use in similar applications. The earpi[INVESTIGATOR_776942] 4 electrodes 
that carry current from the external stimulator to the auricular branch of vagus nerve. The 
earpi[INVESTIGATOR_776943] a silicone material that has evidence of safety in wearable devices. The 
electrode surface is made out of a medical grade, biocompatible conductive hydrogel or conductive silicone material  
The system is comprised of the following major components: 
• Stimulator – The stimulator is housed in an enclosure which is placed on the user’s neck. 
It delivers charge- balanced, current -controlled, biphasic, square waves to electrodes (in the 
earbuds) in contact [CONTACT_776985]'s ear. The type of stimulation (total charge and 
energy delivered to the user) is comparable to the levels applied by [CONTACT_776986] (TENS) or non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators (nVNS).  
• Earbuds – The earbuds are designed to transcutaneously- deliver electrical stimulation to 
the external ear. Each earbud is manufactured using ear molds unique to each user’s ears to facilitate proper contact [CONTACT_776987] (in the earbuds) with the skin. Commercially available 
electrolyte sol ution (e.g., Signa spray or its equivalent) is recommended to be applied on the 
electrodes before they are placed in the ear. This conductive electrolyte solution reduces the 
electrode to skin interface resistance.  
• Nesos proprietary APP – The system com es with a proprietary APP that is downloaded 
onto a smartphone. The key function of the APP is to allow the user to turn stimulation ON/OFF, monitor (using periodic impedance measurements) and notify the user of poor electrode/skin contact. In addition, the APP shows the amount of time left in a stimulation session and will 
notify the user when it is time for a session.  The system also comes with a custom charging 
cable for recharging the stimulator. 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-[ADDRESS_1067076] System was  developed using a [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_1067077]’s skin. The type of stimulation (including 
shape, frequency, pulse width, amplitude, total charge and energy) delivered to the subject is 
comparable to the levels applied by [CONTACT_776988].  
 
Although its use in this study is considered investigational, its use is considered to constitute 
minimal risk. It is also believed that its usage in this feasibility study meets the FDA definition of 
a non-significant risk device. The device is intended to be used to administer a low amount of 
current to stimulate the vagus nerve. The non- significant risk determination was made because 
the device does not constitute a significant risk device since it is not intended as an implant and 
does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; is not 
purported to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life and does not present a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; is not for use of substantial importance 
in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease and does not present a potential for serious 
risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; and does not otherwise present a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  

Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 38 of 75 Randomization : A randomization schema will be pre- generated by [CONTACT_776989], using the Biostatistics Randomization Management System (BRMS) software, by a 
statistician not affiliated with the study. Responders will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either taVNS or sham and given a unique randomization ID number. The randomization schema 
will be read into the randomization module in REDCap, a data management system that only the 
coordinator can access. The software will monitor the allocation progress and responder assignment.  Concealed Allocation : The coordinator will create and keep a crosswalk between participant ID, 
unique randomization ID number, and assignment in REDCap. Nesos  Corp will use the unique 
randomization ID number to label the molds for fitting the device. After the fitted devices are received, the coordinator will give Nesos  Corp a table with unique randomization ID number 
labels and assignment for Nesos  Corp to designate the appropriate program to the device based 
on the responder’s allocation. For the taVNS program, when the responder uses the app to activate the device, the taVNS will provide stimulation at a value that was calibrated to that responder. For the sham program, the device will not provide any electrical stimulation.  Blinding: Responders in the taVNS and the sham group will be blinded to their assignment. Both 
groups will not be able to detect the stimulation provided and thus, will not know which group 
they are in. The directions provided and the use of the application will be the same for both groups. All investigators will be blinded to participation assignment as well. Biologic outcome measures will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Debnath. The CAPS will be conducted by [CONTACT_776990]-report survey completion will be provided by [CONTACT_23164] . 
Only the research coordinators will not be blinded to the assignment. They  will receive the 
allocation assignment after en rollment and will coordinate with Nesos  Corp to program the 
devices corresponding to assignment. 
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
 
In order to verify compliance with the study procedures, the completion of case report forms is required for each study visit for participants. These records will be periodically reviewed investigator(s) to ensure all study procedures were adequately performed. In addition, investigator(s) will cross reference the documented information against the randomization schema to ensure participants were appropriately randomized and administered the proc edures as 
specified .  
 
7 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT  WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 Discontinuation of taVNS does not necessarily mean discontinuation from the study, as remaining study procedures may be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. If a clinically significant finding is identified after enrollment, a qualified investigator will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Also, the participant may be notified of the finding and recommended to seek further clinical evaluation and care.   
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION/W ITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-[ADDRESS_1067078] to withdraw at any time by [CONTACT_776991] a researcher. It is also possible that participation in this study may end without the participant’s consent. This decision may be made by a re searcher, the Northwell Health Human 
Research Protection Program, or a federal or state regulatory agency.  
 Reasons for withdrawal may include: failure to comply with study requirements; failure to keep study appointments; a change in their medical history, medications, or lifestyle (including alcohol, tobacco, or substance usage) that results in them no longer meeting study eligibility; inability to tolerate study procedures; it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue on this study; or the study is stopped.  Participants that prematurely withdraw from the study due to an adverse event will be followed (e.g. telephone contact, follow -up visits, etc.) until resolution of the event or they indicate they 
no longer want to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. In addition, a designated investigator will have access to treatment status at all times and provide that information to appropriate medical personnel in the 
event of medical emergencies. If the participant withdraws from this study or if s/he is 
withdrawn from the study, any data already collected will continue to be used, but no new data will be collected. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1067079] be taken if a particip ant fails to return for a study visit: 
 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_19423].  
• The site will counsel the participant on the importance of following the study visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]. This includes up to 3 telephone calls. 
• All reasonable efforts will be made to recover eq uipment, including sending a prepaid 
label for return.  
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Aim 2: Primary Outcome Measure: Feasibility will be evaluated using criteria suggested by 
[CONTACT_154791]99: 1) rates of recruitment (per month), 2) adherence to the taVNS intervention, 3) 8- week 
retention, and 4) duration and completion rate of study assessments. Feasibility is defined as the 
ability to recruit 75% of eligible, approached, participants and to demonstrate intervention 
adherence and retention rates  of 70% each (Table 1). Secondary Outcome Measure: 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 40 of 75 Acceptability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_58833]: 1) time to completion of questionnaires, 2) 
percentage of missing data from questionnaires, 3) time to completion of the biological data and blood draw, 4) rate of refusal of biologic measurements and blood draw, and 5) score on the taVNS Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire
100 (Table 1).  Tertiary Outcome Measures  
include potential taV NS endpoint measures. At the baseline and 8 week follow -up visits, 
validated self -report MH measures, including assessments of PTSD,94 anxiety,101 depression,102 
sleep,103 and the CAPS interview95 (at screener and follow -up) will be 
administered. To examine potential mechanisms of action  and any acute 
and longer- term change in these mechanisms, the biological measures 
will be administered at baseline [ADDRESS_1067080] (Table 1).  We will also use the preliminary efficacy results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_776944], neural and cardiovascular changes that correlate with treatment outcomes  
Demographics and MH Treatment Variables:  Demographics including age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, and education will be collected using self-report questionnaires, which will be designed in REDCap and recorded using i-Pads. Past and current MH treatment data will be collected, including psychotherapy sessions, duration of treatment, and medications used, to be 
explored as potential covariates in a larger RCT. Information on perceived barriers to 
engagement in MH care will also be gathered. Differences between baseline and post -treatment 
mental  health measures will be used to generate hypotheses for a future larger RCT targeting 
PTSD symptoms as a primary outcome, and anxiety, depression, and sleep quality as secondary 
outcomes, in order to evaluate taVNS efficacy among a larger sample of WTC responders with 
PTSD.  
 Planned Data Analysis : The purpose of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_776945], acceptable, and satisfactory for WTC responders with PTSD. Primary outcomes are based on feasibility. Specifically,  
recruitment, retention, and adherence will be measured as described above. Secondary outcomes are indicators of acceptability including rates of non-response, time to completion of measures, 
and intervention satisfaction. Tertiary outcomes include MH and biologic measures. All 
measures will be described using frequency and percent or mean (SD) as 
appropriate, overall and by [CONTACT_776992], with corresponding 95% confidence intervals to interpret the precision of the estimat es. 
Median and interquartile range may also be used if discrete data are skewed. For the tertiary outcomes measuring MH and biologic data, descriptive statistics for each time point, as well as differences over time, will be calculated. Differences in outcomes will be assessed from 
the first time point at baseline and the last time point at [ADDRESS_1067081] correlation of acute and long- term 
measures will be reported. Precision of Estimates:  Primary outcome 

Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 41 of 75 measures are expected to be 75% for recruitment, 90% for retention, and 80% for adherence. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for one proportion were calculated using the Clopper-
Pearson method, with scenarios varying the expected percent (0.70-0.95), in order to estimate precision given a sample size of 30. The lower confidence level will be used to inform 
recruitment, retention, and adherence planning in the future RCT (Table 2). Hypothesis 
Generation: Differences between baseline and post -treatment secondary outcome measures will 
be used to generate hypotheses for a larger RCT targeting PTSD symptoms (with a particular focus on hyperarousal) as a primary outcome, and anxiety, depression, and sleep as secondary 
outcomes, in order to evaluate taVNS efficacy. Estimates and vari ances at each time point will 
be used to calculate effect sizes to plan the larger RCT. We will be cautious about using our 
findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_776946]. This is because effect sizes observed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_776947], due to the 
small sample size, and may not be indicative of the true difference in the larger population. We will also use results to generate hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms of action including the various inflammatory, neural, and cardiovascular changes that correlate with treatment 
outcomes. We will explore whether the impact of taVNS on PTSD symptoms is mediated by 
[CONTACT_776993] (Table 1).  
D. Potential Limitations: Ideally, the activity of deep brain structures related to relevant neural 
circuits would also be measured using fMRI, given their role in mediating stress and the impact that innervation of the vagus nerve has on specific brain areas, such as the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius. Given the scope of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], however, it is not possible to conduct 
fMRIs on [ADDRESS_1067082] analyses (or as a 
variable on which to block randomize). Finally, should distancing requirements of COVID-19 
continue to be a concern in the beginning of the study period, the study team can easily pi[INVESTIGATOR_776948], and the survey measures can be completed electronically via a secure email link. Fitting for the taVNS devices as well as biologic measurements can be conducted quickly and safely with all 
appropriate precautions taken regarding PPE provision and use for both the study staff and the 
participant.  
E. Dissemination: The results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_776949] a larger trial that tests the efficacy of taVNS at multiple WTCHP sites. As 
such, it is important that the WTCHP providers and the responder community at large are 
engaged as stakeholders and collaborators to facilitate community dissemination activities. [CONTACT_777021] will be integral in these efforts given her strong ties to the WTC provider and responder communities. Updates on study progress and findings will be presented to stakeholders in the 
WTCHP including at the Biannual WTC Research Grantees meetings and at WTCHP committee 
meetings (e.g., WTCHP Mental Health Forum, WTC Steering Committee), as well as to patient 
stakeholder organizations (e.g., 9/11 Health Watch, FealGood Foundation). Additionally, results 
will be reported to the MH working group for the WTCHP, in which [CONTACT_777017] already 
participates, and at monthly meetings of the Queens WTCHP. Results will also be disseminated 
in peer -review publications, and will be presented at national and local conferences. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_776950] a first, integral step toward bringing the latest advances in non-invasive, easy 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-0640 February 1, 2022 
Page 42 of 75 to use bioelectronic medicine technology to a population with high rates of PTSD who 
experience barriers to PTSD treatment engagement and adherence.  
 
 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 Co-primary Safety Endpoints: The primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of any discomfort 
or harm in healthy, able-bodied participants during taVNS protocol.  Secondary  Study Endpoint: The efficacy and specificity of taVNS will be determined by [CONTACT_776994]. This study will explore the changes in the ANS and its branches from taVNS, as well as the stimulation parameters to  achieve significant results.  
 There are no anticipated problems that are associated with this non- invasive study. In the unlikely 
event that a participant is harmed from being in the study, medical care and treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_84392]. However, the participant will be responsible for the costs of any medical treatment, directly or through medical insurance and/or other forms of medical coverage.   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)

 The identification of an adverse event may be from observation, participant notification, clinical assessment, or results from tests.  
 
• Mild – Events that require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events that result in a low level of inconvenience or concern. Moderate events may cause some interference wit h functioning. 
• Severe – Events that interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening – Events that require urgent intervention to sustain life or prevent 
severely debilitating condition. 
• Death – Events that are related to death.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study intervention assessed based on temporal relationship. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.   
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinica l event  occurs within a reasonable time after 
administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of intervention). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
• Not Related – The adverse event is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.

Page 44 of 75 [IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The principal investigator, Rebecca Schwartz, PhD will be responsible for determining whether 
an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND 
FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an adverse event or serious adverse event may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits, interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  All adverse events not meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event will be captured on the case report form. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention, and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All adverse events occurring while on study will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship, and followed to resolution or until the participant no longer wants to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is first seen will be considered as baseline and not reported as an adverse event. However, if the study parti cipant’s 
condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an adverse event.   Changes in the severity of an adverse event will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be perf ormed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The principal investigator, Rebecca Schwartz,  PhD, will be responsible for the recording of all 
reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until resolution or until the participant no longer wants to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of adverse events.   
8.3.[ADDRESS_1067083], assess, categorize, and report all adverse events and serious adverse events as per the reporting requirements of the Northwell Health Human Research Protection Program and the Food and Drug Administration, as applicable.  
8.3.6  REPORTING E VENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
 If an adverse event or serious adverse event is observed, the participant will be notified immediately upon discovery in person or by [CONTACT_25600]. In addition, participants will be told of any new findings that may change their decision to continue to participate.

If incidental findings that are deemed clinically -significantly are discovered, the participant will 
be notified and recommended to seek further clinical evaluation and care.   
8.3.7  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
 
• If an individual becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be withdrawn from the study, as early pregnancy may potentially impact measurements.  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
 An unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others includes any incident, 
experience, or outcome that is considered:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research procedures and participant population being studied; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than previously known or recognized. 
 
8.4.2  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS (UADE)  
 An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on the health and/or safety or any life threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in this study; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)). An event will not be considered related to the device when it is the result of a pre -existing medical condition or medication.  
 A device malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or other performance as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling f or 
the device. The intended performance of a device refers to the labeled use for which the device is labeled.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1067084], assess, and report all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and unanticipated adverse device effects as per the reporting requirements of the Northwell Health Human Research Protection Program and the Food and Drug Administration, as applicable. The report will include a detailed description of the event, incident, e xperience, or 
outcome; an explanation for its occurrence and assessment; and a corrective action plan.

Page 46 of 75 8.4.4  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
If an unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others or unanticipated adverse device effects occur, the participant will be notified immediately upon discovery in person or by [CONTACT_25600], if deemed necessary. Upon reporting to the appropriate regulatory agencies, the study team will implement the approved corrective action plan. This plan will outline the mechanism and time course for notifying study participants.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES  
Our primary o utcome measures are expected to be 75% for recruitment, 90% for retention, and 
80% for adherence. We calculated two -sided 95% confidence intervals for one proportion using 
the Clopper-Pearson method with scenarios varying the expected percent (0.70 and 0.95) in order 
to estimate precision given a sample size of 30. The lower confidence level will be used to 
inform recruitment, retention, and adherence planning in the future RCT.

evaluating the efficacy of taVNS on mental health outcomes is feasible, acceptable, and 
satisfactory for WTC responders with PTSD. The total sample size for the Aim 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_273619] 30 World Trade Center Health Program responders with PTSD. Primary endpoints are based on 
feasibility. Specifically,  recruitment, retention, and adherence, will be measured. Recruitment is 
defined as the percent of eligible responders who meet all study criteria and  were recruited and 
consented to be in the study. Retention is defined as the percent of participants who completed both baseline and 6- week measures. Adherence is defined as the percent of participants who used 
taVNS 15 minutes a day once a day for 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints of acceptability include 
participant satisfaction and ability to complete the various mental health, blood draw and biologic measures with limited refusal, limited non -response, and within acceptable amounts of 
time. Tertiary en dpoints include mental health and biologic measures. Please see the outcomes 
measures section for detailed definitions.  
 All measures will be described using frequency/percent or mean (SD) as appropriate, overall and by [CONTACT_776992], with corresponding 95% confidence intervals to interpret the 
precision of the estimates. Median and interquartile range may also be used if discrete data are 
skewed. For the tertiary outcomes measuring mental health and biologic data, descriptive statistics for each time point, as well as differences over time (baseline to 8 week follow- up), will 
be calculated . Differences in biologic (non-inflammatory) outcomes only will be assessed from 
the first time point at baseline and the last time point at [ADDRESS_1067086] of taVNS on PTSD symptoms is mediated by [CONTACT_776993].  
 
 
9.3.2  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be tabulated using frequency tables and will include summary incidence rates for all causalities and for those possibly -related, probably- related, and definitely -
related to the study.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND S TUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT  DOCUMENT PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
For p re-screening purposes, participants will be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the research team 
from the information provided to the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP). 
Participants  will be asked a ser ies of questions regarding experiences they had responding to the 
WTC terrorist attacks in order to determine initial eligibility for study participation. Participants 
then will be asked to participate in an additional in-person interview to determine further 
eligibility for the study. If eligible, participants will be asked to take part and then will be enrolled in the research study.  
A consent form describing in detail the study purpose, study procedures, risks, and potential 
benefits is given to each participant. The study procedures will only commence after the individual has provided written informed consent for participation. There will be two separate consent forms, one for each aim.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 In order to participate in this study, each potential subject will be required to provide written informed consent themselves. After they sign and date the consent form, the witness and consenting investigator will also sign and date the consent form.     Consent for the RCT will be written. We will send the consent form ahead of time but this will be completed in person.  In all consent processes, the investigator authorized to obtain consent will have a discussion with 
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) to Reduce PTSD Symptoms in WTC Responders  
  
Protocol Number:  21-[ADDRESS_1067088] the opportunity to discuss participation further with family and/or advisors. If an individual joins the study by [CONTACT_65241], the subject will receive a signed copy of the consent form.  The consent process will be conducted in a quiet and private setting within the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research  or at the WTCHP . The entire process will be documented in enrollment 
notes that will be maintained in the regulatory binder along with the original copy of the signed IRB-approved consent form. 
  
25. WAIVER OF DOCUMENTATION HIPAA AUTHORIZATION (remote only)  
Prior to consenting into the study, participants will partake in a screener called the CAPS 
interview. Given the nature of the pandemic we will also have an  verbal authorization option that 
can be done remotely for the screener CAPS interview portion only. We are asking for a waiver of documentation of consent and HIPAA authorization for CAPS interviews done remotely only given the rising COVID cases and necessity to complete remotely. The coordinator will review with the participant and document this within the part [ADDRESS_1067089].  
This will be recorded in order to assure accuracy of results and criteria for 
inclusion/exclusion.  This is required in order to det ermine if a participant is eligible to be part of 
this clinical trial. These recordings will only be seen by [CONTACT_776995].  No one from outside of this protocol or health system would ever have access  to this.  
 
If the consent form is done over the phone, for the screener portion,  we will make sure that there are no distractions and the participant is able to have ample time to answer any questions and we

The Research Data Capture application, REDCap, a secure, HIPAA -compliant, web-based tool, 
will be used to create instruments for eligibility and recruitment tracking, survey questionnaires, 
and biological assessments. This application is accessible via the  web through a secure login. 
Survey questionnaire responses will be entered directly into REDCap by [CONTACT_776998]. Tracking and biological measures will be entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_776999]. Usage data from the taVNS wearable devices will be extracted from the cloud by [CONTACT_777000] 8 weeks. Usage data will be stored in a locked, electronic folder on a secure, HIPAA -compliant institutional server, accessible only to those approved to be part of the 
study by [CONTACT_55295]. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_777001]-in validation checks in REDCap, such as bounds on numeric data, inclusion criteria flags, and missing data flags.  
Adverse Events (AE)  
Aim 1 & 2: As per FIMR Office of Research Compliance (ORC) policies, the PIs are required to notify the ORC promptly of any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occur. The PIs will monitor the progress of the study and safety of participants on an ongoing basis. All serious AE (e.g., medical occurrences resulting in death) that occur during the study, defined by [CONTACT_62325], regardless of the relation to the research, must be reported to the 
ORC by [CONTACT_756], e-mail, or fax within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the 
occurrence of the event. The PIs will report Serious Adverse Events (SAE) to the ORC, and will disseminate information to other agencies (e.g., NIOSH) as necessary. Thes e initial reports are 
followed by a safety report, which is a written account of the serious AE determined by a 
sponsor/investigator to be both related to the treatment under investigation and to be unexpected 
in nature. Serious AEs will be summarized annually in the ORC application for continuation or termination of research.  
 
All adverse events not meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event will be captured on the 
case report form. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onse t, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention, and time of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. All adverse events occurring during the study will be documented appropriately

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
  For both Aim 1  where data is collected through a focus group and Aim 2  where data is collected 
via CAPS interview, self -report surveys and biological measurements, we will completely de-
identify transcripts and datasets in compliance with HIPAA guidelines.  This includes creating 
randomly generated encrypted identifiers and collapsing dates or ages. The data will either be uploaded into a database within Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a HIPAA -
compliant data management software or stored in a locked electronic folder stored on a secure HIPPA -compliant institutional server. Only necessary research staff will have access to both 
repositories of the data.  Recordings of the CAPS interview will be kept in a locked electronic folder stored on a secure 
HIPPA -compliant institutional serve r that only necessary research staff will have access to . 
 
The Research Data Capture application REDCap, a secure HIPAA -compliant web -based tool, 
will be used to create instruments for eligibility and recruitment tracking,  CAPS interview and 
survey data, and biological assessments. The randomization schema will also be uploaded to the 
randomization module in REDCap. This application is accessible via the web through a secure login. Survey questionnaire responses will be entered directly into REDCap by [CONTACT_777010]. Participant tracking information and biological measures will be entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_776999]. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_777001]-in validation checks in REDCap, such as bounds on numeric data, inclusion criteria flags, and missing data flags. Data from the taVNS wearable devices will be extracted from the cloud by [CONTACT_777011] 8 weeks and stored by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked electronic folder stored on a secure HIPAA -
compliant institutional server which will only be accessible to those approved to be part of the

Page 58 of 75 study by [CONTACT_777012]. Nesos ’s application runs on the locked down Android Nexus 5X 
or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_776956]. The Nesos  application is the 
only usable application. The phone is provided with the latest security patches and locked with a 
PIN. The application does not have any capability to capture any personally identifiable information. The application controls the Nesos  stimulator during treatment sessions. The only 
data collected are session metrics for evaluating usage adherence/compliance (user is intended to perform two 15 minute sessions per day for eight weeks). The phone is equipped with a Data-only SIM (no phone or SMS capabilities). This provides an Internet connection for the phone. Upon completion of treatment session, session metrics are transmitted from the application to the Nesos  Google Firestore database. This information is transmitted securely through an SSL 
connection. The application is only permitted write-only access to record treatment session compliance metrics. Stored data is backed -up and re plicated in a Google BigQuery database, this 
is done via a Google cloud function triggered by [CONTACT_777005]. The BigQuery database is accessible as a data source for Nesos ’s customized Google DataStudio dashboard. 
Data stored at rest is en crypted (https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption- at-rest/) and 
protected by [CONTACT_54834]’s infrastructure. Data stores are only available to Nesos ’s internal cloud 
administrator. The Nesos  dashboard is the only other means of accessing data. The dashboard i s 
customized to display usage compliance data for each of the site’s subjects labeled with their device number only. The dashboard cannot be used to modify any data nor does it have any data write access. No subject information is available nor stored. The dashboard is restricted in access and view only for the research team. Authentication is via a Google account that has been granted access to the dashboard. Both the Firestore and BigQuery databases are secured to prevent unauthenticated access. The Nesos  application on the phone is not generally available 
(i.e., not in the app store) and all phones containing the Nesos  application are collected at the end 
of the study.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 The study records will be retained for at least [ADDRESS_1067105], assess, categorize, and report all protocol deviations to the principal investigator, the Northwell Health Human Research Protection Program, and federal and state regulatory agencies as per their reporting requirements.

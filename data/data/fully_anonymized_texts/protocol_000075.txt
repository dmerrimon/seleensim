 A. Summary  
The prevalence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths have risen 
dramatically in recent years. Effective treatments, including medications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428] ( MOUDs; e.g., buprenorphine -naloxone and methadone) are under -utilized. 
Primary care offers an ideal setting in which to treat OUD; however, few clinicians are 
waivered to prescribe bupren orphine and of those who are waivered, less than one -third 
do prescribe. One potential barrier to increasing access to MOUDs is primary care 
clinician (PCC) stigma towards people with OUD. This study will use a randomized 
controlled trial design to examine  a novel intervention to reduce stigma towards people 
with OUD among PCCs. PCCs in clinics randomized in COMPUTE 2.0 to the 
intervention (in 15 of the 30 clinics randomized in the parent study) will be randomized 
1:1 to the stigma reduction or comparison t raining, stratified by [CONTACT_735054]. 
Training will be conducted via MyLearning, an online learning software. PCCs will be 
asked to complete a brief training on the clinical decision support (CDS) tool, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_734996] . PCCs in the stigma reductio n intervention will hear patient narratives designed 
to reduce stigma about patients with OUD. PCCs in the comparison training will not get 
any stigma content, but will have training on using the clinical decision support tool. 
Immediately following the tr aining, the PCCs will complete a survey of stigma beliefs and 
intentions to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. Use of the CDS will be monitored 
in both groups for 6 months.   
 
B. Background and Rationale  
Two-thirds of the more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the [LOCATION_002] in 2017 
involved an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], representing a 12% increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths from 2016.1 
Given the rise in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths, increasing the availability and uptake of 
efficacious treatments for OUD  is critical. However, only 20% of patients diagnosed with 
OUD seek treatment, and only 25% of those receive MOUDs .2 MOUDs, including 
buprenorphine and naltrexone, can be used to treat OUD in primary care settings, which 
could widely increase the availability of treatment.3 In response to guidelines published in 
2016 by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) on prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],4 
health systems are encouraging PCCs  to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_734997]. However, there is a shortage of clinicians waivered to prescribe buprenorphine; in 
April 2020, there were 85,875 waivered clinicians in the [LOCATION_002], representing less 
than 10% of US licensed p hysicians.[ADDRESS_1004403] a health condition.10 
Stigmas about a health condition occur when a person perceives a difference between 
themselves and the person with the health condition, which leads to disdain for that 
person.11,12 People with substance use disorders (SUDs) are more stigmatized than 
people with other conditions, including mental illness and physical disabilities.13,14 
Common stereotypes about people with SUDs include that they are to blame for their 
condition (a nd have personal control over their substance use), dangerous, unpredictable, 
have no job potential, and are criminals.15-[ADDRESS_1004404] of stigma on patients with SUDs, there is relatively little empi[INVESTIGATOR_734998]15 and OUD in particular.18 
Stigma is considered a “major driver” behind the lack of access to MOUDs, because of (1) 
the misconception that addiction is a volitional choice, not a dise ase; (2) the separation of 
addiction treatment from the rest of the medical system; (3) the language used for 
addiction (e.g., calling urine drug screens “clean” or “dirty” or patients “addicts” or 
“junkies”); and (4) the criminal justice system not includ ing medical judgment in the 
5 
 treatment of people with OUD (e.g., not allowing incarcerated patients to take 
MOUDs).19,20 Further, patients may avoid seeking treatment because they fear being 
labeled as an “addict.”15 Even within the SUD treatment community, taking a MOUD is 
stigmatized as a “crutch” or “trading one addiction for another.”21(p.328) Offering MOUDs in 
primary care has the potential to reduce stigma and to increase the likelihood that patients 
will seek treatment for OUD.22,[ADDRESS_1004405] people with OUD, one nationa lly representative study of over 1000 physicians 
found physicians hold many of the same stigma beliefs as the general public.24 In 
particular, the majo rity of physicians endorsed the belief that patients were individually 
responsible for their OUD (89%), desired social distance from people with OUD (not 
wanting a person with OUD to marry into the family [79%] or work with them on the job 
[77%]), and view ed patients with OUD as more dangerous (69%) than the general 
population.[ADDRESS_1004406] suggested that 
combining personal narratives from individuals being treated  with MOUDs with science -
based education about OUD and the benefit of MOUDs could be particularly impactful.19 
Additionally, clinicians can learn to “disentangle behavior from identity” by [CONTACT_735055] a treatable health condition and not a personal failing.[ADDRESS_1004407] been 
studied to reduce stigma of patients w ith SUDs among practicing healthcare 
clinicians,34,35 and both targeted SUD in general, not OUD specifically. Further, both used 
quasi -experimental designs without a control group. The current s tudy will use a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design embedded in a larger, multisite trial of a clinical 
decision support (CDS) tool to help PCCs identify, diagnose, and treat patients with 
OUD. The intervention will be time and cost efficient  by [CONTACT_735056][INVESTIGATOR_734999] e-Learning platform, a commonly used mode of delivery for delivering training  to 
practicing clinicians. However, we are unaware of any  stigma reduction interventions that 
have used this mode to deliver training to PCCs. Further, the intervention will incorporate 
patient narratives to combat commonly held stereotypes about people with OUD , provide 
evidence -based education about the effect iveness of MOUDs, and use person -first 
language (people who have OUD versus “addicts”) to reduce PCC stigma of patients 
with OUD. Previous stigma reduction interventions in PCCs have emphasized 
educational approaches, which have been shown to be less effec tive than patient 
contact [CONTACT_735057].[ADDRESS_1004408] tool and secondary outcomes of change in waiver status and, 
among waivered cli nicians, buprenorphine prescribing behavior.  
C. Objectives , Aims, & Hypotheses  
In response to NOT -OD-101: HEAL Initiative: Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) regarding 
the Availability of Administrative Supplements to Support Strategies to Reduce Stigma in 
Pain Management and OUD and Treatment, this project  will evaluate an intervention to 
reduce stigma in PCCs by [CONTACT_735058][INVESTIGATOR_735000]. PCCs will be randomized to this novel stigma reduction training, grounded in 
stigma science, or an attention -control training. The overall goal  of this project is to 
determine whether stigma reduction training reduces PCC stigma, increases intention to 
get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine  or to prescribe buprenorphine if a waiver were 
no longer required , and ultimately increases the likelihood that PCCs use Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208].  
Aim 1: To examine whether a PCC training to reduce stigma toward people with 
OUD, compared to an attention -control training, reduces stigma, increases 
intention to get waivered, increases intention to prescribe buprenorphine if a 
waiver were no longer requ ired, and increases the likelihood of using Opi[INVESTIGATOR_734996].  
H1a:  PCCs who are randomized to stigma reduction training will report less stigma 
towards patients with OUD compared to PCCs who are randomized to control 
training.  
H1b:  Among non -waivered PCCs, PC Cs who are randomized to stigma reduction 
training will report greater intention to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine than 
PCCs who are randomized to control training.  
H1c:  Among non -waivered PCCs, PCCs who are randomized to stigma reduction 
training will report greater intention to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in the next 
year if a waiver were no longer required than PCCs who are randomized to control 
training.  
H1d: PCCs  who are randomized to  stigma reduction training will use Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735001] a greater proportion of visits where the PCC is alerted to high risk than PCCs who 
are randomized to  control training.  
Aim 2: Examine the relationship between PCC stigma and intenti on to get 
waivered, and likelihood of using Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208].  
H2a:  Among non -waivered PCCs, PCCs who report lower stigma will report greater 
intention to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine.  
H2b:  PCCs who report lower stigma will be more likely to use Opi [INVESTIGATOR_735002].  
As secondary outcomes, we will gather additional objective measures of PCC behavior, 
including PCC prescribing and referral behavior and new waivers among previously non -
waivered PCCs. In secondary analyses, we will examine if  waiver status at the time of 
the intervention moderates the impact of the intervention on stigma attitudes and use of 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208]. Additionally, in exploratory analysis, we will examine  whether stigma 
mediates the effect of the intervention on Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735003]/or control  intervention increases the number of PCCs getting waivered or the 
number of patients receiving treatment (prescriptions or referrals for treatment) . Results 
of this work will inform future interv entions aimed at reducing stigma among PCCs for 
OUD and a variety of other stigmatized health conditions, including other SUDs.  
 
D. Study Parent Trial , Setting , and Design  
a. Parent Trial.  COMPUTE 2.0 is funded by [CONTACT_735059] (CTN -0095) to implement and test a web -based CDS tool 
(“Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208]”) that guides PCCs in the diagnosis and treatment of OUD. 
[ADDRESS_1004409] alerts PCCs to (a) patients at elevated risk for OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_735004] -based risk calculator, (b) patients with recent opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], and (c) 
patients with previously diagnosed OUD or MOUD or ders. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735005]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735006], including 
pregnancy or severe liver disease. It provides a one -page patient handout that 
summarizes treatment options for OUD, including key differences in MOUDs 
(buprenorphine, extended -release intramuscular naltrexone, methadone). For 
buprenorphine waivered PCCs, It provides step -by-step guidance on starting 
buprenorphine at -home or in -clinic, supported by [CONTACT_735060] -home dose escalation of buprenorphine for three different starting doses 
(see Figure [ADDRESS_1004410] screenshot). For all PCCs, it facilitates referrals to 
buprenorphine -waivered PCCs or specialty care colleagues. It also guides screening 
for common comorbid conditions, including depression, anxiety and infectious 
diseases, counseling for safe r use of intravenous drugs, and guidance for use of HIV 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The goal of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735007], access to clinical guideline s, and confidence in diagnosing OUD. With this 
supplement, we will be able to address the additional barrier of stigma. See CTN - 
0095 Protocol for specific details about the main study’s protocol . 
b. Study Setting. This administrative supplement will be implemented at 
HealthPartners. HealthPartners is the largest consumer -governed nonprofit 
healthcare organization in the country. HealthPartners has 55 primary care clinics 
and cares for more than 1.2 million patients in Minnesota and western Wisconsin. 
Patients are insured by a mix of insurance types, including Medicaid (12%), Medicare 
(12%), commercial insurance (60%) and others. At HealthPartners, approximately 
7% of PCCs are currently waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. This study will be 
conducted in t he [ADDRESS_1004411].  
c. Study Design. This study will use a randomized controlled trial design, in which 
PCCs will be randomized to receive one of two trainings deliver ed via MyLearning: a 
stigma reduction training or an attention control training. Outcome assessments will 
occur immediately following the training delivery (PCC initial survey), at 3 months 
following training completion (PCC follow -up survey) , and in the 6  months following 
the training (objective indicators of PCC Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735008], waivered clinician 
prescribing behavior, and waiver status). See Figure 1  for a schematic of the study 
flow.

E. Study Population  
a. Participants . Participants will be PCCs who  practice at HealthPartners Clinics  that 
have been previously randomized to the intervention arm of the parent study, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_734996]. There will be [ADDRESS_1004412] use and 
prescribing and/or referral behavior (in event referrals are made to waivered 
clinicians ).  
b. Inclusion and exclusion criteria . To be eligible for inclusion in this study, a PCC 
must practice at a study -eligible primary care clinic and be a family physician, general 
internist or adult -care non -obstetric nurse practitioner or physician assistant . PCCs 
are study -eligible regardless of whether they are waivered to prescribe 
buprenorphine.  
Sources or methods of recruitment . For the parent study, PCCs will have the 
opportunity to participate in a webinar about general training of the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735009]. This webinar  will include information about CDS alerts, printing the PCC and 
patient priorities, and using the tool within Ep ic’s (EHR) active guidelines. At the end 
of the webinar , all eligible PCCs in intervention clinics will be notified about the 
opportunity to participate in additional case -based training on using Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208], 
which they will receive an invitation to comp lete in their email. Up to three emails will 
be sent to PCCs  from the MyLearning platform  inviting them to participate in the 
training.  The email will provide an introduction to the study and the elements of 
consent. We may also use additional strategies t o encourage study participation, 
including asking clinic leaders to remind their PCCs to complete the training  and 
directly emailing a final reminder before the initial survey closes . See Appendix A  for 
recruitment email and Appendix B  for the consent docu ment . (Subsequent 
communications have been submitted separately as amendments.)   
PCCs who complete the initial training via MyLearning (either the stigma reduction 
training or the comparison [attention control]) will be emailed a follow -up survey 3 
months after they completed the initial training . PCCs will receive up to 4 emails to 
remind them to complete the follow -up sur vey. The recruitment email for the follow -
up survey is available in Appendix C . 
c. Incentives.  PCCs will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1004413] for completing the initial training 
and survey and a $[ADDRESS_1004414] (in 15 of the 30 clinics randomized in the parent study) will be randomized 1:1 
to the stigma redu ction or comparison training, stratified by [CONTACT_735054]. 
Randomization will be generated using SAS software.  
b. Methods for concealment of allocation . PCCs will be blind to their randomized 
MyLearning training assignment. The study statistician ( [CONTACT_360336]) will generate the 
randomization assignment , and a study team member will submit that list to HP 
MyLearning staff . Study team members capturing outcome data from surveys, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_734996], and Epic (including use rates, buprenorphine prescriptions) will also be blind 
to treatment assignment.  
 
G. The Interventions  
a. Intervention delivery. Both the stigma reduction intervention and the comparison 
intervention will be delivered via MyLearning, an online learning platform that is 
available at HealthPartners. This training will be interactive, as PCCs will have the 
opportunity to participate in a case -based training on how to use the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735010].  
b. Comm on intervention components in both trainings. General additional training  
in both groups will include science -based education about OUD and MOUDs and 
how to use Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46208], including where to review relevant chart history, making a 
diagnosis, choosing a  treatment option, conducting follow -up, and caring for 
comorbid conditions. Medical record details relevant for providing care to four 
prototype patients at risk for or with OUD, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and 
comorbid conditions, will be presented to demonstrate aspects of the CDS.  
c. Stigma Reduction Training. Contact [CONTACT_4490] a person sharing personal narratives 
(including a story of “on the way down” and “on the w ay up”) are the most powerful 
interventions to reduce public stigma of health conditions.38,[ADDRESS_1004415] described above, the stigma reduction intervention group will include 
patient narratives and recommendations for non -stigm atizing language. For example, 
one narrative is the story of a patient who developed OUD after taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_735011] . PCCs will hear this patient story (e.g., a video of the “patient” (actor) telling 
their story embedded in the training ), and the tr ainer will walk through how to use the 
CDS, including how to review relevant chart history, make a diagnosis, discuss 
treatment options, and conduct follow -up and care for comorbid conditions. The short 
narratives provide de -stigmatizing context and demons trate CDS applicability to 
diverse populations, in addition to demonstrating aspects of the CDS .  
d. Comparison (Control) Training  will include the general components as above but 
omits a stigma reduction component.[ADDRESS_1004416] see the EHR and 
the trainer will talk about the cases in generalities (e.g., “This is a patient who is 
coming in to the clinic who is at high risk  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].”).   
 
H. Outcome assessment  
a. Timing of outcome assessment.  Immediately following training, PCCs will be 
asked to complete a brief  (15-minute)  follow -up survey via REDCap, a secure data 
10 
 management software, to assess self-reported outcomes: stigma, waiver status, 
and, among non -waivered PCPs, intention to get waivered41 and intention to 
prescribe buprenorphine should a waiver no longer be required (see Appendix D). 
In addition, at 3 months following the training, PCCs will be asked to complete a 
follow -up survey via REDCap, to assess endurance of the stigma training on PCC 
stigma and intentions  (see Appendix E ). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735012] -data for each randomized clinician  for encounters that are eligible for the  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735013] . PCC prescribing (number of MOUD, naloxone, and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_735014]) and 
referral behavior will be extracted from the EHR.  We will pull patient demographic 
information from the EHR  to assess the extent to which provider behaviors differ 
across patient sub-groups, such as racial/ethnic groups, sex, and reason for 
intervention eligibility.  
b. Primary Outcome M easures  
i. OUD Stigma.  Stigma of people with OUD will be measured using the Difference  
and Disdain  scales, which measure stigma of people with mental illness and 
SUDs.11,12,42 This measure was chosen because people are more willing to state 
that people with a health condition are different from them than to endorse 
general stigmatizing beliefs, therefore reducing social desirability in stigma 
measurement.11 Three items measure difference (the extent to which a person 
with OUD is similar, like, or comparable to others) and three items measure 
disdain (people with OUD are not good, not respected, or not favorable 
compared to others). Items are scored on a 9 -point agreement scale; some 
items are reverse -scored so that higher scores reflect greater difference and 
disdain. Evidence suggests that the scales demonstrate good internal 
consistency12 and are positively associated.18 In addition, three items will assess 
blame  as a secondary outcome  (e.g., How responsible do you think a person 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_735015]? ).43,44 
ii. Intentions to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine.  Non-waivered PCCs 
will be asked to rate one question on their intentions to get waivered to prescribe 
buprenorphine: “How likely are you to get waivered to pres cribe buprenorphine 
in the next year?” PCCs will rate their response on a five -point Likert -type scale 
ranging from 1 ( I definitely will not ) to 5 ( I definitely will ). Behavioral intentions 
are commonly used proxies for behavior in behavioral science resea rch and 
were chosen as the primary outcome for H1 b and H2 a because of the time it 
may take for a PCC to complete the waiver training, which may not occur during 
the study observation period ([ADDRESS_1004417] training). Across a wide range of 
behaviors, modera te-large changes in behavioral intentions are associated with 
small -moderate changes in behavior.45 
iii. Intentions to prescribe buprenorph ine should a waiver no longer be 
required.  Non-waivered PCCs will be asked to rate one question on their 
intentions to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine: “ If your patient with OUD 
requested buprenorphine in the next year and a waiver were no longer r equired, 
would you prescribe buprenorphine?”  PCCs will rate their response on a five -
point Likert -type scale ranging from 1 ( I definitely would not ) to 5 ( I definitely 
would ). We have added this question given recent press reports that the federal 
government is considering no longer requiring a waiver to prescribe 
buprenorphine for physicians. Even if this potential rule change does not go into 
effect during this study, press  coverage of this potential change could influence 
clinicians’ intent to complete the waiver change (i.e., anticipating that soon it may 
no longer be required). The addition of this question provides a measure of intent 
to treat OUD with buprenorphine rega rdless of the waiver requirements at the 
time the question is answered. As noted above, moderate -to-large changes in 
[ADDRESS_1004418] use will be defined as taking action 
within the CDS tool, such as reviewing relevant chart history, screening for OUD, 
making a diagnosis, providing a referral or prescribing a medication, printing 
patient education materials, or prescribing naloxone. The use rates for each 
PCC for the follow -up period (6 months) will be calculated as the proportion of 
eligible visits in which Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735016]. This provides an objective 
measure of PCC behavior  with little social desirability bias.  
c. Secondary Outcome Measures  
i. Waivered PCC prescribing and referral behavior.  As an exploratory outcome , 
we will gather the rate of MOUD, naloxone, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_735017] (primary care and specialty addiction medicine) 
among eligible patients in the 12 months prior to the study and during the 6 -
month follow -up period to determine whether the stigma reduction  and/or control  
training affec ted change in prescribing behavior.  
ii. PCC w aiver status.  In addition to intentions to get waivered, change in waiver 
status will be collected as an exploratory outcome. A list of waivered PCCs will 
be pulled from HP administrative data to determine if additi onal PCCs became 
waivered during the follow -up period.  
iii. PCC willingness to work with people with OUD.  PCCs will report on their 
willingness to work with people with OUD using 3 items adapted from the Drug 
Problems Perceptions Questionnaire.46 PCCs will respond to each item using a 
5-point Likert -type scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 (strongly agree ). 
One item is reverse scored  (“I would enjoy my job more if I could stop working 
with patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]”)  and the items will be averaged for a total 
score, with higher scores corresponding to greater willingness to work with 
people with OUD.  
iv. PCC opi[INVESTIGATOR_735018].  Treatment outcome 
expectancies will be assessed using two items developed for this st udy. First, 
PCCs will rate the extent to which they believe available treatments are effective 
for treating OUD on a 4 -point Likert -type scale ranging from 1 ( not at all 
effective ) to 4 ( very effective ). The second item will ask PCCs to rate the extent 
they believe patients will comply with those treatments on a 4 -point Likert -type 
scale ranging from 1 ( not at all likely ) to 4 ( very likely ). Items will be analysed 
separately.  
v. PCC perceptions of the training  and the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735019]. In the initial 
survey, PCCs will provide feedback on the training in four questions, including 
their perception of the usefulness and ease of use of the training and their 
intentions to use the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735019]. At the [ADDRESS_1004419] in the future.  
d. Covariates  
i. Demographics . PCCs will report  on their demographic characteristics, including 
gender, age, race, ethnicity, and days per week in clinic  in the survey . 
HealthPartners administrative data will be used to determine clinician type 
(MD/DO, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant).  
12 
 ii. Frequency in addressing OUD . PCCs will report on the frequency with which 
they typi[INVESTIGATOR_735020]: How often do you 
treat patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_218291]? Response options will be on a 5 -point 
Likert -type scale ranging from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( daily). 
iii. PCC perceived vulnerability to OUD.  PCC perceived vulnerability to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_735021] 3 items. PCCs will rate the extent they 
agree with each statement on a 5-point Likert -type scale ranging from 1 ( strongly 
disagree ) to 5 (strongly agree ). One item will be reverse -scored (“If I were 
prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], there is a real risk I would become addicted”). Items will be 
averaged for a total score, with higher scores corresponding to lower perceived 
vulnerability to OUD.  
 
I. Post -recruitment retention strategies  
a. Participant retention . To encourage PCCs to complete the training, they will receive 
up to 4 reminders and will be offered a $100 incentive. We may also ask clinic 
leaders to remind PCCs to complete training. Further, PCCs will be offered an 
additional $[ADDRESS_1004420] and remind them about the survey. 
There may be volunteer bias in those who complete the training; however, this 
should not compromise internal validity as factor s that predict participation should be 
random across intervention assignment. We will describe differences between 
completers and non -completers (e.g., gender, PCC type, waiver status, clinic).  
b. Participant withdrawal . Participants may withdraw from the stu dy at any time. It is 
possible that they will not complete the training or the surveys . However, the training 
and surveys are designed to be short so they do not overburden participants.   
 
J. Risks, benefits, s afety monitoring and adverse events  
a. Risks to participants.  This study involves minimal risk. The primary risk to PCCs is 
the risk of loss of confidentiality. However, the study team will take multiple steps to 
reduce those risks. First, each PCC will be assigned a unique study identification 
number. Their identifying information will be stored separately from their study data, 
and only the study team will have access to any linkage files. Those files will be 
stored on a secure, HealthPartners server only accessible by [CONTACT_3476], and will 
primaril y be used to provide incentives to participants. Analytic data sets will not 
include any identifying information.  
b. Benefits. There are no direct benefits to participants in this study. However, the 
PCCs may find the training useful in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_735022], which 
could reduce frustration in learning a new EHR platform. One potential benefit is the 
knowledge of whether a training delivered via an online platform can incorporate 
patient narratives and ultimately reduce stigma among PCCs toward pe ople with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], which has the potential to increase the availability of treatment in 
this population.  
c. Data and safety monitoring . Given the minimal risk involved in this study, a data 
and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is not indicated for this study. The parent trial 
has an independent DSMB appointed by [CONTACT_735061].  
d. Adverse event reporting requirements . This is a minimal risk study. Adverse events 
and Serious Adverse events will not be  collected in the context of th is trial.  
 
[ADDRESS_1004421] platform. The study 
programmer will use that information to p ull data from the EHR. No MRNs or patient 
IDs will be retained in an analytic dataset.  
b. Quality control . Survey responses will be directly entered by [CONTACT_735062]. We will program REDCap to minimize non -viable or non -
allowable r esponses (e.g., limiting age to integers between 18 and 100).  Participants 
will only be allowed to choose one Likert -type response on scale items.  In addition, 
participants will be prompted to complete items that do not have a response, but will 
be allowed  to leave them blank if they choose to do so.  
c. Progress reports . During study recruitment phases (initial training and follow -up 
survey), we will use REDCap reports to generate study completion rates and to 
prompt reminders to complete the training and surv eys. The team will review the 
reports to determine if other strategies (e.g., reaching out to clinic leadership) are  
needed to boost recruitment and retention.  
 
L. Sample size  
There are 449 PCCs in the 30 clinics being considered for randomization to the parent 
study, COMPUTE 2.0,  with an average of 15 per clinic (range 4 -36). To the extent that 
the parent study will seek balance between treatment arms in clinic size, and by 
[CONTACT_735063], we estimate that [ADDRESS_1004422] estimated power for PCC participation rates of 50%, 
65%, and 80% with equal numbers of PCCs per arm. Approximately 93% of PCCs at HP 
are not waivered, which would reduce available sample size s for H1b and H1c to 208 
PCCs. The power analysis was calculated using G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_1004423] between groups for each outcome given availa ble 
sample size, α 2 = .05, and desired power (see Table 1). Given these assumptions, we 
will have the ability to detect moderate differences (80% power: d = 0.42 -0.55; RR=1.28 -
1.58) between the groups.  
For Aim 2, the regression models will include PCCs in both arms and up to 4 covariates. 
Given sample size, α 2 = .05, and desired power, we will have adequate power to detect 
small effects for H2 a (80% power: f2 = 0.05 -0.08) and moderate effects for H2 b (80% 
power: RR=1.29 -1.60).  
Table 1. Minimal detectable standardized effects based on PCC 
participation rate and desired power.  
PCC participation=  50%  65%  80%  
[ADDRESS_1004424] that PCCs in the stigma reduction intervention will 
report less stigma of people with OUD and greater intention s to get waivered and 
prescribe buprenorphine (among non -waivered PCCs), and will use Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735023] a 
greater proportion of eligible encounters. A generalized linear model framework will be 
used to test the Aim 1 hypotheses, using appropriate error distrib utions and link functions 
to normalize outcomes. For H1 a through H1c , the primary outcomes will be stigma  (H1a)  
and intentions to get waivered  (H1b) and to prescribe buprenorphine (H1c) , assessed 
immediately following the training; as a secondary outcome, we will examine whether the 
intervention has enduring effects on stigma and intentions by [CONTACT_735064] 3 -month follow -up survey. Secondary analyses will include an 
interaction term between intervention arm and waiver status to asse ss treatment 
heterogeneity.  
In Aim 2, multiple linear regression models, controlling for PCC characteristics (i.e., age, 
gender, PCC type [physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant], and waiver status 
[H2b only]) will be used to examine whether se lf-reported OUD stigma is related to (1) 
intention to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine and (2) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735008]. 
Secondary analyses will include an interaction term between stigma and waiver status to 
examine whether waiver status moderates the ass ociation between stigma and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735024].  
In secondary analysis, we will examine whether self -reported stigma mediates the effect 
of the intervention on Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735025]. If the intervention affects Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735008] 
(H1d), and stigma is related to Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735025] (H2 b), we will use a product of 
coefficients approach to quantify how much of the intervention effect is mediated by 
[CONTACT_121845]. In other exploratory analyses, we will examine whether PCCs in the stigma 
reduction arm prescribe MOUD  and /or naloxone to eligible patients at a higher rate than 
PCCs in the comparison arm, controlling for pre -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735026]. We 
will also examine whether PCCs in the stigma reduction arm prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_735027] a lower  rate than PCCs in the comparison arm, controlling for pre -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735028]. Further, as a follow -up to H1 b, we will examine whether 
PCCs in the stigma reduction arm are more likely to get waivered than control PCCs 
using a logistic regre ssion framework.  To understand how PCC experience with patients 
at high risk for problems with opi[INVESTIGATOR_735029], we will compare PCC prescribing and referral behaviors among PCCs who 
completed the trai ning to those who did not among all randomized PCCs.  
N. Ethical Aspects of RCTs  
a. Participant consent . At the beginning of the training module in MyLearning, PCCs 
will be given the consent form outlining the project, potential risks and benefits, and 
privacy an d confidentiality protections. Participants will have the opportunity to review 112 PCCs  146 PCCs  180 PCCs

O. RCT Management  
a. Registering the trial . This study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy and 
Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information and the Clinical 
Trials Registration and Results Information Submission rule. As such, this trial will be 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and results information from this trial will be submitted 
to ClinicalTrials.go v. In addition, every attempt will be made to publish results in peer -
reviewed journals.  
b. Research governance and good clinical practice . Study staff are required to 
complete institutionally required training per their research site, IRB(s), and 
authorities  with regulatory oversight. Training will include Human Subject Protection 
(HSP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as well as protocol -specific training.  
 
P. Reporting, Dissemination and Notification of results   
a. Trial Registration. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_46230], this trial will be registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, and results information from this trial will be submitted to 
ClinicalTrials.gov.   
b. Publication policy. We will publish results in peer -reviewed journals.  The planning, 
preparation and submission of publications will follow the policies of the Publications 
Committee of the CTN.  
c. Disseminating results to the public. As a result of our previous and ongoing OUD 
and mental health research, we have established communication channels with key 
stakeholders in our health system, as well as with external stakeholders, including 
the NIDA CTN, the Mental Health Research Network , the Midwest Research 
Network, and the Health Care Systems Research Network. We anticipate that our 
findings will be of significant interest to these groups, and we will disseminate our 
findings, methods and resources. We will share our findings immediate ly through 
presentations at local and national meetings. We will publish our findings in peer -
reviewed journals and communicate our findings to public media outlets.  
d. Data Sharing. The study investigators will share a limited de -identified data set used 
for primary outcome analysis with NIDA for NIDA’s Data Share website. The CTN 
DSC can assist the study investigators with providing the data set to the designated 
party to ensure de -identification, and for posting, storing, and archiving on NIDA’s 
Data Share website. Data Share is an online repository of data from studies funded 
by [CONTACT_735065]: https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/.  In addition, we have 
partnered with Konadu F okuo, PhD, an assistant professor in psychiatry at the 
University of Illinoi s at Chicago (UIC), who is interested in stigma of people with 
substance use disorders. We are finalizing  a data transfer agreement with UIC , and 
Dr. F okuo will be conducting secondary analyses on our data based on her interest in 
understanding how race/et hnicity interacts with stigma to affect willingness to treat 
people with OUD.

Comparing  Two Training Methods for  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735035]?  
The [LOCATION_002] is in an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466378] . Only a small percent of patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_46212] (OUD) get help.  As part of a larger study funded by  [CONTACT_735067] , we are examining the  impact of two different versions of a training for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735036]’ use of the tool and attitudes towards opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].   
 
We are asking  you to participate because  you are a clinician who practice s at a primary care 
clinic.  Up to 225 primary care clinicians  will participate in this study across 15 primary care 
clinics at HealthPartners and Park Nicollet.  
What will I be asked to do?  
You will be randomly assigned to receive version [ADDRESS_1004432] training (Group A) 
or version [ADDRESS_1004433] training  (Group B). You will be asked to do the following:  
1. Complete a case -based training on how to use the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735037] 4 different 
patient scenarios  that should take 25 - 35 minutes  
2. Comple te a 1 5-minute (online) survey on your experience with the training  and attitudes 
towards opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]  
3. Complete a 15-minute follow -up (online)  survey in [ADDRESS_1004434] opi[INVESTIGATOR_735038] ? 
This study is not expected to help you. We hope that your participation will help us 
understand how to deliver better trainings for clinical decision support tools in the future.

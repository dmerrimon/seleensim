EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
Endovascular treatment with platinum coils is safe and effective in preventing rebleeding of intracranial 
aneurysms.  Unfortunately, endovascular treatment has been associated with incomplete occlusion at initial treatment (remnant) or at follow -up (recurrence).  This in some studies has been as high as 33%.   
While many such aneurysm remnants or recurrences exhibit benign behavior, many require retreatment 
to prevent future hemorrhage.   
 
A recent randomized controlled trial of aneurysm coiling revealed that aneurysms between [ADDRESS_95906] 10 -caliber coils in 
achieving better composite outcomes, we propose the DELTA trial: Does Emboliza tion with Larger coils 
lead to better Treatment of Aneurysms trial, a randomized controlled blinded trial with 2 subgroups of 282 patients each, 564 total:  
 
 Subgroup 1: Coiled with a maximum proportion of 15 -caliber platinum coils  
                      ( including  Deltamaxx)  as conditions allow  
 Subgroup 2: Coiled with 10 -caliber platinum coils.  
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_87876] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_87877]  165 patients designed to verify the 
feasibility of the coiling strategy, compliance to treatment group allocation, the safety of an 15 -caliber 
platinum coil embolization strategy, recruitment rates, and the capacity to improve packing density (to 28%) with a standardized effect size (E/S) of 0.6, with a power of 9 5% and a two -sided alpha error of 
0.05 (assuming the packing density of the control group will be approximately 2 5%).

Hypotheses : 
  
Primary  Hypothesis  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]: 
The use of Deltamaxx, within a strategy of using larger caliber coils for 
small aneurysms (4 -12mm) will lead to a lesser number of incomplete 
occlusions at 12 months, as compared with smaller caliber 0.010 coils. 
The primary endpoint will be mainly composed of major angiographic 
recurrences or the presence of a ‘residual aneurysm’ as judged by [CONTACT_87889] 12 month.  
 Secondary  Endpoints : 
Secondary endpoints will include:  
 Major recurrence on 12- month follow -up angiography  
 Morbidity and mortality that precludes angiographic follow -up 
 Initial technical success of the coiling strategy  
 Packing density   
 Number of coils implanted.  
 Time of fluoroscopic exposure  
 Immediate angiograp hic results  
 Peri-p rocedural serious adverse events  
 mRS at 1 year follow -up

TION 1:   BACKGROUND  
Endovascular treatment  
Endovascular treatment with platinum coils is safe and effective in preventing rebleeding of intracranial 
aneurysms in the acute phase after subarachnoid haemorrhage; it is now the preferred method of treatment in many centers, because it can improve the outcome of patients as compared to surgical 
clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
2-6 While treatment of ruptured aneurysms is imperative to prevent rebleeding, the management 
of unruptured aneurysms remains controversial, because of a low annual risk of haemorrhage and a high 
surgical risk.7-8 An effective endovascular treatment could offer a less morbid alternative to surgical 
treatment of unruptured aneurysms and thus prevent the morbidity associated with SAH.7, 9 -11 
Unfortunately, endovascular treatment of aneurysms with coils has been associated with incomplete occlusion at initial treatment (remnant) or at follow -up (recurrence).  This in some studies has been as 
high as 20% -33% .   While many such aneurysm remnants or recurrences exhibit benign behavior, many 
require retreatment to prevent future hemorrhage.  This has been rare so far (in less than 1% of patients).
12-19 A multicenter registry has reported up to 15% retreatment rates 2 years after coiling of 
ruptured aneurysms, but a yearly re -rupture rate of only 0.20% after the first year. 2, [ADDRESS_95909] for small aneurysms with satisfactory packing 
densities, is compelling.33-37 Given the lack of scientific evidence that these new voluminous coils improve 
the clinical outcome of patients with small aneurysms ( ≤12mm)  treated endovascularly, we propose a 
randomized trial to address this question.

Mission Statement  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June [ADDRESS_95910], commercially available platinum coils. It aims to 
recruit 564 patients with ruptured or unruptured small and medium sized aneurysms (≥4 and ≤12 mm).  
The clinical impact will be of major significance if substantial differences are found in the outcome 
accord ing to a randomized procedure.  
SECTION 2:   THE PROPOSED TRIA L 
Design  
Delta is an investigator-initiated  multicenter randomized, single -blind controlled trial comparing [ADDRESS_95911] 10 -caliber coils in patients harboring small to medium size aneurysms . All 
patients with aneurysm ≥ 4 and ≤ 12 mm or wi th a recurrence will be eligible. Adjudication of 
angiographic results will be done by a committee blinded to treatment allocation in an independent core 
laboratory. The study will be conducted in 10- 25 centers. The study aims to enroll 564 patients equall y 
divided between the two groups ([ADDRESS_95912] 10 -caliber platinum coils), to 
obtain statistical significance in the primary endpoint, the occurrence of a recurrence at follow -up. The 
forecast duration of the study will be [ADDRESS_95913] 4 years for patient recruitment and accrual plus 12 months of follow -up. 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_87876] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_87877] 165 patients, over approximately 3 
years, designed to confirm the feasibility of the coiling strategy,  its safety, the enrolment rates, as well as 
to compare packing densities between the 2 groups.  
Hypotheses  
The use of 15 -caliber platinum coils will lead to a decrease in the number of patients that reach the 
primary endpoint from 33 to 20% at 12 ± [ADDRESS_95914] the hypothesis that  the use  of 15 -caliber platinum coils will 
lead to an increased packing density as compared to caliber 10 coils from an expected mean of 2 5% to 
28%  (95% power; alpha 0.0 5). 
 
Intervent ions  
The goal of the study is to assess if the use of voluminous [ADDRESS_95915] of either:  
A/ Standard, commercially available [ADDRESS_95916] techniques.  
Or  
B/ The use of the highest safely achievable proportion of 15 -caliber coils, including Del tamaxx, the 
operator being unrestricted in the use of the coil he/she believes is appropriate at any time during the procedure using standard or adjunct techniques.  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June [ADDRESS_95917] and therefore the clinical and interventional research team cannot be blinded to the 
nature of the coils used. However, the imaging center (core lab) that will determine the success of the 
procedure will be blinded during its evaluation.  
Although the mechanism evoked to support the potential benefit of 15 -caliber coils is an increase in 
‘packing density’, the trial does no t require the use of a minimal number or length of coils of either 
nature, nor to reach a certain packing density. To attempt to introduce more coils, even after angiographic exclusion of the lesion, to increase packing density, could be seen as taking unj ustified 
additional risks. The use of balloon assistance for coil deployment or stents deployed after coiling is 
authorized but will be recorded. Parent vessel occlusion concomitant to endosaccular coiling can be 
performed as long as it was not the procedu re’s primary intent.  
Selection criteria   
Inclusion criteria  
 At least one ruptured or unruptured aneurysms with a dimension ≥4 mm and ≤12 mm (longest 
axis)  
 For ruptured lesions, patients should be in WFNS grade < IV.  
 The anatomy of the lesion is such that endovascular treatment is possible with both types of coils (not necessarily certain or probable)  
 Patient is 18 or older  
 Life expectancy is more than 2 years  
Exclusion criteria  
 Patients with planned treatment of an associated cerebral arteriovenous malformations  
 When parent vessel occlusion, without simultaneous endosaccular coiling of the aneurysm, is the primary intent of the procedure  
 Any absolute contraindication to endovascular treatment, angiography, or anaesthesia such as severe allergies to contrast or medications

Treatments  
Patients allocated to caliber-15 coiling will preferably receive caliber-15 coils (perhaps including a caliber-
15 framing coil (or not), as many Deltamaxx filling coils as safely achievable, but the procedure can be 
comple ted with caliber- 10 or smaller finishing coils, in order to achieve as complete an occlusion as 
possible, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_87878].  
Patients allocated to caliber-10 coiling will preferably receive caliber-10 coils (perhaps including a caliber -
10 framing coil, caliber- 10 filling and finishing coils ), once more to achieve as complete an occlusion as 
possible, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_87878].  
Both group s will receive platinum  coils only.   Balloon -assisted or stent -assisted coil embol ization is 
permitted, but should be noted in the procedure CRF.    
Technical freedom  
The goal of the endovascular procedure is (as usual) to realize the most complete exclusion of the lesion 
that is judged to be possible, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_87879], using the randomization algorithm’s 
assigned embolization material. At any time during the procedure the interventionist is unrestricted in the use any device, technique or drug judged important to the safety and success of the endovascular 
procedu re.  
If a patient is randomized to [ADDRESS_95918] interests of the patient. The 
converse is also true.  In any such case, the operator details reasons on the endovascular treatment case report form. Analysis will be on an intention to treat and per- protocol basis.  
Randomization  
DELT A is designed with 1:1 randomization . 
  
A minimization algorithm will be used whether the ane urysm is ruptured or unruptured and previously 
treated or not (major recurrence).

Type, frequency and duration of follow -up 
For the analysis of the safety data, clinical examinations will be recorded at end of procedure, at 
discharge, and at the time of follow -up imaging (to 12 ± 2months). Follow -up CT -scan or MRI will be 
performed at [ADDRESS_95919] silent periprocedural events, as standardly p erformed 
in each institution. In certain cases, when patients are unable or unwilling to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_87880] -up visits information may be collected via telephone.  Also, Rankin scores may be obtained through 
phone interviews (using a standardiz ed questionnaire) by [CONTACT_87891].  
 
Adverse events will be recorded immediately after the procedure and during the [ADDRESS_95920] ed.  Then the relation to 
the aneurysm itself, to the endovascular coil embolization (not possibly or probably related) will be recorded. Clinical assessments will include the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 -12 months. Follow -up 
imaging studies will be pe rformed at 12 ( ±2) months by [CONTACT_87892] -invasive 
vascular imaging according to the preference of the participating center.  The commonly recommended [ADDRESS_95921] recurrences .

Outcomes  
Primary outcome  
The primary outcome determines the size of the population to be studied to reach statistical significance. 
Although the clinical significance of angiographic recurrences remains to be determined, the primary outcome cannot be limited to hemorrhagic events,  estimated to be quite rare, in the range of 0.1- 1% per 
year. New coils or embolic agents are meant to improve long- term results, including a reduction in the 
recurrence rate.   
Primary endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint will mainly consist in the occ urrence of a major recurrence or a residual 
aneurysm at the time of follow -up angiography at 12 ( ±2) months.  
An independent c ommittee will adjudicate, for each patient, whether he o r she has reached the endpoint.  
In the absence of  follow -up imaging, the committee will adjudicate other potential cases of treatment 
failures (expected to be rare) such as:  
 Hemorrhage during the follow -up period  
 Retreatment of the same lesion by [CONTACT_87893] -up 
period  
 Occurrence or progres sion of a mass effect in relation to the treated aneurysm  
 Morbidity and mortality that precludes follow -up 
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_87881] a difference of 3% in mean packing density between 
the 2 groups . 
Secondary outcomes:  
Secondary outcomes  include other indices of immediate treatment success as well as standard safety 
outcomes : 
 Procedure -related serious adverse events  
 Initial technical success of the coiling strategy  
 Use of adjunct devices.  
 Number and total length of coils implanted f or each type 
 Packing density (core -lab measured)  
 Time of fluoroscopic exposure  
 Immediate angiograhic results according to the Montreal scale  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June 23 , 2015                                                                Page 14 of 31 
 
 mRS at 1 year follow -up 
 Major recurrence on follow -up angiography  
 Morbidity and mortality that precludes angiographic follow -up 
 
Concerning radiographic evidence of recurrence, the angiographers at each participating center will 
ensure that best projections showing residual necks at the time of treatment are repeated dur ing follow -
up evaluations. For the purpose of this study, only major recurrences or residual aneurysms that are of a 
size that would ideally necessitate retreatment, as judged by [CONTACT_50338], will be counted. Angiographic 
results will also be scored according to a previously published classification system12 as complete 
obliteration, residual neck or residual aneurysm and groups will be compared initially and at follow -up at 
12 ± 2months.  
Recurrences will be recorded (present or absent) as they are discovered, at the routine follow- up 
assessments as clinical symptoms appear any time during the [ADDRESS_95922] a choice to use 15 -caliber coils 
only and/or other coils during the embolization procedure, in order to guaranty the same safety and immediate efficacy as the standard procedure. A study protocol deviation will be considered to have 
occurred if < 3 0% of coil length is 15 -caliber coils.  The initial technical success or failure of the procedure 
will be determined after treatment by [CONTACT_87894].  
Mortality  
The death rate will be recorded for the intent -to-treat analyses.  It will be obtained by [CONTACT_87895].  Mortality will be categorized as being a/ 
related to the illness, b/ related to coil embolization or c/ unrelated.  
Adverse events  
Adverse events will be recorded immediately after the procedure and during the 12 -month follow -up 
period.  Se rious  adverse events (SAE s), those that are life threatening, leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_87882], as well as unexpected events will all be reported within 48 hours to the data 
coordination centre that will transmit the information to the DSMC. The number and severity of all 
reported adverse events will be recorded for each patient and for each treatment group.  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June 23 , 2015                                                                Page 15 of 31 
 
Morbidity  
The number and the severity of morbid events per patient will be recorded for each patient.  The 
modified Rankin scale will be measured at follow -up appointments.  This scale classifies the patients 
according to their neurological outcome.39   
Sample size  
A decrease in the recurrence rate from 33 to 20% would be clinically significant. Based on Fisher’s Exact 
test, a total sample size of 512 patients would allow detecting such a difference with a power of 90% and 
an alpha error of 0.05 (Table 2). A sample size of [ADDRESS_95923] a decrease 
in the recurrence rate from 33 to 20% with an alpha error of 5% and  a beta error of 10%, allowing 10% of 
losses at determination of the primary endpoint

Summary Statements  
Group sample sizes of 256 in group one and 256 in group two achieve 90% power to detect a difference between the group propor tions of -
0.1300. The proportion in group one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.3300 under the null hypothesis and 0.2000 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the control group) is 0.3300. The test statistic used is the two -sided Fisher's Exact test. The significance 
level of the test was targeted at 0.0500.  
 
Recruitment rate and centres  
The targeted lesions are the most frequent  lesions treated in endovascular centres; thus we expect at 
least  10-20 patients per year per center. We need to recruit 20 -25 centers that wil l recruit 10 -20 
patients/year for 2 -3 years to reach the necessary sample size. Centers will be experienced in 
endovascular treatment of aneurysms (at least [ADDRESS_95924] been treated previously).  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June [ADDRESS_95925] deviations and range will be presented for 
quantitative variables and frequency tables for categorical variables.  Those statistics will be broken down  
by [CONTACT_2939].  Comparability of the groups will be assessed through independent ANOVAs 
(quantitative data) or Mantel-Haentzel and chi -square tests (categorical data). For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731], the 
number of patients with satisfactory immediate angiographic  results, as well as the mean packing density, 
will be compared between the 2 groups.  The primary outcome of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], recurrence rates (for both intent -to-treat end per -protocol populations) will be compared between groups through a z- test for 
independent proportions at 6 months and 12 months.  Secondary outcomes and safety data will be 
compared between groups through independent t -tests (quantitative variables) or chi- square statistics 
(categorical data). The analyses of neurological data at follow -up will control for baseline data when 
possible (for tests done before discharge and at follow -up) using logistic regression, ANCOVA or Cox 
regression multivariate models.  All tests will be interpreted with adjustment for the interim analysis to have the 0.[ADDRESS_95926] with alpha < 0.[ADDRESS_95927] size (E/S) of 0.6 0, with a po wer of 9 5% and a two -sided alpha error of 0.05 (assuming 
the packing density of the control group will be approximately 2 5%). The data will be reviewed and 
analyzed by [CONTACT_87896][INVESTIGATOR_87883].  
 
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June [ADDRESS_95928] approach to control for confounding and selection bias.  
Finally, control variables will be measured and compared between treatment groups in order to ensure 
group comparability (initial angiographic success, periprocedural events, and disease characteristics). 
Protocol compliance will be carefully monitored in every centre.  
Publication of research findings  
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_87897] (SC).  Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_87898].  
Regulatory considerations  
The study will only start after approval by [CONTACT_4707]/Institutional Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) of each centre. The study will be performed in accordance with the national regulatory 
requirements of each participating centre. Participants will be fully aware of the study purposes, the 
procedure and the risks of each inter vention.  When signing the study consent form, they will be informed 
that participation is voluntary and they can request to be withdrawn from the study at any time. Patient 
enrolment in this trial will comply with the principles enunciated in this Declaration of Helsinki*. All the 
information collected with the questionnaires will be kept confidential and will be used on an anonymous basis. 
* The Declaration of Helsinki (Document 17.C) is an official policy document of the World Medical 
Association, the global representative body for physicians. It was first adopted in 1964 (Helsinki, Finland) 
and revised in 1975 (Tokyo, Japan), 1983 (Venice, Italy), 1989 (Hong Kong), 1996 (Somerset -West, South 
Africa) and 2000 (Edinburgh, Scotland). Note of clarification on Paragraph [ADDRESS_95929] of the trial, and no access to the data will be granted until publication; the results will be published whether they are favorable or not, and publications will be fully independent and autonomous, but as authorized by [CONTACT_87899] 1. 8  |  June [ADDRESS_95930] access to the 
unmasked data before completion or interruption of the trial. The clinical events committee, the e ndpoint 
review committee, and the adverse event committee, once nominated, will work independently from the 
steering committee. These committees will regularly send progress reports, notices and warnings when 
appropriate, to the independent data and safety and monitori ng committee (D SMC ). The c ommittees that 
will have access to unmasked data are  limited to the adverse event committee, responsible for reviewing 
each adverse event, and the DSMC, any time members judge that unmasking of groups is mandatory to 
protect the safety of participants, or once they are convinced that significantly different results have 
occurred. The DSMC will follow the progress of the trial, results and events being masked (tagged as group A and B) at all times, but with the possibility of unmasking results in case of necessity. The DSMC will inform the steering committee if the trial should be interrupted if any concern arises during the trial. 
The steering committee will act according to the DSMC recommendations.

Other committees to be determined by [CONTACT_87900]. 
The steering committee will meet to monitor patient accrual, non -compliance with the protocol at 
individual centers, to act upon recommendations of the d ata and safety monitoring committee (DSMC).  
 
An independent DSMC  will be led by a neurologist not involved in the conduct of the trial. He will be 
assisted by 2 members: an interventionist and a statistician. The DSMC will be notified of all SA E reported 
by [CONTACT_941] c linical adjudication committee. Based on safety data, the DSMC may recommend that the s teering 
committee modify or stop the trial.  
 
The clinical adjudication committee will review all clinical events and use the criteria from Appendix 3 to 
evaluate if they correspond to the clinical primary outcome definitions (hemorrhage, retreatment or 
progressive mass effect) and secondary outcome definitions. It will communicate these results to the 
DMSC.

The imaging center (Core Lab) will be blinded. This committee will determine the angiographic success of 
the initial procedure as well as the presence of angiographic recurrences shown by [CONTACT_6492] -up studies. The 
committee will be composed of two neuroradiologists.  
 
The coordinating centre will be in Montreal (Centre de Recherche du CHUM, Hôpi[INVESTIGATOR_87875] -Dame). 
Periodic monitoring visits will be conducted all along the trial, or as needed. Data management will be done using a w eb-based application (Medscinet AB). The application is fully compliant with good clinical 
practice guidelines regarding electronic data transfer (US -FDA 21 CFR, part 11).  
 
SECTION 4:   GUIDELINES 
 
DELTA treatment plan 
1. Confirmation of an aneurysm ≥ 4mm and ≤ 12mm  
2. The aneurysm must be suitable for endovascular treatment by [CONTACT_87901] -invasive 
angiography (catheter angiography required if any doubt).  
3. There is uncertainty over the best method of treatment.  
4. For elective cases, outpatient visit for baseline medic al and neurological examination, including 
modified Rankin scale (mRS).  
5. Patient meets selection criteria.  
6. For elective cases, during this visit, the physician and/or assistant explain treatment options, 
uncertainty over the best option, the trial, rationa le for the trial and goals to the patient and family. 
If there is interest, documents and consent forms are handed to patient. Standard blood tests and a 
pregnancy test in women of childbearing age will be performed to exclude potential 
contraindications to endovascular treatment. Following verification that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the consent form and voluntary nature of participation into the study will be 
explained to the patient.  The patient and family will be offered to sign the consent form. At this 
time, the recruitment form is filled and randomization can proceed online.  
For ruptured aneurysms, the physician will explain the treatment options including surgery to the patient and relatives. If endovascular treatment is to be offered, the physician will explain the 
potential benefits of using voluminous coils in terms of reducing the recurrence rate. Following 
verification that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the consent form and voluntary nature of participation into  the study will be explained to the patient and relatives.  The patient and family 
will be offered to sign the consent form. At this time, the recruitment form is filled and randomization can proceed online.  
7. Randomization is automatic after the registratio n form is entered.  
DELTA  Protocol Version 1. 8  |  June 23 , 2015                                                                Page 22 of 31 
 
8. Elective patients are scheduled for treatment (within 1 -2 months). Ruptured cases are treated as 
soon as possible as generally done. Images are sent to the c oordinating centre.  
9. For all patients, a procedure form is completed following treatment. Pre and final images, as well as 
[ADDRESS_95931] scan, are sent to the coordinating centre.  
Discharge assessment form completed at the time of discharge . 
10. Severe adverse events are entered online or faxed within 48 hours to the coordinating centre. The coordination center will transmit the information to the clinical adjudication committee which will relay it to the DSMC. These events include haemorrhages, strokes related to the aneurysm, deaths, 
or further treatments of aneurysm.  
11. All patients will be followed at 6 and 12 months. Follow -up visits are crucial to assess any change in 
medical condition and to answer questions.   
12. For all patients, follow -up visits at 6 and 12 months and vascular imaging 12 ( ±2) months. Follow -up 
angiograp hy, catheter or non -invasive, is required. Images are sent to the coordination centre .  
 
Centre requirements  
1. Participating centres will be regional referral centre for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. They will have demonstrated a large experience in endovascular treatment of aneurysms (at least 
100 patients treated with safety records within acceptable limits (< 8% overall treatment -related 
complications; < 4% poor outcome at follow -up).  
2. The names of operators in each centre should be submitted to  the coordinating centre. The years 
of experience and number of aneurysms treated will be kept in a confidential centre log.  
3. The centre will identify a local coordinator who will be responsible for all data collection. This 
person will also be responsible for ensuring maintenance of the ascertainment log. A monthly 
return will be expected to the trial office.  
4. Investigators are committed to provide an appropriate environment and quality care that will minimize losses to follow -up. 
5. The approval of the local ethical committee must be obtained and copi[INVESTIGATOR_87886].  
6. Participants must sign the investigator agreement form.

APPENDIX 3: ADJUDICA TION OF OUTCOMES  
Primary outcome:  
An independent Committee will adjudicate, for each patient, whether he or she has reached th e 
endpoint.  In the absence of follow -up imaging, the c ommittee will adjudicate other potential cases of 
treatment failures (expected to be rare) such as:  
  Hemorrhage during the follow -up period  
  Retreatment of the same lesion by [CONTACT_87893] -up 
period  
  Occurrence or progression of a mass effect in relation to the treated aneurysm  
  Morbidity and mortality that precludes follow -up 
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_87881] a difference of 3% in mean packing density between 
the 2 groups. This will be measured by [CONTACT_87904]. For both types of treatment, the packing density (PD) 
will be calculated as the volume of coils (VC) over the volume of the aneurysm (VA): PD = VC/VA with VA = 
(4/3)π(length/2)( width /2)2 
 
Safety  
A.   Safety data  
Safety endpoints  
 Mortality  
 Morbidity (mRS ≥ 3)  
 Combined Mortality & Morbidity(M&M) (mRS ≥  3 at 1 2 months)  
 Serious Adverse Event  
 
Endpoint assessment  
 For all DELTA patients  
 Separately for ruptured and unruptured DELTA  patients  
 
Causality attribution  Treatment -related  
 Strictly treatment related: any M&M associated with a procedural event or complication or 
hemorrage  
 Possibly related: any M&M occurring within 30 days  
 Not treatment related (> 30 days)  
 Related to aneurysm  
 Unrelated  
 
Safety data will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_38366].

 Page 5 of 20 Revised: 1/19/2018  1.0 Objectives  
Primary objective: Determine the effect of  adipokines adiponectin and 
TNFa on the force of myometrial contractility in diabetic, non- obese 
pregnant women and obese, non- diabetic term pregnant womenat the time of 
scheduled cesarean delivery  
Secondary objectives:  
1. Compare the force of myometrial contractility in study groups compared 
to control group (non- DM, non -obese term pregnant patients) 
2. Investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of Progesterone (P4) and 
17a-Hydroxyprogesterone (HPC) on Adiponectin induced m yometrial 
contractility in control group. 
 
2.0 Background 
 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and obesity are two of the most 
important global health issues that are associated with significant fetal and 
maternal morbidity and mortality [1 -4].  
There is a consensus among researchers that the Caesarean section (CS) rate 
is higher in women with diabetes and obese women [5-7 ], with with reported 
rates of up to 67.4% in these populations [8].  
Some authors suggest that the increased CS rate is due to the confounding 
factor of obesity [ 9,10]; however, other analyses have found diabetes 
mellitus to be an independent risk for CS [11- 13]. 
The literature reports that at least half of indicated cesarean deliveries in a 
diabetic population are due to labor dystocia or failed induction of labor. 
This is true even when controlling for infant size. Post -partum hemorrhage is 
also six times more common in diabetic women, raising suspi[INVESTIGATOR_373472] y be impaired in this population [14,15].  
Therefore, poor myometrial contractility may be an important  factor 
contributing to the  increased CS rates . Further evidence to implicate poor 
myometrial contractility is that post- partum hemorrhage is six times mo re 
common in diabetic women  [15]. 
Obesity may alter the pregnant uterine contractility as well , and hence make 
the gestation period shorter or longer [16,17]  
Obesity was found to be an independent risk factor for emergency cesarean 
section (CS) delivery [18-23].

and obese pregnant patients 
PROTOCOL DATE: 02/26/2018  
 
 Page 6 of 20 Revised: 1/19/[ADDRESS_467708] stage at higher BMI 
categories[24] .  
A subsequent analysis of more than 230,[ADDRESS_467709] excessive blood loss which is also consistent with 
poor myometrial contractility [25].  This has subsequently been validated 
using in vitro evaluation of myometrium from obese women obtained at the 
time of scheduled cesarean delivery (Zhang et. al).  
  The mechanism of this change in myometrial contractility is not completely 
elucidated, however the increased adiposity in obese women has yielded a hypothesis.  Adipokines are defined as cell signaling mediators secreted by 
[CONTACT_373476] [26]. The adipose tissue is a multifunctional organ which secretes a large spectrum of adipokines.  These substances may act in a pro - 
or anti -inflammato ry manner.  In the inflammatory of states of diabetes and 
obesity, pro- inflammatory adipokines such as leptin, TNF- α, visfatin, and 
resistin are elevated, while the anti -inflammatory adipokine adiponectin is 
decreased in these populations.  This is true both in and outside of 
pregnancy.  The same adipokine profile is found in gestational diabetics [28-
30]. 
  
Smooth muscle in the vasculature is known to contain receptors for 
adipokines, and these substances have been shown to modulate smooth muscle contracti on in vascular smooth muscle.  Likewise , adipokine 
receptors are found in human myometrium, yielding an interesting potential mechanism for differences in myometrial contractility in an obese or diabetic population. Myometrial contractility in vitro has been shown to be 
modulated by [CONTACT_373477].  Pro- inflammatory adipokines, such as leptin and 
visfatin, have been shown to decrease myometrial contractility in 
vitro.Unpublished data from our group shows that adiponectin may act to 
stimulate myometrial contraction in vitro in an otherwise healthy population 
(manuscript submitted for publication currently)  If adiponectin increases 
myometrial contractility in a normal population, we hypothesize that this effect may be enhanced in a population known to be deficient in this 
substance.

3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
Eligible individuals will be recruited during their pre -natal clinic visits after 
they had been scheduled for a CS delivery.  They will be presented with the 
consent form, and HIPPA form for their review.  Eligible subjects will be 
recruited by [CONTACT_8355]- investigators.Those who agree to participate will 
be consented for the study upon their presentation for their scheduled CS 
delivery.  
Uterine muscle biopsies will be obtained from the upper aspect of a low 
transverse hysterotomy during the CS procedure after delivery of the fetus 
and placenta and prior to uterine incision closure.  The sample will be placed 
in physiologic buffer by [CONTACT_5984].  The sample will be given a number by [CONTACT_373478] (PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Paul Iaizzo) in the Mayo Building, University 
of Minnesota.  
 
 
4.0 Study Intervention(s)/In vestigational Agent(s)  
No intervention will be used directly on participants, however 
obtained myometrial biopsy will be tested for contractility in the 
presence of human adiponectin or TNF- α.  Chemicals will be 
purchased through the University

Screening and recruitment  
• Subjects undergoing cesarean section will identified through the C -
section schedule in EPIC and the schedule book in Labor and 
delivery. 
• Epic will be reviewed to identify subjects who opted out of research.  
• For subjects who did not opt out of research, o bstetric clinic progress 
noted, and vitals including BMI will be reviewed for the subjects 
undergoing C -section to determine eligibility.   
• Eligible participants (please see inclusion and exclusion criteria above) will be approached and recruited for the study by [CONTACT_373479]. Mustafa or [CONTACT_373491] during the subject clinic visits in Riverside 
Professional Building clinics . 
• Subjec ts will not be approached in clinic only after notifying their 
clinic provider who will ask for their permission to meet with the study team consenting them.  
•  During that clinic visit subjects will be given a copy of the consent 
form and HIPPA form.  
• The co nsent will be obtained subsequently upon presentation to labor 
and delivery for cesarean delivery.

 Page 9 of 20 Revised: 1/19/2018  • No local recruitment methods/ materials( e.g. advertisement) will be 
used  
• No payment will be given to participants  
 
Methods  
• Upon participants presentation for their scheduled CS delivery at the 
birth center, informed consent  will be obtained . 
• At the time of scheduled cesarean delivery, a strip of myometrium 
approximately 5 mm in diameter length will be collected from the 
upper border of the low transverse hysterotomy along its length.  
• The biopsy will be obtained by [CONTACT_373480].  
• The removal of this length of myometrial tissue will not significantly change the surgical procedure for the cesarean section. It is 
anticipated that the acquisition of this tissue will add approximately 
0.5-1 minute  to the surgical procedure, with a clinically insignificant 
incre ase in blood loss. Therefore, less than minimal increase in patient 
risk or outcome due to the acquisition of this tissue is anticipated, and the technique has been described in numerous publ ications previously 
for similar testing.  
 
• Myometrial tissue  will be immediately immersed in in physiologic 
Krebs buffer provided by [CONTACT_373481], labelled with a unique cod e assigned for each participant. Bionet registration is 
anticipated in a p ass-through fashion.  The sample will then be 
transported to the Visible Heart Lab immediately for testing.  
 
• Myometrial tissue biopsies will then be dissected free of serosa and connective tissue under light microscopy into multiple bundles approximately 2 cm in length and 2 mm in diameter. The longitudinal 
strips will be suspended in oxygenated physiologic Krebs solution 
isometrically at 37 degrees Celsius. Dilute oxytocin will be added to 
the tissue baths to induce contractions.  The muscle bundles will b e 
allowed to equilibrate for approximately 1 hour. Recordings of the force of contraction will be obtained over a one hour period, as 
previously described in similar studies [34, 35].  Data will be 
continuously recorded with a custom -built LabView interfac e.

PROTOCOL DATE: 02/26/2018  
 
 Page 10 of 20 Revised: 1/19/2018  • For gestational diabetic and obese groups, after one hour of baseline 
data is recorded, bundles will be assigned to adiponectin infusion, TNF -alpha infusion or saline infusion.  Force of contraction will again 
be continuously recorded for one hour.  
  
• Myometrial biopsies from the control group will be treated in 
duplicate  with Progesterone(P4) or 17a -hydroxyprogesterone (HPC). 
Those samples will be subsequently exposed to Adiponectin.  UtSMC 
with +/- Adiponectin will serve as positive and negative controls. IL -6 
will be measured in the culture media by [CONTACT_373482].

9.0 Local Number of Participants: 
20 controls, 20 gestational diabetics, and 20 obese women will be recruited.  
 
10.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if any clinically significant 
event or condition is uncovered during the surgery (e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or complicate 
the subject’s postsurgical course . Data will not be collected or used if 
participants were withdrawn from the study. Likewise, participants are free 
to withdraw their consent from the study at any time.  
 
 
11.0 Risks to Participants  
 
Myomet rial biopsies will be obtained after delivery of the fetus. So no risks 
are anticipated to the fetus.  
The removal of this length of myometrial tissue will not significantly change the surgical procedure for the cesarean section. It is anticipated that the acquisition of this tissue will add approximately 0.5 -1 minute to the surgical 
procedure, with a clinically insignificant increase in blood loss. Therefore, a 
minimal increase in patient risk or outcome due to the acquisition of this 
tissue is anticipated,  and the technique has been described in numerous 
publications previously for similar testing [36 -38]

compared in prior studies. No a priori data for this particular subset of 
patients are available, and as such a power calculation was not feasible. Sample size was determined using sample sizes f rom 
previous similar studies, and in accordance to resources available as 
well as number of patients available for recruitment. Using custom -
built MatLab software mean and median values for maximum

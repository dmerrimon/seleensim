[ADDRESS_376560]
 
Nursing homes are settings with a high rate of 
Staphylococcus aureus
 
(SA) acquisition, which leads to 
infection, particularly for short stay residents. The current standard of care for preventing SA acquisition and 
SA infection in nursing homes is Standard Precautions (gowns and gloves for 
anticipated
 
contact [CONTACT_166922], 
b
ody fluids, skin breakdown or mucous membranes) for all residents. 
 
We propose a feasibility study of a novel strategy, the 
addition
 
of targeted gown and glove use, to 
prevent SA acquisition and SA infection in residents of community
-
based nursing homes. O
ur novel strategy is 
based on prior research on the risk of transmission from residents to healthcare workers’
 
(HCWs)
 
gowns and 
gloves, the first step in SA transmission. Rather than wearing gowns and gloves for all care activities to prevent 
transmission 
(as in Contact [CONTACT_307595]), gown and glove use can be targeted to specific high risk “moments” 
of care for specific high risk residents. High risk “moments” for gown and glove use are care activities most 
likely to transmit SA to HCW clothing and hands (i
n the absence of gown and glove use)
 
based on prior 
research
.
 
(1, 2)
 
Residents with chronic wounds and medical devices are: 1) most likely to be colonized with 
SA; 2) most likely to acquire S
A; 3) most likely to transmit SA to HCW clothing and hands; and 4) most likely to 
develop a SA infection
 
based on prior research
 
(1
-
3)
 
and thus would be 
considered high risk residents
.
 
We will perform a quasi
-
experimental
 
(before
-
after)
 
study of this intervention
, 
targeted gown and glove 
use
,
 
at two community
-
based nursing homes to demonstrate its feasibility and evaluate its effect on SA 
acquisition and S
A infection rates. A quasi
-
experimental study design allows each nursing home to act as its 
own control
,
 
reducing variability. During a two month baseline period, we will measure SA acquisition and SA 
infection using surveillance cultures from residents an
d review of health care records. We will also assess 
gown and glove use for high risk care in high risk residents during the baseline period and begin to develop the 
intervention using a participatory human factor engineering informed approach. During a on
e month training 
period, we will begin phase implementation of the intervention in the nursing homes. During a two month 
intervention period, we will again measure SA acquisition and SA infection using surveillance cultures from 
residents and review of a s
tate
-
wide electronic health information repository. We will also assess gown and 
glove use for high risk care in high risk residents during the intervention period and evaluate the intervention. 
SA acquisition is an excellent measure of resident
-
to
-
residen
t SA transmission, which our intervention is 
designed to decrease. It is also a more frequent outcome than SA infection, increasing the power of our study 
to detect a difference if one exists. We will assess adherence with all components of the interventio
n and the 
change in gown and glove use between baseline and intervention periods.

Background
 
 
Rationale
 
Nursing homes are healthcare settings that house a high prevalence of people with both MRSA and 
MSSA colonization, creating a high risk for resident
-
to
-
resident transmission of 
Staphylococcus aureus
 
(SA). 
There is a 
mingling
 
of long term and short t
erm sta
y residents in community
-
based nursing homes which 
mix
 
a 
population recovering from acute illness with a chronically ill population which has high prevalence of SA 
colonization. For example, we found that short stay residents are at four
-
fold higher risk f
or MRSA acquisition 
than long stay residents. Once SA acquisition occurs, people are at higher risk for infection as colonization 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_307578]. Up to 30% of MRSA colonized p
atients develop an infection
 
contributing to 
community onset invasi
ve SA infections. 
N
ursing home stay was identified as a common risk factor for invasive 
MRSA infection a
fter recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].
 
Nursing home staff are the most frequent vector for SA transmission as their clothing and hands become 
contaminated with SA during the care of SA colonized residents. In contrast to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], where the standard of 
care for patients with MRSA is Contact [CONTACT_307595] (gowns and gloves for all patient contact
), community
-
based nursing homes typi[INVESTIGATOR_307579] (gowns and gloves for anticipated contact [CONTACT_166922], 
body fluids, skin breakdown or mucous membranes) for residents with MRSA. Prior research demonstrating 
high rates of MRSA acquisition in nursing homes suggests that Standard Precautions 
do not adequately 
r
educe the transmission of SA.
 
Contact [CONTACT_307596].
 
Nursing 
homes are resource
-
limited settings without the level of professional staff and 
laboratory 
infrastructure of 
hos
pi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In addition, nursing home staff have deeply rooted beliefs that Contact [CONTACT_307597]. There is a clear need for a solution 
-
 
tailored to the nursing home setting 
-
 
to reduce the risk of SA 
(and other antibiotic resistant bacteri
a) acquisition and infection.
 
Our goal in this 
project
 
is to demonstrate the 
feasibility of a novel intervention, targeted gown and glove use, to decrease SA acquisition and SA infection as 
a precursor for a future multisi
te stepped wedge cluster trial
.
 
 
Po
pulation
 
Study participants will be 
nursing home (NH) 
residents and 
staff
 
in 
participating 
community
-
based 
NH
 
study sites. 
All study activities will occur in the participating 
community
-
based 
NH
 
study sites.
 
 
Risk/Benefits
 
The risks related to this study are minimal 
–
 
the same as that encountered in daily life or at a routine 
doctor's visit. 
There are two types of participants, 
NH
 
residents and 
staff
. The two types of participants have 
different risks
 
which we have minimized
.
 
Potential risks to 
resident 
participants include those associated with 
non
-
invasive
 
cultures (anterior nares
 
and inguinal fold skin
) and the loss of confidentiality of individual health information collected as part of the 
study.  
 
We will minimize these risks as follows
. 
Resident participants 
will b
e educated on how the cultures 
are 
performed at the time of enrollment to reduc
e any p
sychological discomfort.
 
Study coordinators will have 
competencies in doing these procedures and will use gentle pressure to reduce possible irritation or discomfort 
during from the culture procedures.
 
 
Access to study records will be restricted to study s
taff, investigators and 
officials of 
the
 
Office of Human 
Research Protecti
ons
.
 
Every effort will be made to keep the study records confidential through the 
use of 
locked briefcases for transport of paper records, 
assignments of unique participant identifiers, password 
protected databases and storage of paper records in locked filing cabinets
 
in rooms that are locked when not in 
use (see 
11. Data 
H
andling and 
Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_307580])
. 
 
There are few, if any potential risks to 
staff
. 
Staff
 
will be observed during routine care in order to estimate 
gown and glove use. 
A number of 
staff
 
will be shadowed in order to determine how to best implement the 
intervention
, targeted gown and glove use
. A few 
staff
 
will serve as liaisons to the project team. All 
staff
 
will 
wear 
disposable
 
gowns and 
non
-
latex 
gloves
 
while providing 
specific 
care for 
specific
 
residents
 
during the 
intervention period
. 
Wearing g
owns and gloves are part of Standard 
(

P
recautions for certain 
care activities and 
pose

staff
. 
We will not collect any

staff
 
and thus there 
is no risk of lo
ss of confidentiality.

Objective 1
: To implement a targeted gown and glove intervention in two 
community
-
based nursing 
homes.
 
 
Expected Outcome 1
: A targeted gown and glove intervention can be successfully implemented across 
two community
-
based nursing homes with >80% compliance with gown and glove use for high risk care 
in high risk residents.
 
Obje
ctive 2
: To evaluate the impact of a targeted gown and glove intervention on SA acquisition and SA 
infection rates. 
 
Expected Outcome 2a
: The intervention will decrease SA acquisition and infection rates.
 
Expected Outcome 2b
: We will determine the effect s
ize to guide the design (including the sample size) 
of a future trial.
 
Objective 3
: To develop an implementation “toolkit” that can be easily adapted and implemented at 
nursing homes in a future trial. 
 
Expected Outcome 3
: Barriers to and 
strategies for implementation of the targeted gown and glove 
intervention will be identified leading to modification of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_307581] “toolkit” for a future trial.
 
 
Study Design
 
 
Primary Study Endpoints/Secondary
 
Endpoints
 
Outcome 1: Compliance with each component of the intervention (identification and flagging of high risk 
residents, use of gowns and gloves for high risk care) based on 1) weekly point prevalence studies for high risk 
residents and 2) weekly obse
rvations of high risk care interactions with 5
-
10 residents over the 2
-
month 
intervention periods. There will also be weekly observations of high risk care interaction of 5
-
10 residents over 
the 2
-
month baseline period to assess the change in gown and glov
e use.
 
 
Outcome 2a: The primary outcome will be a change in SA acquisition rates comparing baseline and 
intervention periods. 
R
esidents in the nursing home will be swabbed at the start of the study peri
od, or when 
they are admitted. 
Then they will all be re
-
swabbed at discharge or when the study ends. Acquisition will be 
defined as a positive culture for 
a new 
SA in a resident who was negative for 
that 
SA at the start of the study 
period or admission. Cu
ltures will be performed in the research lab using well established methods. 
Specimens 
will be saved for future evaluation of other bacteria. 
The secondary outcome will be invasive SA infections 
and 
other infections 
within 90 days of nursing home admission
 
in residents as detected through 
surveillance from 
health care records including but not limited to 
CRISP, a state
-
wide central repository of health care records 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307582].
 
 
Outcome 2b: The observed SA acquisi
tion rate reduction from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_307583]
e size for a larger trial.

Outcome 3: We will qualitatively examine the acceptability of, and any barriers to implementation using broad 
stakehold
er feedback. Elements found to be infeasible or unacceptable will be modified at each stage and an 
implementation toolkit will be developed for the future trial. 
 
 
Study Design/Type
 
Study Design
 
 
We will use a quasi
-
experimental study of 
a targeted gown and glove
 
intervention 
(
described below
)
 
with each nursing home acting as its own control to reduce between nursing home variability.
 
 
Intervention
 
Our novel strategy is based on extensive prior research 
on the risk of 
S. aureus
 
(
SA
)
 
transmission from residents to 
staff
 
gown and gloves during care interactions, the first step in 
transmission. Our prior work suggest
s
 
a novel, evidence
-
based 
appr
oach to preventing SA transmission and SA acquisition: 
targeted gown and glove use
. Rather than wearing gowns and 
gloves for all care activities, gown and glove use could be 
targeted at a) specific high risk “moments” while caring for b) 
high risk resident
s. The 
staff
 
interactions targeted for gown and 
glove use are those most likely to transmit SA to 
staff
 
clothing 
and hands
 
based on prior 
research
. The targeted gown and glove use is in addition to Standard 
Precautions for all residents. The residents targ
eted are both long and short 
stay residents and are: 1) most likely to be colonized with SA; 2) most likely 
to acquire SA; 3) most likely to transmit SA to 
staff
 
clothing and hands; and 
4) most likely to develop a SA infection
 
based on prior research
. 
 
 
Implementation Strategy
 
W
e wil
l use a participatory approach
 
to develop, implement, and evaluate the intervention. In other 
words, we will actively involve multiple stakeholders, including front
-
line staff and nursing home leaders in all 
stages of the proj
ect, including design, 
implementation, and evaluation.
 
 
For the intervention, gown and gloves will be used for high risk care in high risk residents. 
Implementation will require the following steps: identification and flagging of 
high risk 
residents, then 
making 
acceptable gowns and gloves available at point of care. We will engage stakeholders including nursing home 
administrative and clinical staff, residents and family in these steps. We will develop separate human
-
factors 
engineering informed educationa
l materials for staff, residents and family members, incorporating the feedback 
from our prior focus groups
 
(4)
 
and considering the well
-
known usability engineering (usefulness + ease of 
use) principles to i
ncreas
e acceptability and use.
 
Phased assessment of the implementation of this intervention 
will be performed with modification at each step. 
 
We will use the existing quality improvement infrastructure in each of the two nursing homes to actively 
involve and obtain input from multiple key stakeholders (nursing assistants, nurses, nurse manager, 
and other
 
leaders) about the intervention and imple
mentation toolkit. Each nursing home has 
regular
 
quality improvement 
meetings attended by [CONTACT_307598]. 
The staff member responsible for infection control at the nursing home 
and a human factors expert from the research team will attend these meetings.
 
In these meetings, we will first 
introduce the intervention idea and any evidence supporting the intervention and will seek input and active 
involvement of health care workers in detailing the intervention and implementation plan. We will use this same 
me
chanism to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the intervention and implementation toolkit. 
 
We will conduct direct observations of nursing assistants’ and nurses
’
 
use of gowns and gloves for 
residents
 
with wounds and/or devices before (for informing the i
ntervention design and implementation 
process) and after implementing the intervention (for conducting qualitative evaluation of the intervention and 
how to improve the intervention/implementation package). Before implementation, we will conduct direct 
obs
ervations in order to: (1) understand the baseline process and workflow; (2) identify necessary changes in 
work system design and workflow to make it easy for HCWs to comply with the new targeted gown and glove

intervention; and (3) identify any potential 
barriers before implementation to take the necessary precautions. 
We will develop an observation instrument based existing literature, and input from multidisciplinary 
stakeholders. We will form two
-
person teams consisting of a team member with infection c
ontrol certification 
and a human factors engineer who will shadow a 
HCW
 
while taking care of 
high risk residents
. Based on 
preliminary studies and our previous research experience using this type of methodology, we expect to reach 
theoretical saturation af
ter observing five 
HCW
, on different days and shifts, while they perform activities that 
require gowns and gloves (based on current standard of care), each for 2
-
4 times. After implementation, we 
will use a similar methodology to observe a comparable numbe
r of 
HCW
 
to identify any barriers to compliance 
with the new targeted gown and glove intervention and any workarounds/strategies they developed to 
overcome the barriers. These findings and learnings will be key for improving our intervention and 
implementa
tion toolkit for future large
-
scale implementation efforts. 
 
In this
 
participatory approach, we will identify 2
-
3 HCWs (e.g. 2 nursing assistants, 1 nurse) from each 
nursing home to be liaisons to our research team. Our research team member with infection 
control 
certification and human factors experts will work closely with these HCWs, through regular meetings, in every 
phase of the study, including design, implementation and evaluation. For example, before implementation, 
these HCWs will be asked to descr
ibe the nursing assistant workflow and provide input on how to redesign the 
“nursing home work system” (e.g., best locations to store gowns and gloves, alternatives approaches to 
flagging eligible patients, and design characteristics of effective visual cu
es to flag high risk patients) to ensure 
successful implementation of the intervention
.
 
 
 
Duration
 
Each of two nursing homes will participate for a period of approximately 
6
 
months. 
After an initial month 
of engagement, the next
 
2 months will be a baseline data collection period; the next [ADDRESS_376564] team. All HCW will wear 
disposable gowns and non
-
latex gloves while providing specific care for specific resident
s during the 
intervention period.

Waiver of 
Informed Consent for Residents
 
 
Waiver of Informed Consent
 
We are requesting 
a waiver of informed consent for 
residents
 
participating in 
this study. Under 45 CFR 
46.116(d), the IRB "may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, some or all of 
the elements of informed consent” or waive the requirement to obtain consent all together, provided that:
 
1.
 
The research involves no more than minimal risk to the participants;
 
2.
 
The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants;
 
3.
 
The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and
 
4.
 
Whe
never appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation; and
 
5.
 
The research is not FDA
-
regulated.
 
We are requesting a waiver of consent for this study population for the following reasons:
 
1.
 
The study will
 
involve no more than minimal risk of harm to 
participants
 
See 
1.3 Risks/
Benefits
.
 
 
2.
 
The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.
  
 
Current nursing home accreditation standards mandate that equal, high quality care be 
provided to 
all patients, whether or not they are on contact [CONTACT_307600]. All residents will receive the same high 
quality care during the study.
 
3.
 
The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver. 
 
To adequately evaluate
 
the study outcom
es, it is 
important
 
that all or nearly all residents are included 
in the study. Obtaining authorization from 100% of residents is not pr
actical in a nursing home
 
because many residents lack decision making capacity
. Contact[CONTACT_30697] 100% of legally authorized 
re
presentatives to obtain proxy authorization would also not be possible within the time constraints of 
the study given residents should be cultured
 
within [ADDRESS_376566] the surveillance cultures performed
. If during the surveillance cultures, a 
resident exhibits a negative response to specimen collection, the procedure will be stopped.
 
 
Waiver of HIPAA Authorization
 
This study meets the criteria for a waiver or alteration of HIPAA under 45 CFR 
164.512(i)(2)(ii) as 
described below. The waiver for 
recruitment
 
is to allow research staff to discuss the resident with NH staff to 
determine eligibility criteria. Residents who are identified by [CONTACT_307601]
 
 
[ADDRESS_376567]
s
 
of
 
all residents at participating facilities. 
This information includes
:
 
demographics (ex. 
age, gender, ethnic and racial category
)
, 
length of stay
, level of 
care, 
recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], activities of daily living, case mix ind
ex, 
facility characteristics, skin breakdown, 
medical devices
, recent antibiotic use
 
and 
co
-
morbidities
. Resident identifiers will be collected on case report 
forms to facilitate collection; however, no resident identifiers will be entered into the study d
atabase
 
for non
-
enrolled residents
; instead, a unique identifier or code will be assigned to each resident.
 
 
This study meets the requirements for waiver or alteration of HIPAA under 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2)(ii): 
 
A.
 
Use or disclosure involves no more than minima
l risk to the privacy of individuals because of the 
presence of at least the following elements:
 
1.
 
An adequate plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use or disclosure,
 
2.
 
An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest 
opportunity absent a health or research 
justification or legal requirement to retain them, and
 
3.
 
Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be used or disclosed to a third party except 
as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study
, or for other research uses 
and disclosures permitted by [CONTACT_307602]. All study data 
collected at the NHs will be recorded on case report forms. These case report forms will be
 
entered into a password protected relational database which will be kept on a research server 
which has a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by [CONTACT_307603]. Clinical data on study participants will be obtained
 
electronically from the 
participating NHs and upl
oaded into the study database. 
Data regarding 
S. aureus
 
infections 
will be sourced from a state
-
wide electronic health information repository and entered into the 
study database. Paper records will be store
d in locked filing cabinets in a protected space. 
Data will be maintained on a secure electronic central database on a research server. Data 
will be backed up according to the network backup schedule.
 
A unique identifier or code will be assigned to each re
sident participant. Bacterial 
isolates and culture specimens and datasets used for analysis will be labeled with this code. 
Only the study personnel who directly interact with subject or manage the subject’s clinical 
protocol data will have access to parti
cipant identifying information. Culture data will be 
entered directly into the relational database; however, microbiology laboratory personnel will 
not have access to participant identifiers in the database. Study personnel who leave the 
research team will
 
have their access to study data removed. 
 
As soon as permitted and when all data analyses are complete and have been 
published, source documents containing identifiable information will be shredded and 
identifying information will be removed from the data
base. During the entire study, all data will 
be 
managed
 
centrally at the primary site. There will be a single data table which maintains the 
link between the unique code and patient identifiers. This table containing the link between 
code and identifying i
nformation will be 
destroyed
 
on the server and in any backups when it is 
time to de
-
identify the database. If any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_307584], they will be 
shredded. PHI will not be shared or disclosed unless required by [CONTACT_2371].
 
B.
 
Research could not
 
practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration
 
To adequately evaluation the study outcomes, it is 
critical
 
that all or nearly all reside
nts are included 
in the study. 
Obtaining authorization from 100% of residents is not practical in a nursing 
home due to 
many
 
residents’ 
lack of decision making capacity
. 
Requiring authorization 
w
ould bias the estimate of 
acquisition of 
SA
 
since more ill 
residents
 
will be less likely to provide authorization but may be more 
likely to acquire 
SA
.
 
C.
 
Research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of PHI
 
To adequately evaluat
e
 
the study outcomes, it is critical that we include basic 
clinical
 
information 
as 
described in 
[ADDRESS_376568] the SA acqui
si
t
io
n, an outcome 
variable and other data which will allow us to describe our population in aggregate.
 
 
Informed Consent for 
Health Care Workers (
HCWs
)
 
HCWs 
will
 
participate in a number of ways. 
1) Up to [ADDRESS_376569] implement the intervention, targeted gown and glove use. 
2) 
Up to [ADDRESS_376570] team. 
3) 
HCWs will be observed during routine care in order to estimate gown and glove use. 
4) 
All 
staff
 
will wear disposable gowns and non
-
latex gloves while providing specific care for specific residents during 
the intervention period.
 
We request 
a 
waiver of documentation of informed consent
 
(verbal/oral consent) for healthcare workers
 
who are 
involved as 
research team 
liaisons
 
or 
in 
shadowing to help
 
develop this 
infection control intervention
. 
This is a minimal risk study in which 
staff
 
are being asked to participate as stakeholders in the development of 
an infection control intervention
. The information collected 
is
 
anonymous. If we were to use a consent 
document, the signed document would be 
the 
only 
link
 
between
 
the healthcare worker 
and the
 
information
.
 
 
We will not obtain 
informed
 
consent for our observations of gown and glove use or the routine use of 
gown and gloves for providing specific care for specific residents during the intervention period because this 
will be standard pract
ice in the nursing home
 
as agreed upon by 
[CONTACT_307604]
 
(see below, 
7.1 
Recruitment Process
)
.
 
 
Recruitment Process
 
HCWs will be recruited through participating 
NHs
. Prior to study commencement at a 
NH
, a meeting will 
be scheduled with facility/unit administrators at each prospective 
NH
. Upon confirming their agreement to 
participate, we will 
meet with 
unit 
nurse managers
 
and medical providers
, 
distribute
 
a
 
study information sheet
 
for nursing home staff
 
to all HCWs
 
at that facility that interact with residents and provide a phone number for 
follow
-
up. We will also present at 
a
 
staff meeting to explain study procedures, answer questions and address 
concerns. 
 
 
Informed Consent Process for Health Care Worke
rs
 
Prior to study start in the NH, research staff will describe the study at a staff meeting. 
R
esearch staff
 
will 
introduce themselves, briefly 
re
-
explain the study and ask the healthcare worker if he/she would like to 
participate in a research study being conducted by 
[CONTACT_978]
 
[INVESTIGATOR_307585] a project team 
liaison
. The 
staff member
 
will make clear that participation is voluntary
 
and there will be no repercussions for 
not participating. The 
staff member 
will explain the procedure of 
shadowing the HCW in order to determine the 
best way to implement this intervention
 
or what will be involved in being a project team liaison
. 
As part 
of being 
a project team liaison, meetings or discussion may be recorded. 
The 
staff member 
will also explain that we are 
not collecting any identifiable information and any results will not be linked to the individual 
staff member
. The 
staff member 
will off
er to answer any questions and will offer contact [CONTACT_307605].

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
as defined by [CONTACT_307606]. 
 
 
Attribution of Adverse Events
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307586]. The following scale will 
assess the relationship of AEs to the 
study procedures
:
 

 
Not related: no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or the 
st
udy 
procedures
 
cannot be implicated
 

 
Possibly related: temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however 
involvement of the 
study procedures
 
cannot be excluded
 

 
Probably related: temporal association, other etiologies are possibl
e but unlikely
 

 
Related: established temporal or other association for event not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s 
known clinical state or any other factor
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Serious Adverse Events that are 
more likely than not (
probably or 
definitely
)
 
related to the research will 
be reported 
immediately
 
of the site investigator becoming aware of the SAE to the local 
IRB
 
according to 
established IRB policy
.
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307587] 
a
dverse event affects the Risk/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modification to the protocol 
is
 
required.
 
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a review of all 
serious 
adverse events annually. 
The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307588]. A summary of the 
serious 
adverse events will be reported to the UMB 
IRB annually, when renewal is 
sought. 
 
 
Statistical Plan
 
 
Data Analysis, Sample Size, and Precision
 
For objective 1, we will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the rates of 
compliance with each component of the intervention (identification and flagging of high ris
k residents, use of 
gowns and gloves for high risk care) as well as the change in gown and glove use for high risk care during the 
baseline and intervention periods. We will observe 40
-
80 encounters per nursing home where gowns and 
glove should be used whi
ch will result an estimate of the rate of compliance that is accurate +/
-
 
8
-
10 
percentage points.
 
Preventing the Spread of Infecti
on in Nursing Homes

For objective 2, we will estimate and compare the rates of transmission in the baseline and intervention 
periods in each nursing home. To estimate the rates f
rom binary data, we note that the risk that a person 
acquires the infection in the interval between swabs can be written as 1
-
exp(
-
λt) where “t” is the number of 
days between swabs and λ is interpretable as the daily rate of acquisition. We will estimate λ
 
in the baseline 
and intervention periods using maximum likelihood estimation and compare the two rates. Likelihood methods 
will be used to calculate a confidence interval for the ratio of the rates. This will be done for each nursing home 
separately. We w
ill test 100 residents per nursing home per period which will result an estimate of the rate of 
acquisition that is accurate +/
-
 
[ADDRESS_376573] observation. No identifiable information 
or PHI 
will be collected. All qualitative data will be transferred to the qualitative software package, NVivo©. 
Data will be organized so that the setting and the method of collection can be traceable. We will use an 
iterative data analysis approach; after some d
ata are collected, these will be analyzed to inform future 
qualitative data collection efforts
 
 
Data 
Collection,

Storage
 
 
The 
Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307589], completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data rep
orted.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the study staff.
 
Paper

based 
NHs
. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_307590]. 
All source documents will be completed in a legible manner to ensure 
accurate 
interpretation of data. 
Black ink is required to ensure clarity of repro
duced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  When making 
changes or corrections, the original entry will be crossed out with a single line, and 
the change initialed and 
dated.
 
Erasing, overwriting, or use of correction fluid or tape will not be done.
 
All 
available 
source documents and 
laboratory reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_307607], who will ensure that t
hey are accurate and complete. 
AEs must be graded, assessed for severity 
and causality, and reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. 
 
Confidentiality will be m
aintained to the fullest extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. 
All study
 
data 
collected at the 
NHs will be recorded
 
on case report forms
. These case report forms
 
will be 
entered
 
into a password protected 
relational database which will be kept on a research server which has a level and scope of security that equals 
or exceeds that established by [CONTACT_307608].
 
Clinical data on study participants will be obtained 
electro
nically from the participating NHs and uploaded into the study database.  Data regarding S. aureus 
infections will be sourced from a state
-
wide electronic health information repository and entered into the study 
database. 
Paper records will be 
stored in 
lo
cked 
fil
ing 
cabinets
 
in a
 
protected space.
 
Data
 
will be maintained 
on a secure electronic 
central 
database
 
on a
 
research server.
 
Data will be backed up according to the network 
backup schedule.
 
 
A unique identifier 
or code 
will be assigned to each 
resident participant
. 
Bacterial isolates
 
and culture 
specimens and datasets used for analysis will be labeled with this 
code
. 
Only the study 
personnel
 
who 
directly 
interact with subject or manage the subject’s clinical protocol dat
a
 
will have access to participant identifying 
information.
 
Culture data will be entered directly into the relational database; however, microbiology laboratory 
personnel will not have access to participa
nt identifiers in the database. Study personnel who l
eave the 
research team will have their access to study data removed. 
 
As soon as permitted and when all data analyses are complete and have been published, source 
documents containing identifiable information will be shredded and identifying information wi
ll
 
be removed from 
the database. 
During the entire study, all data will be 
managed
 
centrally at the primary site. There will be a 
single data table which maintains the link between the unique code and patient identifiers. 
This table containing 
the
 
link between code and identifying information will be 
destroyed
 
on the server and in any backups
 
when it is 
time to de
-
identify the database
. If any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_307584], they will be shredded.
 
Selected d

Study
 
Management
 
Plan
 
 
Study Coordination
 
The 
University of Maryland, Baltimore 
will be the 
coordinating 
site for this study under the direction of the 
PI, [CONTACT_307616]. It will also implement the protocol in 
community
-
based 
NHs
 
in Maryland
. 
It
 
will coordinat
e 
study operations
 
and be the central repository
 
for data entry into a centralized database and perfor
m all of the 
microbiology testing.
 
It
 
is also responsible for 
training 
study
 
personnel and monitoring 
study progress and performance. 
The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_307591] m
anager will visit the NHs
 
for a one day study start up meeting
 
in which we review the study 
protocol, 
informed consent procedures and study procedures
. 
In addition, t
he projec
t manager will visit the 
NHs
 
for study monitoring 
as needed during the study
. We will have weekly 
meetings
 
with 
study staff
 
during 
enrollment 
to review
 
p
erformance (see below), protocol deviations and adverse events. 
 
 
Performance monitoring
 
Study 
performance will be monitored via the centralized study database. The monitoring period wil
l 
begin 
soon after enrollment begins and continu
e
 
through 
data collecti
on closeout. Monitoring will focus on timing, 
frequency and quality of study recruitment, follow
-
up, and data collection. Reports will be generated on a 
regular basis related to recruitment and data completeness. Components of the reports will include numb
er of 
participants screened, number of participants enrolled, number of participants lost to follow
-
up, key 
demographics of enrolled participants, number of missing or deficient forms and summaries of data audits and 
edits. 
 
 
Data audits 
 
A list of complete
d forms for specific participants will be randomly selected from the study database on a 
regular basis (approximately quarterly). Hard
-
copi[INVESTIGATOR_307592]. 
F
orms 
will also be inspected 
for proper tracking of modif
ications and completion of fields not captured in the 
study database. Discrepancies between the study forms and database and any errors found on the forms wil
l 
be reported to study staff 
and resolution required.
 
 
Data edits 
 
The data entry process will be guided by [CONTACT_307610]. However, 
the entry of inappropriate data is still possible, so data edits will be run on the study database on a regular 
basis (approximately quarterly). 
D
ata ed
it reports will be generated for missing, out
-
of
-
range, unusual and 
inconsistent values. 
Study staff 
must respond to each data edit and make modifications to the study form and 
database as needed.

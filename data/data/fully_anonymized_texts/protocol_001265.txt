Background, Rationale and Context  
 
History of recent oxytocin research at Wake Forest  
 
 The Pain Mechanisms Laboratory began work on a n NIH  program project grant (P01) 
proposal in 2019 focusing on basic research on oxytocin mechanisms of analgesic action in 
animals and clinical trials to establish oxytocin analgesic efficacy in humans.  We received IRB 
approval for 3 protocols involving intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) oxytocin under a 
waiver of IND requirement from the FDA to acquire preliminary data necessary for this NIH 
submission:

[ZIP_CODE]  4/29/2019  PK Sampling after IV Oxytocin Injection in Healthy Subjects  
[ZIP_CODE]  4/29/2019  Effects of IM Oxytocin in UV Burn  
[ZIP_CODE]  10/1/[ADDRESS_630789] study determined a preliminary model for the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of oxytocin in 
plasma after IV administration using the state -of-the-art liquid chromatograph / mass 
spectroscopy (LC/MS) method and also examined pain report to 5-minute  heating of the skin 
after oxytocin administration.  Oxytocin concentrations were best fit to a two compartment PK 
model and the time course of oxytocin to reduce pain from the heat stimulus was used to create a 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model . The second study was intended to test the 
analgesic effects of IM oxytocin after controlled UV -B burn to a small area of skin as a model of 
peripheral nerve hypersensitivity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_490591], the burn produced minimal 
hypersensitivity on the following day (the day of study), so we were unable to test oxytocin’s 
effect .  The third study demonstrated that IM oxytocin did not affect average pupil diameter or 
heart rate variability ( HRV ) over time, but did reduce slow frequency oscillations in pupil 
diameter, a phenomenon termed hippus, that reflects parasympathetic tone to the iris.  The time 
course of this action of oxytocin was coupled with the PK data to create a PK/PD model for 
central nervous system action of IV administered oxytocin.   These data were central to the P01 
grant submission  in January, 2020.   
 
 In anticipation of NIH requirement for IRB approval at the time of NIH Council meeting 
in September , [ADDRESS_630790] School of Medicine IRB .  
These were approved pending FDA approval of an IND . That IND was approved in November, 
2020 , leading to full IRB approval .

[ZIP_CODE]  7/9/[ADDRESS_630791] score of 37 but was not recommended for 
funding by [CONTACT_490597].  In response to reviewer concerns, we initiated IRB 00066136 to replicate 
the initial observations of oxytocin induced pain relief to a sustained heat stimulus.  This was 
successful and the preliminary PK/PD model from the first study fit well the time course and 
degree of analgesia in this second study.  
 
 The P01 was extensively revised and resubmitted in January, 2021.   This included 
revisions to each of the [ADDRESS_630792] minute documents in 
preparation for funding shortly . 
 
 This IRB application  is for a revision to IRB00066130  (which has not been initiated)  to 
estimate the IV oxytocin dose -response for analgesia to 5 min heating of the skin.  We 
considered amending the approved protocol, but as noted in the table below, the study design 
was altered in so many fundamental ways in response to the NIH review that we felt a 
replacement  was more appropriate.

Rationale for current application  
 
 Both preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that oxytocin may serve as a novel pain 
therapeutic and potential disease -modifying agent to prevent the transition from acute to chronic 
pain. This follows from observations that pain resolves quicker in women after cesarean delivery 
than other surgeries [1], and that hypersensitivity resolves quicker in rodents when neuropathic 
injury is performed after delivery, an effect blocked by [CONTACT_490599] [2, 3] . 
Oxytocin may act peripherally to affect pain after injury.  Since chronic pain is usually reduced 
acutely by [CONTACT_490600], peripheral input is necessary, but most research assumes 
that input is normal and pain reflects ongoing central sensitization. We and others challenge 
5 
11/8/[ADDRESS_630793] 
conducting pain nerve fibers are sensitized [4].  In rodents, oxytocin acutely moves these two 
abnormal signals after injury towards normal [5], suggest ing a disease -modifying potential of 
oxytocin as a ‘vaccine’ against chronic pain after injury .  
 
 Oxytocin itself is the only clinically available tool for translational studies in many areas – 
neuroprotection, anxiety, sleep, social 
behaviors, addiction, and pain.  Most 
rodent and human studies of oxytocin 
are small, lack strong scientific rigor, 
and only half of the clinical studies 
examining pain demonstrat e efficacy.  
Thus, we have minimal ability to 
understand oxytocin effects across 
species.  A critical problem is the 
complete lack of fundamental 
pharmacologic characterization for 
oxytocin, which is used clinically in 
obstetrics by [CONTACT_210578] -to-effect.  There 
are few PK and no PK/PD modeling 
studies of oxytocin in the literature, and 
the PK studies use RIA and ELISA 
assays which are unreliable [6].  
 
 Under IRB00056413 we 
measured  plasma oxytocin 
concentrations  after IV administration, 
using a n LC/MS assay [7].  Figure 1A  shows individual (thin lines) and group (thick lines) after 
oxytocin, 10 IU (17 μg).  The first 3 individuals received a 1 min infusion, which was 
accompanied with headache and sensation of flushing (red lines) and the remaining 8 
volunteers received a 10 min infusion with 5 of 8 subjects experiencing symptoms.  These data 
were well fit to a 2 -compartment PK model using NONMEM.  Note the large discrepancy 
between these data and a recent report [8] in which the same dose of oxytocin was infused over 
10 min and plasma oxytocin measured by [CONTACT_243359] ( RIA). 
 
 To assess peripheral effects,  we used pain report to 5 minute exposure to a 45°C 
stimulus, since our studies in rodents shows that prolonged noxious heat sensitizes and 
increases activity the fast conducting pain fibers which are sensitive to oxytocin [9]. Figure 1B  
shows the modeled plasma oxytocin concentrations in the 11 subjects in Figure 1A  and pain 
report to a 5 min noxious heat exposure.  The data were nicely fit to a PK/PD model yielding 
parameters of [ADDRESS_630794], an EC50 of 10 pg/ml, and steepness of concentration 
response (γ) of 1  (green dashed lines) . The goal of this PK study was to determine oxytocin PK 
and to explore a potential effect on pain from skin heating.  Under IRB00066136 we examined 
the time course of analgesia to skin heating by [CONTACT_490601] (0.47 µg/min for 30 
min for a total dose 14 µg) in 10 volunteers . There were no adverse events with this dosing 
regimen, and the PK/PD model from the first study accurately predicted the time course of onset 
of analgesia during infusion and maintenance of analgesia after the infusion was stopped 
(Figure 1C ). 
 
 The primary objective  of the current  IRB application  is to determine the dose response of 
IV oxytocin for analgesia to experimental heat pain at the time of anticipated maximum effect.  Figure 1.  A)  plasma  oxytocin concentrations with LC/MS 
(red/black lines) compared to plasma by [CONTACT_69727]  (blue lines.  B)

11/8/[ADDRESS_630795] being tested on two separate study days 
and receiving on each study day two 10 -min IV infusions of study drug separated by [CONTACT_490602] 
(Figure 2A ).  As shown in this figure, the preliminary PK/PD model predicts that infusions of 0.3, 
1.3, and 7 µg in these paradigms will result in analgesic effects of approximately 20%, 50%, and 
85% of the maximum.  The PK/PD model further predicts a relatively stable drug effect with this 
infusion paradigm from 10 to 50 min after the end of the infusion.     
 These infusion times and oxytocin dosages 
were also chosen to minimize adverse events 
observed in our previous studies.  In the original PK 
study (IRB00056413) adverse events were observed 
in [ADDRESS_630796] the uterus after delivery of the fetus.  
Adverse events were not observed below plasma 
oxytocin concentrations of 400 pg/ml, and in the 
second study (IRB00066136) in which we infused 
oxytocin to a modeled concentration of 400 pg/ml, no 
adverse events were observed.  As shown in Figure 
2B, plasma oxytocin concentrations with the largest 
oxytocin infusion are modeled to not exceed 400 
pg/ml, and we therefore anticipate few if any of these 
adverse events.  
 
 
Objectives  
Main objective  Determine dose -response of 
IV oxytocin infusions to reduce pain from an 
experimental heat stimulus  
 
Additional Objectives  
1. Test for effects of subject sex or age on oxytocin effect  
2. Refine the PK/PD model for oxytocin analgesic action based on time course of 
observations  
 
Methods and Measures  
 Equal numbers of adult men and women will be recruited. Sample size will be divided 
into 3 groups; young (18 -39-year-old) middle (40 – 59-year-old) and older (60 – 75-year-old). 
We anticipate that approximately 20% of subjects will be in the elderly group, 35% will be in the 
middle age group, and 45% will be in the young group.  
 Subjects will report to the Pain Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or the CTSI CRU for three 
visits

STUDY DESIGN  
 This is a blinded, randomized, controlled study of IV infusion of placebo and 3 doses of 
oxytocin. In this study, healthy individuals will come to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343304] 2 Pain Clinical 
Research unit (CRU) or the CTSI CRU for a training visit and then to the CTSI CRU for two 
other study days, separated by [CONTACT_2669] 72 hr . During the training day they will report pain on a 0 
(no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) scale each minute during a 5 min heating of the skin of 
the lateral calf to a temperature (45°C) using an FDA approved, commercially available device 
(Medoc, TSA II) . If pain score is less than [ADDRESS_630797] ending at 1 5, 30, and 45 min after the ending of the infusion .  
The probe temperature used for heating will be that determined during the training day.  
Immediately after the 60 min pain report the second infusion will be given and pain intensity at 
the end of 5 -min of heating recorded at 1 5, 30, and 45 min thereafter. The study will then end.   
 
Phase II trials  
 
Setting  
The training visit will occur at either the Pain CRU at Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343304] 2 or the CTSI 
CRU.  Drug s tudy visits will occur on the main campus at CTSI CRU .  
 
 
Subjects selection criteria  
The study will enroll healthy subjects.

1. Male or female > 18 and < 75 years of age, Body Mass Index (BMI) <40.  
2. Generally in good health as determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_490592], American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_630798] COVID -19 
4. For healthy volunteers, normal blood pressure (systolic 90 -140 mmHg; diastolic 
50-90 mmHg) resting heart rate 45 -100 beats per minute) without medication.  For 
those with hypertension, blood pressure controlled with anti -hypertensive medication 
and with a resting heart rate 45 -100 beats per minute.

8 
11/8/2022  methods (e.g., combined oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives), 
double barrier methods (e.g., condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring plus 
spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse for a 
minimum of 1 full cycle before study drug administration.  
 
Exclusion Criteria   
1. Hypersensitivity, allergy, or significant reaction to any ingredient of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933]®  
2. Any disease, diagnosis, or condition (medical or surgical) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_160507], would place the subject at increased risk (active gynecologic 
disease in which increased tone would be detrimental e.g., uterine fibroids with 
ongoing bleeding), compromise the subject’s compliance with study procedures, or 
compromise the quality of the data  
3. Women who are pregnant (positive result for serum pregnancy test at screening 
visit), women who are currently nursing or lactating, women that have been pregnant 
within [ADDRESS_630800] or current history of hyponatremia or at risk for hyponatremia; 
anyone taking thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, combination diuretics, lithium, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enalapril, Ramipril, celecoxib, temazepam, gliclazide, glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], 
glibenclamide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], omeprazole, pantoprazole, desmopressin, SSRI’s, MAOI, or 
the recreational drug ecstasy.  
7. Subjects with a known latex allergy.  
 
Sample Size  
  
 The projected sample size is 24 subjects.  Our current estimates indicate that the 
confidence interval for studies of 2 1 individuals with pain intensity ratings will determine the 
pharmacodynamic  parameters with a corrected confidence range < 20%. A corrected confidence 
range < 20% implies that mixed effect analysis will distinguish covariate effects in the range of 
40% in a study with [ADDRESS_630801] may be 
clinically consequential. In practice, mixed -effects analysis with NONMEM is often sensitive to 
covariate effects smaller than predicted by [CONTACT_490604]. The sample size is increased to 
24 to provide stratification by [CONTACT_654] (3 strata), weight (2 strata), and sex. The crossover design 
permits accurate determination of dose linearity despi[INVESTIGATOR_490593] -subject variability  in 
pain ratings.  
 
Interventions and Interactions  
 
 At all study visits temperature will be measured and participants queried regarding recent 
history of symptoms commonly associated with COVID -[ADDRESS_630802]. 
 
Study Visit 1:    
 The participant will report to the Pain CRU o r the Wake Forest CTSI  CRU . The 
participant will review and sign the Informed Consent. After informed consent is adequately 
9 
11/8/[ADDRESS_630803] performed to determine pregnancy status.  Vital signs to include  
blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (Resp) and oxyhemoglobin saturation by 
[CONTACT_406] (POX) will be measured and recorded along with height and weight.  
Once eligibility has been determined  the participant will be trained in study procedures. 
This will include pain ratings to brief (5 sec) heat stimuli on the lateral calf to 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 
and 49⁰C and then a pain intensity rating each minute for 5 mins during heating to 45⁰C.  If the 
pain report to 45⁰C is < 2 at the end of the 5 min, a second trial using 46⁰C will be done, and if 
that also results in pain intensity < 2, a third trial with 47⁰C will be performed.  Subject s who 
have pain intensity < 1 with the 47⁰C 5 -min stimulus will not be further studied.  The duration 
for visit 2 will be approximately 2 hours  
 
Study Visit 2  
On the second visit, the participant will report to the CTSI CRU . Baseline vital signs (BP, 
HR, Resp, POX) will be obtained for a baseline measurement , a catheter inserted into a 
peripheral vein in the upper extremity and pain report to [ADDRESS_630804] ending at 15, 30, and 45 min after the end of each infusion.   Subjects will be 
randomized to receive either 1) IV infusion of saline followed by [CONTACT_300854], 1.3 µg or 2) IV 
infusion of oxytocin 0.[ADDRESS_630805] visit, the participant will report to the CRU  and all procedures performed as in 
study visit 2.  The pair of IV infusions will be the alternate to that used in study visit 2.  The 
duration for study visit 3 will be approximately 4 hours.  
 
Safety and Monitoring:  
 
Assessment of Side Effects :  Significant side effects are defined as changes > 30% from baseline 
in the mean arterial pressure, HR, or oxyhemoglobin pulse oximetry < 90. Any unexpected or 
serious side effects will be reported to the IRB within 24 hrs. Peripheral oxyhemoglobin 
saturation, BP and HR will be measured non -invasively before and 15, 30, and 60 min after each 
IV infusion.  If either BP or HR change by > 30%, or oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to less 
than 90, and require treatment, these vital signs will be repeated at 5 -minute intervals until vital 
signs are stabilized.  
 
Treatment of Side Effects : Mean blood pressure elevations greater than 30% of baseline will be 
treated with labetalol 5 -15 mg IV incrementally until BP elevation is less than 30% elevated. 
Reductions in mean BP > 30% of baseline will be treated with incremental ephedrine 5 -20 mg, 
IV. Heart rate (HR) reductions or elevations > 30% of baseline will be treated with incremental 
glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV or propranolol 0.2 mg IV, respectively. Peripheral oxyhemoglobin 
10 
11/8/2022  desaturation (< 90) will be treated with supplemental oxygen, nasal cannula, face mask, or 
non-rebreathing mask depending upon the degree desaturation and the response to therapy.  
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
 
 Primary Outcome Measure  
 Name:  [CONTACT_490610] (0 -10) at the end of 5 min of skin heating  
 Type:  Primary  
 Time Frame: For 45 minutes after the end of each study drug infusion  
 Description: Pain scores are measured each minute during [ADDRESS_630806] (Emax), 
predicted concentrations from the PK/PD model to produce a 50% and 90% maximum drug 
effect (C50 and C90, respectively), the steepness of the dose response curve (γ), and the time to 
peak effect.  Inter -subject variability (e.g., biological variability) will evaluate additive, 
proportional, and exponential models. Residual intrasubject variability (e.g., noise) will typi[INVESTIGATOR_490594]. The influence of covariates (e.g., age, sex, 
weight) on model parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_10333] / exclusion, with significance 
determined by [CONTACT_142847] (p < 0.01 if the decrease in -2 log likelihood exceeds 6.6 
). Parameters will be estimated using first-order conditional estimate with - 
interaction.  
 
 Covariate effects deemed significant by [CONTACT_490605] -validation [10]. Jackknife cross -validation provides an estimate of the utility of 
the covariate to inform the pharmacodynamics in a future individual, rather than merely 
characterize the pharmacodynamics in the individuals from which the model was derived. The 
jackknife cross -validation divides the data into N subsets. Each subset leaves out a single 
individual. The parameters of the model are re -estimated for each subset with and without the 
covariate being validated. The inaccuracy (mean ((|measured – predicted|) / predicted)), of the 
model with and without the covariate is measured in the excluded individual. The covariate is 
only being  included in the final model if it the improvement in model accuracy in the N 
iterations is significantly greater than 0. Jackknife cross -validation helps compensate for 
NONMEM’s ability to identify very small covariate effects that do not meaningfully contribute 
to accuracy in future patients.  
 
 Expected outcomes.   Based on pain ratings and an estimate of the PK/PD model from 
preliminary data (Fig 1), we anticipate that the maximum oxytocin  effect is a 50 -60% reduction 
in pain rating from the 5 min heat stimulus.  We anticipate that the oxytocin  dose range will 
demonstrate a sigmoidal dose -response with a peak within 10 min after the end of infusion  and 
an ED80 of ~[ADDRESS_630807] was within 1% of the same value, supporting this stepped dosing study design.  
The expected peak plasma oxytocin  concentration after the 7 μg infusion following the 0.3 µg 
infusion is 400 pg/ml, below that which produc ed subjective symptoms  in previous studies .

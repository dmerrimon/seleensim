INTRODUCTION 
Background  
Intravenous drug use (IVDU) is the leading cause of new Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and is widespread 
among pregnant women with OUD. HCV screening during pregnancy is recommended for women with risk 
factors for HCV exposure and provides a unique opportunity to identify the virus among high-risk women of 
reproductive age. HCV positivity in pregnant women with OUD ranges from 40-75% and over 28% are newly 
diagnosed with HCV during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a unique opportunity to engage HCV-infected women in 
efforts to improve their health and facilitate HCV treatment. However, less than 2% of HCV-infected pregnant 
patients initiate HCV treatment within one year following delivery. 
Rationale 
Incorporating HCV treatment into opi[INVESTIGATOR_858744]-pregnant, 
drug-using populations. This “medical home” approach would combine HCV and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858745], hepatologists, substance abuse 
treatment providers and pediatricians into one comprehensive clinical care model. We hypothesize that co-
locating prenatal care, HCV treatment and substance abuse treatment services in the same clinical 
environment will significantly improve HCV treatment uptake and compliance as well as facilitate ongoing 
recovery from opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]. 
SOF/VEL Fixed Dose Combination 
Description 
The study medication is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for oral 
administration. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor and velpatasvir is an NS5A 
inhibitor. 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
9 
 Each tablet contains 400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg velpatasvir. The tablets include the following inactive 
ingredients: copovidone, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The 
tablets are film-coated with a coating material containing the following inactive ingredients: iron oxide red, 
polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide. 
Sofosbuvir: The IUPAC name [CONTACT_858800] (S)-Isopropyl 2-((S)-(((2R,3R,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-
dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)-4-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)-
(phenoxy)phosphorylamino)propanoate. It has a molecular formula of C22H29FN3O9P and a molecular weight 
of 529.45. Sofosbuvir is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a solubility of at least 2 mg/mL across the pH 
range of 2–7.7 at 37 oC and is slightly soluble in water. 
Velpatasvir: The IUPAC name [CONTACT_858801] {(1R)-2-[(2S,4S)-2-(5-{2-[(2S,5S)-1-{(2S)-2-
[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-methylbutanoyl}-5-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]-1,11-
dihydro[2]benzopyrano[4',3':6,7]naphtho[1,2-d]imidazol-9-yl}-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-4-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidin-1-
yl]-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl}carbamate. It has a molecular formula of C49H54N8O8 and a molecular weight of 
883.0. Velpatasvir is practically insoluble (less than 0.1 mg/mL) above pH 5, slightly soluble (3.6 mg/mL) at pH 
2, and soluble (greater than 36 mg/mL) at pH 1.2. 
Mechanism of Action 
Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is required for viral 
replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the 
pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by 
[CONTACT_282554]5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the 
polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotype 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a with an IC50 value ranging 
from 0.36 to 3.3 micromolar. GS-461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an 
inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Sofosbuvir has a very short half-life in plasma. SOF accounts for 
only ~4% of the drug related material circulating in plasma. The majority (>90%) of the drug-related material in 
plasma is in the form of GS-331007, an inactive metabolite of sofosbuvir.  
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein, which is required for viral replication. Resistance selection 
in cell culture and cross-resistance studies indicate velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
Clinical Studies 
 
Clinical Studies of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir for the Treatment of HCV

Safety   
The adverse reactions data for SOF/VEL in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis were derived 
from three Phase 3 clinical trials (ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2, and ASTRAL-3) which evaluated a total of 1035 
subjects infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who 
received SOF/VEL for 12 weeks. SOF/VEL was studied in placebo- and active-controlled trials. The proportion 
of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0.2% for subjects who received 
SOF/VEL for [ADDRESS_1196758] common adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by 
[CONTACT_809031] 10%) were headache and fatigue in subjects treated with SOF/VEL for 12 weeks. 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
11 
 Adverse reactions, all grades, observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving 12 weeks of 
treatment with SOF/VEL in ASTRAL-1 include headache (22%), fatigue (15%), nausea (9%), asthenia (5%), and 
insomnia (5%). Of subjects receiving SOF/VEL who experienced these adverse reactions, 79% had an adverse 
reaction of mild severity (Grade 1). With the exception of asthenia, each of these adverse reactions occurred at 
a similar frequency or more frequently in subjects treated with placebo compared to subjects treated with 
SOF/VEL (asthenia: 3% versus 5% for the placebo and SOF/VEL groups, respectively). The adverse reactions 
observed in subjects treated with SOF/VEL in ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 were consistent with those observed 
in ASTRAL-1. Irritability was also observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated with SOF/VEL in 
ASTRAL-3.

 - Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] 
- Attendance at opi[INVESTIGATOR_858749]:  
- Breast milk concentrations of SOF, GS-331007, and VEL 
- Rates of IVDU recidivism 
- HCV reinfection 
- Patient centered outcomes such as health related QOL will be assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months 
following treatment completion 
- Pregnancy and delivery outcomes collected prospectively by [CONTACT_858774] 30 pregnant and postpartum women between the ages of 18-39 year old 
(inclusive) at screening who are chronically infected with Hepatitis C virus, as described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.  
Time to Complete Accrual 
The approximate time to complete study enrollment is expected to be 12 months.  
Expected Duration of Participation 
The expected duration for maternal and infant participants is approximately 18 months after SVR Assessment, 
not including the screening window. Maternal study data will be collected from the participant and/or her medical 
records through the End of Study Visit ([ADDRESS_1196759]-treatment visit, V14). Infant study data will be collected 
from his/her medical record after End of Study Visit ([ADDRESS_1196760]-treatment visit, V14).  
STUDY POPULATION 
Selection of the Study Population 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 will be utilized to ensure the appropriate selection of 
study participants. 
Recruitment 
HCV-infected pregnant or postpartum women will be recruited from the outpatient obstetrical clinics at Magee-
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MWH) of UPMC. There are over 10,000 deliveries at MWH per year and it is estimated that 
approximately 1% of women who deliver are infected with HCV.  Recruitment will be primarily targeted from the 
MWH Pregnancy Recovery Center, which was established in 2014 to provide concurrent treatment for OUD 
with prenatal care, which has an estimated retention rate of 90% for weekly opi[INVESTIGATOR_858750].  There are approximately 120 pregnant women with OUD who receive prenatal care at the Pregnancy 
Recovery Center per year.  The prevalence of HCV infection in this Center is approximately 60%.  Recruitment 
materials will be approved by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_858751]. 
Retention 
The importance of retention will be stressed to the participant at each visit as part of protocol adherence 
counseling.  Once a participant is enrolled, the study staff will make every effort to retain the participants in 
follow-up to minimize possible bias associated with loss-to-follow-up.     
Inclusion Criteria 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.[ADDRESS_1196761] meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Any exclusionary laboratory 
values can be repeated at a later date within the screening window.  If the repeated laboratory values meet 
inclusion criteria then the participant can be enrolled. If there is concern that the participant’s health status has 
changed between the enrollment visit and the screening visit or if there is concern by [CONTACT_858775], the screening laboratories can be repeated prior to enrollment.

STUDY MEDICATION 
Regimen 
Each participant will take a 12 week course of SOF/VEL one tablet by [CONTACT_1966], once daily.   
Administration 
Study medication will be dispensed in the immediate postpartum period in the quantities sufficient to have one 
dose per day until the next scheduled visit with [ADDRESS_1196762]/Pharmacist of Record (PoR) in the pharmacy at Magee-Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   Participants will be given 
a medication administration log to assist them with keepi[INVESTIGATOR_858752]. The medication 
administration log will include instructions on timing of the dose, what to do if a dose is missed and how to store 
the medication. If a dose is missed, they should take the dose as soon as it is remembered, but only one dose 
per day.  Participants will be instructed to take their medication in the morning each day at the same time, 
preferably early in the morning.  SOF/VEL can be taken with or without food.  Additionally, participants will be 
given adherence tips, such as setting an alarm on their phone, linking medication taking to another daily activity, 
etc. Participants will be instructed to bring any unused medication to their next visit.  Participants will be instructed 
to call the study staff immediately if they run out of medication or if they lose their study medication.  In this case, 
all possible efforts will be made to get the participant study medication as soon as possible. 
Supply and Accountability 
 
Supply 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences will manufacture the study medication under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and will 
package, label and ship all of the study medication directly to the PoR at Magee-Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Storage and Dispensing 
SOF/VEL should be stored at room temperature below 30°C within the main pharmacy at Magee-Womens 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]1. The PoR will maintain documentation of temperature in the area where the study medication is stored. 
Study medications will be dispensed from the pharmacy in a small bottle until the next study visit with two 
additional doses in the case of a lost dose or missed study visit.  Study medications will be dispensed from the 
pharmacy only upon receipt of a written prescription from an authorized prescriber.  The study medication will 
be dispensed to the study staff, then subsequently provided directly to the study participant in the research clinic.  
Accountability 
The PoR will maintain complete accountability records of all study SOF/VEL FDC received and dispensed. All 
unused study medications will be returned to [COMPANY_009] Sciences after the study is complete.  
Retrieval of Study Medication 
The participants will be instructed to return any unused medication at each visit. If the participant fails to return 
unused medication at a scheduled visit, alternate arrangements will be made to obtain the unused medication 
from the participant (i.e. at an unscheduled visit). Unused medication will be accounted for by [CONTACT_15370], 
documented in the participant’s research record and then returned to the PoR.  
Concomitant Medications  
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.[ADDRESS_1196763] timing of acid suppressing medication use according to the Epclusa package insert.   
STUDY PROCEDURES 
An overview of the study visit and evaluations schedule is presented in Appendix 1. Any clinical or laboratory 
information collected as a part of the participant’s routine clinical care occurring on the same day as the study 
visit does not need to be repeated and can be collected from the participant’s medical record.   
Pre-screening 
With IRB approval, study staff will pre-screen records to identify potential participants by [CONTACT_858776] (i.e. age, gestational age, Hepatitis C status).  Clinic staff will be informed of the study and will be asked 
to provide an IRB-approved material to potential participants or will assess interest.  If the participant agrees, 
research staff can provide additional information by [CONTACT_858777]-approved screening script, which will 
include a brief overview of the study and minimum eligibility questions.  Women who are interested and qualify 
based on the screening script may schedule a screening visit if interested.  Process information (e.g., number of 
potential participants contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], number presumptively eligible) may be recorded and stored at the study site in 
the absence of written informed consent from potential participants, provided the information is collected in such 
a manner that it cannot be linked to participant identifiers. Procedures and documentation will comply with the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_858753]. IRB approved ads and flyers may also be used (i.e. hung throughout 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; displayed on electronic boards; emailed to providers or appropriate support or community groups). 
Visit 1- Screening A (V1) 
Screening Visit A can take place anytime with the screening window. Multiple visits may be conducted to 
complete all required screening procedures, if necessary. Written informed consent will be obtained before any 
screening procedures are initiated. All participants will meet with hepatology who will ultimately determine 
whether to initiate hepatitis C treatment in the immediate postpartum period and participants will be encouraged 
to discuss participation in the study with hepatology. For participants who subsequently do not meet the eligibility 
criteria, screening will be discontinued once ineligibility is determined. Any exclusionary laboratory values can 
be repeated at a later date within the screening window. If the repeated laboratory values meet inclusion criteria 
then the participant can be enrolled. If there is concern that the participant’s health status has changed between 
the enrollment visit and the screening visit or if there is concern by [CONTACT_858778], the screening laboratories can be repeated prior to enrollment.

Breastmilk Pharmacokinetics Substudy 
A subset of women (n=5) will participate in a sub-study to determine the quantity of drugs (SOF and VEL) 
transferred into breastmilk. Because the drug has not been studied in infants, all expressed milk will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_1758]. We ask each of the 5women to express [ADDRESS_1196765] 
dose and no sooner than 6 hours from a previous sample. All samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_4475] 10 postpartum. 
The time of prior SOF/VEL dosing will be carefully recorded as well as the time of the breastmilk and blood 
collection.   
Participants will be instructed to take their daily dose at home as usual. This subsample of participants will be 
given a pi[INVESTIGATOR_173105] (Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) that tracks drug timing so that we have accurate time stamp for when the drug was 
taken. This is important for the PK study to ensure women were adherent with the medication and to track the 
time of prior doses in relation to milk and blood collection.  
Women will be asked to only express milk when they are at Magee-Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858755]. Women will be asked to express until both breasts are soft and the milk expression rate slows. 
Because women will be pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_858756], their milk volume will diminish and by 10 days, will be of limited 
volume. Individual venipuncture(s) will be used to collect all plasma samples, and participants will be instructed 
on how to pump to obtain breastmilk samples.  
Case report forms will be completed for each set of breastmilk and blood samples obtained. Two 5-mL 
breastmilk samples will be processed and stored. One 5-mL aliquot of whole intact milk will be transferred to a 
cyrovial and stored. The second 5-mL aliquot will be centrifuged, the lipid layer removed and transferred to a 
cryovial and the remaining fluid transferred to a separate cryovial. All three cryovials will be stored at -
80°Celcius until shipment to the Colorado Antiviral Pharmacology Laboratory for analysis. 5-mL of blood will be

Follow-up Procedures for Participants Who Permanently Discontinue Study Medication 
Participants will be permanently discontinued for significant laboratory abnormalities or adverse events as 
outlined in section 9.3 and 9.4 or if they choose to discontinue the study medication.  Participants who are 
permanently discontinued from the study will be instructed to return the study medication and study medication 
log. All protocol-specified study procedures will continue for safety except the following: 
 Provision of study medication 
 Provision of medication use adherence counseling  
The following procedures will be performed at the visit in which study medication use is permanently 
discontinued: 
 Viral load as needed (i.e. participant withdraws, investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) 
The participant will be asked to continue in the study and complete all remaining scheduled maternal and infant 
visits per protocol for safety.  
Interim Visits 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
22 
 Interim visits may be performed at any time during the study. Study procedures may be repeated at interim visits 
as deemed clinically indicated.  All interim contacts and visits will be documented in participants' study records 
and on applicable CRFs.  
Adherence Counseling and Assessment 
Adherence counseling to the study protocol will be performed at each study visit.   Additionally, investigators 
may use text messaging (daily or weekly), follow-up phone calls and meeting study participants at their regular 
clinic visits in order to improve adherence the study medication.  All options will be included in the informed 
consent document and will be tailored to the participant’s needs.  At the follow-up visits (V5-10) all remaining 
medication will be counted, recorded and returned to the pharmacy.  Study participants will be given a medication 
administration log upon enrollment to assist in study medication adherence.  Each log will have instructions on 
how and when to take the medication. We will recommend that participants take the study medication between 
8:00am and 9:00am daily.  If a participant forgets to take a dose, she should take the missed dose as soon as 
she remembers but should never take more than one tablet of SOF/VEL FDC per day.  Directions on how to 
store the medication as well as what to do if the medication is lost or stolen will be included on the medication 
administration log.  Participants will be asked to bring the medication administration log to the next study visit for 
review.  Medication administration logs will be collected and a new log will be given with each bottle/refill of study 
medication.  
In Depth Interviews and Qualitative Analysis 
At the End of Treatment visit (V10) and End of Study visit (V14) a trained interviewer will conduct an in depth 
qualitative interview about Hepatitis C infection, HCV transmission risk behaviors, and HCV treatment during 
the postpartum period. All interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim.  The original recordings will be 
destroyed after transcription.  Following transcription, the research team will develop a qualitative codebook 
using an editing approach to ensure that all relevant topi[INVESTIGATOR_858757]. Two trained 
qualitative coders will then be trained in the codebook. Coding will be completed using Atlas.ti software, which 
will help to determine the frequency and prevalence of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_858758]. Thematic 
analysis will then be completed using a constant comparative method.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
24 
 Safety Monitoring 
The Principal Investigator (PI, [CONTACT_858802]) is responsible for continuous close safety monitoring of all study 
participants, and for notifying [COMPANY_009] Sciences, and the IRB if unexpected and/or serious events occur. An 
independent physician safety monitor who is not otherwise involved in the study will be identified and review the 
safety data once per month or more frequently as needed throughout the period of study implementation, discuss 
study medication management, and address any potential safety concerns. 
 
Clinical Data and Safety Review 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_858759]. Additional reviews may be conducted as dictated by [CONTACT_634008]. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_858760]. Events identified as 
questionable, inconsistent, or unexplained will be queried for verification. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_858761]. The content, format and frequency 
of the clinical data reports will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_53020], [COMPANY_009] Science and the 
research team in advance of study implementation. In addition to routine safety data reviews, the independent 
safety monitor and study investigators will convene on an ad hoc basis to make decisions regarding the handling 
of any significant safety concerns. If necessary, external experts representing expertise in the fields of 
pregnancy, infectious diseases, hepatology and medical ethics may be invited to join the safety review. A 
recommendation to pause or stop the trial may be made at this time or at any such time that the safety review 
team agrees that an unacceptable type and/or frequency of AEs has been observed. 
Adverse Events Definitions and Reporting Requirements 
Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical research participant administered an 
investigational medication and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational 
medication. As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medication, whether 
or not considered related to the medication. The term “investigational medication” for this study refers to the 
study medication. 
Study participants will be provided instructions for contact[CONTACT_858784]. Since the women enrolled in this 
study will be receiving prenatal care at Magee-Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858762]-
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858763]. Participants will be seen by a 
physician investigator/study clinician. In cases of potentially life-threatening events, participants will be instructed 
to seek immediate emergency care. With appropriate permission of the participant, whenever possible, records 
from all non-study medical providers related to untoward medical occurrences will be obtained and required data 
elements will be abstracted and recorded on study CRFs. All participants reporting an untoward medical 
occurrence will be followed clinically until the occurrence resolves (returns to baseline) or stabilizes. 
Study site staff will document all AEs reported by [CONTACT_858785], including gradable laboratory findings. AE severity will 
be graded per the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004 
(Clarification dated August 2009). 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
25 
 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE will be defined as an AE that:  
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858764]. 
 
Adverse Event Relationship to Study Medication 
Relatedness is an assessment made by [CONTACT_858786].  
 Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study agent(s) 
 Not Related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study agent(s) 
Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Reporting Requirements for this Study 
All adverse events will be reported to [COMPANY_009] Sciences on a monthly basis.  All serious adverse events will be 
reported to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159499], the FDA and [COMPANY_009] Sciences according to 
the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348]’s reporting guidelines.   
Grading Severity of Events 
The most current Division of DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS 
AE Grading Table) is available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech-res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/ . 
Regulatory Requirements 
Information on all reported AEs will be included in reports to the FDA and other applicable government and 
regulatory authorities. The Protocol Chair will submit AE information in accordance with the requirements of the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348]. 
Social Harms Reporting 
Although every effort will be made to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants’ 
involvement in the study could become known to others and that social harms may result. Social harms that are 
judged by [CONTACT_858787][INVESTIGATOR_68348].   
Managing any potential emotional distress from participating in this study: 
From prior studies, we have established relationships with experts in the fields of mental health, social work, 
and intimate partner violence, and with their advice we have developed several strategies to minimize and 
manage potential emotional distress that may occur as a result of participating in our research study.  
The research staff and investigators who will be conducting the research activities will be trained regarding 
how to handle any situations in which a patient reveals her desire to change her situation, asks for additional 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.[ADDRESS_1196776] danger.  
Because problems with alcohol, drug, and persistent tobacco use in women are often associated with other 
issues such as mental illness and intimate partner violence (IPV), all research team members will receive 
training in identifying and dealing with crises associated with these other conditions.  
In any of the above cases or in the case that participation in the study elicits any emotional distress, Magee-
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858765]. All of these social workers have 
received extensive training in behavioral health assessment/management, suicide intervention, and IPV and 
crisis management. Clinical investigators will also be available for consultation on difficult cases at all times by 
[CONTACT_37160]. The Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s telephone hotline, supported [ADDRESS_1196777] and inform the obstetric 
care providers of any relevant and ongoing behavioral health concerns to the social work or behavioral 
medicine experts. 
CLINICAL MANAGEMENT 
Guidelines for clinical management and permanent discontinuation of study medication are outlined in this 
section. In general, the physician investigators will only discontinue study medication if they feel that the risk of 
study medication continuation outweighs the benefits of study medication continuation. The physician 
investigators will document all permanent discontinuations on applicable CRFs. 
 
Grading System 
AE severity grading is described in Section 8.3.1. 
Dose Modification Instructions 
No dose modifications will be permitted in this study. 
General Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Medication 
A participant will be permanently discontinued from medication use by [CONTACT_858788], according the HCV treatment guidelines:  
 5-fold or greater increase in ALT or AST at the V1 or V2 compared to baseline result (screening visit), 
confirmed by [CONTACT_199607] 
 Any increase of ALT or AST of less than 5-fold from baseline (screening visit) V1 or V2 visit that is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_809056], nausea, vomiting, or jaundice 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
27 
  3-fold or greater increase in ALT or AST accompanied by [CONTACT_58132] >2x the upper limit of normal, confirmed 
on immediate repeat testing 
 HIV seroconversion occurs during the time of study medication use 
 Participant is unable or unwilling to comply with required study procedures 
 If the participant desires to breastfeed  
 Participant might be put at undue risk to their safety and well-being by [CONTACT_809057], 
according to the judgment of the study investigators. The study investigators will consult with the 
independent safety physician prior to all study medication discontinuation instituted for this reason.  
Any time a participant is permanently discontinued from study medication (prior to completion of the 12 week 
course of study medication), HCV resistance testing will be performed.  
Permanent Discontinuation in Response to Adverse Events 
Grade 1 or 2 
In general, a participant who develops a Grade 1 or 2 AE as defined by [CONTACT_858789], Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) regardless of 
relationship to study medication will continue study medication use.  
Grade 3 
For participants who develop a Grade 3 AE as defined by [CONTACT_858790], Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) that is judged by [CONTACT_858791], the study medication will continue.  The study medication must 
be permanently discontinued for participants who develop a Grade 3 AE judged by a physician investigators to 
be related to the study medication. 
Grade 4 
If a participant develops a Grade 4 AE as defined by [CONTACT_858792], Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) and the AE is determined to be related 
to study medication, then study medication must be permanently discontinued. 
Any time a participant is permanently discontinued from study medication (prior to completion of the 12 week 
course of study medication), HCV resistance testing will be performed. 
HIV-1 Infection 
Participants who are positive for HIV (known or positive at Screening) will not be eligible to participate.  If HIV 
seroconversion occurs during the time of study medication use, the participant will be permanently discontinued 
from medication use by [CONTACT_858793].     
Criteria for Early Termination of Study Participation  
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. The study investigators also 
may withdraw participants from the study to protect their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply 
with required study procedures. Participants also may be withdrawn if [COMPANY_009] Sciences, government or regulatory 
authorities, including the FDA and Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), or site IRBs/ECs terminate 
the study prior to its planned end date. Detailed reason with the withdrawal of a participant will be documented 
in the research record.  Every reasonable effort will be made to continue to follow the participant as scheduled 
for safety      
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
28 
 Overview and Summary of Design 
This is a Phase IV, single-arm, open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_858766] 30 HCV-infected women with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858767] a 12-week course of SOF/VEL FDC. 
Study Endpoints 
Pregnant women meeting all of the criteria in section 5.2 and 5.3 will be enrolled into the study and followed 
prospectively through delivery and 18 months postpartum. Study medication will be initiated in the immediate 
postpartum period (1-14 days after delivery).  Infants will be enrolled upon delivery and their medical records 
will be reviewed at approximately 18 months of age. 
Primary Endpoints 
 Treatment feasibility will be established through the successful recruitment and enrollment of 
participants, administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the postpartum period and ability to determine 
SVR at 3 months following treatment completion.  
 Acceptability of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will be evaluated by [CONTACT_6270]-report of treatment side effects and 
barriers and facilitators to treatment adherence.  
 Adherence to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will be evaluated with medication diaries, an assessment of missed 
doses, pi[INVESTIGATOR_858743].  
Secondary Endpoints 
 Breast milk concentrations of SOF, GS-331007, and VEL 
 Rates of IVDU recidivism 
 HCV reinfection 
 Patient centered outcomes such as health related QOL will be assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months 
following treatment completion 
Sample Size 
To evaluate the primary objective, we estimate a desired sample size of 30 participants. A subset of 5 
participants will participate in the PK visits. Approximately 375 OD pregnant patients receive prenatal and 
postpartum care at MWH each year and approximately 50% are HCV infected. Anticipating a 75% enrollment 
rate, [ADDRESS_1196778] information, alternative contacts will be called in order to reach the participant.  A maximum of 
10% loss-to-follow-up will be targeted. 
Data Analysis 
Validated survey instruments will be used to collect data on patient-centered outcomes such as HCV health 
related quality of life (QOL). Protocol-specific survey instruments will be used to record treatment side effects, 
medication diaries, an assessment of missed doses and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. All responses to data collection materials 
will be transferred into a secure database. Preliminary statistical analyses will focus on data checks for 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.[ADDRESS_1196779] deviations (or medians and quartiles for skewed distributions) for continuous variables and 
frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. 95% confidence intervals for means and proportions will 
be calculated. To visually examine distributions, boxplots and histograms will be constructed for continuous 
variables. Poisson regression analyses will be conducted for rates of SVR following treatment. Logistic 
regression analysis will be used for the remaining dichotomous outcome variables (IVDU relapse, HCV 
reinfection). Outcomes will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_545], age, parity, income, and insurance. All 
analyses will be conducted using STATA (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College 
Station, TX). 
Analysis of SVR12 
Approximately 98% of patients treated with SOF/VEL for [ADDRESS_1196780] approximately every 3 months, and as needed.  At the 
time of these reviews, or at any other time, the medical monitor may recommend that the study proceed as 
designed, proceed with design modifications, or be discontinued.   
 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_858768].  
Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents 
The site will maintain source data/documents in accordance with current DAIDS policies. ( http://rsc.tech-
res.com/policiesandregulations/ )  
The study team will maintain, and store securely, complete, accurate and current study records throughout the 
study. In accordance with U.S. regulations regarding testing investigational medications, the study investigator 
will maintain all study documentation for at least two years following the date of marketing approval for the study 
medications being tested for the indication in which they were studied. If no marketing application is filed, or if 
the application is not approved, the records will be retained for two years after the investigation is discontinued 
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.[ADDRESS_1196781] reaches the age of 23. 
Study records will be maintained on site for the entire period of study implementation. All physical source 
documents will be stored in the participant’s study chart, labeled with the participant ID number in a locked file 
cabinet in a locked office in the Pregnancy Recovery Center. All interactions with patients should be tracked, 
including but not limited to: dates they were called enrolled, recruited and consented, dates they completed each 
survey, dates interviewed, interviewer, dates they were contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (and method of contact) to completed all follow 
up assessments, dates they completed follow up assessments, any and all study payments using the Participant 
Tracking Database. This database is password-protected and will be backed up weekly 
Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The study site will conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures in accordance with site SOPs.  
CLINICAL SITE MONITORING 
As this is an investigator initiated study, monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_858794] (i.e. QA/QC 
Reviewer), PoR, laboratory staff and local data management team.   Internal reviews will include: 
 Review informed consent forms, protocol procedures, and study documentation 
 Assess compliance with the study protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, and applicable 
regulatory requirements (US and non-US), including CFR Title 45 Part 46 and Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 
312  
 Perform source document verification to ensure the accuracy and completeness of study data 
 Verify proper collection and storage of biological specimens 
 Verify proper storage, dispensing, and accountability of investigational study medications 
 
The Education and Compliance Office for Human Subject Research (ECO-HSR), Research Conduct and 
Compliance Office will also oversee study activities.  The ECO-HSR has extensive experience in the auditing 
and monitoring of clinical investigations for compliance with GCP standards and IND commitments. To ensure 
appropriate institutional oversight of University-based IND applications, the ECO-HSR will periodically monitor 
the research oversight programs of IND Sponsors, which will include compliance of the Sponsor and 
Investigator with applicable FDA regulations, applicable University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_809005]-approved 
protocol and consent document. The frequency of these monitoring visits shall be determined by [CONTACT_858795]-HSR 
The study investigators also will allow inspection of all study-related documentation by [CONTACT_858796], FDA, OHRP, IRBs/ECs and other local and US regulatory authorities.  
HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS 
Study investigators will make efforts to minimize risks to participants. Informed consent will be reviewed in 
detail with potential participants and all questions will be adequately answered prior to obtaining written 
informed consent.  All eligibility criteria will be verified prior to initiation of investigational product.  Recruitment 
will begin after receiving IRB approval and after the protocol has been submitted to the FDA.  The study 
investigators will permit audits by [CONTACT_18121], [COMPANY_009] Sciences, the FDA, OHRP, IRB, and other local and US 
regulatory authorities or any of their appointed agents. 
Institutional Review Boards 
The study staff will ensure that the protocol, associated informed consent form, and study-related documents 
(such as participant education and recruitment materials) are reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_858797]/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
31 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_858769]. Any amendments to the protocol or informed consent will be approved 
by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_809007]. 
Study Coordination 
Elizabeth Krans MD MSc is the study principal investigator. Assignment of all sponsor responsibilities for this 
study will be specified in a Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA) executed by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_858770]. 
Close coordination between the study team is necessary to track recruitment, enrollment, retention, AEs and 
unanticipated problems and to address other issues that may arise in a timely manner. The study investigators 
and the independent safety physician will address issues related to study eligibility, AE management/reporting 
and unanticipated problems as needed to assure consistency. Rates of accrual, protocol adherence, retention, 
and AE incidence will be reported by [CONTACT_858798]. 
Risk Benefit Statement 
Risks 
As with any research study, there may be adverse events or side effects for the maternal participant that are 
currently unknown and certain of these unknown risks could be permanent, severe or life-threatening. 
It is also not known if SOF/VEL is present in human breast milk.  If the participant intends to breast feed, she will 
not be eligible to enroll in this study.  
There is a potential risk that the hepatitis virus may become resistant to SOF/VEL if the participant does not 
complete the entire [ADDRESS_1196782] been associated with the use of oral SOF/VEL used daily for 12 weeks of duration 
in men and non-pregnant women. With the exception of asthenia, each of these adverse reactions occurred at 
a similar frequency or more frequently in subjects treated with placebo compared to subjects treated with 
SOF/VEL (asthenia: 3% versus 5% for the placebo and SOF/VEL groups, respectively). 
 Percentage of Participants 
N=624 
Headache 22% 
Fatigue 15% 
Nausea 9% 
Asthenia 5% 
Insomnia 5% 
 
There are risks of alterations in laboratory values with the use of this medication.  Previous studies have shown 
the following: 
Lipase Elevations: In ASTRAL-1, isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3xULN were 
observed in 3% and 1% of subjects treated with SOF/VEL and placebo for 12 weeks, respectively; and in 6% 
and 3% of subjects treated with SOF/VEL in ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3, respectively.  
Creatine Kinase: In ASTRAL-1, isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations greater than or equal to 
10xULN were reported in 1% and 0% of subjects treated with SOF/VEL and placebo for 12 weeks, 
respectively; and in 2% and 1% of subjects treated with SOF/VEL in ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3, respectively.  
SOF/VEL in postpartum women with OUD, Version 8.0  June 11, 2019 
32 
 There are known drug interactions with SOF/VEL and other prescription and non-prescription medications.  A 
comprehensive list of medications will be obtained from participants including over-the-counter medications (i.e. 
antacids, St. John’s wort) and compared to the package insert to assess any contraindication to participation or 
necessary alterations in dosing schedules with use of the study medication.   
Phlebotomy or starting an IV may lead to excessive bleeding, discomfort, feelings of dizziness or faintness, 
and/or bruising, swelling and/or infection.  
Disclosure of HIV status may cause worry, sadness or depression. Disclosure of HIV-positive status has been 
associated with depression, suicidal ideation, and denial as well as social isolation. Trained counselors will be 
available to help participants deal with these feelings.  
Participation in clinical research includes the risks of confidentiality loss. 
Participants will be asked to provide personal/protected health information (PHI).  All attempts will be made to 
keep PHI confidential within the limits of the law.  However, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will see 
PHI.  All paper records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at Magee.  Electronic 
files will be password protected.  Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing 
of this study will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected.  Any publications from this study will not use 
information that will identify participants by [CONTACT_2300].  Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records 
maintained at the participating sites for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as the study 
sponsor, the National Institute of Health (NIH) or its designee and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Benefits 
Participants may or may not benefit from being in this study. Participants may benefit from this study though the 
opportunity to receive treatment for their chronic HCV.  Participants and others may benefit in the future from 
information learned from this study. Specifically, information learned in this study may lead to evidence-based 
guidance for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the postpartum period in conjunction with opi[INVESTIGATOR_183834].  
Informed Consent Process 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each study participant prior to performing study procedures. In 
obtaining and documenting informed consent, the study investigators will comply with applicable local and US 
regulatory requirements and will adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Participants will be provided with a copy of the informed consent form if they chose. 
The informed consent process will cover all elements of informed consent required by [CONTACT_18125]. In 
addition, the process specifically will address the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_68352]:

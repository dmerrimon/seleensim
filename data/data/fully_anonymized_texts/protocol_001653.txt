Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 1 Introduction 
1.1 RAD001 (everolimus) 
RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin.  
RAD001 has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ 
transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of 
rejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority 
of the European Union. RAD001 has been in development for patients with various 
malignancies since 2002. RAD001 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets were approved under the 
trade name [CONTACT_3617]®  for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of 
treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or Nexavar® (sorafenib) in the US, EU and several other 
countries and is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide.  Afinitor® was also 
recently approved for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma 
(SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are 
not candidates for curative surgical resection. 
RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: 
 Directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_580457] (via potent 
inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF-induced proliferation 
of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth is 
well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor 
production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in 
endothelial cells. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_763234] and mechanism of action 
At cellular and molecular levels, RAD001 acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. RAD001 
selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key and highly conservative 
serine-threonine kinase, which is present in all cells and is a central regulator of protein 
synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and cell survival. mTOR 
is the only currently known target of RAD001 (Reviewed in Boulay and Lane 2007). 
mTOR is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a pathway known to be dysregulated in a 
wide spectrum of human cancers (e.g. through loss/mutation of the PTEN negative regulator; 
through PI3K mutation/amplification; through AKT/PKB overexpression/overactivation; 
through modulation of TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressors). In addition, activation of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently a characteristic of worsening prognosis through 
increased aggressiveness, resistance to treatment and progression.  
The main known functions of mTOR include the following (Bjornsti and Houghton 2004; 
Boulay and Lane, 2007): 
 mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy and nutrient levels, 
facilitating cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase in appropriate growth conditions. 
 Confidential Page 7 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763235] itself is frequently activated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors.  
 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E-BP1) and 
activating the  40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates translation of 
important messages, including those encoding the HIF-[ADDRESS_763236] leads to increased production of pro-angiogenic factors 
(i.e., VEGF) in tumors and to cell growth and proliferation of tumor, endothelial, and 
smooth muscle cells. 
 The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators, such as 
AKT that phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous Sclerosis 
Complex (TSC1/TSC2). 
mTOR is represented by [CONTACT_316988], mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1, rapamycin sensitive) and mTORC2 (mTOR 
complex 2, rapamycin insensitive) (Wullschleger et al. 2006).  
mTORC1 is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT (also known as PKB, 
protein kinase B) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) (Bjornsti and Houghton 
2004). Activated AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which leads to the dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 
complex, thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2 to act as a GTPase activating protein. This allows 
Rheb, a small G-protein, to remain in a GTP bound state and to activate mTORC1. AKT can 
also activate mTORC1 by [CONTACT_129554]40 phosphorylation, thereby [CONTACT_214791]40-mediated 
inhibition of mTORC1 (Manning and Cantley 2007; Wang, et al. 2007).  
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) is activated through a currently unknown mechanism, possibly 
by [CONTACT_129556] (RTK) signaling (Manning and Cantley 2007). It has been 
suggested that mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates a different pool of AKT that is not 
upstream of mTORC1. PHLPP phosphatase plays a role of a negative regulator. mTORC2 is 
rapamycin insensitive and is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton 
(Wullschleger et al. 2006). 
mTORC1-mediated signaling is subject to modulation by [CONTACT_580458], such as RAD001. Once these agents bind to the 12 kDa cytosolic FK506-
binding protein immunophilin FKBP12, the resulting rapamycin-FKBP12 complexes bind to 
a specific site near the catalytic domain of mTORC1 and inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR 
substrates. As a consequence, downstream signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 
to S-phase transition are inhibited. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the 
immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin as well as its putative antineoplastic activity 
[Reviewed in (Sabatini 2006)]. As many cancers are characterized by [CONTACT_113912] G1 
transit (for example, overexpression of cyclin or cyclin-dependent kinases), inhibition of 
mTOR becomes an intriguing target for inducing cytostasis (Bjornsti and Houghton 2004).  
1.1.2 Preclinical studies 
Everolimus acts as an inhibitor of interleukin and growth-factor -dependent proliferation of 
cells. The only currently known target of everolimus is mTOR, a key regulatory protein 
 Confidential Page 8 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 affecting cell growth (Boulay and Lane, 2007). Everolimus exerts its activity through high 
affinity interaction with an intracellular receptor protein, the immunophilin FKBP12. The 
FKBP12/everolimus complex subsequently interacts with the mTOR protein kinase, inhibiting 
downstream signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 to S-phase transition.  
The main known functions of mTOR include: 
• Function as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors, energy and nutrient levels, facilitating cell-
cycle progression from G1 - S phase in appropriate growth conditions. 
• Regulation of protein synthesis important for tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis 
through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S 
ribosomal S6 kinases (e.g. p70S6K1). For example, activation of the mTOR pathway leads to 
a) increased production of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF) in tumors b) tumor, endothelial 
and smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation. 
The PI3K-mTOR pathway itself is frequently activated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors. The regulation of 
mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators such as AKT that phosphorylate 
and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/TSC2). In 
summary, mTOR has pleiotropic functions; hence, the activities of everolimus may vary 
depending upon cell type. 
The mTOR inhibitory activities presumably contribute to the antiproliferative activity of 
everolimus against tumor cell lines. However, everolimus may also exert an antitumor effect 
through the inhibition of angiogenesis. Indeed, both rapamycin and everolimus potently 
inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells ([LOCATION_009]sc 1999, Yu 1999, Lane et al 2009) and have 
antiangiogenic activity in vivo (Guba 2002, Tsutsumi 2004, Mabuchi et al 2007, Lane et al 
2009). Exactly which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to 
everolimus is still unclear. Currently, the activation status of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70 S6K 
pathway may be indicative of responsiveness to rapamycins. For example, preclinically, loss 
of PTEN or constitutive/hyper-activation of AKT has been suggested to sensitize tumors to 
the effects of inhibition of mTOR (Reviewed in Boulay and Lane, 2007, Mabuchi et al 2007). 
Also, clinically, it has been suggested that high p70S6K activation in baseline GBM tumor 
samples may predict a patient population more likely to derive benefit from mTOR inhibition 
(Galanis, et al 2005). 
Everolimus is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR, which is afforded by [CONTACT_5019]-affinity binding 
to the protein FKBP-12 (IC 50 of 5.3 nM) similar to that of rapamycin. Similar potency of 
rapamycin and everolimus was also demonstrated at forming the mTOR / FKBP-[ADDRESS_763237] 10 
other protein kinases at concentrations up to 10 μM. 
 
The antiproliferative effects of everolimus were investigated in a mixed panel of 48 different 
tumor cell lines (including breast, colon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], glioblastoma, lung, melanoma, prostate 
and renal). The majority of tumor cell lines were highly sensitive to the anti-proliferative 
effects of everolimus while a few others appeared intrinsically insensitive, or „resistant‟ (IC 50 
range 0.2 to 4125 nM) ( O‟Reilly and McSheehy, 2009 ). The median IC 50 value of the 48 cell

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763238] been observed for rapamycin ( Huang and Houghton  
2002). Everolimus was also shown to have activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, 
where induction of apoptosis was reported (Zitzmann, et al 2007), as well as in acute myeloid 
leukemia cells (Zeng, et al 2007), mantle cell lymphoma cells (Haritunians, et al 2007), adult 
T-cell leukemia cells (Ikezoe, et al 2007), diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells (Wanner, et al 
2006), pancreatic tumor cells (Tuncyurek, et al 2007), ovarian cancer cells (Treeck, et al 2006, 
Mabuchi, et al 2007) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Sieghart, et al 2007). 
Everolimus was also evaluated in a clonogenic assay using cells derived from 81 patient 
derived tumor xenografts never cultured in vitro (11 human tumor types with 3 to 24 tumors 
each: bladder, colon, gastric, NSCLC, SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, and 
pleuramesothelioma). Everolimus inhibited colony formation in a concentration-dependent 
manner (mean IC 50: 175 nM). In addition, normal hematopoetic stem cells were found to be 
relatively insensitive to everolimus, with an IC 50 about 15 fold higher than the tumor lines. 
Everolimus is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR, which is afforded by [CONTACT_5019]-affinity binding 
to the protein FKBP-12 (IC 50 of 5.3 nM) similar to that of rapamycin. Similar potency of 
rapamycin and everolimus was also demonstrated at forming the mTOR / FKBP-[ADDRESS_763239] 10 
other protein kinases at concentrations up to 10 μM. The antiproliferative effects of 
everolimus were investigated in a mixed panel of 48 different tumor cell lines (including 
breast, colon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], glioblastoma, lung, melanoma, prostate and renal).  
Everolimus was also shown to have activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, where 
induction of apoptosis was reported (Zitzmann, et al 2007), as well as in acute myeloid 
leukemia cells (Zeng, et al 2007), mantle cell lymphoma cells (Haritunians, et al 2007), adult 
T-cell leukemia cells (Ikezoe, et al 2007), diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells (Wanner, et al 
2006), pancreatic tumor cells (Tuncyurek, et al 2007), ovarian cancer cells (Treeck, et al 2006, 
Mabuchi, et al 2007) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Sieghart, et al 2007). Everolimus 
was also evaluated in a clonogenic assay using cells derived from 81 patient derived tumor 
xenografts never cultured in vitro (11 human tumor types with 3 to 24 tumors each: bladder, 
colon, gastric, NSCLC, SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, and 
pleuramesothelioma). Everolimus inhibited colony formation in a concentration-dependent 
manner (mean IC 50: 175 nM). In addition, normal hematopoetic stem cells were found to be 
relatively insensitive to everolimus, with an IC [ADDRESS_763240] subcutanuous (s.c.) tumors established 
from a variety of tumor cell lines of diverse histotypes (NSCLC, pancreatic, colon, melanoma, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_015]), including a PgP170-overexpressing, multi-drug resistant tumor line. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
the antitumor activity of everolimus was that of reduction of tumor growth rates rather than 
producing regressions or stable disease although, in the case of A549 and NCI-H596 lung and 
ARJ42 pancreatic tumors, regressions could be obtained. These effects occurred within the 
dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg, p.o., once per day. The change in tumor volume of the treated 
mice divided by [CONTACT_129558] (T/C) typi[INVESTIGATOR_129520] 15 to 50% at optimal doses. A marked loss of antitumor activity occurred when 
tumor-bearing mice were treated with everolimus once per week, but improved moderately

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 with twice per week dosing. Antitumor activity of everolimus has also been demonstrated in 
mouse models of ovarian ( Mabuchi, et al 2007 ), breast ( Lu, et al 2007 , Torres-Arzayus , et al 
2007) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( Rossi, et al 2006 ). 
 
Pre-clinical safety 
In safety pharmacology studies, everolimus was devoid of relevant effects on vital organ 
functions including the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_129521]. Everolimus had no 
effects on QT interval. Furthermore, everolimus showed no antigenic potential. Although 
everolimus passes the blood-brain barrier, there was no indication of relevant changes in the 
behavior of rodents, even after single oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg or after repeated 
administration at up to 40 mg/kg/day. 
The preclinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], monkeys, 
and rabbits. The major target organs were male and female reproductive systems (testicular 
tubular degeneration, reduced sperm content in epi[INVESTIGATOR_129522]) in several 
species; lungs (increased alveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; and eyes (lenticular anterio r 
suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney changes were seen in the rat (exacerbation of 
age-related lipofuscin in tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse 
(exacerbation of background lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys 
or minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. 
Genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of 
clastogenic or mutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to [ADDRESS_763241] doses, corresponding 
respectively to 4.2 and 0.2 times the estimated clinical exposure. In reproduction studies, 
everolimus was toxic to the conceptus in rats and rabbits, and was considered potentially 
teratogenic in rats. It is therefore recommended that women of childbearing potential should 
use effective contraceptive measures during the entire treatment period and for 8 weeks 
thereafter.

1.1.3 Clinical experience 
[IP_ADDRESS] RAD001 Pharmacokinetics 
Everolimus is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median t max of 1-2 hours. The steady-state AUC 0-τ is 
dose-proportional over the dose range between 5 to 70 mg in the weekly regimen and 5 and 
10 mg in the daily regimen. Steady-state was achieved within two weeks with the daily dosing 
regimen. C max is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg for both the weekly and daily 
regimens. At doses of 20 mg/week and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose 
proportional. In healthy subjects, high fat meals reduced systemic exposure to everolimus 10 
mg (as measured by [CONTACT_12265]) by 22% and the peak plasma concentration C max by 54%. Light fat 
 Confidential Page 11 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 meals reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Food, however, had no apparent effect on the 
post absorption phase concentration-time profile. 
The blood- to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 
5 to 5,000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is 
approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus 10 
mg/day. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment.  
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. 
Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood 
and is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacologic activity.  No specific 
excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; however, data available from the 
transplantation setting found the drug to be mainly eliminated through the feces. There was a 
significant correlation between AUC 0-τ and pre-dose trough concentration at steady-state on 
the daily regimen. The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. 
 
Table 3-3 (Section 3.3.3) lists examples of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. 
Please refer to Section 3.3.3 for more information on the concomitant use of CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers and other medications.

[IP_ADDRESS] RAD001 Pharmacodynamic studies 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling based on inhibition of the biomarker p70S6 
kinase 1 [S6K1] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) suggests that 5-10 mg daily 
should be an adequate dose to produce a high-degree of sustained target inhibition ([Study 
C2101] / [Study 2102], Lane et al 2003). In molecular changes in tumor were evaluated 
through serial biopsying before and during treatment. Biopsying on treatment took place in 
week 4 (pharmacokinetic steady-state). All patients underwent a 24-hour post-dose biopsy. 
Patients following the weekly regimen had a further biopsy on Day [ADDRESS_763242] with a near complete inhibition of pS6 and pelF-4G at the  10 mg/day and 50 mg/wk 
schedules. In addition, pAKT was upregulated in 50% of the treated tumors. In the daily 
schedule, there was a correlation between everolimus plasma trough concentrations and 
inhibition of peIF4G and p4E-BP1. There was good concordance of mTOR pathway 
inhibition between skin and tumor. ([Study C2107], Tabernero, 200 8)

Everolimus has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid  
organ transplantation and was approved in Europe in 2003 under the trade name [CONTACT_117] ®, 
for the prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and cardiac transplantation. 
Additional non-oncologic indications currently being explored are wet age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Clinical 
experience of everolimus in the transplant indication is summarized in a separate 
Investigator‟s Brochure.  
In oncology, everolimus has been in clinical development since [ADDRESS_763243] been conducted in support of the transplant 
indication, are described in the oncology IB due to the relevance of these data for the 
oncology indication. Malignancies that are currently being evaluated in [COMPANY_001] sponsored 
studies include the following: metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), breast cancer, 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET), mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse 
large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), gastric cancer, and lung 
cancer. In addition, treatment of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) associated 
subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and Angiomyolypoma is also being evaluated. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is no longer being evaluated. 
 
Everolimus 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets were approved under the trade name [CONTACT_3617]® for 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in the US, EU and several other countries and is 
undergoing registration in other regions worldwide.  Recent approval was granted in the US 
for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astocytoma (SEGA) associated with 
tuberous sclerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for 
curative surgical resection. 
. 
Phase I dose escalating studies, exploratory Phase I/II studies with everolimus as single agent 
or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, Phase II/III studies of everolimus in 
indications, and Phase III double-blind studies are contributing to the extensive database. 
Approximately 12,[ADDRESS_763244] been treated with everolimus as of 30 SEP 2010: 
• 5559 patients in [COMPANY_001]-sponsored clinical trials 
• 712 patients in the single patients use IND program for renal cell cancer 
• 5474 in investigator-sponsored studies. 
• In addition, healthy volunteer subjects have participated in the clinical pharmacology 
studies as described in Section 5.2. 
As of 30 SEP 2010, there are a total of 11 Phase III trials ongoing in the indications mRCC 
(1), advanced NET (2), breast cancer (3 ), TSC (2), DLBCL (1), gastric cancer (1) and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (1). One additional Phase III trial in the  TCS will be starting later in

lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths 
due to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were 
observed on the everolimus arm. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting 
in permanent discontinuation were 7% and 0% for the everolimus and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively. Safety data from study [C2240] are described in detail in Section 6.5.  
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies are 
consistent with the aforementioned findings of the Phase III trial. Everolimus is generally well 
tolerated at weekly and daily dose schedules. The safety profile is characterized by 
[CONTACT_58858] (AEs). These AEs are generally reversible and non-cumulative.

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 [IP_ADDRESS] Gliomas 
  
The incidence of primary brain tumors in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is about 17,000 per year, 
with a case fatality of about 10,000 per year.  Gliomas account for up to 80% of primary brain 
tumors and they account for significant mortality.  Gliomas can be classified as either high-
grade (or malignant), or low-grade.  The low-grade gliomas (LGG) themselves are a diverse 
group of glial tumors with an annual incidence in the US is about 1800 cases ( CBTRUS: 
Statistical Report  2002). Histologic subtypes of LGG include diffuse astrocytomas (WHO 
grade II astrocytomas), oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas Ashby [CONTACT_2297]. 2004).  
The majority of these tumors are of mixed histology.   
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_580433] 10-year survival rates 
for LGG range from 17-49%.  Survival is limited by [CONTACT_580459]-grade gliomas. Factors influencing survival in these patients include histologic subtype, 
age, extent of surgical resection, and presence of 1p 19q status (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_580434] 2002; Yeh et al. 
2005; Smith et al. 2000.   One particular subtype of LGG, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_422860], usually 
occurs in the cerebellum of children. These tumors are often completely resectable and are 
associated with a 10-year survival of >80%.  For the purposes of this project only 
supratentorial non-pi[INVESTIGATOR_580435].  
 
The management of patients with residual low grade glioma following surgical resection is 
not standardized (Lang et al. 2006).  Options include surveillance scans and treatment at the 
time of tumor progression, versus the use of radiation therapy soon after the surgical 
procedure.  Adjuvant chemotherapy following radiation is not considered a standard approach 
(Grier and Batchelor, 2003).    
 
Low grade gliomas are diffuse in nature and the treatment fields for radiation therapy can be 
large. The potential complications of radiation therapy to the brain include seizures, cognitive 
decline, endocrinopathies, necrosis and vasculopathies.  In addition, any of a number of 
secondary malignancies may arise after radiation treatment including meningiomas, gliomas 
and sarcomas.  Given the potential for long term survival of patients with LGG and the 
morbidity associated with radiation therapy, alternative approaches in this setting are 
appealing and are being evaluated (Grier and Batchelor, 2003).     
 
In an effort to reduce the use of radiotherapy, several studies have evaluated the use of 
chemotherapy as initial treatment of LGG.  Tumor  regressions using a combination of 
procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine in patients with an oligodendroglial component has 
been demonstrated (Buckner et al. 2003; Stege at al. 2005).  More recently, temozolomide 
showed activity as treatment for recurrent LGG.  However, the role of chemotherapy as up-
front treatment of LGG continues to be evaluated (Grier and Batchelor, 2003; Hoang-Xaun et 
al. 2004; Brada et al. 2003).  
 
The role of chemotherapy in adult patients with recurrent LGG has also not been extensively 
investigated (Quinn et al. 2003; Pace et al. 2003; Soffietti et al. 1998).  Nitrosourea based 
chemotherapy and temozolomide have both been evaluated. In small studies, temozolomide

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763245] response rates ranging from 47-61% and 1 year progression free survival from 
39-76% (Quinn et al. 2003; Pace et al. 2003).  Although these numbers appear promising for 
the treatment of recurrent LGG with chemotherapy, other treatment strategies are needed for 
this patient population, especially in the setting of progression to malignant glioma.  With a 
better understanding of the signaling pathways important for tumor growth and invasion,

[IP_ADDRESS]  PTEN methylation and PKB/Akt phosphorylation in gliomas 
 
Alterations in the tumor suppressor protein PTEN are common in gliomas and result in 
activation of the PI3K pathway, as evidenced by [CONTACT_580460] / Akt.  Whereas 
mutation of PTEN is common in de novo malignant gliomas (Choe et al. 2003; Rasheed et al. 
1997; Ermoian et al. 2002), methylation of the PTEN promoter is thought to be the underlying 
mechanism of PTEN alteration found in low-grade gliomas and secondary malignant gliomas 
(Wiencke et al. 2007).   
 
In fact, methylation of the PTEN promoter occurs frequently in low-grade gliomas.  Whereas 
there is no evidence of PTEN promoter methylation in normal brain and only 9% methylation 
in de novo glioblastiomas, low-grade tumors displayed methylation of PTEN promoter in 43-
67% of low-grade glioma cases, and in 68-82% of secondary high grade glioma cases. The 
differences in PTEN promoter methylation frequencies for low-grade gliomas were highly 
statistically significant (P<0.001) (Wiencke et al 2007).   
 
Not only is methylation of the PTEN promoter frequent and associated specifically with low-
grade gliomas and secondary malignant gliomas, there is evidence that PTEN methylation 
also leads to functional activation of the PI3K pathway, which is thought to be important for 
tumor transformation and growth (Wiencke et al. 2007).  Furthermore, a retrospective study of 
43 LGG (grade II) tumor specimens from newly diagnosed patients show a trend towards 
decreased overall survival in low grade glioma patients with PTEN promoter methylation 
compared to those without methylation (McBride et al. 2007).   
 
Because of the clinical significance of PTEN promoter methylation and its effects on the PI3K 
pathway, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580437]3K activity may be of clinical benefit in low-
grade gliomas.  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is downstream to the (PI3K) / 
PTEN-AKT survival pathway and is therefore an ideal target for low-grade glioma and 
secondary malignant glioma patients with PTEN promoter methylation (Choe et al. 2003; Xu 
et al. 2004; Neshat et al. 2001).  In fact, there is evidence that tumors expressing activated 
PKB/Akt appear particularly sensitive to mTOR inhibition (Gera et al. 2004; Noh et al. 2004).   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical experience with mTOR inhibitors for gliomas 
 
There is extensive clinical experience with mTOR inhibitors including the evaluation in the 
treatment of patients with malignant glioma (Reardon et al. 2006).  Perhaps most exciting are 
recent studies in which patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and low-grade 
 Confidential Page 16 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 gliomas were treated with an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin most commonly), resulting in tumor 
regression in every treated patient.  In one patient treatment was interrupted, resulting in 
tumor re-growth, followed by [CONTACT_580461] (Franz et al. 2006). The success of this approach adds credence to our plan to treat 
low-grade gliomas with RAD001 because of the genetic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_580438]-grade gliomas 
in TSC patients.  In brief, mutations in either hamartin or tuberin, the tuberous sclerosis gene 
products, result in elevated mTOR signaling.  As a result, afflicted individuals develop 
hamartomatous growths in multiple organs, and 5-15% of TSC patients develop low-grade 
central nervous system neoplasms in the form of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas 
(SEGAs).  Although SEGAs rarely respond to radiation or chemotherapy, striking tumor 
regressions were documented after treatment with mTOR inhibitor in these TSC patients.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_763246] shown that methylation of the PTEN promoter occurs frequently in low-grade 
gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and is associated with PI3K signaling and PKB/Akt 
phosphorylation (Wiencke et al. 2007).  Given these findings, and the link between (mTOR) 
and the (PI3K) / PTEN-AKT survival pathway, we hope that RAD001 will also prove 
efficacious in the treatment of low-grade gliomas and secondary malignant gliomas as 
delineated in the study proposed herein.   
 
In this study, molecular features, including PTEN status and PKB/Akt phosphorylation will be 
assessed prospectively in this trial to test the hypothesis that those tumors with PTEN 
methylation and consequent PKB/Akt phosphorylation will preferentially respond to mTOR 
inhibition. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_763247] anatomic MRI in conjunction with clinical evaluation such as neurologic status and 
corticosteroid use, remains the key determinant of response to therapy and the evaluation of 
tumor recurrence for LGG (Just and Thelen 1988; Dean et al. 1990; Ginsberg et al. 1996) . 
Increase in contrast enhancement, worsening cerebral edema, and mass effect are universal 
traits of malignant transformation. Acquiring tissue samples to confirm tumor upgrade, 
although considered the “gold standard” for determining the presence of viable tumor, can 
result in both false positives and negatives that relate to sampling error (Earnest et al. 1988; 
Kleihues et al. 1993). Recent studies using MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) suggest that in 
vivo levels of metabolites such as choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate, lactate and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_580439]-reliable measures of the presence of recurrent tumor. Perfusion-weighted 
imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been explored for patients with 
newly diagnosed glioma, but only on a limited basis for patients with recurrent LGG. 
Techniques to characterize the molecular morphology of pre-specified areas in addition to 
neuroimaging parameters may better define the biologic behavior of such lesions. 
 
Many of the newer drugs being studied in neuro-oncology target specific aberrant pathways 
and are cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Examples include anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic

was 61 years (range 27 to 85). The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) were 
stomatitis, rash, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucosal inflammation,

most common grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) were infections, stomatitis, 
fatigue, and pneumonitis. 
The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (range 19 to 451) for patients 
receiving everolimus and 60 days (range 21 to 295) for those receiving placebo. The rates of 
treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were 7% and 0% 
for the everolimus and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Most treatment-emergent 
adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse 
reactions were reported in 39% versus 7% of patients receiving everolimus and placebo, 
respectively. Deaths due to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal 
failure (0.4%) were observed on the everolimus arm. 
 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, 
fungal, viral or protozoan infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens. 
Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive 
fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral infections including 
reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking everolimus. Some of 
these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to respi[INVESTIGATOR_36886]) and 
occasionally have had a fatal outcome. 
 
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with everolimus. 
Treat pre-existing infections prior to starting treatment with everolimus. While taking 
everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of infection is 
made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of 
everolimus. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue 
everolimus and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
 
Reactivation/flare of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving 
chemotherapy (Yeo 2004). Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been seen in

Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by [CONTACT_129572], but not limited to, anaphylaxis, 
dyspnea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or 
without respi[INVESTIGATOR_88739]) have been observed with everolimus. 
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is 
recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter. Optimal 
glycemic control should be achieved before starting a patient on everolimus. Mouth ulcers, 
stomatitis and oral mucositis have been seen in patients treated with everolimus. In such cases

Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, have been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring 
of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine, 
is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter. 
Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelets and neutrophils have been reported in clinical 
trials. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of everolimus 
therapy and periodically thereafter. 
Everolimus is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment, (Child-Pugh class  
C). 
The use of live vaccines and close contact [CONTACT_580464] d 
be avoided during treatment with everolimus.

Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to RAD001 should be treated using local 
supportive care.  
When described, the disorder has been identified as inflammation or ulcers in the mouth. If 
exam reveals mouth ulcers, rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, please 
classify the adverse event as „mouth ulcers‟. If inflammation is limited to the mouth without 
ulcers please use the term „stomatitis‟ rather than the less specific term „mucositis‟.

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 If the disorder is elsewhere than the mouth please describe the location as well as any specific 
procedures carried out for exploration (e.g. endoscopy).   
Please use the Grading according to the NIH-NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0; http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf). 
Grade 1: minimal symptoms; normal diet 
Grade 2: symptomatic but can eat and swallow modified diet 
Grade 3: symptomatic and unable to adequately aliment or hydrate orally 
Grade 4: symptoms associated with life-threatening consequences  
Recommendations 
1. To help avoid these effects patients should brush their teeth with a very soft toothbrush and if 
gums bleed patients should be instructed to brush their teeth with gauze instead, use an 
alcohol-free mouthwash up to 3 times a day, eat soft bland foods like puddings milkshakes 
and cream soups, avoid spi[INVESTIGATOR_70329], crunchy, acidic and very hot foods.  
2. For mild toxicity (Grade 1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic mouth wash 
or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution. 
3. For more severe toxicity (Grade [ADDRESS_763266] pain but are able to 
maintain adequate oral alimentation, or Grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain 
adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_53295] (i.e., local anesthetics such as benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (e.g. Kenalog in Orabase®). 
Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen 
mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless 
a fungal infection is diagnosed. In particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents 
(ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their 
strong inhibition of RAD001 metabolism, therefore leading to higher RAD001 exposures. 
Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_033]. Similarly, 
antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral infection is diagnosed.

habits. Blood tests to monitor hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309937].. 
Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_580443]. Patients should be monitored clinically and through serum chemistry for the 
development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as required in the product label/data 
sheets for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is 
recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter. Optimal 
glycemic control should be achieved before starting trial therapy.

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 [IP_ADDRESS]   Management of Hepatitis B reactivation 
If any patients experience reactivation of hepatitis B during treatment, the patient will be 
removed from study protocol and referred to the appropriate specialist for management of 
Hepatitis B.   
[IP_ADDRESS]   Management of non-infectious pneumonitis 
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non-infectious 
pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been described in patients taking 
everolimus (see Section 5 Adverse drug reactions). Some of these have been severe and on 
rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed.  
A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with 
non-specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], pleural effusion, cough or 
dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-medicinal causes have been 
excluded by [CONTACT_129575]. Patients should be advised to report 
promptly any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have 
few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy without dose alteration. If symptoms 
are moderate (Grade 2), consideration should be given to interruption of therapy until 
symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. Everolimus may be 
reintroduced at a reduced dose until recovery to Grade 1 or better.  
For cases where symptoms of non-infectious pneumonitis are severe (Grade 3), everolimus 
therapy should be discontinued and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical 
symptoms resolve. Therapy with everolimus may be re-initiated at a reduced dose depending 
on the individual clinical circumstances. 
 
Both asymptomatic radiological changes (grade 1) and symptomatic non-infectious 
pneumonitis (grade 2 = not interfering with activities of daily living or grade 3 = interfering 
with activities of daily living and oxygen indicated) have been noted in patients receiving 
RAD001 therapy. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been associated with RAD001 and other 
mTOR inhibitors (Atkins 2004). In order to monitor for asymptomatic (grade 1) pulmonary 
infiltrates, a chest X-ray is required if a CT scan of chest is not used for bi-monthly disease 
evaluations. Additional chest CT scans may be performed, when clinically necessary. If non-
infectious pneumonitis develops, a consultation with a pulmonologist should be considered. If 
the patient develops grade 3 pneumonitis, treatment with RAD001 should be interrupted and 
the patient should be treated as medically indicated (short course corticosteroids, oxygen, 
etc).Management of non-infectious pneumonitis suspected to be associated with RAD001 and 
dose modifications instructions are provided in Table 3-2

3.3 Treatments 
3.3.1 RAD001 Administration 
The study drug RAD001 will be self-administered (by [CONTACT_36129]). The 
investigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. 
RAD001 will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg (two 5 mg tablets) 
continuously from study day [ADDRESS_763271] be recorded. 
Medication labels will comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They 
will supply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be 
described on the medication label. 
RAD001 will be provided by [CONTACT_5343]. RAD001 is formulated as tablets for oral 
administration of 5 mg and 10mg strength. Tablets are blister-packed under aluminum foil in 
units of 10 tablets (16 units per box), which should be opened only at the time of 
administration as drug is both hygroscopic and light-sensitive. 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_763272] year, patients will receive an MRI 
and return to clinic for clinical evaluation.  The frequency of MRI‟s is based on clinical 
practice at the Neuro-oncology department at UCSF for patients on active therapy.  Upon re-
evaluation, patients who have not experienced excess toxicity or disease progression will 
continue on protocol therapy.

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763273] dose of RAD001.   
 
3.3.3 Concomitant therapy 
 
All concomitant medications administered within 14 days of enrollment through treatment 
termination should be reported to the investigator and recorded in the Case Report Form 
(CRF).  In particular, corticosteroid dosing will be recorded as use of corticosteroids may 
affect the appearance of T2 changes on MRI imaging.  In addition, the definition of response 
is based on corticosteroid use (see section 3.42).   
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over-the-counter 
products) during the course of the study without prior consultation with the investigator. At 
each visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any new medications he/she is or has 
taken after the start of the study drug. 
All Concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to start and 
after start of study drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be 
recorded. 
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study: 
 No other investigational therapy should be given to patients. 
 No anticancer agents other than the study medication should be given to patients. If such 
agents are required for a patient then the patient must first be withdrawn from the study. 
 Oral contraceptives in preclinical and clinical data have shown everolimus to have 
CYP3A4 inhibitory activity rather than induction activity, induction of metabolism of 
contraceptive hormones by [CONTACT_129577]. Consequently, administration of 
everolimus should not reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or PgP  
 Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir) or P-glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided  
 Confidential Page 31 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763274] P450 and PgP activity. These 
juices are potent CYP3A4-inhibitors. Concomitant use should be avoided  
 Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole) or 
PgP inhibitors should be used with caution.  If patient requires co-administration of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors, reduce the dose of RAD001 to 2.5 mg 
daily. Additional dose reductions to every other day may be required to manage toxicities. 
If the inhibitor is discontinued the RAD001 dose should be returned to the dose used prior 
to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor after a washout period of 2 to 3 days. 
Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP 
Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers. If patient requires co-administration of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, Phenobarbital, St. 
John‟s wort), an increase in the dose of everolimus from 10mg daily to 20mg daily, using 5mg 
increments. Enzyme induction usually occurs within 7-10 days, therefore everolimus dose 
should be increased by [CONTACT_098] 7 days after the start of the inducer therapy.  If no safety 
concerns are seen within the next 7 days, the dose can be increased again one additional 
increment up to a maximum of twice the daily dose used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP3A4 inducer.  This dose adjustment of RAD001 is intended to achieve similar AUC to 
the range observed without inducers.  However, there are no clinical data with this dose 
adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers.  If the strong inducer is 
discontinued the RAD001 dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.  
 
 No chronic treatment with systemic steroids (at a dose equivalent of greater than 20 mg 
prednisone per day) or other immunosuppressive agents. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_580444]. 
 
 The use of live vaccines and close contact [CONTACT_580465]. Examples of live vaccines include 
intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella and 
TY21a typhoid vaccines. 
Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are CYP2C9 substrates and, as such, no interaction with 
RAD001 is expected. However, drug-drug interaction studies between macrolide antibiotics 
and warfarin have produced mixed outcomes and the disparity in these findings has led to the 
conclusion that multiple factors may alter the clearance of warfarin. The coadministration of 
RAD001 and oral anticoagulants is possible but should be subject to verification of 
coagulation (INR) once steady state is reached (after one week‟s treatment).

[IP_ADDRESS] Response Definitions 
 
Standard anatomic MRI in conjunction with clinical evaluation such as neurologic status and 
corticosteroid use, remains the key determinant of response to therapy and the evaluation of 
tumor recurrence for low grade gioma. Increase in contrast enhancement, worsening cerebral 
edema, and mass effect are traits of malignant transformation. Acquiring tissue samples to 
confirm tumor upgrade, although considered the “gold standard” for determining the presence 
of viable tumor, can result in both false positives and negatives that relate to sampling error.  
Evaluating response in low-grade glioma by [CONTACT_580467]-funded brain tumor consortiums 
operate. 
 
One of the secondary endpoints will be response rate, based on the best response achieved (see 
below for definition of best response).  In order to ensure comparability of data from this trial 
with data from earlier trials, this trial will retain the traditional evaluation definition as the 
primary way to define response.  Response will be determined by [CONTACT_224361]-dimensional 
diameters.  However, RECIST criteria will be collected and used for secondary evaluation.   
 
Definitions of Response  
 
Measurable Disease:  Bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins 
by [CONTACT_212690].  A measurable lesion must be [ADDRESS_763283] diameter. 
 
Evaluable Disease:  Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not 
clearly defined. 
 
Objective Status, To Be Recorded at Each Evaluation:  If there are too many lesions to 
measure at each evaluation, choose the largest two to be followed before a patient is 
entered on study.  The remaining lesions will be considered evaluable for the purpose 
of objective status determination.  Unless progression is observed, objective status can 
only be determined when ALL measurable and evaluable sites and lesions are 
assessed. 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable 
disease.  No new lesions.  No evidence of non-evaluable disease.  All measurable, 
evaluable and non-evaluable lesions and sites must be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline.  Patients must be on minimal or no steroids. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   Greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the 
sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions.  No progression 
of evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  All measurable and evaluable lesions and sites 
must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  Responders must be on the 
same or decreasing doses of dexamethasone. 
 
Partial Response, Non-Measurable (PRNM):  Not applicable. 
 
 Confidential Page 41 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 Stable / No Response (NR) / No Change (NC):  Does not qualify for CR, PR, or 
progression.  The designation of Stable/No Response requires a minimum of [ADDRESS_763284] be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline. 
 
Progression:  25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over 
smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) using the same techniques as 
baseline, OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new 
lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition 
(unless clearly unrelated to this cancer). 
 
Unknown:  Progression has not been documented and one or more measurable or 
evaluable sites have not been assessed. 
 
Best Response:  This will be calculated from the sequence of objective statuses. 
 
For patients with all disease sites assessed every evaluation period, the best response 
will be defined as the best objective status as measured according to the previously 
noted definitions.  Best response is unknown if all objective status determinations 
before progression are unknown. 
 
Neurological Exam:  Although not used for determining response, it is useful to 
evaluate improvement in the neurologic exam that should coincide with objective 
measurement of tumor size.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pathology Review 
 
Pathology must be reviewed in the UCSF pathology department.   
 
Obtaining tissue samples : 
 
 The UCSF Neurosurgery Tissue Bank has a general consent that patients sign to 
authorize release of their samples from previous surgeries at outside institutions.  
 Slides and tissue blocks, along with a path report, are sent to UCSF -- c/o one of the 
NeuroOnc study coordinators or directly to the Neurosurgery tissue bank manager 
(currently Cynthia Cowdrey)  
 
Preparation of tissue samples : 
 
 Confidential Page 42 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011 
 Once received, samples are logged into the Pathology computer system and assigned 
an SF#.   
 If H&E slides are not provided, the tissue bank manager (currently Cynthia Cowdrey) 
will prepare unstained slides from paraffin blocks.   
 The unstained slides will be staining at the UCSF Core lab. 
 
Review of tissue samples : 
 
 Pathology Materials Required for Review: 
o A copy of the Pathology Reports and the Operative Reports. 
o A Protocol Specific Pathology Submission Form. 
 A neuropathologist () will review all H&E slides and will determine if the histology 
corresponds to the report and if it is adequate / appropriate for the study.   
 The neuropathologist will also choose the blocks from which to prepare unstained 
slides for additional analysis.  
 In general, one to two representative H&E stained slides from a pre-registration 
biopsy and when available from the original surgery will be reviewed. 
 
Immunohistochemical assays:  
 
All antigens to be assayed in this protocol are cytoplasmic or membranous and will be 
scored using a semi-quantitative scale as described herein: 
 
To examine whether the PTEN promoter is methylated in glioma specimens, we will 
use methylation-specific primers that had previously been used to demonstrate 
methylation of the PTEN promoter in a subset of non-small-cell-lung cancer samples. 
These primers amplify a 181 base pair region of the PTEN promoter that starts 2477 
nucleotides from the translation start site. The methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay 
is sensitive to approximately 5% methylated product. 
 
The designated neuropathologists will identify areas on the glass slide that are 
appropriately stained with the antibody, and will review the positive and negative 
control samples.  The neuropathologist will then determine the ratio of tumor cells 
staining positive to those staining negative for the particular antibody. This 
interpretation does not consider intensity of staining per cell, but defines as “positive” 
all cells staining in a similar fashion to positive control cells. Based on this 
interpretation, the results are categorized into four groups: 
 
0- negative staining  = no staining in any of the tumor cells 
1- focal positive staining  = staining similar to positive control in less than one 
quarter of the tumor cells as determined by [CONTACT_580468]. 
2- Intermediate positive staining = staining similar to positive control in greater 
than one quarter but less than three quarters of tumor cells as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e 
review of the entire slide and visual estimate. 
3- Diffuse positive staining  = staining similar to positive control in greater than 
three quarters of the tumor cells as determined by [CONTACT_580469].

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/2011  
Visual estimation may be aided by [CONTACT_580470] a tissue marker. It is beneficial to provide a visual scale 
in the form of a figure for the initial publications that will utilize the grading system. 
The results of this scoring can be reported as either a number representing each 
category, or descriptively using the terms negative, focal, intermediate, and diffuse.

[IP_ADDRESS] Radiology review 
  
All objective responses must be reviewed by a neuro-oncologist at UCSF.   Images will be 
viewed on the WebPACs system and comparison will be made between the most recent MRI image 
and the previous MRI image.  Measurements and responses are judged based on criteria outlined in 
section 9.1.  Discrepancies between measurements will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_580471]-oncologist at 
UCSF.  
    
3.4.[ADDRESS_763285] of monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious 
adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and regular 
measurement of vital signs and the performance of physical examinations. 
These assessments should be performed within ±2 days of the scheduled day of assessment 
except for adverse events that will be evaluated continuously through the study. Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed according to the NIH/NCI CTC 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other 
means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to 
be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are 
only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory 
values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.

other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade 1-4) 
2. its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
5. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in 
study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89392], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, 
if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the [Investigators‟ Brochure]. This information should be included in the patient 
informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse events 
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. To ensure patient 
safety each serious adverse event must also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical

6 Statistical methods 
6.1 Statistical methods  
 
6.1.1. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_580456] 20% or greater and the lower bound for the one-
tailed 95% confidence interval is > 10%, this strategy would not be considered feasible.  At 
the time we observe any toxicity that requires permanent discontinuation of drug, we will 
estimate, with confidence intervals, the rate of toxicity.  If there is a greater than 20% rate for 
discontinuation of drug during therapy the study will stop and we will assess the study design.  
Because the confidence interval may be calculated multiple times, the actual confidence level 
will be overstated.  This increases the likelihood of rejecting the therapy due to toxicity.  
However, this is felt to be an acceptable risk in order to prevent continuation of a therapy that 
may have a toxicity rate that precludes its routine use. 
 
If there is any treatment related mortality event, the study accrual will be suspended until all 
data pertaining to the event is reviewed by [CONTACT_580477]-investigators.  
 
6.1.2. Endpoint Definitions and Sample Size 
 
The following definitions will be used for statistical analysis: 
 
 Response : Response is based on the best response.  The best response is defined as 
the best objective status as measured by [CONTACT_580478].  
 Progression-free survival : Number of days from the day the patient was enrolled to 
the day the patient experiences an event of disease progression or recurrence or to 
the date of death if disease progression or recurrence is not reached.  All events of 
disease progression or recurrence will be included, regardless of whether the event 
 Confidential Page 51 
Clinical study protocol  Study No.  
 
Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763296] an 
event of disease progression or recurrence nor as the patient died, the patient‟s data 
will be censored at the date of last contact [CONTACT_10970]. 
 Overall survival : Number of days from the day the patient was enrolled until the 
date of death.  If the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient‟s data will be censored 
at the date of last contact [CONTACT_10970].  
 
For this single-arm phase II trial, the primary endpoint will be 6-month 
progression-free survival (PFS-6).  Patients will be analyzed based on intention to treat. 
The primary determination of treatment success will be based on the results for those 
patients who are shown to still be low-grade.  The intent is to perform the primary 
analysis at the time the 6 month PFS is known for all patients. 
 
Precise documentation of prognosis among recurrent low grade glioma 
patients treated with targeted therapy is limited in literature.  A recent study based on 
the experience of the North American Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC) was 
conducted to assess whether progression status at 6 months predicts survival from that 
time among recurrent high-grade glioma adult patients (Lamborn, Yung et al. 2008). In 
that study, it was reported that the estimated PFS-[ADDRESS_763297] of care for newly diagnosed gliomas, is approximately 17%.  Since we expect 
patients with recurrent low grade gliomas to have better prognosis than grade III 
patients, we consider the lower threshold for the probability of 6-month PFS to be 17%.  
The calculation of sample size is based on a binary endpoint with the goal to increase 6-
month PFS rate to 40%. This translates into a hazard ratio of 0.52 
(experimental/historical).  40 patients will provide over 90% power using a one-sided 
test with alpha of 0.05.  
6.1.3. Accrual Objectives 
 
  The study plan is to accrue [ADDRESS_763298] 
of recurrent low -grade glioma patients to present with high-grade gliomas.  Therefore, 
we should be able to complete enrollment of 40 low-grade glioma patients and 20

Protocol: RAD001  Version 7.0 03/15/[ADDRESS_763299] enrolled. 
 
6.1.4 Analyses Time-points and planned analysis 
    
Primary end-point –  6-month PFS : 
 
  Analyses will be performed after all enrolled patients have completed [ADDRESS_763300].  The primary analysis will be based on Kaplan-
Meier method.  Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% CIs will be calculated 
for the 6-month PFS separately for low-grade glioma patients and secondary malignant 
glioma patients. The Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to allow for 
adjustment of the prognostic factors including age, KPS, extent of resection, and 
number of prior chemotherapy regimens.  
 
Secondary end-point –  overall survival and objective response rate:  
The method described above for the analysis of PFS-[ADDRESS_763301] objective status as 
measured by [CONTACT_580479]. 
The point estimate and the associated 2-sided 95% CI for the response rate will be 
calculated separately for low grade and secondary malignant tumors. 
 
Secondary end-point –  biologic correlates : 
 
The endpoints of overall survival,objective response rate and progression status at [ADDRESS_763302] of phosphorlyated PKB/Akt status.  We anticipate 
that the response rate may be more dependent on phosphorylated PKB/Akt status than 
on current tumor grade.  We also expect approximately 50% of the low-grade tumors to 
be phosphorylated PKB/Akt positive and 75% of the higher-grade tumors to be positive. 
This will result in approximately 20 phosphorylated PKB/Akt positive low-grade cases 
and 15 phosphorylated PKB/Akt positive high-grade cases for secondary analyses.  A 
consideration of phosphorylated PKB/Akt status as a predictor of response will use the 
Cochran Mantel-Haenzel test stratified by [CONTACT_479].  If the number of responses is 
sufficient, logistic regression will be used to evaluate the potential impact of 
phosphorylated PKB/Akt status on the likelihood of response adjusting for grade. 
Estimates of the odds ratio and its associated 95% confidence interval will be calculated 
to determine if future studies of RAD001 should require prior assessment of 
phosphorylated PKB/Akt status.  The same methods will be used to determine if 
phosphorylated PKB/Akt status predicts progression status at [ADDRESS_763303] of phosphorylated PKB/Akt status on OS will be assessed using the 
proportional hazards models adjusting for grade. Estimates of the hazard ratio and its 
associated 95% confidence interval will be calculated. We will repeat these analyses on 
patients based on PTEN promoter methylation status.

Exploratory analysis –  radiographic responses : 
 
We will determine if the pretreatment imaging and changes from pre-treatment 
to first post-treatment scan correlate with the clinical endpoints of time to tumor 
progression and survival.  A scoring system will be developed for predicting outcome 
based on the initial, pretreatment scan. Since all of these patients will have surgery, it 
will be possible to prospectively determine if the imaging score can predict grade as 
assessed by [CONTACT_580480]. However, since most patients do not have surgery at 
time of progression, and time to progression varies even among those with the same 
tumor grade, we want to determine how useful this score will be beyond the current 
histology information. We plan to test the usefulness of this score in predicting PFS and 
survival using Cox regression. If the number of patients with responses is sufficient we 
will also assess the ability of the imaging score to predict response using logistic 
regression. The models will include, in addition to the imaging score, age, KPS, exten t 
of resection, time since diagnosis, and initial diagnostic histology scored as 
oligodendroglioma only vs. those with an astrocytoma component. Because PKB/Akt 
phosphorylation status is predicted to impact outcome for this particular therapy, this 
will also be included in the model. The inclusion of these additional variables is to 
adjust for known or potential confounding risk factors. The primary hypothesis test will 
focus on the ability of the prediction score to add information beyond what would have 
been known based on the clinical data. 
 
The patients will initially be categorized as predicted upgraded (Yes/No) 
consistent with the primary question posed. For supplementary analyses the prediction 
score will be included as a continuous variable, or we may create a score – based, for 
example, on the quartiles of the values observed in the previously studied cases – to 
determine if a further refinement in prediction of outcome can be achieved. A further 
analysis will include the known current histologic grade to determine if the score 
provides information even adjusted for this variable. Based on preliminary data we 
expect 1/[ADDRESS_763304] of them at the time of the 
analysis. Assume that the analysis is done when 50 of the 60 event times are known and 
alpha=0.05 one-tailed. There would be over 80% power to detect the difference if the 
hazard ratio was 2.2.   
 
The analysis of the change from initial to first post treatment scan will be 
performed in a similar manner except that there will be the additional covariate of 
baseline prediction score, since we will want to know if the change from baseline adds 
information beyond what was available at the initial scan. The primary endpoints will be

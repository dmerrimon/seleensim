Randomization  The eligibility for randomization for all enrolled subjects will be 
evaluated at the in-person 3-month study visit.  Subjects with any of 
the following will not be rando mized: 
 Refusal of randomization by  [CONTACT_645633]  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Lost to follow-up 
 Death 
 Major bleeding (BARC Types 3b or greater) 
 Occurrence of an ischemic event after PCI such as myocardial

aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645585].  The primary objective is to determine if 
ticagrelor monotherapy is superior to ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645586] (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding).  The 
null hypothesis for this analysis is th at the HR for the experimental 
group (H 0) = 1.  The alternative hypothesis is that the HR for the 
experimental group (H A) ≠ 1.  A test of superiority at the two -sided

two-sided 95% CI for the relative risk as measured by [CONTACT_645634].  
Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan -Meier curves 
will be plotted for the time from randomization to the first occurrence 
of confirmed BARC Type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding by [CONTACT_1570].  
This analysis will be repeated in the per protocol ( PP) cohort to 
support the primary results.

Page 5 of 58 Analysis for 
Primary Ischemic 
Endpoint  The analysis  for the primary ischemic endpoint  will be performed on 
the PP cohort.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor 
monotherapy is non -inferior to ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645587] ( all-cause death, non -fatal myocardial infarction, 
or stroke).  Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan -
Meier curves will be plotted for the time from randomization to the 
first occurrence of confirmed all -cause death, non -fatal myocardial 
infarction, or stroke or by  [CONTACT_1570]. A test of non -inferiority at 
the one-sided 0.025 level will be performed. .  . .  Assuming an event 
rate of 8.0% in the control group, a sample size of 8200 will yield 
80% power to exclude an absolute non-inferiority margin  of 1.6%.  If 
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the point estimate of the absolute 
risk difference between groups is less than or equal to 1. 6% then the 
criteria for non -inferiority will be met.   This non-inferiority margin 
translates to a relative risk of 20% assuming t he observed event rate 
equals 8.0% in the control arm.  
Statistical Methods  Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests will be performed using 
two-sided tests at the 5% significance level.  Continuous variables 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics including means and 
standard deviations if normally distributed or median with 
interquartile ranges for skewed distributions.  Discrete variables will 
be summarized using absolute and relative frequencies.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  A cumulative bl eeding rate of 4.5% is anticipate d between time of 
randomization and 1 year.  Assuming a 2% loss to follow -up and 
non-compliance  / cross-over rate of 4% , the current trial will require 
[ADDRESS_864290] a relative reduction in bleeding of 28% with 
ticagrelor monotherapy with 80% power  and a Type I error of 0.05 .  
It is anticipated that approximately 8% - 10% of enrolled subjects 
will not be eligible for randomization and therefore 9000 subjects 
will be enrolled  at the time of PCI .

1. INTRODUCTION  
Pharmacologic platelet inhibition with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y 12 inhibitor is a requirement in all 
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting. Such dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended by [CONTACT_1577], with duration 
varying according to clinical presentation (i.e. acute coronary syndrome) or type of stent 
implanted during PCI (bare metal vs. drug eluting)( 1-3). The paradigm for DAPT is shifting to 
shorter durations, as evidenced by [CONTACT_645637] /EACTS Guidelines on myocardial 
re
vascularization giving a class Ib recommendation for 6 months of DAPT after DES 
(4).While clopi[INVESTIGATOR_458127] P2Y 12 inhibitor, its efficacy is hampered by 
[CONTACT_645638], genetic and 
procedural parameters ( 5-8). Moreover, although the novel thienopyridine prasugrel has a 
more potent and consistent effect on platelet inhibition ( 9, 10), bleeding risk is significantly 
higher compared to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_645590] (ACS) patients following PCI 
(11)
. In contrast, ticagrelor, an oral, reversible, direct-acting inhibitor of the adenosine 
diphosphate P2Y 12 receptor ( 12) has proven faster, greater and more consistent P2Y 12 
inhibition than either clopi[INVESTIGATOR_104880] ( 13-15). In the landmark Study of Platelet 
Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, ticagrelor significantly reduced death from 
va
scular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, without significantly increasing overall 
major bleeding in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes ( 16).  
Along with the advent of more potent antiplatelet pharmacotherapy, stent technology has also 
advanced in a concordant fashion with the introduction of safer and less thrombogenic

se devices, compared to their older-generation counterparts, yield significant 
reductions in thrombotic events that are durable over the long term ( 17).  As a consequence, 
classical paradigms favoring a minimum of DAPT duration of [ADDRESS_864300] no increased risk for thrombotic events after only 3-6 months of DAPT in PCI patients 
treated primarily with novel generation devices ( 18-22).   
1.[ADDRESS_864301] to ischemic events in high-risk patients undergoing elective or urgent 
PC
I.  
This hypothesis will be tested in the following two specific aims: 
Aim 1:  To determine the impact of 
ticagrelor  alone versus ticagrelor  plus 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645591] -risk patients who had 
PCI. Hypothesis 1:  A DAPT strategy of ticagrelor  + 
ASA for [ADDRESS_864302] to clinically 
relevant bleeding (BARC ≥ 2) in high -risk 
patients undergoing PCI.  
Aim 2:  To determine the impact of 
ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor  plus 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645592] -risk patients 
undergoing PCI  Hypothesis 2:  A DAPT strategy of ticagrelor  + 
ASA for [ADDRESS_864303] to ischemic adverse events at 1 year in 
high-risk patients undergoing PCI . 
1.2 Rationale for conducting this study 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_645593], certain high-risk 
pati
ents may derive additional benefit from potent and sustained platelet inhibition extending 
beyond 3 months after PCI.  Defined by [CONTACT_284747]/or anatomic criteria, a short course of 
DAPT in such patients may provide sufficient protection against early stent-related thrombotic 
events while ongoing platelet inhibition may yield further reductions in systemic 
atherothrombosis.  Among diabetics undergoing PCI, for example, Brar et al. previously 
demonstrated that the benefits of DAPT compared to antiplatelet monotherapy persisted 
irrespective of BMS or DES use, suggesting a systemic rather than stent-related effect ( 23).  
Analogously, results from the EXCELLENT trial suggested diabetics may derive additional 
benefit from prolonged DAPT (ASA + clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) compared to ASA alone ( 24).  Findings 
from Dangas et al., which demonstrate a link between atherosclerosis and increased platelet

Drug Substance Ticagrelor & Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645581]0345

Page 15 of 58 rea
ctivity, provide a biological basis for potent platelet inhibition in high-risk patients 
characterized by [CONTACT_645639] ( 25).  These observations are clinically relevant as 
many patients undergoing elective or urgent PCI exhibit high-risk features, such as renal 
dysfunction, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, that are associated with systemic 
atherosclerosis.  Given the clear benefits of ticagrelor in the setting of high-risk ACS, it is 
plausible that ticagrelor alone will provide sufficient platelet inhibition to reduce thrombotic 
events compared to ticagrelor plus ASA among high-risk patients who have completed a 
requisite short course of DAPT.   
Reduction in bleeding with ticagrelor alone while preserving of the anti-ischemic benefit 
associated with DAPT use would favor such a strategy in high-risk patients undergoing 
PCI.  
Accordingly, the proposed study will examine the comparative safety and efficacy of a 
strategy of 3 month DAPT with ASA and ticagrelor followed by [CONTACT_645640] a potent 
agent (ticagrelor) compared to continued ASA and ticagrelor among high-risk patients 
undergoing PCI with DES.  Our primary hypothesis is that, among such patients, use of 
ticagrelor alone will yield a significant reduction in clinically relevant bleeding while 
preserving anti-ischemic protection compared to the combination of ticagrelor and ASA. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment 
The potential benefits that subjects might realize by [CONTACT_645641] a 
reduction in clinically relevant bleeding for those who are randomly allocated to the placebo 
arm.  Other benefits applicable to all subjects include close monitoring and surveillance for 
cli
nical events that will be performed by [CONTACT_645642]. 
The potential risks for subject s include an increased rate of thrombotic events for those who 
are randomized to the placebo arm and increased risk for bleeding in subjects randomized to 
the active treatment arm (low-dose ASA [81 mg – 100 mg]).    
An independent data safety monitoring board will provide external oversight to ensure safety 
of all trial participants.  In addition, subjects will be followed closely with periodic study 
contacts.  Also, clinical equipoise exists for conducting a trial with this type of randomized 
compar
ison.

5.2.1 Procedures for randomization 
The eligibility for randomization for all enrolled subjects will be evaluated at the in-person 
3-month study visit.  Subjects with any of the following will not be randomized: 
 Refusal of randomization by [CONTACT_645633]  
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Death 
 Major bleeding (BARC Types 3b or greater) 
 Occurrence of an ischemic event after PCI such as myocardial infarction, definite or 
probable stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization with drug-
eluting stent 
 No longer taking DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8257] 
 Non physician-guided cessation of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645595] 5 consecutive days or 
gr
eater.   
 Women of child bearing potential (as defined in Section 4.2) 
 
 Renal failure requiring dialysis 
 Current indication for oral anticoagulation or high dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645596] & Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645581]0345 
Edition Number  Version 4.[ADDRESS_864311] and 
provide 
study site research personnel the appropriate bottle ID number(s).  
Upon r
andomization at the conclusion of the in-person 3-month visit, the study site research 
personnel will provide a 6-month supply of blinded investigational product (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645597]) and open-label ticagrelor. 
Enrolled subjects who do not meet eligibility for randomization will have completed their 
protocol required activities and therefore will not receive any further study-provided 
medica
tions. Their treating physician will also be notified that the patient’s protocol-mandated 
study activities have concluded. Further antiplatelet therapy will be at the discretion of the 
subject’s treating physician in accordance with local standard of care. Vital status of these 
subjects will be determined at the 18-month time point.    
Enrolled subjects who do not meet eligibility for randomization prior to the in-person 3-month 
visit will not be required to complete the 3-month in-person visit.  
5.[ADDRESS_864312] has already been randomized, 
the investi
gational drug (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645598]) will be discontinued and further 
treatment will be as per standard of care. Subjects will be advised to continue therapy with 
ticagrelor until seen by [CONTACT_24018]. 
Subjec
ts who are provided the incorrect investigational drug (study drug bottle(s) were not 
provided a
ccording to EDC randomization instructions) may be identified during monitoring 
proc
edure and/or drug reconciliation. In this case, the subject will be informed immediately 
a
nd requested to return with all dispensed investigational drugs. The subject will then be 
provided with the correct investigational drug according to the randomization instructions. In 
addition, a protocol deviation form will be completed. 
5.4 Bl
inding and procedures for unblinding the study 
5.4.1 Methods for ensuring blinding 
This study has a double-blind design with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645599].  The subjects, study 
site research personnel, academic research center staff, and treating physicians involved in the 
tre
atment and/or clinical evaluation of the subjects will not be aware of treatments received.  
There
 will be an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to monitor the data on a 
periodic
 basis.  An independent statistician, not otherwise involved in the study, will prepare 
and provide the required reports to the DSMB as per the DSMB charter.

Study-provided medications (open-label ticagrelor or blinded study drug) may 
require temporary interruption  for the following reasons: 
1. Surgery or invasive procedure :  Study-provided medications should be 
resumed after surgery once the risk of bleeding is no longer considered 
prohibitive in the judgment of the treating physician.  Minor surgeries and 
procedures, including but not limited to tooth extraction, colonoscopy and 
endoscopy, may be safely performed on low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645601]. However, if deemed 
necessary and at the discretion of the treating physician, open-label ASA may 
be substituted for blinded study drug in the peri-operative period.  Blinded study 
drug may then be restarted at the discretion of the treating physician after 
completing the mandatory course of open-label ASA.  
2.  Balloon angioplasty or PCI with bare-metal stent :  In the event of coronary 
revascularization with balloon angioplasty alone or PCI with bare metal stent, 
blinded study drug may be temporarily interrupted for 2-[ADDRESS_864318] of care.  Blinded study drug may then be 
restarted at the discretion of the treating physician after completing th e 
mandatory course of open-label ASA.

without prejudice to further treatment. 
2. Investigator’s decision: 
a. Incorrectly enrolled patient in whom the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
violation would put the patient at undue risk 
b. Adverse Events felt to be related to either study medication for which 
Investigator feels continued treatment would put the patient at undue 
risk, such as severe or life-threatening bleeding, myocardial infarction,

l results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 
7.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, 
wash
-out, follow-up), that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death 
• Is immediately life-threatening 
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The severity and causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatments and/or 
procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to the ARC. 
7.2.1 Definition of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction. To qualify as a S[LOCATION_003]R, the 
event must be: 
 Serious 
 Undesirable reaction to medicinal product 
 Unexpected - NOT listed as a potential risk or reaction to the product as outlined in the 
protocol, informed consent document or literature.

Clinical Study Protocol TWILIGHT Study 
Drug Substance Ticagrelor & Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645581]0345 
Edition Number  Version 4.[ADDRESS_864333]’s course must be monitored until the event has subsided or, in a 
case of permanent impairment, until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has 
been ascertained.  
7.3.3 Information to be collected for each AE/SAE 
• Description of AE /SAE  
• The dates when the AE/SAE started and stopped 
• Whether the AE/SAE is serious or not 
• Investigator causality rating against the investigational product 
• Action taken with regard to investigational product 
• Whether the AE/SAE caused subject’s withdrawal from study  
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date the study site research personnel became aware of S AE 
• Date when decision was made for meeting S AE criteria 
• Criteria met leading to classification as SAE 
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (if applicable) 
• Date of discharge (if applicable) 
• Date of death (if applicable) 
• Probable cause of death (if applicable) 
• Autopsy performed (if applicable) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 7.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke 
that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be 
an SAE.

Page 31 of 58 7.3.4 Adver
se Events based on signs and symptoms 
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses (when possible) is preferred to recording a 
list of si
gns and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_864334]. 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or s
ymptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_864335]’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. For 
example, continued angina should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition without serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_864336] be reported to the sponsor within 7 business days of the study site research 
personnel’s knowledge of the event via the EDC.  
SAEs must be reported to the sponsor immediately, but no later than 24 hours, of the study 
site research personnel’s knowledge of the event via the EDC. 
The ARC Safety Monitor will review all submitted SAEs for qualification as a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The ARC will further report SAEs 
determined to qualify as S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the local regulatory body (IRB/EC).  
The ARC Safety Monitor will voluntarily inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs form, 
a
nd EudraVigilance, of any serious adverse events which qualify as S[LOCATION_003]Rs in accordance 
with reporting
 requirements.

eviations from protocol 
8.5.1 Compliance to protocol 
No investigative procedures other than those defined in this clinical investigational plan will be 
undertaken on the enrolled subjects without the written agreement of the IRB/EC and ARC.  
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that there are no deviations from the clinical 
investigational plan and full compliance with all established procedures of the IRB/EC is 
maintained. The Investigator will not deviate from the clinical investigational plan for any 
reason except in cases of medical emergencies, when the deviation is necessary to protect the 
life or physical well-being of the subject. 
8.5.2 Procedures for recording, reporting, and analyzing protocol deviations  
A deviation is an instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the 
requirements of the protocol. All deviations must be reported to the ARC. The occurrence of 
clinical investigational plan deviations will be monitored by [CONTACT_645650]. It is the 
Investigator's responsibility to inform their IRB/EC of clinical investigational plan deviations 
in accordance with their specific IRB/EC reporting policies and procedures.  
In the event that an investigative site does not comply with the Investigator Agreement or 
clinical investigational plan, the ARC will notify the Investigator of the site’s non-compliance. 
Conti
nued non-compliance may result in further escalation in accordance with the ARC’s 
standard procedures. 
8.5.3 Corrective and preventative actions and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_645609]/PI [CONTACT_105]-compliance will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_645651]. Identifying deviations and taking corrective actions at the earliest 
possible stage increases the potential for clinical trial success and reduces patient risk. The 
initiation of a corrective and preventative action (CAPA) to investigate and establish 
corrective actions may be required in some cases. The ARC reserves the right to close a 
cli
nical study site or replace a PI [INVESTIGATOR_645610]-compliance is observed.

DETERMINATION 
The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.0 or greater and Stata versions 
12.0 or greater. 
12.1 Description of analysis sets 
The Enrolled Population consists of all subjects who signed informed consent. 
The intention- to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who have been randomized 
(i.e. when the subject number and allocated treatment are recorded in the EDC).  Subjects will 
be analyzed in the treatment group assigned by [CONTACT_97937].

Page 39 of 58 The pe
r-protocol population (PP) will consist of all randomized subjects without any major 
deviations
 from the protocol.  The following deviations will lead to exclusion from the PP 
population 
• Subjects not receiving the assigned treatment as allocated by [CONTACT_645654]
 
• Non-compliance to study drug (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34203]) or ticagrelor.  Non-compliance is 
defined as taking less than 80% of dispensed tablets based on manual pi[INVESTIGATOR_645613]. 
12.1.1 E
fficacy analysis set 
All analyses for the primary bleeding endpoint will be performed on the ITT and PP 
population.  The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population.  This analysis will 
be repeated in the PP population to support the primary results. 
The primary bleeding endpoint is the composite of BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding. 
12.1.2 S
afety analysis set 
Analyses for the primary ischemic endpoint will be performed on the PP cohort.  A secondary 
ana
lysis for the primary ischemic endpoint will be performed in the ITT cohort. 
12.2 Methods of statistical analyses 
Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests will be performed using two-sided tests at the 5% 
significance level.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including means and standard deviations if normally distributed or median with interquartile 
ranges for skewed distributions.  Discrete variables will be summarized using absolute and 
relative frequencies. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_645655].  Baseline characteristics that will define subgroups 
of interest for the efficacy and safety analyses are: 
• Age group (< 65, >= 65 years) 
• Race (Caucasian, non-Caucasian) 
• Gender (Male, Female) 
• Geographic Region (US, non-US) 
• Diabetes Mellitus (yes, no) 
• Chronic Kidney Disease (yes, no)

Censoring:   Subjects not experiencing any endpoint will be censored at time of death, last 
contact [CONTACT_568] (for subjects who withdraw consent or are lost to follow-up) or [ADDRESS_864348]. 
Analysis for the Primary Bleeding Endpoint:   This analysis will be performed on the ITT 
population.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor monotherapy is superior to 
ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645614] (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding).  
The null hypothesis for this analysis is that the HR for the experimental group (H 0) = 1.  The 
alternative hypothesis is that the HR for the experimental group (H A) ≠ 1.  A test of superiority 
at the two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_864349] model that 
includes treatment group as a covariate.  A point estimate and two-sided 95% CI for the

plotted f
or the time from randomization to the first occurrence of confirmed BARC Type 2, 3 
or 5 bleeding by [CONTACT_1570].  This analysis will be repeated in the PP cohort to support 
the prim
ary results. 
Analysis for the Primary Ischemic Endpoint: The analysis for the primary ischemic endpoint 
will be performed on the PP cohort.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor 
monotherapy is non-inferior to ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645615] (all-
cause death, non- fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke).  .  A test of non-inferiority at the one-
sided 0.[ADDRESS_864350] occurrence o f 
confirmed all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke or by [CONTACT_1570].  
Assuming an event rate of 8.0% in the control group, a sample size of 8200 will yield 80% to 
exclude a non-inferiority margin of 1.6%.  If the upper limit of the 95% CI for the point 
esti
mate of the absolute risk difference is less than or equal to 1.6% then the criteria for non-
inferiority will be met.  This non-inferiority margin translates to a relative risk of 20% 
assuming the observed event rate equals 8.0% in the control arm. 
Subgroup Analysis One year event rates for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
calculated in all subgroups described in section 12.2.  Stratum-specific HRs and 
corresponding 95% CI will be calculated for each subgroup using a Cox proportional hazards

Page 41 of 58 model.  For
mal interaction testing will be performed using the subgroup X treatment 
allocation as an additional term in the Cox model. 
12.3 Determination of sample size 
Power calculations are based on a superiority comparison for the primary efficacy endpoint of 
clinically relevant bleeding (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5) at 1 year from randomization (15 months 
after enrollment).  Based on bleeding rates as shown in Table 3, a cumulative bleeding rate of 
4.5% is anticipated between time of randomization and [ADDRESS_864351] 3 months after PCI will not be randomized.  Assuming a 2% loss to follow-up and 
non-compliance / cro ss-over rate of 4%, the current trial will require [ADDRESS_864352] a 
re
lative reduction in bleeding of 28% with ticagrelor monotherapy with 80% power with a 
Type I error of 0.05.  It is anticipated that approximately 8% - 10% of enrolled subjects w ill 
not be eligible for randomization and therefore 9000 subjects will be enrolled.  Additional 
sample size estimates are provided in Table 4 assuming different control bleeding rates and 
risk reductions. References for the sample size estimates include Lakatos 1988, Biometrics 
volume 44 pages 229-241; and Lakatos 2002, Statistics in Medicine, Volume 21 pages 1969-
1989.   
Assuming a 1 year ischemic adverse event rate of 8% the current study will have 80% power 
to exclude a non-inferiority margin of 1.6% (upper limit of 95% CI for absolute risk 
diffe
rence).

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or clinically-driven revascularization. The definitions of 
the individual components of MACE are given below. 
15.2.1 Death 
All-cause death comprises several subclassifications ( Table 7). In general, all deaths are 
considered cardiac unless an alternate cause is unequivocally established, even among subject s 
with serious noncardiac comorbidities.  
Table 7 Classification of Death( 29) 
Cardiac death Any death due to proximate cardiac cause (eg, MI, low -output 
failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed death and death of 
unknown cause, all procedure -related deaths including those 
related to concomitant treatment, will be classified as cardiac 
death. 
 
Vascular death  Death caused by [CONTACT_645662], such as 
cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic 
aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm or other causes.  
 
Noncardiovascular death  Any death not covered by [CONTACT_13780], such as death 
caused by [CONTACT_80601], malignancy, sepsis, pulmonary causes, 
accident, suicide or trauma.  
 
 
15.2.[ADDRESS_864368] universal definition( 30) and includes: 
 Type 1: spontaneous MI 
 Type 2: MI secondary to an ischemic imbalance 
 Type 3: MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable 
 Type 4a. MI related to PCI 
 Type 4b: MI related to stent thrombosis

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis of MI: 
 Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cardiac troponin) 
with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and with at least one of the 
following: 
o Symptoms of ischem ia 
o (Presumed) new significant ST-T wave changes or new LBBB 
o Development of pathological Q waves  
o Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormality 
o Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by [CONTACT_381465] 
 Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of MI and presumed new ischemic ECG 
changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or 
before cardiac biomarker values would be increased 
 PCI related MI is arbitrarily defined by [CONTACT_645663]  
o (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values or 
o > 20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling 
In addition, one of the following is required 
o symptoms suggestive of ischemia  
o new ischemic ECG changes  
o angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication OR 
o imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall 
motion abnormality

15.2.3 Stroke  
Stroke is defined as an acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_513434], more than 24 
hours in duration in the absence of therapeutic intervention or death, due to cerebral, spi[INVESTIGATOR_645627]. It includes the following 
subclassifications: 
 Ischemic stroke: infarction due to prolonged ischemia. Causes include (but are not 
limited to) arterial and venous thrombosis, embolism, and systemic hypoperfusion. 
 Hemorrhagic stroke: caused by a non-traumatic intraperenchymal, intraventricular or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage 
 Undetermined: stroke with insufficient information to determine ischemic or hemorrhagic 
cause 
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_513434] (< 24 hours) 
caused by [CONTACT_645665], spi[INVESTIGATOR_645628]. 
15.2.4 Stent thrombosis 
Stent thrombosis is classified according to the level of certainty and timing following PCI( 29) 
(Table 8). 
 Definite stent thrombosis: is highly specific and requires angiographic or pathological 
confirmation of stent thrombosis in or within [ADDRESS_864369] 
o New ischemic ECG changes 
o Typi[INVESTIGATOR_196543] 
 Probable stent thrombosis includes 
o Any unexplained death within the first 30 days following PCI

the territory of the implanted stent, in the absence of angiographic/pathological 
confirmation of stent thrombosis and no other obvious cause 
 Possible stent thrombosis 
o Any unexplained death after the first 30 days following PCI until the end of trial 
follow-up

Acute 0-24 hours following PCI  
Subacute >24 hours to 30 days following PCI  
Late >30 days to 1 year following PCI  
Very late >1 year following PCI  
 
15.2.5 Clinically driven revascularization 
Clinically driven revascularization includes repeat PCI or CABG for recurrent or persistent 
symptomatic ischemia and can be defined according to the relationship to the index PCI (target 
lesion)(29): 
 Target lesion revascularization, at the previously stented segment  
 Non-target lesion, target vessel revascularization, of the previously treated vessel or its side 
branches AND 
 Non-target vessel lesion revascularization, of a vessel other than the previously treated vessel

invasive hemodynamic assessment using fractional flow reserve (FFR) with values less than or 
equal to 0.8 will be considered significant.  For intermediate left main lesions, a minimal lumen 
area by [CONTACT_645666] (IVUS) less than 6.0 mm2 will be considered significant. 
Successful PCI 
PCI is considered successful for lesions treated with stent implantation if the residual diameter 
stenosis based on visual estimation is less than or equal to 10% and the final TIMI flow grade is 
3.  PCI is considered successful for lesions treated without stent implantation if the residual

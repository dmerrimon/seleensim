(Q2W) starting at Cycle 2 (cycle length is 28 days) . Phase1b patients who 
have been on study for at least 8 weeks may be switched to the RP2DS, at 
the discretion of the Investigator . (Synopsis, Study Design Schema, 
Sections  [IP_ADDRESS], 3.3, 3.4, 6.1, and Table 2 and Table 5). Based on emerging 
PK, pharmacodynamic and clinical data, the dosing regimen was changed to 
weekly dosing to improve patient convenience while maintaining potential 
efficacy and safety.  
• The ability to explore multiple Phase 2 dose regimens in the Phase 2 portion of the protocol is being added to potentially evaluate alternative dosing 
regimens that may maximize potential efficacy and patient convenience. 
Additional safety run- in dohorts will not be required for other doses.  
(Synopsis, Section s [IP_ADDRESS] , 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.1 ,and Table  2 and Table 5).  
An initial futility analysis after 15 evaluable patients for each dosing regimen 
is included to evaluate potential efficacy differences to enable further patient 
enrollment  (Section  11.4). 
• Modified the dose- limiting toxicity of Grade 3 infusion  reaction to specify 
infusion reaction to Hu5F9- G4 or cetuximab ( Section  3.2.4).  
• Modified the re- priming instructions ( new Section 6.1.3) .  Specified the timing 
and dose of Hu5F9- G4 required to obviate the effects of acute anemia that 
patients may experience after the first dose of drug.  For patients u ndergoing 
repriming, safety -related laboratory tests and procedures are required.  
• Modified the Dose Reductions and Delay Guidelines ( Sections 6.1.3  and 
6.1.4). 
• Inclusion criterion 2b has been modified for subjects with KRAS wild -type 
CRC in Phase [ADDRESS_867001] only been refractory to (not

previous therapy  (Synopsis, Section  4.1). 
• Inclusion criterion 7 was modified to reduce the calculated glomerular filtration 
rate from >40 mL/min/1.73  m2 to >30  mL/min/1.73  m2) (Synopsis, 
Section  4.1). 
• Exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_867003] (Synopsis, Section  4.2). 
• Reduced the number of estimated sites from 14 to 8 ( Section  3.8). 
• Removal of sample collection for receptor occupancy studies in Phase 2 
(Section 7.11, Table 5 and Table 6;  deleted previous Table 10).  At the 
current doses maximal RO appears to be achieved in the periphery;  further 
collection in additional patients is unlikely to provide substantive scientific 
information or insights into dosing regimen, activity , or mechanism of action.  
• Specified that patients could discontinue either drug in the combination and 
continue participation in the study while receiving single- agent treatment 
(either Hu5F9- G4 or cetuximab) ( Sections 3 and 6 ).  If the treating physician 
and Sponsor agree that it is in the best interest of the patient to continue treatment with either Hu5F9- G4 or cetuximab alone, the patient may continue 
to participate in the study provided that other protocol stipulations are met.  
• Modified the secondary objectives and endpoint s for Phase 1b and 2 to 
include disease control rate and time to progression (Synopsis, 
Sections 2.1.2, 2.2.2, and 11.3.1 ). 
• Added the secondary  objective and endpoint of objective response rate 
(ORR) as determined by [CONTACT_647518] ( Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors guidelines for use in trials testing immunotherapeutics ) 
(Synopsis, Section s 2.1.2 , 2.2.2 , 6.1, 7.9, 10.1, 10.3 [new] , and 11.3.1, and

Study Title :  Protocol Number 5F9004:  A Phase 1b/2 Trial of Hu5F9- G4 in 
Combination with Cetuximab in Patients with Solid Tumors and Advanced Colorectal 
Cancer  
Scientific Rationale and Background  
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the [LOCATION_002] ( Siegel  2016).  Although screening strategies have started to 
reduce the overall colorectal cancer death rate, the development of advanced metastatic disease is still associated with poor long -term survival.  Systemic 
chemotherapy in combination with anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) 
antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab have significantly improved 
prognosis in patients who have KRAS wild- type tumors ( Lee 2015).  However, 
patients with KRAS mutations, which comprise over 40% of colorectal cancers (Vaughn 2011 ), do not respond to anti -EGFR antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Allegra  2009).  
Patients with KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer have a poor prognos is with 
limited available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647498].  The prognosis is also 
poor for patients with KRAS wild- type who progress during treatment and within 
6 months after anti -EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment.  Thus,  additional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647499].  
Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized anti -human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
to CD47 and blocks its interaction with its receptor, enabling phagocytosis of human 
cancer cel ls (Liu 2015b ).  The  activity of Hu5F9 -G4 is primarily dependent on 
blocking CD47 binding to SIRPα and not on the recruitment of Fc -dependent effector 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 10 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  functions, although the presence of the IgG4 Fc domain is required for its f ull activity.  
For this reason, Hu5F9 -G4 was engineered with a human IgG4 isotype that is 
relatively inefficient at recruiting Fc -dependent effector functions that might enhance 
toxic effects on normal CD47 expressing cells ( Liu 2015b ).  Preclinical studies using 
xenograft cancer models provide compelling evidence that Hu5F9- G4 triggers 
phagocytosis and elimination of cancer cells from human solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies.  Based on this mechanism of action (MOA) and its potent 
preclinical activity, Hu5F9 -G4 is being developed as a novel therapeutic candidate 
for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.  
Metastatic colorectal cancer patients with both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild- type 
tumors who are refractory to treatment with standard treatment regimens have limited options for effective treatment.  In patients with KRAS wild- type CRC who 
were refractory to all standard chemotherapy, cetuximab monotherapy significantly increases median survival over best supportive care from 4.8 months to 9.5 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P  < 0.001), but had no benefit for 
patients with KRAS mutated tumors ( Karapetis  2008).  However, even in patients 
with KRAS wild -type CRC, the objective response rate to single- agent cetuximab 
was only 12.8%; thus, there is still a substantial unmet medical need for these 
patients.  Consequently, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD47 that enables 
phagocytosis and elimination of tumor cells and that demonstrates strong synergistic 
activity in combination with cetuximab in KRAS mutant and wild- type CRC would be 
an important therapeutic advance in the management of CRC patients.  
To date, no significant overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_647500]5F9- G4 and cetuximab 
have been observed.  The combination therapy of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab has 
shown strong preclinical evidence of activity in both RAS mutant and RAS wild- type 
CRC.  This combination creates the potential to address an unmet medical need for these patients .  The  well-established tolerability of cetuximab and the manageable 
safety profile of Hu5F9- G4, together with the plans for rigorous safety monitoring in 
the Phase 1b part of this trial, suggests an acceptable risk -benefit profile for the 
advanced CRC patients enrolled in this study.

Overall Stud y Design:  
This trial is an open label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 trial investigating the combination 
of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab in patients with solid tumor and patients with advanced 
CRC.  The  study will be conducted in 2 parts:  
• Dose escalation Phase 1b open to patients with solid tumors  
• Phase 2 study with 2 treatment arms in patients with advanced/metastatic 
CRC whose tumors are either KRAS mutant or KRAS wild- type  
The Phase 1b dose escalation part of the study will be conducted using a standard 
3+3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if one 
exists, and to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Hu5F9- G4 in 
combination with cetuximab.  Up to [ADDRESS_867004] dose escalation cohort will employ a Hu5F9- G4 priming dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 10- mg/kg 
maintenance doses on Days 8, 15, and 22.  Cetuximab will be administered at a reduced dose of 300 mg/m
2 infused over 120- minutes on Day 8 followed by 
200 mg/m2 infusions given over [ADDRESS_867005] dose of 
400 mg/m2 will be infused on Day 8 followed by 250 mg/m2 infusions on Days 15 
and 22.  The dose of cetuximab used in the combination will not exceed the recommended single- agent dose and will be given during Cycle 3 and subsequent 
cycles.  During Cycle  1, the  weekly maintenance dose of Hu5F9- G4 will escalate to 
20 mg/kg for patients in dose Cohort 3, assuming this dose level continues to be 
safe and well tolerated in the ongoing single- agent Phase 1 trial (Study 
SCI-CD47 -001).  Hu5F9- G4 will continue to be given weekly during subsequent 
cycles.  Additional dose escalation of Hu5F9- G4 may continue in subsequent dose 
cohorts including the exploration of a loading dose in Week  2; however, the dose of 
Hu5F9- G4 may not exceed the single- agent MTD defined in ongoing studies.  
The anticipated dose levels are shown in Synopsis Table 2.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867006] 
cohort will be 10 mg/kg.  Dose escalation of the regimen will proceed through the 
designated dose levels, and decisions related to dose escalation will be based on 
the first 4 weeks of treatment in the current cohort, referred to as the “Dose- Limiting  
Toxicity (DLT) Assessment Period,” in conjunction with ongoing assessments for patients in prior cohorts who continued therapy beyond 4 weeks.  Decisions 
regarding additional cohorts to further refine the MTD or recommended Phase 2 
dose and schedule (RP2DS) will be made by [CONTACT_55682] (CTSC).  For example, the Hu5F9- G4 weekly maintenance dose schedule may be 
changed to every 2 or 3 weeks by [CONTACT_647520] (PK) and 
clinical data review.  In addition, adding inter mediate dose steps (e.g., a 
maintenance dose cohort of 15 mg/kg weekly) or selecting a 10- or 20- mg/kg loading 
dose may be explored in new dose cohorts if supported by [CONTACT_647521].

Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867008] 4 weeks of 
treatment for each patient, referred to as the “DLT Assessment Period.”  The  last 
patient in a cohort must complete the DLT Assessment Period before new patients are escalated to a higher dose level.  
Patients assigned to a particular dose cohort in Phase 1b are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if either of the following criteria are met in the DLT 
assessment period:  
• The patient experienced a DLT at any time after initiation of the first infusion of 
either Hu5F9- G4 or  cetuximab.  
• The patient completed at least 4 infusions of Hu5F9- G4 and 2 infusions of 
cetuximab.  
Patients who withdraw before completing the 4- week DLT assessment period for 
reasons other than a DLT, or who do not fulfill either of the criteria above, will  not be 
evaluable for assessment of DLT for dose review decisions and will be replaced in 
the cohort.  
All toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix  B), 
which provides additional guidance for AEs not specifically mentioned in CTCAE .  
A DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater AE that is assessed as related to study 
treatment that occurs during the 4- week DLT observation period.  DLTs apply only to 
patients in the Phase 1b part of the study.

Phase  2 Study Design:  
Once the Phase 1b dose escalation phase of the trial is completed and an RP2D determined, the CTSC will open the Phase [ADDRESS_867010] completed the DLT period.  If the DLT rate in this CRC 
population does not exceed 33%, accrual will begin for patients who have KRAS 
mutant tumors and continue to accrue for patients who h ave KRAS wild -type tumors.  
Additional safety run- in cohorts will not be required if other doses are tested in 
Phase 2.   Patients may be enrolled simultaneously without an observation time 
between patients.  After the appropriate number of initial stage patients in each arm have been enrolled and followed for at least 8 weeks, an efficacy and safety analysis 
will be performed as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The CTSC will 
convene to review and approve proceeding with full accrual of either or both arms, or 
terminate either arm.  Full accrual in either arm may be opened earlier by [CONTACT_647524] -cancer activity is observed.  The CTSC may also 
approve further enrollment and exploration of additional alternat e Phase [ADDRESS_867011] 1  hour after the completion of the cetuximab administration.  
Starting with Cycle 2, the Day 8 and Day 22 dosing of Hu5F9- G4 has been removed 
(i.e., dosing is every 2 weeks [Q2W]).  Patients enrolled in the Phase 1b part of the study who have been on study for at least [ADDRESS_867012] their dose revised to

Combination Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Study Endpoints  
The study objectives and endpoints are outlined above in Synopsis Table [ADDRESS_867021] deviation, median, and ranges will be 
provided.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage in each category 
will be provided along with confidence intervals for primary and secondary efficacy 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 25 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  endpoints.  For time- to-event variables, the Kaplan- Meier (KM) estimates and 
corresponding two- sided 95% confidence intervals for the median and quartiles will 
be provided.  The KM plot may also be provided. Details regarding the statistical 
analysis to be conducted, including the handling of missing data and patient 
withdrawal, will be provided in the SAP.  
Safety :  The statistical analysis of safety will be conducted for patients in the 
safety analysis set (SAF).  Safety variables to be examined include DLTs, 
treatment emergent adverse events (treatment -emergent adverse events 
[TEAEs]: AEs worsening or occurring during or after a patient’s first exposure to study drugs), vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory, receptor occupancy, 
and antidrug antibody assessments.  Adverse events will be coded using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 17.1 or later) and grouped 
by [CONTACT_6657].  
Efficacy :  Endpoints used in the efficacy analysis are ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, 
OS, and TTP.  
Objective response is defined as CR+PR determined by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1 (primary efficacy) and iCR+iPR determined by [CONTACT_19393] (secondary efficacy) separately.  
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with objective response in the 
Efficacy Analysis Set.  A sensitivity analysis of ORR will be conducted on the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set if more than 10% of patients in the Efficacy Analysis Set 
are excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set.  
Disease control is defined as CR + PR + stable disease (SD) determined by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1. DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with disease control 
in the Efficacy Analysis Set.  
DOR is measured from when the first (objective) response is met (i.e., CR or PR) until the first date of objectively documented progressive disease.  Patients who 
do not have objectively progressive disease will be censored at their last 
documented progression- free date.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867022] documented 
progress ion-free date.  
Pharmacokinetics:  PK analysis will be conducted for Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab 
using the PK Analysis Set  (PAS) .  Based on the distinct MOAs of Hu5F9- G4 and 
cetuximab, drug -drug PK interactions are not expected.  Thus, samples for PK 
analysis for cetuximab will be biobanked and will be analyzed based on CTSC 
recommendation.  Summary statistics will be presented for Hu5F9- G4 serum 
concentrations at each scheduled time point.  Descriptive graphical plots of individual serum concentration- versus -time profiles and mean 
concentration- versus -time profiles will be generated.  
Dose Proportionality :  The analysis of dose proportionality will be conducted for 
the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C
max) of Hu5F9 -G4 
using a power model on l og-transformed scale.  The log -transformed PK 
parameters will each be regressed onto a fixed factor for log (dose).  The 90% CI of the slope for each PK parameter will be computed from the model and 
presented in a summary table.  
Immunogenicity Analyses :  The rate and magnitude of anti -Hu5F9 -G4 antibody 
positivity will be evaluated for individual patients, for all patients in the Phase 1b 
and [ADDRESS_867023] the immunogenicity of cetuximab and vice 
versa.  
Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Analyses:  Several pharmacodynamic and 
correlative studies will be conducted on patient samples, as described in the 
SAP.   
  
 
. 
Sample Size Determination : 
The total number of patients in this trial will include as many as [ADDRESS_867024] 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to explore the MTD of the 
investigational study drug combination in patients with solid tumors.  An estimated 
32 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1b, depending on dose escalation and 
expansion.  
Phase 2 includes 2 arms, one comprising patients with KRAS mutant CRC and the 
other comprising patients with KRAS wild -type CRC, in which enrollment in one or 
both arms may be modified based on emerging data.  A total of 88 patients 
(44 patients per arm) will be enrolled in Phase 2, assuming progression to Stage 2 
for both arms.  This sample size estimate was determined using a one- sided alpha 
level of 0.10 and a power of 0.80 based on a null hypothesis of 5% response rate 
compared to an alternative hypothesis of 15% for each cohort.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. Colorectal Cancer  
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in 
the [LOCATION_002] ( Siegel  2016).  Although screening strategies have started to 
reduce the overall colorectal cancer death rate, the development of advanced metastatic disease is still associated with poor long -term survival.  Systemic 
chemotherapy in combination with anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) 
antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab have significantly improved 
prognosis in patients who have KRAS wild- type tumors ( Lee 2015).  However, 
patients with KRAS mutations, which comprise over 40% of colorectal cancers 
(Vaughn 2011 ), do not respond to anti -EGFR antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Allegra  2009).  
Patients with KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer have a poor prognosis with limited available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647498].  The prognosis is also 
poor for patients with KRAS wild- type who progress during treatment and within 
6 months after anti -EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment.  Thus,  additional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647499].  
1.2. Study Drug:  Hu5F9 -G4, a CD47 -blocking Antibody  
1.2.1.  CD47 Biology  
CD47 is a widely expressed cell surface protein that regulates of phagocytosis -mediated by [CONTACT_647525].  CD47 binds to and activates a receptor on innate immune cells, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which initiates a signal transduction cascade 
that blocks phagocytosis.  In this way, CD47 functions as a dominant inhibitor of 
phagocytosis by [CONTACT_26129] a potent “don’t eat me” signal to phagocytic cells 
(Blazar  2001; Okazawa 2005) .  However, the complex process of phagocytosis 
depends  on the relative balance of pro- phagocytic and anti -phagocytic inputs.  Most 
normal cells, apart from aging red blood cells (Okazawa 2005;  Oldenborg  2000), 
lack expression of corresponding pro- phagocytic signals ( Chao 2012 ; Jaiswal 2009; 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 39 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Majeti  2009), and, thus, are unaffected by [CONTACT_398]47 blockade.  In contrast, most cancer 
cells express pro- phagocytic signals on their cell surface, many  of which are not yet 
molecularly characterized ( Chao  2011b ; Chao 2012).  As  a consequence, effective 
phagocytosis requires two distinct  events:  a silenced CD47/SIRPα pathway coupled 
with a pro- phagocytic signal.  
CD47 is overexpressed in a broad range of human tumors, including colorectal 
cancer.  The Weissman and Majeti laboratories originally identified increased CD47 
expression on leukemic stem cells (LSC) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Chao 2010b ; Majeti  2009).  The  increased expression of CD47 on cancer cells is 
presumed to prevent their phagocytic elimination by [CONTACT_209067] (Jaiswal 2009; Majeti  2009).  These observations have since been extended to a 
diverse range of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.  Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal (non- tumor) tissue revealed that CD47 is 
overexpressed by [CONTACT_3450]  3.3-fold in a panel of solid tumors including ovarian, 
breast, bladder, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate and colon cancer 
(Willingham  2012).  CD47 mRNA expression levels correlated with a worse 
progression- free and overall survival for patients with ovarian, gliomas and 
glioblastomas  (Willingham  2012).  
CD47 appears to be an indispensable means by [CONTACT_647526], including cancer stem cells, overcome intrinsic expression of their pro- phagocytic, “eat me,” 
signals (Chao 2010b; Chao 2012).  When CD47 is blocked from interacting with 
SIRPα (e.g., using an antibody to CD47), these pro- phagocytic signals dominate, 
enabling phagocytosis of the cancer cells, which results in the inhibition of tumor growth and metast asis (Chao 2011b;  Chao  2010a ; Edris  2012a; Edris  2012b; 
Kim 2012 ; Majeti  2009; Willingham  2012;  Liu 2015b).   In addition to this direct 
anti-tumor effect, CD47 blockade also has the potential to induce an adaptive 
anti-tumor T -cell response through the cross -presentation of tumor antigens by 
[CONTACT_647527]- presenting cells following phagocytosis ( Tseng 2013; 
Liu 2015a ).  Thus, the inhibition of CD47 signaling is a promising therapeutic 
strategy for targeting tumors using the innate and adaptive immune systems.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867039] normal cells lack expression o f pro-phagocytic signals and are unaffected by 
[CONTACT_398]47 blockade.  Red blood cells (RBCs) are a notable exception because CD47 
expression protects RBCs from elimination by [CONTACT_647528], as well 
as sinusoidal macrophages, in liver and bone marrow.  As RBCs age, they gradually 
lose CD47 expression and reorganize membrane phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_144045] a manner that 
enhances pro- phagocytic signaling, ultimately leading to their elimination by 
[CONTACT_495782].  The Weissman laboratory explored the effect of CD47 blockade on 
erythrocytes in primates by [CONTACT_647529]47 signaling ( Liu 2015b).  Administration of CD47 -blocking antibodies accelerates 
the phagocytotic process by [CONTACT_647530]47 with immediate 
blockade of CD47 on aging RBCs, changing the balance between anti -phagocytic 
and pro- phagocytic signals in the RBC pool.  In nonclinical studies, the premature 
loss of aging RBCs is compensated by [CONTACT_647531], and the initial 
anemia resolves as aged RBCs are replaced with younger cells.  Furthermore, in non-human primates, the risk of severe anemia is mitigated by [CONTACT_647532] a low, priming dose of anti -CD47 antibody that results in 
mild-to-moderate anemia and stimulates reticulocytosis.  
1.2.2.  Hu5F9 -G4:  A CD47- blocking Antibody  
Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized anti -human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
to CD47 and blocks its interaction with its receptor, enabling phagocytosis of human 
cancer cells (Liu  2015b).  The  activity of Hu5F9 -G4 is primarily dependent on 
blocking CD47 binding to SIRPα and not on the recruitment of Fc -dependent effector 
functions, although the presence of the IgG4 Fc domain is required for its full activity.  
For this reason, Hu5F9 -G4 was engineered with a human IgG4 isotype that is 
relatively inefficient at recruiting Fc -dependent effector functions that might enhance 
toxic effects on normal CD47 expressing cells ( Liu 2015b ).  Preclinical studies using 
xenograft cancer models provide compelling evidence that Hu5F9- G4 triggers 
phagocytosis and elimination of cancer cells from human solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies.  Based on this mechanism of action (MOA) and its potent 
Hu5F9-G4 
Protoco l 5F9 004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867040] range human solid tumors (breas t, ovarian , colon , glioblastoma and others ) 
(Willingham 2012 ; Edris 2012a ) and hematologic malignanc ies (AML , acute 
lymphoblastic anemia [ALL], non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma [NHL], myeloma, and others ) 
(Maje ti 2009; Chao 2011a; Chao 2010a; Chao 2011b; Kim 2012 ). In CRC laborat ory 
models, anti-CD4 7 antibodies enhance the in vitro phagocytosis of CRC stem cells 
by [CONTACT_647533] (Figure 1 ).

Anti-CD47 antibodies are also highly synergistic in combination with other anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including tumor -targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, 
panitumumab, rituximab, trastuzumab, and others ( Chao 2010a ; Chao  2011a ; 
Willingham  2012; Liu 2015b ; Forty  Seven Inc., unpublished data).  Tumor targeting 
antibodies with active Fc effector functions can provide strong pro -phagocytic 
signals that augment the anti -tumor effects of Hu5F9 -G4.  In  preclinical studies in 
CRC, NOD/SCID/IL2R -gamma null ( NSG) mice were subcutaneously implanted with 
UM8 colon cancer cells (EGFR+) transduced with GFP -luciferase- encoding 
lentivirus.  Twenty -eight days after engraftment, animals were treated with 
intraperitoneal injections of PBS control, cetuximab, panitumumab, Hu5F9- G4, or 
Hu5F9- G4 in combination with cetuximab or panitumumab ( Figure 2; 
Study  SU-RSR- 16-002).  Animals were treated every other day (PBS, Hu5F9- G4) or 
weekly (cetuximab, panitumumab) for 16 weeks.  Treatment with Hu5F9- G4 alone in 
this model did not inhibit tumor growth, and treatment with cetuximab or 
panitumumab monotherapy stabilized tumor growth, but failed to produce a durable 
tumor remission.  However, significant tumor regression and durable remissions 
were observed in all mice treated with Hu5F9- G4 in  combination with cetuximab or 
panitumumab.  Potent anti -tumor activity of Hu5F9- G4 in combination with 
cetuximab was also observed in both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild -type colorectal 
cancer models ( Forty  Seven Inc., unpublished data).  No evidence of system ic 
toxicity such as body weight loss was observed in these combination studies, 
although Hu5F9- G4 does not cross -react with murine CD47.  In  summary, 
Hu5F9- G4 in combination with anti -EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab is a highly 
promising treatment for colorectal cancer, independent of RAS status.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Hu5F9-G4 Clinical Safety Hu5F9 -G4 + 
Panitumumab 
The safety of Hu5F9-G4 is curren tly being evaluated in two ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_867042]-i n-human Phase 1 trial (SCI-CD47-00 1) started dosing patie nts on 
[ADDRESS_867043] 2014 , and it is designed to determ ine the optimal dose and schedule of 
Hu5F9-G4 and to charac terize its prelim inary safety , pharmaco kinetics (PK) , and 
pharmacodynamics. This single institution study is enroll ing patients with solid 
tumors and lymp homas ; however , only solid tumor patie nts have been enrolled to 
date. A second Phase 1 trial (SCI-CD4 7-002) in relapsed refractory acute myeloid 
leukemia patie nts began dosing patients on 30 November 2015, and it is desig ned to 
define the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate the safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics of Hu 5F9-G4 in this patient population. 
In 17 patients treated with Hu5F 9-G4 (16 with solid tumors as of 4 February 2016, 
and 1 patien t with AML as of 31 December 2015), Hu5F9-G4 has been 
well tolerated. The most common treatment-associated effects related to the 
Forty Seve n Inc. Confidentia l 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867044] 
prominent.  Other common treatment -related adverse events (AEs) include mild 
headache, fatigue, nausea, photopsia, urine discoloration, low back pain, and 
abdominal pain.  Common drug -related abnormal laboratory findings include 
transient reticulocytosis, spherocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, D -dimer elevation, and 
decreased haptoglobin.  The  majority of these findings occur following the first 
infusion, with very few study drug -related toxicities reported beyond the first cycle.  
In patients with solid tumors, the recommended priming dose of 1 mg/kg of 
Hu5F9- G4 was defined by [CONTACT_121287]- limiting toxicities (DLTs) of acute abdominal 
pain and headache associated with hemagglutination.  However, using a priming 
and maintenance dose schedule in these patients has allowed for the further escalation of the maintenance dose to 10- 20 mg/kg.  
As expected, the most common, clinically relevant toxicity is an acute anemia manifested as a 1- to 2-g/dL fall in hemoglobin observed during the first 1 to 2 weeks 
of treatment.  In solid tumor patients, this is followed by a compensatory reticulocytosis and a gradual return to baseline by [CONTACT_10585]  3 or 4 despi[INVESTIGATOR_647501].  These clinical observations are completely consistent with the known MOA of Hu5F9- G4 and the physiologic role of CD47 in regulating the turnover of aging 
erythrocytes.  Other associated laboratory abnormalities including reticulocytosis, spherocytosis, transient hyperbilirubinemia (pr edominantly unconjugated), and 
decreased haptoglobin are all indicative of extravascular hemolysis consistent with phagocytic removal of RBCs due to blockade of CD47.  No solid tumor patient has 
required a blood transfusion; however, the single patient enrolled to date in the AML 
Phase  1 study (SCI -CD47

as transfusion- dependent prior to study entry and 
has received frequent RBC transfusions without problems throughout the first 
[ADDRESS_867045] interaction of Hu5F9- G4 with CD47 on red blood 
cells.  In Part  A of the solid tumor Phase 1 study (SCI -CD47 -001),
 hemagglutination 
was observed on peripheral blood smears in 8 out of 11  patients, typi[INVESTIGATOR_647502]5F9- G4

common, there was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, nor were 
there any signs of thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, microangiopathy, 
thromboembolic  disease, or other clinical sequelae associated with the 
hemagglutination findings.  An asymptomatic solitary cotton wool spot was noted on 
retinal photographic examination in 1 solid tumor patient, but this was not associated 
with any hemagglutination and subsequently resolved.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Hu5F9 -G4 Clinical Pharmacology  
No formal clinical pharmacology trials have been completed with Hu5F9- G4; 
however, PK samples are being gathered from all patients in all ongoing studies 
after single and multiple doses.  As  of October 2017, approximately 1200 PK 
samples from 58 patients in the ongoing solid tumor Phase 1 study (SCI -CD47 -001) 
had been analyzed using a validated enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  
Samples are from Parts  A, B, or C of the protocol.  Hence, all patients were 
administered a single dose of 1 mg/kg (or less in Part A) on Day 1 of Week 1 
followed by [CONTACT_208706] (1, 3, 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg once weekly, thereafter) from  
Day [ADDRESS_867046].  Patients in Part  C received 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 20 or 30 mg/kg in 
the week after priming dose followed by 20 or 30 mg/kg weekly afterwards.  Overall, 
the data indicated nonlinearity in the PK profiles over the dose range 0.3 –30 mg/kg; 
the terminal half -life was higher at the higher doses of 10– 30 mg/kg compared to the 
lower doses indicating potential target -mediated drug disposition.  Drug exposures 
were dose- proportional at doses ≥10 mg/kg and a typi[INVESTIGATOR_647503] -like profile with 
extended hal f-life was seen at these doses.  
The PK also showed time- variance between the first and second doses at the dose 
of 1 mg/kg.  After the first dose of 1 mg/kg the maximum concentration (C max) was 
approximately 0.7 mcg/mL, whereas that after the second dose of 1 mg/kg was 
approximately 10- fold higher.  On subsequent dosing, there were no further changes 
in the PK at this dose level.  Furthermore, at higher doses (3, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), the PK profile was roughly similar after the second and fifth doses, suggesting that 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 46 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  the time -variant PK only occurred at 1 mg/kg between the first and second weekly 
doses.  
As of June 2017, in the solid tumor Phase 1 study, 2 of 41 patients (4.87%) treated 
tested positive for anti -drug antibodies (ADA) against Hu5F9- G4.  In AML 
(Study  SCI-CD47 -002), 1 out of 13 patients (7.69%) had confirmed ADA samples, 
but the impact on drug PK could not be ascertained due to the limited amount of 
available PK  data.  The samples have not yet been tested for neutralizing 
antibodies.  No unusual clinical toxicities have been observed in the patients with positive ADAs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Hu5F9 -G4 Clinical Efficacy  
In the [ADDRESS_867047] been observed in 
10 of the 13 patients with solid tumors who were evaluable for tumor response at the 
time of data cutoff in the ongoing dose escalation solid tumor Phase 1 study 
(SCI-CD47 -001).  Two patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas had stable disease 
for 33 and 72 weeks.  In Study  SCI
-CD47 -002, t
he single patient with AML treated 
thus far has had stable disease based on a Day  25 bone marrow evaluation and 
remains on study with stable disease after 5  weeks of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summa ry of Hu5F9 -G4 Clinical Experience  
In summary, the expected adverse effects of anemia and hemagglutination have been observed in solid tumor and AML patients treated with Hu5F9- G4, but the 
overall safety profile to date is manageable and consistent with preclinical toxicology studies.  All non- hematological Hu5F9- G4-associated toxicities have been transient 
and easy to manage.  Supportive care with frequent RBC transfusions has been safely and successfully administered to an  AML patient who was concurrently  
treated with Hu5F9- G4.  Furthermore, implementation of a priming and maintenance 
dose strategy, coupled with the extension of the priming infusion duration to [ADDRESS_867048] 
been conducted in colorectal xenograft mouse models.  No evidence of systemic 
toxicity, such as body w eight loss, was observed in these combinations studies; 
however, Hu5F9- G4 does not cross -react with murine CD47 (Forty  Seven Inc., 
unpublished data).  
1.3. Cetuximab  
Cetuximab (Erbitux®) is a commercially available chimeric mouse/human IgG1 
kappa monoclonal anti body that targets EGFR ( Appendix A ).  Its principal 
mechanism of action is through down regulation of the EGFR/KRAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathway; although antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity may also be 
relevant ( Fan 1993 ; Kurai  2007).  It is approved for the treatment of KRAS wild- type 
CRC as a first -line agent and in later lines of therapy.  It is not indicated for treatment 
of RAS -mutant colorectal cancers.   Cetuximab is also approved for the treatment of 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation for 
locally advanced disease, or with platinum -based chemotherapy plus 5- fluorouracil 
for recurrent/metastatic disease.  The most c ommonly observed adverse reactions 
associated with cetuximab treatment include cutaneous reactions (including rash, 
pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection.  The  most serious 
adverse reactions with cetuximab are infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest, dermatologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis, sepsis, renal failure, interstitial lung 
disease, and pulmonary embolus.  Cetuximab exhibits non- linear PK with 
decreasing clearance observed at higher doses.  After the administration of the recommended dose regimen of 400 mg/m
2 initial loading dose, followed by 
250 mg/m2 weekly doses, concentrations of cetuximab reached steady -state levels 
by [CONTACT_12043].  The mean half -life of cetuximab is approximately 
112 hours (range 63 –230 hours) (Appendix A ).

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1.4. Correlative Studies Background  
Blockade of the CD47- SIRPα signaling axis on tumor cells by a monoclonal 
anti-CD47 antibody leads to tumor elimination by [CONTACT_647535].  The  anti-tumor activity of CD47 blocking antibodies is 
mediated by [CONTACT_647536].  
Macrophages are a common immune cell infiltrate in many tumor types, with degree 
of intratumoral macrophage infiltrate correlating with clinical prognosis.  
The correlation between macrophage infiltration and clinical disease course is often 
dependent on the presence of either classically activated (M1) type macrophages that suppress tumor progression or alternatively, activated (M2) type macrophages 
that promote tumor progression ( Pollard  2004 ).  Given the frequent infiltration of M2 
macrophages in many tumor types and its role in promoting tumorigenesis, there is widespread interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_647504]- tumorigenic M2 to the anti -tumorigenic M1 macrophages.  In preclinical 
studies, anti -CD47 antibody -mediated tumor cell phagocytosis has been 
demonstrated to occur through both M1 and M2 macrophages ( Zhang  2016).  In 
addition, in vivo treatment of human xenograft tumors with anti -CD47 antibody 
demonstrated increased M1 intratumoral macrophages post -treatment 
(Zhang  2016), suggesting that anti -CD47 antibody can also shift the phenotype of 
macrophages from the M2 towards the M1 phenotype in vivo.  Because the 
recruitment of macrophage effector cells is a key mechanism of anti -tumor activity 
for anti -CD47 antibodies, the characterization of macrophage tumor  infiltration 
pre- and post -treatment may provide important insights into the degree of potential 
benefit seen in different patients and across various cancer subtypes.  
In addition to modulating the innate immune system, anti -CD47 antibody therapy 
also activates the adaptive immune system towards an anti -tumor response.  
Phagocytosis of tumor cells by [CONTACT_305472] (macrophages and/or dendritic cells) 
leads to cross -presentation of tumor antigens to T  cells, enabling a T  cell anti -tumor 
response ( Tseng  2013 ; Liu 2015b).  In  one preclinical study, anti -CD47 antibody 
mediated a specific CD8 T  cell anti- tumor response without proliferation of regulatory 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 49 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  T cells (which are generally thought to be tumor -prom oting) ( Tseng  2013).  
Currently, there is intense interest in investigating the relationship between T  cell 
subsets that infiltrate the tumor and clinical response with the use of 
immune- oncology therapeutics.  Indeed, increas ed T cell infiltration in the tumor has 
been associated with clinical response in oncology patients treated with T  cell 
checkpoint inhibitors ( Tumeh  2014 ; Herbst  2014).  Given the role of anti -CD47 
antibody in mediating an anti -tumor T  cell response, the clinical investigation of the 
contribution of T  cell effectors to anti -CD47 antibody -mediated efficacy is important 
to define how the innate and adaptive immune systems interact in various patient s. 
1.5. Starting Dose Rationale  
1.5.1.  Hu5F9 -G4 Dose  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase 1b Doses  
In the Phase 1b part of the trial of Hu5F9- G4 in patients with solid tumors  
(SCI-CD47 -001), the safety and PK of a 1- mg/kg priming  dose followed by [CONTACT_647537] 10 ,20, 30, and 45  mg/kg weekly were to be explored 
(Forty  Seven Inc., unpublished data).  Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that 
these dose levels should generate circulating Hu5F9- G4 drug concentrations that 
exceed those associated with anti -tumor efficacy in preclinical models.  In the 
current Phase 1b trial, the first dose escalation cohort will receive 1 mg/kg of 
Hu5F9- G4 as a priming dose followed by [CONTACT_12884] 10- mg/kg maintenance doses.  
This starting dose of up to 45 mg/kg weekly has been declared safe and well 
tolerated in the ongoing solid tum or single -agent Phase 1 trial .  The  dose of 
Hu5F9- G4 in combination with cetuximab will not exceed the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for single- agent Hu5F9- G4 defined in the ongoing solid tumor Phase 1 
trial (SCI-CD47 -001). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase 2 Dose  
The Clinical Trial Steering Committee (CTSC) has determined, based on the 
aggregate safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data obtained in the 
Phase  1b portion of this study (5F9004) that the dose of Hu5F9- G4 in the Phase 2 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 50 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  portion of this  study will be as follows:  A priming dose of 1 mg/kg and maintenance 
doses of 30 mg/kg; administration will be intravenous (IV) weekly during Cycle 1, 
and then every 2 weeks (Q2W) starting at Cycle 2 (cycle length is 28 days).  Based 
on review of ongoing dosing data, the CTSC may recommend testing of multiple 
doses  and schedules  in Phase 2, including hig her doses of Hu5F9.  
1.5.2.  Cetuximab Dose  
Because the adverse effect profile of the combination of Hu5F9- G4 plus cetuximab 
is not known, a moderately reduced starting dose of cetuximab will be utilized in 
combination with Hu5F9- G4 to evaluate the initial safety of the combination regimen.  
Cetuximab will be started at a dose of 300 mg/m2 initially followed by 200  mg/m2 
weekly in combination with Hu5F9- G4, which is a 25% and 20% reduction from the 
approved full cetuximab dose (400 mg/m2 administered as a 120- minute intravenous 
infusion followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly, infused over 60 minutes).  If the starting 
dose in combination with Hu5F9- G4 is well tolerated, the dose of cetuximab will be 
escalated to the full recommended single- agent dose in the second dose cohort.  
The dose of Hu5F9 -G4 will be escalated to the 20- mg/kg maintenance level only 
after the cetuximab dose is increased.  
1.6. Study Rationale and Risk -Benefit  
Metastatic colorectal cancer patients with both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild- type 
tumors who are refractory to standard treatment regimens have limited options for 
effective treatment.  In patients with KRAS wild- type CRC who were refractory to all 
standard chemotherapy, cetuximab monotherapy significantly increases median survival over best supportive care from 4.8 months to 9.5 months (95% confidence 
interval, 0.41 to 0.74; P  < 0.001), but had no benefit for patients with KRAS mutated 
tumors (Karapetis  2008 ).  However, even in patients with KRAS wild- type CRC, the 
objective response rate to single- agent cetuximab was only 12.8%; thus, there is still 
a substantial unmet medical need for these patients.  Consequently, a monoclonal  
antibody targeting CD47 that enables phagocytosis and elimination of tumor cells 
and that demonstrates strong synergistic activity in combination with cetuximab in 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867049] been observed.  Single- agent toxicity data are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
for Hu5F9- G4 and in Section 1.[ADDRESS_867050] 3+3 
study design prior to further escalation.  
The combination therapy of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab has shown strong preclinical 
evidence of activity in both RAS mutant and RAS wild- type CRC.  This combination 
creates the potential to address an unmet medical need for these patients.  The well-established tolerability of cetuximab and the manageable safety profile of 
Hu5F9- G4, together with the plans for rigorous safety monitoring in the Phase 1b 
part of this trial, suggests an acceptable risk -benefit profile for the advanced CRC 
patients enrolled in this study.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This trial is an open label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 trial investigating the combination 
of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab in patients with solid tumor and patients with advanced 
CRC.  The  study will be conducted in 2 parts:  
1. Dose escalation Phase 1b open to patients with solid tumors  
2. Phase 2 study with 2 treatment arms in patients with advanced/metastatic CRC whose tumors are either KRAS mutant or KRAS wild- type  
The Phase 1b dose escalation part of the study will be conducted using a standard 
3+3 dose escalation design to determine the MTD, if one exists, and to identify a 
recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D) of Hu5F9- G4 in combination with cetuximab.  
Up to [ADDRESS_867051] 
KRAS wild -type tumors and who are relapsed or refractory to an anti -EGFR antibody 
therapy.  Additional safety run- in cohorts will not be required if other doses are 
tested in Phase 2.  A total of up to 88 evaluable patients (44 patients with KRAS 
wild-type and 44 patients with KRAS mutant CRC) will be enrolled in the Phase [ADDRESS_867052] 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 (of which at least 
1 of the doses is a maintenance dose) may be replaced.  
3.2. Phase 1b Study Design  
3.2.1.  Phase 1b Dose Levels 
In Cycle [ADDRESS_867053] dose escalation cohort will employ a Hu5F9- G4 priming dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 10- mg/kg 
maintenance doses on Days 8, 15, and 22.  Cetuximab will be administered at a reduced dose of 300 mg/m
2 infused over 120- minutes on Day 8 followed by 
[CONTACT_444238]5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 55 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  200 mg/m2 infusions given over [ADDRESS_867054] dose of 
400 mg/m2 will be infused on Day 8 followed by 250 mg/m2 infusions on Days 15 
and 22.  The dose of cetuximab used in the combination will not exceed the 
recommended single- agent dose and will be given during Cycle 3 and subsequent 
cycles.  During Cycle  1, the  weekly maintenance dose of Hu5F9- G4 will escalate to 
20 mg/kg for patients in dose Cohort 3, assuming this dose level continues to be 
safe and well tolerated in the ongoing single- agent Phase 1 trial (Study 
SCI-CD47 -001).  Hu5F9- G4 will continue to be given weekly during subsequent 
cycles.  Additional dose escalation of Hu5F9- G4 may continue in subsequent dose 
cohorts including the exploration of a loading dose in Week  2; however, the dose of 
Hu5F9- G4 may not exceed the single- agent MTD defined in ongoing studies.  
The anticipated dose levels are shown in Table 1.  
For the Phase 1b part of the study, the maintenance dose of Hu5F9 -G4 for the first 
cohort will be 10 mg/kg.  Dose escalation of the regimen will proceed through the 
designated dose levels, and decisions related to dose escalation will be based on 
the first 4 weeks of treatment in the current cohort, referred to as the “Dose- Limiting 
Toxicity (DLT) Assessment Period,” in conjunction with ongoing assessments for patients in prior cohorts who continued therapy beyond 4 weeks.  Decisions 
regarding additional cohorts to further refine the MTD or recommended Phase 2 
dose and schedule (RP2DS) will be made by [CONTACT_23191].  For example, the Hu5F9- G4 weekly maintenance dose schedule may be changed to every  2 or 
3 weeks by [CONTACT_647541].  In addition, adding 
intermediate dose steps (e.g., a maintenance dose cohort of 15 mg/kg weekly) or

Dose escalation of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab in Phase 1b will follow a 3+[ADDRESS_867055] 6 patients are evaluable and less than 33% of these patients experience a DLT.  The  RP2D will be determined by [CONTACT_23191] ( Section  3.5) based on review of 
all available safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data.  The first patient in 
each dose cohort must complete at least [ADDRESS_867056] 4 weeks of 
treatment for each patient, referred to as the “Dose- Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Assessment Period.”  The last patient in a cohort must complete the DLT 
Assessment Period before new patients are escalated to a higher dose level.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definition of DLT- evaluable Patients  
Patients assigned to a particular dose cohort in Phase 1b are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if either of the following criteria are met in the DLT 
assessment period:  
• The patient experienced a DLT at any time after initiation of the first infusion of 
either Hu5F9- G4 or cetuximab.  
• The patient completed at least 4 infusions of Hu5F9- G4 and 2 infusions of 
cetuximab.  
Patients who withdraw before completing the 4- week DLT assessment period for 
reasons other than a DLT, or who do not fulfill either of the criteria above, will not be evaluable for assessment of DLT for dose review decisions and will be replaced in 
the cohort.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  3.2.4.  Definition of Dose -limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities  will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix  B).  
A DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater AE that is assessed as related to study 
treatment that occurs during the 4- week DLT observation period.  DLTs apply only to 
patients in the Phase 1b part of the study.  
The following are exceptions to the DLT definition and will NOT be considered a 
DLT:  
• Grade 3 anemia; however, Grade 3 hemolytic anemia that is medically 
significant, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
disabling, or limiting self -care activities of daily life (ADLs) is considered a DLT.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_867057]/unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that resolves to ≤  Grade 2 with 
supportive care within 1 week and is not associated with other clinically 
significant consequences.  
• Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that resolve to ≤ Grade 2 with supportive care within 1 week and are not associated with other clinically 
significant consequences.  
• Grade 3 elevation in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or 
alkaline phosphatase that resolves to ≤  Grade 2 with supportive care within 
1 week and is not associated with other clinically significant consequences.  
• Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that resolves to ≤ G rade 2 with supportive 
care within 72 hours  
• Grade 3 fatigue that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 2 weeks on study.  
• Grade 3 Hu5F9- G4 or cetuximab- related infusion reactions in the absence of an 
optimal pretreatment regimen, which is defined as acetaminophen or  a 
comparable non- steroidal anti -inflammatory agent, plus an antihistamine and 
corticosteroids.  
• Grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome or electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia) that resolve to ≤ Grade 2 or baseline within 
1 week  
• Grade 3 hypomagnesemia, that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 1 week  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 59 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  • Grade [ADDRESS_867058] completed the DLT period.  If the DLT rate in this CRC population does not exceed 33%, accrual will begin for patients who have K RAS 
mutant tumors and continue to accrue for patients who have KRAS wild- type tumors.  
Patients may be enrolled simultaneously without an observation time between 
patients.  Patients who do not receive at least 2 doses of Hu5F9 -G4 (of which at 
least 1  of the doses is a maintenance dose) may be replaced.  After the appropriate 
number of initial stage patients in each arm have been enrolled and followed for at 
least 8  weeks, an efficacy and safety analysis will be performed as described in the 
Statistical Ana lysis Plan (SAP).  The  CTSC will convene to review and approve 
proceeding with full accrual of either or both arms, or terminate either arm.  Full 
accrual in either arm may be opened earlier by [CONTACT_647543] -cancer activity  is observed. The CTSC may also approve further 
enrollment and exploration of additional alternate Phase [ADDRESS_867059] 1  hour after the completion of the cetuximab administration.  
Starting with Cycle 2, the Day 8 and Day 22 dosing of Hu5F9- G4 has been removed, 
compared with the Phase 1b schedule (i.e., dosing is Q2W).  Patients enrolled in the 
Phase 1b part of the study who have been on study for at least [ADDRESS_867060]

4.3. Patient Screening  
All patients who enter the Screening period for the study, which starts when the patient signs the informed consent form, receive a unique subject identification 
number before any study procedures are performed.  This number is used to identify 
the patient throughout the clinical trial and must be used on all study documentation 
related to that patient, including if a patient is rescreened.  
Patient Screening laboratory assessments may be tested repeatedly within the [ADDRESS_867069] dose of study treatment.  Patients who screen fail may 
undergo repeated screening if the patient’s medical condition has changed.  
All patients who provide informed consent must be registered in the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, including any screen failures.  
A patient is defined as enrolled in the study once all eligibility criteria have been 
satisfied and the Sponsor or designee has confirmed the cohort or study arm 
assignment.  After signing the informed consent, eligible patients are expected to 
receive the first dose of Hu5F9- G4 (Study  Day 1) within [ADDRESS_867070]/Research Ethics 
Committee ( IRB/REC) approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in 
any study specific procedure.  Data from assessments performed as part of standard 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867071] receive a copy of the signed and dated consent

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  6. TREATMENT PLAN  
6.1. Study Drug Administration Guidance:  Hu5F9 -G4 and Cetuximab  
6.1.1.  Dosing 
Planned Phase 1b dose levels are presented in Table 1 and the Phase  2 dose and 
schedule is presented in Table  2. 
The dose of each study drug will be calculated based on actual weight at enrollment 
(using weight obtained either at Screening or on Day 1) and remains constant 
throughout the study, unless there is a >  10% change in weight from baseline.  
Modifications to the study drug doses administered should be made for a >  10% 
change in body weight and for dose modifications as described in Section 6.1.4 .  
Dose modifications for changes in body weight <  10% may be made according to 
local institutional guidelines.  
All patients will receive an Hu5F9 -G4 priming dose of 1 mg/kg on Day  1.  
The duration of the infusion of the priming dose will be 3 hours (± 30 minutes).  
The priming dose will be followed by a weekly maintenance dose.  The duration of 
the infusion of the maintenance dose will be 2 hours (± 30 minutes).  The  first 
maintenance dose will be administered starting on Day [ADDRESS_867074] dose of cetuximab.  All subsequent maintenance doses of Hu5F9- G4 will be 
administered at the start of each study week (±  1 day).  Hu5F9- G4 will be 
administered at least [ADDRESS_867075]- infusion monitoring is not required for doses after Cycle 1.  Patients who 
experience any treatment -related AEs during the observation period should be 
further monitored, as clinically appropriate.  
Patients will receive a cetuximab dose of 300 -400 mg/m2 given IV starting on Day  8, 
followed by [CONTACT_647545] 200- 250 mg/m2 on Days 15 and 22.  Starting at 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 71 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Cycle  2, and for each cycle thereafter, cetuximab will be given weekly starting on 
Day 1.  (Details are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .) 
Because of the possibility of an initial increase in tumor burden caused by [CONTACT_647546] a T -cell response (termed pseudoprogression) with 
immunotherapy treatment, radiographic progression defined as unconfirmed 
progressive disease according to iRECIST ( Seymour  2017) may not be indicative of 
true PD.  Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab combination treatment may continue past the 
initial determination of disease progression according  to iRECIST as long as the 
following criteria are met:  
• No new symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms  
• Tolerance of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab  
• Stable ECOG performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serio us complications of disease progression (for example, central nervous 
system [CNS] metastases)  
6.1.2.  Premedication  
Premedication is required before administration of the first cetuximab dose and 
before the first 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 (inclusive of the priming dose).  At the 
discretion of the Investigator, administration of premedication may continue for subsequent doses of cetuximab and/or Hu5F9- G4.  
Hu5F9 -G4 
Premedication with oral acetaminophen [ADDRESS_867076] 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 (inclusive of the priming dose.  Premedication may 
be given at any time on the day(s) of dosing, up to 15 minutes prior to dosing.  Premedication for subsequent Hu5F9- G4 tre atments may be continued based upon 
the treating physician’s clinical judgement and the presence/severity of prior

reactions are described in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS].2  and [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_867077] (e.g., 50 mg of diphenhydramine) 
intravenously.  Continued use of premedications plus the addition of other agents (i.e., glucocorticoids, etc.) should be implemented as required by [CONTACT_647547].  
6.1.3.  Repriming 
The following list describes the requirements for Hu5F9- G4 repriming.  
• Patients who experience an interruption of >2 weeks after receiving only the 
priming dose (1 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by [CONTACT_647548]5F9- G4 
priming dose of 1 mg/kg IV over 3 hours (±30 minutes) and 3 subsequent weekly maintenance doses prior to starting the Q2W dosing schedule.  
• Patients who experience an interruption of >[ADDRESS_867078] 1 maintenance dose (i.e., 30 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by [CONTACT_647549]5F9- G4 priming dose of 1 mg/kg IV over 3 hours (±30 minutes) and 
3 weekly maintenance doses prior to starting the Q2W schedule.  
• Cetuximab must be administered as regularly scheduled (e.g. Hu5F9- G4 
repriming doses may be administered on the same day as cetuximab is given 
and administration of cetuximab once weekly should be maintained.)  
• Premedication is required for the repriming dose and the first weekly maintenance dose ( Section  6.1.2 ). 
On the day that patients receive their repriming dose, a predose ADA sample is to be collected.  
For patients who are reprimed, the following assessments are to be performed at the supplemental weekly visits (e.g., Day 8, Day 22):  
• Complete blood count ( CBC) with differential, platelets, reticulocytes  
Hu5F9- G4

6.1.4.  Dose Delays, Dose Modifications, and Safety Management 
Guidelines  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hu5F9 -G4 
Dose modification or dose delay of Hu5F9- G4 may not occur for patients in the initial 
28-day DLT assessment period in the Phase 1b part of the study or for patients in 
the first cycle of the Phase 2 part of the study.  After the initial 28- day treatment 
period for evaluation of DLTs, Hu5F9- G4 may be withheld if treatment -emergent 
Hu5F9- G4-related AEs occur, which include all AEs that constitute a DLT as defined 
in Section 3.2.4 .  If the severity has recovered to Grade 0 to 2 within 4 weeks and in 
the absence of disease progression, Hu5F9- G4 may be re- introduced at the next 
lower dose level.  Patients who experience a DLT of either hemolytic anemia or 
Grade ≥ 4 non-hematological toxicity will not restart Hu5F9- G4 and will be withdrawn 
from study drug treatment.  Restarting treatment after a delay of more than 4 weeks (such as for an unrelated medical condition with expected recovery) must be 
approved by [CONTACT_7195].  
Patients with an interruption or treatment delay of longer than 2 weeks after receiving only the priming dose (1 mg/kg) or > [ADDRESS_867079] 
1 maintenance dose ( e.g., 30 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by [CONTACT_647550] 1 mg/kg IV over 3 hours (±30 minutes) and 3 subsequent weekly 
maintenance doses following the repriming dose pr ior to resuming the Q2W dosing 
schedule ( Section 6.1.3,  Repriming).

[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Intra -patient Dose Escalation  
In the Phase 1b part of the study, patients who have been on study for at least [ADDRESS_867081] their maintenance dose escalated to a higher dose level that has 
been previously demonstrated to be safe in this study, at the discretion of the Investigator and the CTSC.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cetuximab  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Administration  
Cetuximab should not be given as an intravenous push or bolus; instead, it should be administered by [CONTACT_647552] 10  mg/min.  It should also be administered through a low protein bi nding 
0.22- micrometer in -line filter.  The  parenteral drug product should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever 
solution and container permit.  The  solution should be clear and colorless and may 
contain a small amount of easily visible, white, amorphous, cetuximab particulates.  
Do not shake or dilute the solution.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Infusion Reactions  
Serious infusion reactions requiring medical intervention and immediate, permanent discontinuation of cetuximab included rapid onset of airway obstruction 
(bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, shock, loss of consciousness, 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 75 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  myocardial infarction, and/or cardiac arrest.  Severe (NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4) 
infusion reactions occurred in 8.4 % of 1373 patients receiving cetuximab in 4 
different clinical studies, with a fatal outcome in 1 patient (Cetuximab [Erbitux®] 
Prescribing Information,  Appendix A ).  Approximately 90% of severe infusion 
reactions occurred with the first infusion despi[INVESTIGATOR_236904].  
Patients should be monitored for 1 hour following cetuximab infusion in a setting with 
resuscitation equipment and other agents necessary to treat anaphylaxis 
(e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, intravenous antihis tamines, bronchodilators, and 
oxygen).  If serious infusion reactions occur, study drug administration should be immediately interrupted and permanently discontinued.  If hypersensitivity or 
infusion- related events develop, the infusion rate should be reduced by 50% for NCI 
CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_867082] be observed until resolution of the 
event.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Cardiopulmonary Arrest  
Cardiopulmonary arrest and/or sudden death occurred in 4 (2%) of 208 patients 
treated with radiation therapy and cetuximab as compared to none of 212 patients 
treated with radiation therapy alone (Cetuximab [Erbitux
®] Prescribing Information, 
Appendix A).  Carefully consider the use of cetuximab in combination with radiation therapy or platinum -based therapy with 5- FU in head and neck cancer patients who 
have a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias in light of these risks.  Closely monitor serum electrolytes, includi ng serum magnesium, 
potassium, and calcium, during and after cetuximab infusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Pulmonary Toxicity  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including 1 fatality, occurred in 4 of 1570 (<  0.5%) 
patients receiving cetuximab in 3 clinical trials (Cetuximab [Erbitux
®] Prescribing 
Information, Appendix A), as well as in other studies in colorectal cancer and head 
and neck cancer.  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity and

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  interrupt cetuximab for acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms and  
permanently discontinue cetuximab for confirmed ILD.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5.  Dermatologic Toxicity  
Dermatologic toxicities, including acneiform rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial inflammation, infectious sequelae (for example, S. aureus sepsis, 
abscess formation, cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis/ulcerative keratitis 
with decreased visual acuity, cheilitis), and hypertrichosis occurred in patients 
receiving cetuximab therapy.  Acneiform rash occurred in 82%  of 1373  patients 
receiving cetuximab in 4 clinical trials (Cetuximab [Erbitux®] Prescribing Information, 
Appendix A ).  Severe acneiform rash occurred in 9.7%  of patients.  
Acneiform rash usually developed within the first 2 weeks of therapy and resolved in a majority of the patients after cessation of treatment, although in nearly half, the 
event continued beyond 28 days.  Life- threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous 
disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with cetuximab.  It could not be determined whether these 
mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to 
idiosyncratic immune- related effects (e.g., Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]).  Prophylactic interventions  for cetuximab skin rash using oral 
and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], sun block, moisturizing creams, or other agents may be 
instituted according to local standard of care.  Possible oral antibiotic regimens for 
skin prophylaxis include oral doxycycline 100 mg t wice-weekly or comparable 
regimens with tetracycline or minocycline.  Patients will be monitored for dermatologic toxicities and infectious sequelae and they will be instructed to limit sun 
exposure during cetuximab therapy.  
Recommended dose modifications for severe (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) acneiform rash are specified in Table 3.

patients receiving cetuximab in one trial (Appendix  A) an d it was severe (NCI 
CTCAE Grades 3 and 4) in 6% –17%.  In one study in which cetuximab was 
administered in combination with platinum -based therapy, the addition of cetuximab 
to cisplatin and 5- FU resulted in an increased incidence of hypomagnesemia (14% 
vs. 6%) and of Grade 3– 4 hypomagnesemia (7% vs. 2%) compared to cisplatin and 
5-FU alone.  In contrast, the incidences of hypomagnesemia were similar for those 
who received cetuximab, carboplatin, and 5- FU compared to carboplatin and 5- FU 
(4% vs. 4%).  No patient experienced Grade 3– [ADDRESS_867084] 8 weeks following the completion of cetuximab.

In the Phase 1 trial experience with Hu5F9- G4 in solid tumors and acute myeloid 
leukemia, agglutination of RBCs has been observed on peripheral smear.  
Hu5F9- G4-related microangiopathy is a possible sequela of hemagglutination.  AEs 
may be associated with findings of hemagglutination.  Monitoring of hemagglutination and microangiopathy includes physical exam assessments, 
complete blood counts (CBCs), peripheral smears, serum chemistries, and D- dimer 
testing as outlined in the schedule of assessments (SOA).  Peripheral smears will be read by [CONTACT_647553], spherocytosis, and evidence 
of RBC destruction (e.g.,  schistocytosis, fragments) when present.  The presence or 
absence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral smear will be incorporated into the AE severity grading for hemagglutination and microangiopathy, 
as described below.  The degree of peripheral smear findings will be quantified 
accord ing to the appropriate scale ( Appendix E ) for sites that have the capability to 
do so, but is not required.   
  AEs relating to hemagglutination and 
microangiopathy will be graded for toxicity according to the scale below.  
AE Severity Grading for Hemagglutination and Microangiopathy  
Grade 1:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that is asymptomatic 
or mild, not requiring intervention  
Grade 2:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that requires medical 
intervention

[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Anemia, Blood Cross -matching, and Packed Red Blood Cell 
Transfusion Procedures  
Hu5F9- G4 binds to red cells and leads to erythrophagocytosis.  This, coupled with 
anemia from other causes in patients with cancers, means that care has to be taken 
with RBC cross -matching and packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions.  There is 
a possibility that treatment with Hu5F9- G4 may obscure assessment of red blood 
cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
During the Screening period prior to initiation of Hu5F9- G4 therapy, blood cell ABO 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_647505], type and screen (ABO/Rh), and Direct Antiglobulin 
Test (DAT) will be performed for each patient as described in Section 7.3.4.  This, 
together with using the prior phenotype, will facilitate allocation of properly 
cross- matched blood, should a blood transfusion be warranted.  
• Procedure for patients after exposure to Hu5F9- G4: 
1. ABO, Rh, and DAT may be pan- reactive due to Hu5F9- G4 binding to red 
cells.  Therefore, if a non- urgent transfusion is ordered by [CONTACT_978], perform the 
following procedures:  
• Front Type:  EGA Treat cells (×2 Maximum) and Warm Wash × 4 
(Minimum) with  0.9% Saline.  
• Back Type:  Perform reverse anti -human globulin for both A and B.  
• If a valid ABO type cannot be obtained, mark the final report as invalid and 
notify the transfusion service for the site.  
2. Antibody screen  
If a pan- agglutinin/warm autoantibody  is present in low ionic strength solution 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 80 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  (LISS), repeat the antibody screen with polyethylene glycol (PeG).  Perform 
PeG adsorption studies and elution studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Blood Components for Transfusion  
For all elective red cell transfusions, leucocyte -reduced units matched for the 
phenotype of the patients (as described above) will be used.  Where exact matching 
for all the specified blood groups proves impractical (e.g., for MNS), local sites will 
decide on the best matched donor units to be used.  Cytomegalovir us (CMV) 
matching (i.e., CMV seronegative units for CMV -seronegative patients) will not be 
required for this study because it will limit the inventory for antigen matching.  
If the cross -match is incompatible, the RBC units that are Coomb's 
crossmatch- incom patible will be selected (e.g., phenotype- matched or least 
incompatible) for issue at the discretion of the local site’s Transfusion Service Medical Director or equivalent person, where available.  Such instances will be 
documented, along with consent signatures obtained from ordering physicians, 
according to best practices in blood bank policies and procedures.  
For emergency transfusions, the transfusion laboratory may consider using emergency Group O Rhesus negative units if phenotyped units are not avail able.  
Blood plasma therapy will be blood- type specific.  Platelets will be blood type 
compatible whenever possible, and if not, will have been tested and found not to 
have high titer anti -A or anti -B. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Management of Hu5F9 -G4 Infusion Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions are defined by [CONTACT_515570] (under the category 
“General disorders and administration site conditions”) as “a disorder characterized 
by [CONTACT_318929].”  
For the purposes of this study, the time frame for infusion reaction assessment is the 
24-hour period beginning from the start of the infusion.  Recommendations for the 
management of infusion- related reactions are provided below.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 81 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  • For Grade 1 infusion- related reactions, described as mild transient reaction, 
infusion interruption is not indicated, intervention is not indicated:  
o Remain at bedside and monitor patient until recovery from symptoms.  
• For Grade 2 infusion- related reactions, infusion interruption is indicated, but 
patient responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, IV fluids); and 
prophylactic medications are indicated for ≤  24 hours:  
o Stop the Hu5F9- G4 infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the patient with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 500- 750 mg 
oral acetaminophen.  
o Remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.  
o Corticosteroid therapy may also be given at the discretion of the Investigator.  
o If the infusion is interrupted, wait until symptoms resolve, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate.  
o If no further complications occur after 60 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  Monitor the patient closely.  
o If symptoms recur, stop infusion and disconnect patient from the infusion apparatus.  
o No further Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at that visit.  
o Premedications should be considered before any future infusions.  
o The amount of Hu5F9 -G4 infused must be recorded on the case report form 
(eCRF).  
o Patients who experience a Grade [ADDRESS_867085] -infusion 
observation period that does not resolve during that time should be observed 
until the AE resolves or stabilizes, with vital sign measurements every 4 hours 
and additional evaluations as medically indicated for the management of the 
AE. 
• For Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion- related reactions, where Grade 3 is described 
as prolonged signs and symptoms (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or brief interruption of infusion), or recurrence of symptoms 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 82 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  following initial improvement, or where hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647506] (e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates).  
Grade 4 is described as having life- threatening consequences and where urgent 
intervention indicated.  
o Immediately discontinue infusion of Hu5F9- G4. 
o Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the patient as follows:  
Administer bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for 
subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration and/or diphenhydramine 50  mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed.  
o The patient should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur.  
o Patients who have Grade [ADDRESS_867086] be given 
premedication prior subsequent doses.  In this setting, premedication with 
oral acetaminophen (650 mg), oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 
(25-50 mg), and intravenous dexamethasone (4- 20 mg), or a comparable 
regimen, is recommended.  
o Patient s who receive premedication and still have a Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reaction will be permanently discontinued from study treatment.  
o Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis.

until the AE(s) resolves or stabilizes, with vital sign measurements and 
additional evaluations, as medically indicated for the management of the 
AE(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS].5.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
In the case of evidence for tumor  lysis syndrome associated with Hu5F9- G4, 
patients will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647507].  Standard 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 83 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  management will include vigorous IV hydration; correction of acidosis, if present; 
hypouricemic agents; and close monitoring of serum uric acid, phosphorus, and 
electrolytes.  Study treatment should be held until the patient’s condition resolves or 
stabilizes.  
6.2. Post -therapy Follow -up and Patient Study Completion 
Patients who complete, terminate, or decline further treatment should be encouraged to return for an End of Treatment Visit for evaluation of safety within 
1 week of the decision to end Hu5F9- G4 treatment.  The studies to be performed at 
end of treatment are listed in the Schedules of Assessments (SOAs), Section 7.4.  It 
is strongly encouraged that patients return for their Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days 
(± 1 week) after the last dose of last study drug received.  The Safety Follow -up Visit 
assessments are described in Section  7.5. 
Patients are considered to have completed study drug treatment when they finish the Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days (± 1 week) after their last dose of the last study  
drug received, unless they are experiencing ongoing drug -related AEs and serious 
adverse events (SAEs).  For patients being followed for ongoing AEs or SAEs, 
follow-up visits will continue at least every [ADDRESS_867087] patient completes follow -up for safety, disease 
progression, or survival, or when the CTSC decides to end the study.  
Recruitment will cease when one of the following occur s: 
• Study treatment is considered too toxic to continue treatment before the anticipated number of patients are recruited.  This assessment will be made by 
[CONTACT_23191].  
• The stated number of patients to be recruited is reached.  This number may be 
increased to include replacement patients for those who are not DLT evaluable and patients added to intermediate dose or expanded cohorts as determined by 
[CONTACT_23191], and approved, if necessary, by [CONTACT_647544].  
• The stated objectives of the trial are achieved.  
In terminating the trial, the Sponsor and the Investigators must ensure that adequate 
consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interest.

process has been documented.  
• Confirmation that all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met.  
• Demographic data including sex, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity.  
• Vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature, height and weight.  
• Physical examination (complete) and ECOG ( Appendix C ). 
• Visual acuity assessment by [CONTACT_647555].  
• Single ECG.  
• Relevant medical and cancer history will be completed through consent  (all 
findings recorded on the medical history electronic case report form [eCRF]).  
• Documentation of concomitant and prior medications.  
• Adverse Events related to Screening procedures and any SAEs reporting.  
• Serum or urine pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential).  
• Local laboratory values, including CBC (with differential, platelets, reticulocyte 
count), serum chemistry, serum uric acid, phosphorous, haptoglobin, D -dimer, 
thrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT, and urinalysis.  (See .) 
• Local laboratory Type and Screen (ABO/Rh) and DAT.  (Details are provided in Section  7.3.4).  
• Local laboratory Peripheral Blood Smears.  (Details are provided in Section  7.3.5).  
• ECOG performance status.  
• Tumor biopsy (within [ADDRESS_867098] dose of drug): strongly encouraged for 
Phase  1b, mandatory for Phase 2.  Archival tumor tissue may be collected by [CONTACT_647556].  The tissue block is preferred, but if not available 
at least 10 u nstained slides are suggested.  
• Response assessment:  diagnostic imaging.  (Historic imaging may be used for 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867099] dose of Hu5F9- G4; details are

7.3.1.  Physical Examination/Visual Acuity  
Complete physical exam should be performed at Screening.  Thereafter, 
symptom -directed physical exams are acceptable and may also include routine 
examination of the skin (including fingers, toes, and ears) and CNS.  For patients 
who have a change in visual acuity of [ADDRESS_867101] should be consulted for additi onal 
evaluation.  
7.3.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs should include heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, temperature, 
and weight.  Height should be recorded during Screening only.  Weight should be 
recorded during Screening and on Day 1 of each cycle.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  7.3.3.  Electro cardiographs  
One ECG will be performed at screening.  Triplicate ECGs will be performed before 
the cetuximab dose (within 2 hours of infusion) and within 30 minutes of the end of 
Hu5F9- G4 infusion for Phase 1b only.  
7.3.4.  Type and Screen (ABO/Rh), DAT  
Due to the  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_370105], blood phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], type and screen 
(ABO/Rh), and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) should be performed at Screening prior 
to exposure to Hu5F9- G4:  Full phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (if not transfused in last 3 months) – 
ABO, Rh, D, C, E, Kell, Kid d, Duffy, MNS, and antibody screen.  Treatment with 
Hu5F9- G4 may make phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_647508].  In addition, patients who experience a drop in hemoglobin to below 9 g/dL at any time, or patients in whom clinical findings indicate a possible need for 
transfusions, it is recommended, but not required, that a Type and Screen and DAT be performed.  Details are provided in  Table  11. 
7.3.5.  Peripheral Blood Smear Assessment  
Peripheral smears will be collected prior to selected study drug infusions and assessed for the presence of hemagglutination, in addition to standard cell 
morphology assessment.  Slides should be processed and assessments  should  
occur in accordance with the  local laboratory's standard reporting timelines. These 
samples should be collected from the arm contralateral to the arm being used for 
drug infusion, if possible.  Peripheral smears will be evaluated according to the 
guidelines provided in Appendix E.   For patients undergoing blood transfusion, 
samples for peripheral smears will be collected 1 hour (±  30 minutes) after 
completion of the transfusion.

imaging modality used at Screening should be used throughout the study whenever 
possible.  It is understood that some circumstances may require a different imaging 
modality.  An alternate imaging modality is acceptable and may be performed at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
The first response assessment will occur at Cycle 3, Day 1 (±  1 week).  After 
Cycle  3, assessments will have a window of ±2 weeks.  Subseq uent response 
assessments will occur every 2 cycles.  Response assessment will be obtained at treatment termination, unless a prior radiographic assessment has been performed 
within the prior 4 weeks or a prior response assessment documented PD 
(progressiv e disease).  
7.10.  Immunogenicity  
Peripheral blood for immunogenicity assessments for antidrug antibodies against 
Hu5F9- G4 will be collected on Days 1 and 8, and then on Day  1 of all subsequent 
cycles; at the End of Treatment Visit; and at the Safety Follow -up Vi sit.  When 
collected on the day of study drugs dosing, the blood sample must be collected 
before dose administration.  A precise, sensitive, and reproducible qualitative 
electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay will be used to measure antibodies to 
Hu5F9- G4 in serum samples.  This assay has been validated in cynomolgus 
monkey serum and has been used for the IND -enabling non- human- primate 
toxicology study for Hu5F9- G4 (PR013/20044845) and in Phase 1 clinical trials with 
Hu5F9- G4 (Studies  SCI-CD47 -001 and SCI -CD47 -002).  For patients who have 
tested positive for antidrug antibodies (ADA), the impact of ADA on PK, safety, and 
biologic activity will be assessed.  Neutralizing antibodies to Hu5F9- G4 will also be 
assessed for patients who test positive for ADA.  Antidrug antibodies to cetuximab may be assessed if the CTSC or Sponsor determines such testing is needed.

Tumor Biopsies  
Tumor biopsies will be obtained during both the Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts of the study.  .  For the Phase 2 part, 
tumor biopsies are mandatory, unless the Investigator determines that it is not feasible.  These reasons could include, but are not limited to, lack of accessible 
tumor tissue to biopsy and patient safety issues.  A tumor biopsy will be obtained

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  8. STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
8.1. Withdrawal of Patients from Study Drug Treatment  
Patients (or a legally acceptable representative) may decline to continue receiving 
study drugs at any time during the study.  The patient’s health and welfare is the 
primary consideration in any determination to discontinue study drugs treatment.  Patients who withdraw from study drugs during the treatment period should be 
encouraged to return for an End of Treatment Visit for evaluation of safety within 
1 week of the decision to end Hu5F9- G4 treatment.  The studies to be performed at 
end of treatment are listed in the Schedules of Assessm ents, Section 7.1.  It is 
strongly encouraged that patients return for their Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days 
(± 1 week) after their last dose of study drugs.  The Safety Follow -up Visit 
assessments are described in Table 6.   All patients who withdraw from study drugs 
treatment will be followed for disease response and survival.  
Reasons for patient withdrawal from study drug s treatment may include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
• Tumor progression, including confirmed tumor progression according to iRECIST  
• Unacceptable toxicity  
• Clinically significant change in the patient’s status that precludes further 
treatment (e.g , pregnancy or other AE)  
• Patient’s request, with or without a stated reason  
• Investigator or treating physician decision in the absence of any of the above.  
8.2. Withdrawal of Patients from Study  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care.  Patients (or a legally acceptable 
representative) may decline to continue receiving study drugs and/or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647509].  Patient data 
up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study and, where permitted, publically available data may be included after withdrawal of consent.

• Death  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to follow up

8.3. Study Termination 
Forty  Seven Inc. reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Both 
Forty  Seven Inc. and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the Investigator’s 
participation in the study according to the study contract.  The Investigator is to notify 
the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in writing of the study’s completion or 
early termination and send a copy of the notification to Forty  Seven Inc.

Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867110] of recording all AEs and SAEs; protocol -specified 
hematology and clinical chemistry variables; measurement of protocol -specified vital 
signs; ECGs and physical exams; and the results from other protocol -specified tests 
that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the combination of study drugs.  
Forty  Seven Inc. or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the 
Competent Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating 
Investiga tors, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical 
Trials Directive, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
9.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an inv estigational product or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies).  
• AEs that occur prior to administration of the study drug that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies).  
• Preexisting medical conditions, judged by [CONTACT_647561] -specified AE 
reporting period.  
9.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that at any dose is: 
• Fatal (i.e., the AE is the actual cause of death)  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 113 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  • Life threatening (i.e.,  the AE in which the patient was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe) 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e.,  the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother ex posed 
to the investigational product(s)  
• Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_647562] (i.e.,  may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non- serious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the 
intensity of an AE (as in Grade 1 [mild], Grade 2 [moderate], Grade 3 [severe], 
Grade 4 [life- threatening], or Grade 5 [death] per CTCAE v. 4.03).  The event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or 
action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or 
vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs.  
9.2. Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded on 
the eCRF and that SAEs are recorded on the SAE Report Form and reported to the 
Sponsor in accordance with instructions in the Study Reference Manual and protocol 
instructions. SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_867111] been caused by a protocol mandated 
intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) will be collected as AEs (or 
SAEs if any of t he serious criteria applies).  
After initiation of any the study drugs, all  AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution will 
be collected until [ADDRESS_867112] study drug received or 
the Safety Follow up Visit (whichever is later), or  when the patient begins an 
alternate anti -cancer therapy.  
At any time, even after [ADDRESS_867113] study drug received or the Safety Follow up Visit, Investigators are to report SAEs that they assess to be 
related to one of the study drug (Hu5F9- G4 and/or cetuximab received as part of this 
study).  
The Investigator must follow all unresolved SAEs and study drug -related AEs until 
the events are resolved (back to baseline) or stabilized, are determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_737], the Medical Monitor deems it necessary after the end 
of the study, the patient initiates alternate therapy for their cancer, or the patient is 
lost to follow -up. Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification (SDV).  
The Sponsor or its designee may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or 
a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], 
consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate 
the SAE report.  
9.2.2.  Eliciting Adverse Events 
A consistent methodology of non- directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient 
evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  Examples of non -directive questions 
include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 115 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
9.2.3.  Assessment of Severity and Causality of Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each patient contact.  
All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_332514],  will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable eCRF, the Investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality ( seriousness criteria are 
provided in Section  9.1.2 .).  A causality assessment will be made for both Hu5F9- G4 
and cetuximab individually.  
The AE grading (severity) scale ( Appendix  B) will be used for AE reporting and 
Table 12  provides additional guidance for AEs not specifically mentioned in CTCAE.  
Table 13  provides guidance for assessing the causal relationship to the study 
drug(s).

Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 117 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, Investigators should apply the 
following general guidelines:  
Table 13. Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the AE/SAE suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], 
evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES = Related  The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, AND other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide suf ficient 
explanation for the AE/SAE.  
NO = Not Related  The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, OR other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the AE/SAE.  
Abbreviations:  AE = adverse event; SAE = serious adverse event.  
NOTE:  The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No”  causality assessment for 
individual AE reports, Forty  Seven Inc. or its designee, will promptly evaluate all reported 
SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to Investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
 
9.3. Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events  
9.3.1.  Recording Adverse Events 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs 
on the eCRF.  Colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided.  
A separate log line in the Adverse Event eCRF should be used for each medical 
concept that needs to be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g.,  record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE on 
separate log lines of the eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 118 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  be reported to Forty  Seven Inc. by [CONTACT_647563] .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other 
Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if  severe 
diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE on the eCRF.  However, medically significant AEs occurring 
secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if  a severe gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once unless their 
severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it  should be recorded 
again on a new log line on the Adverse Event eCRF indicating the change in 
severity.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs  and resolves between patient evaluation 
timepoints and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and ECG results that require active management will be recorded as AEs on the eCRF (e.g., abnormalities that 
require study drugs dose modification or discontinuation, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.).  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 119 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5  × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only 
the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or 
syndrome, the  abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE on the eCRF.  If the 
laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE.  For example, an  elevated serum potassium 
level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”.  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to 
visit should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their 
severity , seriousness, or etiology changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period 
(Section 9.2.1 ), regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an eCRF and 
expeditiously reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_867114] “[specific tumor type] progression” as the SAE 
term on the SAE Report Form.  
When recording a death on an eCRF or SAE Report Form, the event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single 
medical concept whenever possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Worsening of Disease  
Worsening of and/or progression of disease should not  routinely be recorded as an 
AE or SAE if it does not result in death.  These data will be captured as efficacy 
assessment data.  However, worsening and/or progression of disease should be 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 120 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  recorded as an SAE if the outcome is fatal in the absence of other signs and 
symptoms ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), or if the Investigator assesses the disease progression 
to be related to one of the study drugs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647510] a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647511]:  
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the s tudy.  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical condition that has not changed.  
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647512] (e.g. respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], waiting for insurance authorization) 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Reportable Information 
Certain information, although not considered an AE or SAE, must be recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated below.  This includes:  
Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or a patient’s partner during treatment with either study drug or within [ADDRESS_867115] be 
reported ( Section 9.4.2 ) within 24  hours of becom ing aware of it, using a Pregnancy 
Notification Form (provided in the Investigator Trial File).  If the pregnancy occurs in a patient’s partner, the Investigator must obtain consent from the patient’s partner 
before collecting any pregnancy -related information.  All pregnancies must be 
followed up until there is a pregnancy outcome using a pregnancy outcome form.  In the event that the neonate/s has/have abnormalities at birth, additional data will be 
collected regarding the abnormalities.  Any  congenital a nomaly/birth defect in a child 
born to a female patient or female partner of a male patient exposed to any of the 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 121 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  study drugs should be recorded and reported as an SAE within 24 hours of 
awareness  (Section 9.4.2 ). 
Spontaneous or therapeutic abortion should always be reported as an SAE 
(medically significant event) and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form, 
and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as described in (Section 9.4.2 ). 
Female patients of childbearing potential who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrollment must agree to use 1 of the following highly 
effective methods of contraception (defined as methods that can achieve a failure 
rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly):  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner  
• Intra-uterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Oral c ombined hormonal contraception (estrogen and progestogen containing) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, implantable)  
• A bstinence  
Defined as:  refraining from heterosexual intercourse for the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatments.  Periodic abstinence is not acceptable 
(calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), nor is the withdrawal method 
(coitus interruptus).  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  
Contraception must be effective at the first administration of any of the study drugs, throughout the trial, and for [ADDRESS_867116] agree to take measures not to father children by 
[CONTACT_647564]/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository during the 
study.  
It should be explained to the patient that if his partner is pregnant or breast -feeding 
when he is enrolled on the trial, the patient must  use barrier method contraception 
(condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent the unborn fetus or the baby [CONTACT_647565].  
Male patients must also refrain from sperm donation from the administration of the first dose of Hu5F 9-G4, throughout the trial, and for [ADDRESS_867117] be recorded in the trial drug section of the eCRF.  
Abuse or Misuse  
Abuse or misuse of a study drug is use for nonclinical reasons, with or without experiencing an AE.  
9.4. Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Reporting Requirements  for Fatal/Life Threatening SAEs Related to 
Investigational Products  
Any life -threatening (i.e., imminent risk of death) or fatal AE assessed as related to 
the study drug(s) that occurs while on study drugs should be submitted to the 
Medical Monitor with written case details on an SAE Form within [ADDRESS_867118] Information for Sites:

9.4.2.  Reporting Requirements for All SAEs  
Investigators will submit reports of all SAEs to the Safety CRO and Sponsor within 
24 hours of awareness, regardless of attribution according  to the instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Sponsor or designee will report applicable serious adverse events and/or 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to regulatory 
authorities, Investigators/institutions, and central IRBs/IECs in compliance with 
reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice 
(GCP).  
The Investigator is to notify the appropriate local IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other applicable adverse event reports  in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.  
9.5. Type and Duration of Follow -up of Patients after Adverse Events  
The Investigator must follow all unresolved SAEs and study drug -related AEs until 
the events are resolved or stabilized, are determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_3786], the patient initiates alternate therapy for their cancer, or the patient is 
lost to follow -up, whichever occurs first. Follow up will be conducted as described in 
Section  7.5.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 124 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Adverse Event eCRF and SAE Report Form (if applicable) and in the patient’s 
medical record to facilitate SDV.  
The Sponsor or its designee may  follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or 
a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], 
consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate 
the SAE report. At any time, Investigators are to report SAEs that they assess to be 
related to one of the study drugs (Hu5F9- G4 and/or cetuximab received as part of 
this study).  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867119] Version  1.1 C riteria 
(Eisenhauer  2009 ; Appendix D ) and iRECIST ( Seymour 2017,  Appendix D ).  
The first response assessment will occur after [ADDRESS_867120] Version 1.1 
Criteria, as detailed in  Appendix D.  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as follows:  
• Measurable tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with 
a minimum size of: 10  mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan (CT scan slice 
thickness n o greater than 5  mm; Appendix D).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_867121] X -ray. 
• To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be ≥ [ADDRESS_867122] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
• At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867123] diameter <  10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with <  15 mm short axis as well as truly non- measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non- measurable include:  
• Leptomeningeal disease 
• Ascites 
• Pleural or pericardial effusion  
• Inflammatory breast disease 
• Lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung  
• Abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_236942]  
10.2.2.  Assessment of Target Lesion Response  
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at  baseline all lesions up to a 
maximum of 5  lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to 
< 10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum measured while on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least [ADDRESS_867124] Version 1.1 -defined radiological progression of disease until disease 
progression is confirmed ≥  4 weeks later ( Nishino  2013; Hodi 2016) provided that all 
of the following apply:  absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically 
significant disease progression; no decline in performance status; absence of rapid 
disease progression, or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g., CNS 
metastasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_90972], or spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710]) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention; and no significant 
unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study treatment.  If the confirmation 
scan demonstrates pseudoprogression and not PD, the patient may continue on 
treatment until disease progression is c onfirmed.  The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression according to RECIST Version 1.1 
guidelines, however patients who meet the above criteria for non- clinically significant 
disease progression may also continue treatment until disease progression is confirmed (Hodi  2016).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters measured 
while on study.  
10.2.3.  Assessment of Non -target  Lesions  
CR:  Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tum or marker level above the normal limits.  
PD:  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  However, because 
patients treated with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_647513], patients with 
PD may continue investigational treatment through RECIST  Version 1.1- defined 
radiological progression of disease until disease progression is confirmed ≥  4 weeks 
later (Nishino 2013, Hodi 2016), provided that all of the following apply:  absence of 
clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression; no 
decline in performance status; absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 128 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g. CNS metastasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_647514], spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]) requiring urgent alternative medical 
intervention; and no significant unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study 
treatment.  If the confirmation scan demonstrates pseudoprogression and not PD, 
patients may continue on treatment until disease progression is con firmed.  
10.2.4.  Assessment of Evaluable rather than Measurable Disease  
Patients with evaluable but non- measurable response will be assessed with the 
diagnostic study used to establish evaluable disease at least every [ADDRESS_867125] Criteria are listed in  Appendix  D. More examples (Scenario A -F) of 
response evaluation by [CONTACT_647567]  D. 
10.3.1.  iRECIST Response Assessment  
Overall response will also be assessed using iRECIST.  Immunotherapeutics may result in infiltration of immune cells leading to transient increase in the size in 
malignant lesions, or undetectable lesions becoming detectable.  The criteria are 
identical to those of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_867126] overall responses will be 
recorded separately.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Confirming Progression 
Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confir mation of progression and uses the 
terms iUPD (unconfirmed progression) and iCPD (confirmed progression). 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867127] 
assessment, is seen as evidenced by [CONTACT_10980]:  
• Continued increase in tumor burden (from iUPD) where RECIST 1.1 definitions of progression had been met (from nadir) in target, non- target 
disease or new lesions  
o Progre ssion in target disease worsens with an increase of at least 
5 mm in the absolute value of the sum  
o Continued unequivocal progression in non- target disease with an 
increase in tumor burden  
o Increase in size of previously identified new lesion (s) (an increas e of 
at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of those considered to 
be target new lesions) or additional new lesions.  
• RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesions types (target or non- target or new 
lesions) where progression was not previously identified,  including the 
appearance of additional new lesions.  
• If iUPD is not confirmed at the next assessment, then the appropriate response will be assigned (iUPD if the criteria are still met, but no worsening, or iSD, iPR or iCR if those criteria are met compared to 
baseline).   As can be seen in Table 14,  the prior documentation of iUPD 
does not preclude assigning iCR, iPR, or iSD in subsequent time- point 
assessments or as best overall response (BOR) providing that iCPD is not 
documented at the next assessment after iUPD.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  New Lesions  
New lesions should be assessed and measured as they appear using RECIST 1.1 criteria (maximum of [ADDRESS_867128] 10 mm in long axis 
(or 15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions)  and recor ded as New Lesions -Target 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 130 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  (NLT) and New Lesion -Non-Target (NLNT)  to allow clear differentiation from 
baseline target and non- target lesions . 
New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD).  
However, the measurements of target lesions should NOT be included in the sum of 
measures of original target lesions identified at baseline.  
PD is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but not more than 8 weeks) after iUPD confirm s further 
progression from iUPD with either an increase of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR an increase (but not necessarily unequivocal increase) in the 
size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of additional new lesions.

or iCR/iPR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent 
or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded on study (including baseline).  
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
(including baseline).  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 133 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS].  Methods of Measurement  
The same method of assessment and the same t echnique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Assessments should be identified on a calendar schedule and should not be 
affected by [CONTACT_121243].  While on study, all lesions recorded at baseline 
should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm).  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13051], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the le sion 
is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value 
of 5 mm should be assigned.  For lesions which fragment/split add together the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longest diameter for the “merged lesion”.  
Clinical Lesions .  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥  10 mm as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  If feasible, imaging is preferred.  
Chest X -ray.  Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression 
is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in 
identifying new lesions.  However, lesions ≥  [ADDRESS_867132] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for 
a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations (e.g., for body scans).  Other specialized imaging or other 
techniques may als o be appropriate for individual case.   For example, while PET 
scans are not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET -CT scans may be used 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment [ADDRESS_867133] (with IV and oral contrast).  
Ultrasound .  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.   If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_460195], confirmation by [CONTACT_13222].  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials 
where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers .  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and 
CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When 
effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the 
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the 
measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is advised to 
differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive disease.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  analysis to be conducted, including the handling of missing data and patient 
withdrawal, will be provided in the SAP.  
11.3.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
Endpoints used in the efficacy analysis are O RR, DOR, DCR, PFS, OS, and TTP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Objective Response Rate 
Objective response is defined as CR+PR determined by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1 (primary 
efficacy) and iCR+iPR determined by [CONTACT_19393] (secondary efficacy) separately.  
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with objective response in the Efficacy 
Analysis Set.  
A sensitivity analysis of ORR will be conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set if more than 10% of patients in the Efficacy Analysis Set are excluded from the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Disease Control Rate  
Disease control is defined as CR+PR+SD determined by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1. DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with disease control in the Efficacy Analysis 
Set. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Duration of Response  
DOR is measured from when the first (objective) response is met (i.e., CR or PR) until the first date of objectively documented progressive disease.  Patients  who do 
not have objectively progressive disease will be censored at their last documented 
progression- free date.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Progression- free Survival  
PFS is measured from dose initiation until the first date of objectively documented progression disease or death.  Patients who do not have objectively documented 
progression disease AND not died will be censored at their last documented 
progression- free date.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 138 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS].  Overall Survival  
OS is measured from dose initiation until death.  Patients who did not die will be 
censored at their last known alive date.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Time to Progression  
TTP is measured from dose initiation until the first date of objectively documented progressiv e disease. Patients who do not have objectively documented progressive 
disease will be censored at their last documented progression- free date.  
Note: Term “objectively documented progressive disease” above refers to PD in the 
overall response evaluation form.  
11.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamics Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
PK analysis will be conducted for Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab using the PAS.  Based 
on the distinct MOAs of Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab, drug -drug PK interactions are not 
expected.  Thus, samples for PK analysis for cetuximab will be biobanked and will 
be analyzed based on CTSC recommendation.  
The PAS consists of all patients who have at least [ADDRESS_867137] measurable concentration sampling time (t last) (mass 
× time × volume ˗ 1)  
AUC inf The AUC from time zero to infinity (mass × time × volume ˗ 1)  
AUC tau The AUC calculated to the end of a dosing interval (tau) at steady -state (amount × time 
× volume ˗ 1)  
Cmax The maximum (peak) observed plasma, blood, serum, or other body fluid drug 
concentration after single dose administration (mass × volume ˗ 1)  
Tmax The time to reach maximum (peak) plasma, blood, serum, or other body fluid drug concentration after single dose administration (time)  
T1/2 The elimination half -life associated with the terminal slope (λz) of a semi logarithmic 
concentrat ion-time curve (time).  Use qualifier for other half -lives 
CL The total body clearance of drug from the plasma (volume × time ˗ 1)  
Vz The apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase (associated with λz) (volume)  
PAS will be used in all PK data analysis and PK summary statistics, except for the 
dose- exposure analysis for Phase 1b. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The following parameters will be determined by [CONTACT_632782]- compartmental 
method(s) for Hu5F9- G4: 
• AUC inf 
• AUC 0-168h 
• C max 
• T max 
• T 1/2 
• CL 
• V z 
Biofluid concentrations will be expressed in mass per volume units.  All 
concentrations below the limit of quantitation or missing data will be reported as 
such in the concentration data listings.  Concentrations below the limit of quantitation 
will be tre ated as zero in summary statistics.  
Descriptive statistics of all PK parameters will include arithmetic and geometric mean, median, SD, CV, geometric CV, minimum and maximum.  Zero 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 140 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  concentrations will not be included in the geometric mean calculation.  Since T max is 
generally evaluated by a nonparametric method, median values and ranges will be 
provided for this parameter.  
Summary statistics will be presented for Hu5F9- G4 serum concentrations at each 
scheduled time point.  Descriptive graphical plots of individual serum 
concentration- versus -time profiles and mean concentration- versus -time profiles will 
be generated.  
Missing concentration values will be reported as is in data listings.  Concentration 
values below lower limit of quantitation will be handled as  zero in summary statistics, 
and reported as is in data listings.  Any missing PK parameter data will not be imputed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Proportionality  
The analysis of dose proportionality will be conducted for the AUC and C
max of 
Hu5F9- G4 using a power model on log -transformed scale.  The log -transformed PK 
parameters will each be regressed onto a fixed factor for log (dose).  The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the slope for each PK parameter will be computed from 
the model and presented in a summary table.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Immunogenicity Analyses  
The rate and magnitude of anti -Hu5F9- G4 antibody positivity will be evaluated for 
individual patients, for all patients in the Phase 1b and [ADDRESS_867138] the immunogenicity of cetuximab and vice 
versa.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Immunogenicity:  Exposure and/or Adverse Event Relationship 
The concentration- versus -adverse event/immunogenicity relationship will be 
explored graphically, tabulated and, if appropriate, evaluated by a mixed effects 
model in order to characterize a relationship between the changes from screening 
immunogenicity presence and serum concentration of Hu5F9- G4. 
In addition, the potential correlation between immunogenicity and other endpoints (major safety, efficacy, and biomarker parameters) may be evaluated.  This will be 
done in [ADDRESS_867139], a descriptive analysis will be performed graphically between 
immunogenicity change from screening values and major safety, efficacy, and 
biomarker parameters (either as categories or continuous variables).  Second, for 
any potential correlation identified, further investigation will be performed using a 
mechanism -based modeling approach, as appropriate.

11.3.3.  Safety Analyses 
The statistical analysis of safety will be conducted for patients in the SAF. 
The statistical analysis will be de scriptive, providing listings, graphical displays, 
frequencies, and percentages for discrete variables and/or the mean, standard 
deviation, median, and ranges for continuous variables.  Safety variables to be 
examined include DLTs, treatment -emergent adver se events (TEAEs: AEs 
worsening or occurring during or after a patient’s first exposure to study drugs), vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory, receptor occupancy, and antidrug antibody 
assessments.  Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA,  Version 17.1 or later) and grouped by [CONTACT_39812].

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Data will be presented by [CONTACT_7609] 1b dose cohort and Phase 2 arm, where relevant, 
summarized across various dose cohorts.  Data may be graphed, summarized, or 
listed depending on the amount of data to be reported.  Where relevant, safety data 
will also be presented by [CONTACT_647568]/study day interval corresponding to dose 
administrations within each dose cohort.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events 
For the safety Analysis Set, AEs that occurred during Screening, but before exposure to study drugs will be reported in the AE line listings and appropriately 
identified as non- TEAEs.  Summary tables of TEAEs will be provided using the 
NCI CTCAE Version  4.03 to describe the type and severity of event.  Peripheral 
smear assessments will be tabulated and reported separately.  TEAEs will also be 
tabulated using Investigator assessment of the relationship to study drugs (related or 
not related).  SAEs, including deaths, will be summarized and/or listed for each dose 
cohort and for all dose cohorts combined.  TEAEs resulting in withdrawal from study 
drugs or further study participation will be tabulated and/or listed.  DLTs will also be 
listed.  Unless otherwise noted, the tabulation of AEs will be based on patient 
incidence rather than event incidence.  
Adverse events and SAEs occurring during Screening will be reported separately for patients in the Screened- only Set with line listings and/or summary tables, along with 
relevant  demographic data collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints  
The analysis of other safety endpoints such as vital signs, peripheral smear 
assessments, and other laboratory assessments, will include listings, graphical displays, and descriptive statistics such as change from baseline and/or shift tables, 
where relevant.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
11.4.  Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis would be conducted on the first 15 efficacy evaluable patients for each cohort in Phase 2. If median PFS is no more than 2 months and objective 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9004, Amendment 3  Page 143 of 161 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  response rate is less than 10%, then there would be no further enrollment into the 
cohort. CTSC would decide whether or not to further expand a cohort based on the 
totality of the efficacy as well as safety data.

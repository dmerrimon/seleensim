Study Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, active -controlled, dose-finding 
study to compare the efficacy, safety  and tolerability of oral SCY -078 compared to oral 
fluconazole in adult female subjects 18 years and older with moderate to severe AVVC. 
Approximately 180 eligible subjects (30 subjects per treatment group)  will be enrolled and 
randomized into the study.  
The primary objective of this study is to identify the recommended dose of oral SCY -[ADDRESS_803555] of a Screening visit, a Baseline visit on Day 1, a study visit on Day 3

 (which will consist of an on -site visit for PK sampling for a subset of subjects and a phone contact 
[CONTACT_606524]), a TOC visit (which will includ e PK sampling for the PK  Subset of 
subjects ) on Day 10  (±2) and a FU visit on Day 2 5 (+4). The Screening and Baseline visits may 
be combined. Efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK assessments will be conducted for the study.  
Efficacy will be determined primarily by [CONTACT_27370] (complete 
resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy endpoints will include 
mycological eradication (negative fungal culture) at the TOC visi t, a composite endpoint of both 
clinical cure and mycological eradication at the TOC and FU visits, continued clinical response 
cure (continued absence of signs and symptoms) at the FU visit , and time to resolution of signs 
and symptoms after initiation of study drug. Other efficacy endpoints will also be explored. 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following 
parameters: physical exam, vital signs, adverse events ( AEs), treatment discontinuations , and 
safety laboratory tests. A subset of approximately [ADDRESS_803556] ing will be done at the central 
laboratory for all positive cultures for Candida  spp. Additional vaginal samples will be col lected , 
if clinically indicated, to be examined  for the presence of other pathogens (e.g., causative agents 
for bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas , Herpes virus, N. gonorrhea , Chlamydia , human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_606496]) by a qualified  laboratory and for the determination of 
vaginal pH  by [CONTACT_093] . The investigators and the s ubjects will rate the signs (edema, 
erythema and excoriation) and symptoms (itching, burning and irritation) of infection, 
respectively, on a standardized vulvovaginal signs and symptoms scale (the Vulvovaginal Signs 
and Symptoms [VSS] Scale). Safety proce dures, including an abbreviated physical exam, vital 
signs, laboratory tests and a pregnancy test will also be performed. To be eligible for inclusion, 
subjects must have a minimum composite score of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms ≥[ADDRESS_803557] 2 signs  or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or greater  in the VSS Scale , a positive 
KOH test and a normal vaginal pH (≤4.5).  
At the Baseline  visit (which may be combined with the Screening visit) , eligible subjects will be 
randomized in equal allocation (a t a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the following 6 active treatment 
groups (5 experimental groups and 1 active comparator group):  
• Treatment Group 1: oral SCY -078 750 mg QD on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Group 2: oral SCY -078 300 mg BID on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Grou p 3: oral SCY -078 450 mg BID on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Group 4: oral SCY -078 150 mg BID on Days 1 to 3  
• Treatment Group 5: oral SCY -078 300 mg BID on Days 1 to 3  
• Treatment Group 6: oral fluconazole 150 mg QD on Day 1 only  
Subjects will receive randomized trea tment from Day 1 through Day 3. For the purpose of 
maintaining treatment blinding, all randomized subjects will receive matching SCY -078 placebo 
tablets and/or matching fluconazole placebo capsules as needed based on treatment assignment, 
in a double -dummy  fashion. During treatment days, subjects will rate their vulvovaginal 
symptoms and record dosing details, AEs and concomitant medication use daily on subject 
diaries. On Day 3, a PK Subset consisting of 10 subjects per treatment group (total of 60 subjects) 
will visit the site to have PK samples drawn pre -dose (immediately before dosing) and at 2 -6 
hours’  post-dose of either the morning or evening dose.   Day 3 will be an on -site visit for PK 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803558] visit  (with a window  of +3 days ) for non -PK subjects.  All subjects 
(both PK and non -PK subjects) will continue to take their assigned study treatment and rate their 
symptoms of infection within  their subject diari es. Treatment compliance will be reviewed either 
on site or by [CONTACT_606525]. Study drug may be collected from PK subjects who have 
completed study drug dosing at the time of this visit.  
At the TOC visit (Day 10  [±2])  vaginal samples will be obtai ned for local KOH testing and for 
fungal culture  by [CONTACT_2237] . In addition, s usceptibility testing will be done at the 
central laboratory for all positive cultures for Candida  spp. The investigators and the subjects 
will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale. An abbreviated 
physical exam, vital sign measurements and safety laboratory tests will also be performed.  
Additionally, a  single PK sample will be obtained at any convenient time of the day from the PK  
Subset only.  For the PK Subset, the TOC visit must occur as close to Day [ADDRESS_803559] diaries.  Compliance with study drug dosing will be evaluated  
and study drug will be collected for all subjects who did not retu rn their study drug on Day  3.   
At the FU (Day 2 5[+4])) visit, vaginal samples will be obtained for local KOH testing and for 
fungal culture by [CONTACT_2237]. In addition, susceptibility testing will be done at the 
central laboratory for all positive cultures for Candida spp. The investigators and the subjects  
will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale to evaluate clinical 
outcome . 
AEs and prior/concomitant medications will be assessed and documented at all visits.

All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment, except for a member of 
the sponsor personnel or a sponsor representative who will be involved in safety activities.  
Approximately 180 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in equal allocation to one 
of the 6 study treatment groups (5 experimental groups and 1 active comparator group). For  the 
purpose of maintaining treatment blinding, all randomized subjects will receive matching SCY -
078 placebo tablets and/or matching fluconazole placebo capsules as needed based on treatment 
assignment, in a double -dummy fashion.  
All randomization of subjects will be managed electronically through an interactive voice 
response system ( IWRS ). There will be no stratification for this study.  
Study Evaluations:  
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations:  
Blood samples to measure SCY -[ADDRESS_803566] of 10 subjects per treatment 
group (total of 60 subjects ).  On Day 3, samples will be collected at pre -dose (immediately before 
dosing) and at 2 -6 hours’  post-dose of either the morning or evening study drug dose . On Day  10, 
a single PK sample will be collected. For the PK Subset, the TOC visit must occur as cl ose to 
Day 10 as possible. This sample may be collected at any time  of the day.  Blood will be collected 
from all six treatment groups to keep the treatment blinding but only samples from subjects 
assigned to SCY -078 will be analyzed for PK.  
Efficacy Evalua tions:  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy endpoints

 include mycological eradication (negative fungal culture) at the T OC visit, a composite endpoint 
of both clinical cure and mycological eradication at the TOC and FU visits, continued clinical 
response (continued absence of signs and symptoms) at the FU visit and the time to resolution 
of signs and symptoms after initiation of study drug. The percentage of subjects with a negative 
KOH test at the TOC visit , the percentage of subjects who are free of signs and symptom s at the 
FU visit, the percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_606522],  the percenta ge of 
isolates susceptible to SCY -078 and fluconazole , the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at TOC by [CONTACT_606521], and the p ercentage of 
subjects with mycological eradication (negative fungal culture ) at TOC by [CONTACT_606526] s will 
be evaluated as exploratory efficacy endpoint s. 
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy:  
Clinical Outcome s 
•  Clinical cure : Complete resolution of signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal infection without 
need for further antifungal treatment. Specifically, for complete resolution, any sign  or 
symptom  should be absent (score = 0) by [CONTACT_477743] . 
•  Clinical failure : No response to therapy or incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms or 
need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy. If the subject receives or self -
administers topi[INVESTIGATOR_606497]/pruritus such as 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_606498], the subject is considered a clinical failure.  
• Continued Clinical Response : continued absence of signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal 
infection in subj ects who achieved clinical cure at the TOC visit.  
•  Free of Signs and Symptoms : absence of signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal infection  at the 
FU visit . 
Mycological Outcome s 
•  Mycological eradication : A subject with negative culture (no growth) for Candida  species.  
•  Mycological persistence : A subject with a positive culture for Candida  species.  
Safety Evaluations:  
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, physical 
examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and treatment discontinuations.  
Statistical Analyses:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later, unless otherwise 
stated.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance lev el. The study 
is not powered for formal statistical comparisons . 
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, etc.) will be 
provided for all continuous variables; frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for incidence 
and categorical variables.  For parameters measured over time, observed values and changes 
from baseline will be described for each time point.  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Unless otherwise stated, data will be analyzed 
as is with no imputation.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be employed.  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses in detail will be provided as 
a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study tre atments.

 Sample Size Determination  
This is an exploratory study and no formal sample size calculation was performed. 
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in an equal allocation (at a 
1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to the six study treatment group s. Thirty subjects per group are estimated to be 
adequate to perform an initial assessment of the safety and tolerability as well as the potential 
efficacy of SCY -078 in subjects with AVVC . 
Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population: All randomized subjects who have a positive KOH 
test and a confirmed positive mycological culture for yeast at Baseline.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: All mITT subjects who have completed the  study drug treatment , 
who have a TOC evaluation  AND who have no major protocol deviations .  
PK Population: All randomized subjects who received study drug and provided at least one PK 
sample.  
Safety Population: All randomized subjects who received at leas t one dose of study drug and 
who have at least one post -Baseline evaluation.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK parameters will be estimated using Population PK (Pop PK) analysis in NONMEM as 
detailed in the SAP. The PK analyses will be done using the PK Populati on.  
An evaluation of exposure for each dosing regimen relative to clinical cure will be performed.   
The concentration versus time data from the PK samples collected in this study will be analyzed 
using a Pop PK model to predict AUC and C max (as appropriat e). A Pop PK modeling strategy is 
required because the sampling time points will not support a standalone PK analysis, and hence, 
the data from this study will be pooled with data from other oral studies to predict AUC and C max 
on Day [ADDRESS_803567] and-alone Population PK report will prepared to describe the analysis 
performed on the PK samples collected from this study.  
Further analysis of possible metabolites may be performed.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT  (primary analysis population) , ITT  and 
PP populations. The efficacy parameters will be evaluated comparing each SCY -078 treatment 
group (and all treatment groups combined) versus the active comparator (fluconazole) group.  
The primary endpoint (clinical cu re at TOC) will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
row mean scores test. Pairwise treatment comparisons of SCY -078 vs . fluconazole will be 
performed using a Fisher’s Exact test; p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. 
Subjects whose results are missing at Day 10 (TOC) will be imputed as failures in the analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed wh ere subjects with missing values will be removed 
from the analysis.  
For continuous efficacy endpoints, the Student’s t -test will be used for pairwise treatment 
comparisons of SCY -078 vs . fluconazole; p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be 
presented for the differences between treatment groups. For categorical endpoints, Fisher’s Exact 
test will be performed, and p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  The time 
to resolution of signs and symptoms after initiation of study drug will be  analyzed using Kaplan -
Meier methods.

 7.0 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
7.1 Background Information  
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common fungal infection caused by [CONTACT_606528] a 
significant morbidity condition in women from all social classes . 
Information on the i ncidence of VVC  is incomplete, since the disease is not a reportable entity and 
data collection is hampered by [CONTACT_27384] -representative study 
populations.1 VVC affects 70 %–75% of women at least once during their lives, most frequently 
young women of childbearing age . Approximately 40%–50% of women will experience a 
recurrence2 and 5 % to 8 % of adult women have a recurrent vul vovaginal ca ndidiasis.3 The reported  
incidence goes from  15% to 30% .4,5  
Current treatments for VVC include topi[INVESTIGATOR_606499] a single doses of fluconazole.  In two vaginal candidiasis studies conducted w ith fluconazole, 
the therapeutic cure rate, defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms of vaginal candidiasis 
along with negative KOH examination and negative culture for Candida , was achieved by 55% of 
subjects receiving single dose s of fluconazole 1 50 mg.  The therapeutic cure rate is reduced to 
40% in subjects with a history of recurrent vaginitis.6,[ADDRESS_803568] certain species of Candida  that cause VVC.  
New curative approaches are needed, particularly involving agents with fungicidal activity ( i.e., 
that are able to kill the fungus) and activity agains t fluconazole -resistant strains, so that the 
causative yeasts can be eradicated . A new therapeutic approach with these characteristics would 
be expected to result in improved short -term and potentially long -term outcomes for this conditi on.   
This study aims to identify the  efficac ious dose of SCY -078, as a new class of antifungal agent  
with fungicidal activity against Candida  spp. in the treatment of patients with VVC.  
The glucan synthesis inhibitor SCY -[ADDRESS_803569] class 
of glucan synthesis  inhibitor (GSI) that inhibits the synthesis of the fungal cell wall  polymer β -

 (1,3) -D-glucan.  Time -kill studies have demonstrated that SCY -[ADDRESS_803570] oral and intravenous (IV) GSI for the treatment and 
prevention of fungal infections caused by [CONTACT_606529].  
Antifungal activity  
The spectrum and potency of activity of S CY-[ADDRESS_803571] and mold isolates using the 
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( M27 -A3 guidelines)[ADDRESS_803572] >[ADDRESS_803573] shown that SCY -078 retains activity (i.e., no significant change in minimum 
inhibitory concentration when compared to wild type) against >90% of azole -resistant strains and 
>70% of Candida  strains with FKS mutations commonly associated with echinocandin resistance. 
Interestingly, although SCY -078 and the echinocandins share a similar mechanism of action (β -
[1,3] -D-glucan synthesis inhibition), their clearly different molecular structure pro vides them with 
some differentiating characteristics in terms of microbiological activity.  
SCY -[ADDRESS_803574] >170 clinical isolates of echinocandin -resistant strains of 
Candida spp., >95% of which contained mutations in the FKS gene. Overall, SCY -[ADDRESS_803575] approximately 70% of the isolates containing the most commonly reported FKS mutation 
associated with echinocandin resis tance in C. glabrata (S663P in FKS2  and S645P in FKS1 ). 
Selection of SCY -078 resistance in vitro occurs at a low frequency. A deletion at position F659 in 
FKS2  of C. glabrata was the predominant mutation observed in these studies; notably, SCY -[ADDRESS_803576] >70% of these isolates. SCY -[ADDRESS_803577] life -threatening and multi -drug-resistant C. auris  strains 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803578] >[ADDRESS_803579] all of the strains tested.  
Murine models of invasive fungal infections  
The antifungal efficacy of SCY -078 has been evaluated in several murine models of disseminated 
candidiasis and aspergillosis. In a diss eminated C. albicans model, SCY -078 was more active than 
fluconazole at all doses. Murine models of SCY -078 in disseminated candidiasis caused by 
C. glabrata and C. tropi[INVESTIGATOR_606500]. The SCY -078 
area under the c oncentration -time curve  (AUC) in plasma necessary to achieve target efficacy in 
these models was estimated to be 15.4 ± 2.2 μM•hr.  
Nonclinical experience  
Toxicology studies in rats and dogs have been conducted with SCY -078 following oral 
administration for up to 90 days. The results from the non -clinical safety program are supportive 
of the doses and treatment duration intended in this study.  
The in vitro studies indicated that SCY -078 metabolism was predominantly oxidative, with 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A  being the primary enzyme involved in its oxidative metabolism. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase plasma levels of SCY -078; therefore, 
the concurrent administration of SCY -[ADDRESS_803580] received either oral or IV formulations  of SCY -078 
in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.  
SCY -078 was generally well tolerated following single oral doses of up to 1600 mg and multiple 
oral doses of up to 800 mg/day for 28 consecutive days in Phase 1 studies. Reported adverse events 
(AEs) after oral administration have been generally transient and primarily mild to moderate in 
intensity. The most frequently reported AEs have been mild gastrointestinal events (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain).  
A Phase 2 study of oral SCY -078 as step -down therapy from IV echinocandin in patients with 
invasive candidiasis has been completed. Following three to ten days of IV echinocandin therapy, 
21 patients received either  SCY -078 or fluconazole. SCY -078 was well tolerated, with an AE 
profile typi[INVESTIGATOR_606501]. The results from this study also

 indicated that the higher dose of SCY -078 tested (750  mg QD) is predicted to achieve the target 
exposure at steady state in the majority of patients.  
A Phase 2 proof -of-concept study of oral SCY -078 in patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis 
(AVVC) has also been completed. In this multicenter, randomized, active -controlled, evaluator -
blinded stu dy of oral SCY -078 compared to oral fluconazole in adult female patients with AVVC, 
96 patients with an acute, moderate to severe, symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_606502] a 1:1:[ADDRESS_803581] been  conducted. Ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of 
CYP3A) induces a significant (5 -fold) increase in SCY -078 exposure, while diltiazem (a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A) induces a mild to moderate (<3 -fold) increase in SCY -[ADDRESS_803582] on rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) exposure, had only a mild 
effect (less than a 0.5 -fold increase) on the AUC of tacrolimus (a CYP3A and P-glycoprotein 
[P-gp] substrate) and had no effect on the maximum concentration (C max) of tacrolimus.

Rationale for Selected Dose Levels and Dosing Regimens  
The SCY -078 dose levels and dosing regimens  selected for this study (750 mg QD for 1 day, 
300 mg twice daily [ BID] for 1 day  [total daily dose of 600  mg], 450 mg BID for 1 day  [total daily

 dose of 900  mg], 150 mg BID for 3 days  [total daily dose of 300  mg] or 300 mg BID for 3  days 
[total daily dose of 600  mg]) are in the range of doses that have been well tolerated in Phase 1 
investigations . Since the estimated effective exposure of SCY -078 for vulvovaginal candidiasis 
has not been determined , this study will contribute to a better understanding of the exposures that 
may be associated with clinical efficacy  for this indication to guide further inves tigations .   
The dose selected for the active comparator of this study ( fluconazole ) is one  single oral dose of 
150 mg, which is the recomme nded and approved dose for this indication .  
Rationale for Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint for the study is cli nical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms) 
of the acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_606503] -of-cure (TOC) visit on Day 10 (±2), which is in line 
with current regulatory guidance for this condition.9 The secondary efficacy endpoints will include 
mycological eradication (negative fungal culture)  at TOC , a composite endpoint of both clinical 
cure and mycological eradication  at the TOC and FU visits , continued clinical response  (continued 
absence of signs and symptoms ) at the Follow -up (FU) visit  on Day 2 5 (+4), and time to resolution 
of signs and symptoms , which are also in line with current guidelines.  The safety and tolerability 
of SCY -078 will also be evaluated as secondary objectives. Other  objectives of the study will be 
to explore the efficacy of SCY -078 based on KOH testing  at the TOC visit and based on additional 
clinical outcomes (clinical response  regardless of clinical outcome at TOC ) at the FU visit , to 
explore the prevalence of different Candida  species , to explore the in vitro  activity o f SCY -[ADDRESS_803585] baseline Candida  spp. isolates , to explore clinical and mycological outcomes by [CONTACT_606531] , and to evalu ate the PK of SCY -078.  
Rationale for Study Design  
This trial  is being conducted as a double -blind , double -dummy  study. This design is considered an 
appropriate  design  for this indication and phase of investigation , and will use matching SCY -078 
and fluconazole placebo to accommodate the differences in the dos ing regimen s and formulation s 
of SCY -078 and the comparator (fluconazole ).  
The data generated from this study will provide an initial characterization  of the safety  and 
tolerability  of SCY -[ADDRESS_803586] 
effective do sing regi men with efficacy of SCY -078 in this condition. Results from this study will 
guide subsequent phases of development for this indication.

This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, active -controlled, dose-finding  
study  to compare the efficacy, safety  and tolerability of oral SCY -078 compared to oral 
fluconazole in adult female subjects 18 years and older  with moderate to severe AVVC. 
Approximately 180 eligible subjects (30 subjects per treatment group) will be enrolled and 
randomized into the study.  
The primary objective of this study is to identify the recommended dose of oral SCY -078 in 
subjects with moderate to severe AVVC by [CONTACT_606533] -078. 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803588] of a Screening visit, a Baseline visit on Day  1, a study visit on Day 3 ( which

tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following parameters: physical 
exam, vital signs, AEs , treatment discontinuations and safety laboratory tests. A subset of 
approximately 60 subjects will also undergo blood sampling for PK analyses of SCY -078 in 
plasma.  
A summary description of the study visits and assessments is provided below. A schematic of the 
study desi gn is available in Section 6.0. Detailed description s of study treatments and procedures  
are provided in Section  12.0 and Section  14.0, respectively .  
10.1.1  Study Visits  
Screening (Day -1) 
Consenting s ubjects who are experiencing vulvovaginal symptoms at Screening will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_093], who will obtain a vaginal sample for local KOH testing and for fungal culture 
and species identification  by [CONTACT_2237]. Susceptibility testing will be done a t the central 
laboratory for all positive cultures for Candida  spp. Additional vaginal samples will be collected , 
if clinically indicated, to be examined  for the presence of other pathogens  (e.g., causative agents 
for bacterial vaginosis , Trichomonas , Herp es virus, N. gonorrhea , Chlamydia , human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_606496]) by a qualified  laboratory  (central or local laboratory)  
and for the determination of vaginal pH  by [CONTACT_093] . The investigators and the subjects will 
rate the signs (edema, erythema and excoriation ) and symptoms (itching, burning and irritation) of 
infection, respectively, on a standardized vulvovaginal signs and symptoms scale  (the 
Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms [VSS] Scale)  (see Appe ndix B ). Safety procedures, including 
an abbreviated physical exam, vital signs, laboratory tests and a pregnancy test will also be 
performed.  
To be eligible for inclusion, subjects must have a minimum composite score of vulvovaginal signs 
and symptoms  ≥[ADDRESS_803589] 2 signs or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or greater  in 
the VSS Scale , a positive KOH test and a normal vaginal pH  (≤4.5).

Baseline (Day 1)  
At the Baseline  visit (which may be combined with the Screening visit) , eligible subjects will be 
randomized in equal allocation (at a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the following 6  active  treatment 
groups (5 experimental groups and 1 active comparator group):  
• Treatment Group 1: oral SCY -078 750 mg QD on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Group 2: oral SCY -078 300  mg BID on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Group 3: oral SCY -078 450  mg BID on Day 1 only  
• Treatment Group 4: oral SCY -078 150  mg BID on Days 1 to 3  
• Treatment Group 5: oral SCY -078 300  mg BID on Days 1 to 3  
• Treatment Group 6: oral fluconazole 150  mg QD on Day 1 o nly 
For the purpose of maintaining treatment blinding, all randomized subjects will receive matching 
SCY -078 placebo tablets and/ or matching fluconazole placebo capsules as needed based on 
treatment assignment, in a double -dummy fashion. Study drug treatme nt will be dispensed on 
Day 1 and will be self -administered by [CONTACT_508198]  1 (Baseline) through Day 3. Subjects 
will also be given subject diaries to rate their symptoms of infection on the VSS scale and to record 
dosing details, AEs and concomit ant medication use daily from Day 1 through the TOC visit 
(Day  10). 
 
Day 3  
On Day  3, a PK Subset consisting of  10 subjects per treatment group (total of 60  subjects) will 
visit the site to have PK samples drawn pre-dose (immediately before dosing)  and at 2 -6 hours’  
post-dose of either the morning or evening dose .  Day [ADDRESS_803590] visit (with a window  of +3 days ) for non -PK subject s.  All s ubjects (both PK and 
non-PK subjects) will continue to take their assigned study treatment  and rate their symptoms of 
infection on their subject diaries.  Treatment compliance will be reviewed either on site or by [CONTACT_606535].   Study drug may be collected from PK subjects who have co mpleted study drug 
dosing at the time of this visit.  
 
 
TOC (Day 10)  
Vaginal samples will be obtained  for local KOH testing and for fungal culture  by [CONTACT_11378]. In addition , susceptibility testing will be done at the central laboratory for all positive 
cultures for Candida  spp. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of 
infection, respectively, on the VSS S cale. A n abbreviated physical exam , vital sign measurement s 
and sa fety laboratory tests  will also be performed.  Additionally , a single PK sample will be 
obtained at any convenient time of the day from the PK Subset only.  For the PK Subset, the TOC

Compliance with study drug dosing will be evaluated and study drug will be collected for all 
subjects who did not return their study drug on Day  3.   
 
FU (Day 2 5) 
Vaginal samples will be obtained for local KOH testing and for fungal  culture by [CONTACT_11378]. In addition , susceptibility testing will be done at the central laboratory for all positive 
cultures for Candida  spp. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of 
infection on the VSS Scale  to evaluate clinical outcome . 
  
All Visits  
AEs and prior/concomitant medications will be assessed and documented at all visits.  
10.1.2  Study Assessments  
The study will include efficacy, safety and PK assessments.  
 
Efficacy Assessments  
Treatment outcome will be assess ed primarily based on clinical cure ( complete resolution of signs 
and symptoms)  at the TOC (Day  10) visit . Secondary efficacy endpoints  will include mycological 
eradication (negative fungal culture) at the TOC visit , a composite endpoint of  both clinical cure 
and mycological eradication at the TOC and FU visits, continued c linical response  (continued 
absence of  signs and  symptoms ) at the FU visit and time to resolution of signs and symptoms after 
initiation of study drug . Additionally , the percentage of subjects with a negative KOH test at the 
TOC visit , the percentage of subjects who are  free of signs and symptoms  at the FU visit, the 
percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_606522] , the percentage of isolates 
susceptible to SCY -078 and fluconazole will be explored , the percentage of subjects with clinical 
cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at TOC by [CONTACT_606536] (negative fungal culture) at TOC by [CONTACT_606537] s. 
 
Clinical Evaluation  
The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms (itching, burning and 
irritation) of infection will be as sessed by [CONTACT_27379], respectively, on the VSS 
Scale [ provided in Appendix B]). The VSS Scale is a standardized , predefined  scale where each 
sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on s everity (absent = 0; mild  = 1; 
moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score.  
 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803592] microscopic examination with 10%  KOH and fungal cultures. 
KOH will be performed locally at Screening f or the determination of subject eligibility  and at the 
TOC and FU visits for the exploratory assessment of treatment outcome . Fungal cultures will be 
performed centrally at Screening for species identification and susceptibility testing and at the 
TOC  and FU  visits for the assessment of treatment outcom e and susceptibility testing  for subjects 
with positive cultures .  
 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be drawn on Day 3 and Day 10 (±2) from the PK Subset ( 10 subjects per 
treatment group ) for the determination of SCY -[ADDRESS_803593], safety 
laboratory tests, AEs and revie w of concomitant medication use . 
10.2 Blinding , Randomi zation and Stratification  
This is a randomized, double -blind , double -dummy  study.  All site and sponsor personnel will be 
blinded to treatment assignment, except for a member of the sponsor personnel or a sponsor 
representative who will be involved in safety activities . 
Approximately 180 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in equal allocation (at a 
1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the 6 study treatment groups (5 experimental groups and 1 active 
comparator group). For the purpose of maintaining  treatment blinding, all randomized subjects 
will receive matching SCY -078 placebo tablets  and/or matching fluconazole placebo capsules as 
needed based on treatment assignment, in a double -dummy fashion.  
All randomization of subjects  will be managed electr onically through an interactive voice response 
system ( IWRS ).

bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas. Testing for N. gonorrhea , Chlamydia  or Herpes  virus will 
also be conducted by a qualified laboratory (local or central lab oratory) , if clinically indicated. 
Vaginal samples will be tested for bacterial vaginosis,  Trichomonas, N. gonorrhea , Chlamydia  or 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803625] microscopic examination with 
10% KOH . Subjects must have a positive KOH test at Screening to be randomized to one of the 
study treatment groups. The Screening KOH will be assessed at the site by [CONTACT_170270]. A vaginal sample will al so be obtained at Screening for fungal culture and species 
identification by [CONTACT_606540] -078, fluconazole 
and additional antifungal agents . Central susceptibility testing will be done as per CLSI M27 -A3 
guidelines.  An additional vulvovaginal specimen will be collected at the TOC and FU  visits for 
local KOH testing and for fungal culture by [CONTACT_606541] . In addition,  susceptibility testing will be done at the cen tral laboratory for all positive 
cultures for Candida  spp. Vulvovaginal samples may also be taken at unscheduled visits, if needed.

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803634] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug/study intervention , whether or not 
related to the study drug/study intervention . 
Any laboratory abnormality  that is deemed to be clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_27350] , whether or not 
it is related to the study drug.  
Stable chronic conditions t hat are present prior to clinical trial enrollment  and do not 
worsen are not considered AEs and will be accounted for in the subject ’s medical history.  
The following can be considered AEs:  
• An exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after the initiation of treatment with study 
medication, even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Continuous persistent disease or symp toms present at Baseline that worsen after 
signing the informed consent or following the initiation of treatment with study 
medication  
The follow ing are not considered AEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. , surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction or 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence ha s not occurred (e.g.,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27352]/convenience

 • The disease being studied or signs or symptoms associated with the disease, unless 
more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition  or a worsening of the disease 
being studied  
16.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Any other important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes may 
be considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above.  
A life -threatening AE is any AE that places the subject , in the view of the i nvestigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
16.[ADDRESS_803635] (ECIs)  if they occur after dosing , 
and must be reported by [CONTACT_27438] : 
• ALT or AST > 8 x the upper limit of normal ( ULN ), confirmed by [CONTACT_601269]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_803636] for more than 2 weeks  if new compared to Baseline , 
confirmed by [CONTACT_601269]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_803637] and either  total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_803638] or international 
normalized ratio ( INR) >1.5 if new compared to Baseline , confirmed by [CONTACT_606545]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_803639], with the appearance of fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (>  5%) 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803640] be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.   If 
the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify 
the Sponsor .  At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the 
outcome of the pregnancy. If th e outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting an SAE . 
16.6 Unexpected  Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is of greater specificity or 
severity than those that have been observed with the particular study drug being tested.  For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected," as used 
in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not 
specifically m entioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,521  
PROTOCOL SCY -078-204 Version 2.0 
 
13 JUL  2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 
 16.7 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject ’s 
daily activities and will be classified by [CONTACT_27414], m oderate or severe using 
the following criteria:  
• Mild:   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.  Not likely to require 
medical attention.  
• Moderate:   Discomfort enough to cause some interference with daily activity .  May 
require medical intervention.  
• Severe:  Intense enough to disrupt daily activities .  Likely requires medical 
intervention.  
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious”  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a sp ecific event (as 
in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria u sually associated with events 
that pose a threat to life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
16.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator will assess causality (i .e., whether there is a reas onable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs.  The relationship will be characterized 
using the following classification:  
• Related:  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes causality 
possible  and as lik ely or more likely than  due to another cause such as other drugs, 
a surgical intervention or an underlying disease.  
• Not related:  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes 
causality improbable and can be due to another cause such as other drugs, a surgical 
intervention  or an underlying disease.  
16.9 Adverse Event Collection Timeframe  
All AEs  and SAEs will be recorded from  the time informed consent is obtained through  
the FU visit (end of study) .   
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803641]  or observed by [CONTACT_606546]  (PI) or qualified designee . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_27354], if 
possible, to establish a diagnosis based on presenting signs and symptoms.  The nature of 
the AE, time of onse t relative to study drug administration, duration, severity, and 
relationship to treatment should be determined. Details of any corrective treatment must be 
recorded in the eCRF . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_606508]. All AEs and SAEs will be collected in the eCRF . 
16.[ADDRESS_803642]/Ethics Committee 
(IRB/EC) in accordance with its regulations and guidelines.  
16.11  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow -up 
All AEs and SAEs will be followed up to resolution (the subject ’s health has r eturned to 
her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal) or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the event) or the event is otherwise explained, regardle ss of whether the 
subject  is still participating in the study. All appropriate therapeutic measures should be 
undertaken and recorded. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be 
performed to document resolution of the event (s). 
16.12  Serious Adver se Event  Reporting – Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports and Follow -Up SAE Reports :  To report an SAE, the SAE eCRF form within 
the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be completed. All SAEs, whether or not 
deemed drug -related or expected, m ust be reported by [CONTACT_606547] [ADDRESS_803643] becoming aware of the event.  The investigator/qualified designee 
will enter the required information regarding the SAE into the appropriate form, which will 
automatically r esult in distribution of the information to the appropriate sponsor contact  
[CONTACT_606548] (>24 hours), the event, including the 
investigator -determined causality to study drug, should be reported via a paper back -up 
SAE form to Novella Safety Surveillance via  (contact [CONTACT_3031], i.e., e-mail or fax will 
be available on the SAE form).   
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_803644] be 
updated within 24 hours of knowledge/receipt of SAE follow -up information.  
16.13  Procedures for Emergency Unblinding  
This is a double -blind, double -dummy study.  The Investigator should only be unblinded if 
it is necessary to determi ne treatment of emergency.  The study personnel responsible for 
the treatment assignment  can provide the information necessary to unblind the investigator  
(evaluator) , in case of an emergency. If the evaluator is unbli nded, the rea son for 
unblinding  should be documented in the comment page of the eCRF.

18.0 Analytical Plan  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later, unless 
otherwise stated.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance 
level. The study is not powered for formal statistical comparisons.  
Descriptive statistics (i .e., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, etc.) 
will be provided for all continuous variables; frequencies and percentages will be tabulated 
for incidence and categorical variables.  For parameters measured over time, observed 
values and change s from baseline will be described for each time point.  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] .  Unless otherwise stated, d ata will be 
analyzed as is with no imputation.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be employed.  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses in detail will be 
provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study 
treatments.  
18.1 Sample Size Determination  
This is an exploratory study and no formal sample size calculati on was performed . 
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in an equal allocation (at a 
1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to the six study treatment groups  (see Table 1). Thirty subjects per group 
are estimated to be adequate to perform an initial assessment of the safety and tolerability 
as well as the potential efficacy of SCY -078 in subjects with AVVC.  
18.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population:  All randomized subjects who have a 
positive KOH test and a confirmed positive mycological culture for yeast at Baseline . 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: All mITT subjects who have completed the  study drug 
treatment , who have a TOC evaluation  AND who have no major protocol deviations .

 PK Population: All randomized subjects who received study drug and provide d at least 
one PK sample.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at leas t one dose of study drug 
and who have at least one post -Baseline evaluation.  
18.[ADDRESS_803649] demographics 
and baseline characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, height, body mass 
index, region  (if applicabl e) and other relevant parameters will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the date (and time if 
appropriate) of the first dose of study drug.  Change from baseline is defined as:  post-
baseline value – baseline value.  
18.[ADDRESS_803650] dose of study drug will be considered 
concomitant medications.

 18.6 Pharmacokinetics  
18.6.1  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples to measure SCY -078 and possible metabolite plasma concentration s will be 
drawn on Day 3 and Day  10 (±3) from the PK Subset, which will consist of 10 subjects per 
treatment group (total of 60 subjects).  On Day 3, samples will be collected at pre -dose 
(immediately before dosing ) and at 2 -6 hours’  post-dose of either th e morning or evening 
study drug dose. On Day  10, a single PK sample will be collected. For the PK Subset, the 
Day 10 (TOC ) visit must occur as close to Day 10 as possible . This sample may be 
collected at any time.  Blood will be collected from all six treat ment groups to keep the 
treatment blinding but only samples from subjects assigned to SCY -078 will be analyzed 
for PK.  
18.6.2  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK parameters will be estimated using Population PK analysis in NONMEM as detailed in 
the SAP. The PK analyses w ill be done using the PK  Population.  
An evaluation of e xposure for each dosing regimen  relative to clinical cure will be 
performed .  
The concentration versus time data from the PK samples collected  in this study will be 
analyzed using a Population PK (Pop PK)  model  to predict AUC and C max (as appropriate) . 
A Pop PK modeling strategy is required because the sampling  time points will not support 
a standalone  PK analysis, and hence, t he data from this study will be pooled with data from 
other oral studies to predict AUC and Cmax on Day 1 of treatment.   A stand -alone 
Population PK report will prepared to describe  the analysis performed on the PK samples 
collected from this study.  
Furthe r analysis of possible metabolites may be performed.  
18.7 Efficacy  
18.7.1  Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints include the percentage of subjects with  mycological eradication  (negative fungal 
culture ) at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with both clinical cure and mycological 
eradication at the TOC and FU visits, the percentage of subjects with c ontinued clinical

 response  (continued absence of signs and symptoms) at the FU visit and the time to 
resolution of signs and symptoms after initiation of study drug. The percentage of subjects 
with a negative KOH test at the TOC visit , the percentage of su bjects who are free of signs 
and symptom s at the FU visit, the percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_606550] , the percentage of isolates susceptible to SCY -078 and fluconazole , the 
percentage of subjects with clinical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at 
TOC by [CONTACT_606551] 
(negative fungal culture) at TOC by [CONTACT_606552] s. 
 
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy:  
Clinical Outcome  
• Clinical cure: Complete resolution of signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal infection 
without need for further antifungal treatment. S pecifically, for complete resolution, any 
sign or symptom should be absent (score = 0) by [CONTACT_477743] . 
• Clinical failure:  No response to therapy or incomplete resolution of signs and 
symptoms or need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal ther apy. If the 
subject receives or self -administers topi[INVESTIGATOR_606510]/pruritus such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_606511], the subject is 
considered a clinical failure.  
• Continued Clinical  Response : Continued absence of signs and symptoms  of 
vulvovaginal infection at the FU visit in subjects who achieved clinical cure at the TOC 
visit. 
• Free of Signs and Symptoms : Absence of signs and symptoms  of vulvovaginal 
infection at the FU visit . 
• Mycological Outcome  
• Mycological eradication:  A subject with negative culture (no growth) for Candida 
species .  
• Mycological persistence:  A subject with a positive culture for Candida  species . 
18.7.2  Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT (primary analysis population) , ITT  
and PP populations. The efficacy parameters will be evaluated comparing each SCY -078 
treatment group (and all treatment groups combined) versus the active comparator 
(fluconazole) group.

PROTOCOL SCY -078-204 Version 2.0 
 
13 JUL  2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 
 The primary endpoint (clinical cure at TOC) will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel row mean scores test. Pairwise treatment comparisons of SCY -078 vs. 
fluconazole will be performed using a Fisher’s Exact test; p-values and 95% c onfidence 
intervals will be presented.  Subjects whose results are m issing at Day 10 (TOC) will be 
imputed as failures in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed where subjects 
with missing values will be removed from the analysis.  
For contin uous efficacy endpoints, the Student’s t -test will be used for pairwise treatment 
comparisons of SCY -078 vs. fluconazole; p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be 
presented for the differences between treatment groups. For categorical endpoints, Fishe r’s 
Exact test will be performed, and p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
The time to resolution of signs and symptoms after initiation of study drug will be analyzed 
using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
 
18.8 Safety  
18.8.1  Safety Assessments

 CYP3A4 substrates  
CYP  Substrates  
3A4 In vitro , SCY -078 was an inhibitor of CYP3A mediated metabolism of midazolam, but 
was only a weak inhibitor of metabolism of testosterone. The clinical significance of this 
inhibition is unknown; caution should be exercised when administering SCY -078 with 
drugs known to be CYP3A sensitive substrates with narrow therapeutic index.  
Subjects receiving sirolimus , tacrolimus  or warfarin are permitted for enrollment in the 
study and these medications may be administered concomitantly with SCY -078 with 
close monitoring.  The administration of either sirolimus or tacrolimus should be offset 
by [CONTACT_246392] 2 hours with the administration of SCY -078 At a m inimum, blood levels 
of sirolimus , tacrolimus  or PT/PTT/INR for subjects  on warfarin should be measured 
after the first dose of SCY -[ADDRESS_803658]  has received approximately 7  days 
of SCY -078 (at which time, SCY -[ADDRESS_803659] reached steady state). 
Dosing adjustments and subsequent monitoring of sirolimus and warfarin should be 
undertaken in accordance with product prescribing information for the respective agents.  
Abbreviations: PT = prothrombin time; PTT = partial thrombopla stin time; INR = international 
normalized ration  
 
OATP1B3 substrates  
OATP  Substrate  
1B3 In vitro , SCY -078 is an inhibitor of the OATP1B3 liver uptake transporter.  The clinical 
significance of this inhibition is unknown; however, there is a potential risk for 
increased exposure of the concomitant medications (arising from lowered hepatic 
clearance) when administering SCY -[ADDRESS_803660] prescribing information.

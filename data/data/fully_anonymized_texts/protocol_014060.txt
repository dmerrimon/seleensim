Introduction  
 
This document summarizes the statistical analysis plan for the study entitled 
“Postoperative Ibuprofen and the Risk of Bleeding after Tonsillectomy with or without 
Adenoidectomy ”.   
 
Study design  
 
This study is a randomized , two-arm, blinded , non -inferiority  study to evaluate the 
effects of ibuprofen on postoperative bleeding and pain.   Consented and eligible 
subjects w ill be randomized to receive ei ther ibuprofen (treatment arm) or 
acetaminophen (control arm) postoperatively.  Eligible subjects are children aged 2 -18 
years undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy with electrocautery for 
recurrent tonsillitis and sleep disordered breathing/ obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ).  
Children with the following characteristics w ill be excluded from participat ion in th e 
study: NSAID or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_270861], acetaminophen allergy, bleeding disorders, asthma, 
lung, kidney or liver disease, or allergy to the dyes used in the medications.    
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine if postoperative ibuprofen at 10mg/kg 
dosing QID (for times daily, roughly Q6 hours) postoperatively for [ADDRESS_754305] -tonsillectomy bleeding requiring operative intervention for 
hemostasis (type 3 bleeding) in children when compared with acetam inophen at 
15mg/kg dosing QID.  Secondary outcomes include comparing rates of post -
tonsillectomy hemorrhage based on patient age, indication for tonsillectomy, and 
operating surgeon, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of ibuprofen as a post -
tonsillect omy analgesic.   
 
This is a non -inferiority study which seeks to demonstrate that post -operative ibuprofen 
is not associated with a clinically significant increase in postoperative bleeding rate, 
compared with acetaminophen, in children undergoing tonsille ctomy.  The null 
hypothesis for the primary aim is inferiority of ibuprofen; that is, subjects randomized to 
receive ibuprofen postoperatively after t onsillectomy will have an increased rate of post -
tonsillectomy hemorrhage requiring operative intervention  (type 3 bleeding) compared 
with subjects receiving acetaminophen.  The alternative hypothesis is that bleeding rate 
with ibuprofen is not greater than acetaminophen by [CONTACT_574695] -inferiority 
margin.  This non -inferiority margin was set at 3%.   
 
The overall sample size of 722 (361 per study arm) for the primary analysis  was 
calculated using a group sequential two proportions non -inferiority method using East 
V5.4.2 and O’Brien –Flemming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_574692] -
DeMets approa ch with the following parameters: one sided alpha of 0.025, power of 
80%, 5% projected loss to follow -up rate, acetaminophen (control) type 3 bleed rate of 
2%, non -inferiority  difference of 3%, and 3 anticipated looks at the data (14%, 50% and 
100% enroll ment).  
 
Subjects w ill be recruited from the following five sites:  
1. [LOCATION_005] Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI), [LOCATION_011], MA  
2. Madigan Army Base, Tacoma, WA  
3. Naval Medical Center, San Diego, CA  
4. Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA  
 
Recruited subjects that are  eligible w ill be offered to consent and randomized in a one -
to-one scheme using a uniform (1, 2) random number generator ( www.randomizer.org ) 
in blocks.  This is  a double -blinded study.  Both the patient/parent an d the healthcare 
providers (surgeon and nurses) will be  blinded to which arm the patient is randomized.   
 
The surgical technique used in the tonsillectomy  with or without adenoidectomy along 
with the  pain management prior and during the surgery  is prescribed by [CONTACT_760].  
Postoperative pain management is dependent on randomization.   All subjects will be  
randomized prior to surgery.  
 
Main Outcome Measure and Classification of Bleeding Events  
 
Post-tonsillectomy bleeding is the main outcome m easure.  This is categorized into type 
1, type 2, and type [ADDRESS_754306] two classifications:  
1. Primary vs. Secondary  (based on timing)  
a. Primary : bleed occurs < 24 hours after surgery  
b. Secondary : bleed occurs >/= 24 hours after surgery  
2. Levels 1 -3 (based on severity)  
a. Level 1 : children with any history of postoperative bleeding, regardless of 
whether there was clinical evidence of bleeding upon medical evaluation.  
This level includes all children with a history of postoperative bleeding who 
presented for evaluation/treatment by a physician in the Emergency  
Department, inpatient unit or operating room.  
b. Level 2 : children who require inpatient admission for postoperative 
hemorrhage regardless of the need for operative intervention.  This level 
of severity excludes children who were evaluated in the emergency r oom 
who had no clinical evidence of hemorrhage or clot and were deemed safe 
for discharge home without admission for observation or intervention.  
c. Level 3 : the highest level of severity, includes children who required 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574693] o f post -
tonsillectomy hemorrhage.  This is our main outcome measure.  
 
The endpoint for the primary analysis is either 1.a. or 1.b. and only 2.c. above (i.e. all 
Level 3 primary or secondary tonsil bleeds).  For those subjects with more than one 
distinct bleed event within the study follow -up period, the most severe event will be 
considered  for the primary analysis . 
 
Secondary Endpoint: Effectiveness  
 
Effective ness will be measured by [CONTACT_6270] -reported pain control.  See Appendix I  for pain 
questionnaire  (only the questionnaire from Day 0 is included as Days 1 -8 are the same) .  
The primary definition of effectiveness will be overall rating of the child’s pain (mild, 
moderate, severe); secondary  definitions will include the four categories for crying, 
excitement, anxiety and verbalization of pain (0, 1, 2; corresponding to no experience of 
this symptom, mild and moderate/severe).  
 
Specific Aims  
 
• Primary Aim 1 : To compare  the rates of post -tonsillectomy bleeding between 
pediatric patients who receive postoperative ibuprofen to those who receive 
acetaminophen in a prospective, randomized, blinded and controlled trial.  
• Secondary Aim 2 : To compare the rates of post -tonsillect omy hemorrhage when 
studying different groups of patients based upon their age, indication for 
tonsillectomy, or operating surgeon.  
• Secondary Aim 3 : To evaluate effectiveness of ibuprofen as a post -
tonsillectomy analgesic in comparison to acetaminophen, wh ich is currently the 
standard of care at our institution.  
 
Statistical summaries and methods  
 
All summaries and analyses will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_30157] .  There are two 
study arms: ibuprofen and acetaminophen .

Primary Objective  
 
The primary analysis will be intent -to-treat (ITT).  All randomiz ed subjects will be 
included with the exception of any that withdrew consent  or were found to be ineligible 
post-randomization (see Study Design  section above)  and did not receive the study 
medication .  All other randomized subjects will be included.  
 
This ITT primary analysis (Aim 1 ) will be a simple, univariable analysis to evaluate the 
association between ibuprofen and bleeding.  As described above, t he outcome will be 
type 3 bleeding (including both primary and secondary).  The null hypothesis ( the type  3 
postoperative hemorrhage rate in subjects on the ibuprofen arm differed from the 
bleeding rate of subjects on the acetaminophen arm) will be rejected if the difference in 
bleeding rates do not exceed  3%, which is the preset non-inferiority  margin, and t he 
conclusion will be that the type 3 bleeding in the ibuprofen study arm is not greater than 
that in the acetaminophen arm by [CONTACT_726] 3% .  Thus, the hypotheses are as follows:  
 
𝐻0: 𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑒𝑛 − 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑝 ℎ𝑒𝑛 ≥0.03 
𝐻𝑎: 𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑒𝑛 − 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑝 ℎ𝑒𝑛<0.[ADDRESS_754307] with 
an overall significance level of 0.025.   Analysis will be performed for both primary and 
secondary bleeding.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondarily, a multivariable logistic regression model (Aim 2 ) will assess this primary 
bleeding outcome with adjustment for pain con trol (primary definition of effectiveness as 
recorded on the day before the bleed event) and potential confounding variables  
(including study site, narcotics use, age, surgical indication, gender and operating 
surgeon).   A variable  will be considered confoundin g with study arm if the parameter 
estimate for study arm changes by [CONTACT_726] 10% once the potential confounder is 
included in the model.  Any variables meeting this definition will be included in the 
adjusted model regardless of significance -level.  
 
Both the univariable and multivariable analyses will include all randomized subjects  and 
be intent -to-treat.  This includes t hose that are lost to follow -up.  Those that  are lost to 
follow -up will be assumed to not have had a Type [ADDRESS_754308] to follow -up 
will be  those who d o not return for their postoperative visit.    
 
The final protocol -specified secondary objective ( Aim 3 ) is to evaluate th e effectiveness 
of ibuprofen as a post -tonsillectomy analgesic in comparison to acetaminophen.  Using 
the primary definition of e ffectiveness  we will compare the experience of pain based on 
the overall category (mild, moderate or severe) and study treatmen t arm (mortrin versus 
acetaminophen) using ordinal logistic regression separately for each postoperative day.  
Subsequent  regres sion models will be adjusted for study site, narcotics use, age, 
surgical indication, gender and operating surgeon.   It is not o f interest to assess 
changes in pain over time since post -tonsillectomy pain does not improve consistently in 
the first eight days post -surgery.  For example, it is not unusual for a patient to have 
severe pain on postoperative (PO) days 0 -3, improved pain  levels on PO days 3 -5 and 
then increased pain on PO days 5 -8.  
 
Additionally, assess the correspondence between the primary definition of effectiveness 
and the secondary definitions (crying, excitement, anxiety and verbalization of pain).  
Tables will sum marize overall primary pain response by [CONTACT_574703], separately for each of the [ADDRESS_754309] will be used to assess whether the primary and secondary definitions 
increase or d ecrease in similar ways (since are measures of pain are ordinal and we are 
interested in the linear association between these two measures).

Specific Aims:  Achieving clinically significant weight loss  (CWL) of 5- 10% has been shown to improve 
important cardiometabolic  risk factors in overweight and obese adults  (e.g. insulin sensitivity, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] , 
systemic inflammation , blood pressure) . However,  only 20%  of individuals achieve weight loss maintenance 
and even mild weight  regain (2- 6%) is associated with regression of  risk factor s toward pre -weight loss levels.  
Obtaining high amount s of physical activity  (PA) are critical for successful weight loss  maintenance. However , 
the current recommendation for  the amount of PA needed  to maintain CWL ( 200-300 min per wk. at moderate 
intensity) was derived primarily  from retrospective studies where PA  level was determined by [CONTACT_164581] (e.g. standardization/supervision of exercise levels, 
randomization after clinically significant weight loss) . The American College of Sports Medicine position stand 
on Physical Activity and Weight Maintenance  state s that “ there are no correctly designed,  adequately 
powered, energy balance studies to provide evidence for the amount 
of physical activity to prevent  weight regain after weight loss .” This is 
important given that increased compensation for weight loss  (losing less 
weight than predicted)  has been observed with high levels of aerobic 
exercise  training ( Figure). Similarly,  changes in cardio metabolic risk factors  
(e.g. insulin sensitivity, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], arterial stiffness) have rarely  been reported 
acros s PA levels during weight maintenance, which may be more influential 
on cardiovascular disease risk status  compared to only evaluating change s 
in weight . Thus , there is a need for tightly controlled prospective 
interventions  to test the extent to which the weight maintenance physical 
activity recommendations  improve  weight maintenance and cardiometablic 
risk factors compared to other exercise levels.  
 The Prescribed Exercise to Reduce Recidivism After W eight Loss Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (PREVAIL -P) study will evaluate 
the effect of aerobic exercise training amount on weight maintenance following CWL . In concert with goals of 
the R56 mechanism, this one- year project will provide data to support a future R01 application  where 
overweight and obese  (BMI: 25 -40 kg/m2) men and women ( 18-65 years old) complete an OPTIFAS T diet 
(7%-10% weight loss). Participants that obtain CWL will be subsequently randomized  to aerobic exercise 
training consistent with the minimum physical activity guidelines  (~150 min of moderate intensity exercise)  or 
weight maintenance guidelines (200- 300 min per wk. at moderate intensity)  for [ADDRESS_190970] proposed 2 studies to address the feasibility  of this intervention and demonstrate differences in weight 
and cardiometabolic health parameters to justify the  funding of a future  R01 proposal . In both s tudies, exercise 
training will be  supervised by [CONTACT_164582]- related caloric expenditure. Non-exercise physical 
activity will be assessed objectively through accelerometry during the entire intervention.  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To demonstrate the efficacy  of the  weight loss program in producing CWL and 
retention/ adherence of the exercise inter venti on. Overweight and obese adults (N=39 ) will participate in an 
OPTIFAST weight loss program and  supervised aerobic exercise training (~550 MET min.  per week.) for 10 
weeks . Participants who obtain CWL  will be subsequently randomized to 18  weeks of aerobic  training  
consistent with the minimum physical activity recommendations (~550 MET min per week .) or weight 
maint enance guidelines (~970 MET min per week ). We will evaluate the percentage of participants that  obtain 
at least 7% weight loss  following OPTIFAST treatment, retention r ates in the weight loss program,  adherence 
to exercis e levels, and changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in response  to the intervention.  
 
 
Specific Aim 2:  To test the hypothesis that  exercise levels consistent with weight maintenance 
recommendations  leads to greater weight maintenance after CWL compared to the minimum physical activity 
recommendation levels . Overweight and obese adults (N=30) enrolled in VIDANT health’s OPTIFAST program 
and have achieved at least 7% weight loss will be randomized to 36 weeks of aerobic exercise training 
consi stent with  the minimum  public health guidelines for physical activity  (~550 MET min. per week.)  or we ight 
maintenance levels  (~970 MET min per week) . We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on weight 
(primary) as well as main secondary measures (e.g. body fat, visceral fat, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoprotein particles size/class, 
insulin sensitivity, blood press ure, arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation, fitness, and quality of life) . The 
aforementioned cardiometabolic risk factors were selected because they can be improved specifically by 
[CONTACT_164583].  
 
 
The PREVAIL -P study will provide data  on the effect of exercise level on weight maintenance and 
cardiometabolic risk factors after CWL. This study has high public health importance and will yield 
meaningful results  to justify additional fundin g for this clinical tria l as an R01 application.  Martin  et al. Weight compensation with

1. Background  and S ignificance: Clinically significant weight loss (CWL) is defined as  a weight loss of at 
least 5%-10% of initial body weight  and has been shown to elicit improvements in important cardiometabolic 
risk factors (e.g. lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], blood pressure, insulin resistance) [1] . However, the vast majority of individuals ( 80%) 
[2] are not able to maintain CWL, and the recidivism back to the initial weight  is not only associated with 
increased cardiovascular  disease (CVD) , but also regression in CVD risk factors  [3, 4] . Potential rationales for 
the high prevalence of weight regain after the initial weight loss include increases in appetite  hormones (e.g. 
ghrelin), decreases in anorexigenic hormones (e.g. L eptin, GLP -1), red uctions in compliance with self -
monitoring/weighing habits, and decreases in resting metabolic rate with weight loss  [3]. Import antly , it has 
been well  established that  obtaining a high amount  of physical activity is a critical factor for the maintenance of 
CWL  [1]; however the actual level of physical activity needed to optimally promote weight maintenance 
following CWL has not been adequately quanti fied or tested in a  prospective intervention. In the  American 
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)  position stand (Appropriate Physical Activity Strategies for Weight Loss 
and Prevention of Weight Regain for Adults ) [1] a committee of experts  attempted to determine the  amount of 
physi cal activity that was necessary to promote weigh t mai ntenance after CWL. The committee determined 
that approximately 200-300 minutes  per week o f physical activity  at a moderate intensity  was necessary  to 
promote weight maintenance. These levels are based on data from studies from the National Weight Loss 
Registry  and retrospective analyses from prospective studies where the amount of physical activity was 
quantified primarily through questionnaires  [5-9]. The ACSM position stand emphasized  that although this was 
the best estimation that could be determined based on the limited  available literature,  “major flaws ” existed  in 
the design of  these  studies ”.  Further, the position stand  express ed the need for more research as it states, 
“there are no correctly designed, adequately powered, energy balance studies to provi de evidence for 
the amount of physical activity to prevent weight regain after weight loss.”   
 
The primary limitations  of the  physical activity amount  and weight maintenance literature  are listed below : 
• Many studies were retrospective , meaning that physical activity levels wer e self -selected [5-7] 
• Physical activity levels were  quantified through subjective physical activity questionnaires   [5-7, 10- 12], 
which have reduced accuracy  and may be over -reported  compared to objective measures [13- 15] 
• Lack of randomization to different physi cal activity levels after the attainment of CWL  
• Physical activity and weight maintenance was evaluated across a wide range of PA levels. Studies 
evaluating physical activity  level and weight maintenance often use tertile analyses  which collapse 
many physical activity levels together (e.g. <150 (low), 150- 250 (moderate), >250 min. per week (high). 
Thus, if  level of exercise is being compared to weight maintenance and one of the categories is <150 
minutes per week. This means that a n individual with 2 min. per week and 145 min. p er week are both 
categorized as having low physical activity, which are very different exercise levels.    
•  Little data are available on how physical activity levels  after CWL affect  clinically relevant  traditional 
and non-traditional cardiometabolic  risk factor s 
To further highlight the need for a prospective intervention on physical 
activity amount and weight maintenance, previous exercise studies without 
a weight loss component  have shown that there is greater amount of 
weight loss compensation (losing less weight than predicted)  with very high 
levels of aerobic training. Church et al.  [16] observed greater amounts of 
weight compensation in obese postmenopausal women after 6 months of 
aerobic exercise at  around ~140 min . per week  compared to ~193 min. per 
week  (Figure 1A). Similarly , preliminary data from the E -MECHANIC study 
(Co-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_164544] [consultant on this grant ]) show  a greater amount of 
weight compensation after 6 months of aerobic  training in overweight and 
obese adults exercising at  ~250 min.  per week) com pared to ~100 min.  per 
week ) (Figure 1B) . Weight compensation occurred in 90% of exercisers in 
the [ADDRESS_190971] of different exercise 
levels after CWL on major independent  cardiovascular  and metabolic risk 
factors.  Weight loss alone has notable effects on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  (LDL -C: ~↓5 
mg/dL, triglycerides : ~↓15 mg/dL,  HDL-C: ~↑2-3 mg/dL)  [17-19], but also Figure 1. Weight compensation and 
exercise level  in DREW ( Panel A) and 
E-MECHANIC (Panel B) studies  
 

other clinically relevant cardiometabolic  risk factors such as insulin sensitivity  [20, 21] , arterial stiffness  [22, 23] , 
c-reactive protein [24, 25]  and resting blood pressure [18, 19] . Independently, aerobic exercise training has a 
much more limited effect on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  [26], but has been shown to have independent effects on insulin sensitivity 
[27, 28] , arterial stiffness  [29-31], lipoprotein particle size [32] and absolute fitness [33, 34] . It also important to 
highlight that cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_164545] [35] ) are independent ris k factor s 
for cardiovascular disease [35 -37]. Higher levels of  aerobic training improves fitness in a dose response 
manner  [33]. Thus , along with prevention of weight regain, exercising at weight maintenance guidelines (200 -
300 minutes of moderate physical activity  per week ) has  the potential to maintain CWL more effectively than 
lower levels of exercise, but also offer more cardiometabolic health benefits. This is particularly important give n 
that even mild weight regain (2- 6%) [4] has been associated with regression in major cardiovascular risk 
factors such as t otal cholesterol [38, 39] , LDL cholesterol  [39, 40] , triglycerides  [38, 41, 42] , blood pressure [41-
43], glucose [38, 39, 44]  and insulin levels [40, 43] . Along with c ardiovascular complications , quality of life is 
lower in obese compared to normal weight individuals  [45-47]. QOL improves  with aerobic training in a dose 
response manner [48]  and also improves with weight loss [49 -51] and is another important variable to 
understand the health benefits  of the weight maintenance physical activity recommendations.    
Thus , there is value in understanding the impact of aerobic  training to  counter the negative 
cardiovascular and behavioral impacts of weight regain after weight loss . The clinical and public health 
implications of this research will provide physicians, clinicians and health professionals greater information on 
how to help their patients m aintain their weight loss and what the direct impact of these exercise levels are on 
major  traditional and non -traditional cardi ometabolic  variables .                                                                                                                              
 
2. Innovation:  The Prescribed Exercise to Reduce Rec idivism After We ight Loss Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (PREVAIL -P) study will 
provide data to support a large- scale  trial on the impact of  aerobic  exercise training  level on weight 
maintenance  and cardiometabolic risk factors. To address the design limitations of previous studies on 
physical activity level and weight maintenance, the PREVAIL- P study will: 1) Directly supervise exercise 
training to confirm exercise- related energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry will be used to enhance the 
accuracy to exercise caloric expenditure). 2) Non -exercise physical activity will be objectively measured during 
the entire intervention through accelerometry . 3) Randomizing participants to study groups after clinically 
significant weight loss.  4) Obtain data on cardiovascular risk fact ors, which have rarely been reported in the 
weight maintenance literature (as much of the focus is solely  on weight).  This R56 application and subsequent 
R01 application will help clarify how aerobic exercise level impacts weight mai ntenance, but also  clinically 
relevant traditional  (brachial blood pressure, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], insulin sens itivity , body fat ) and non -traditional risk 
cardiometabolic risk  factors  (central blood pressure, arterial stiffness, lipoprotein particle size /class and 
fitness ), which have both high clinical and public health relevance. These studies have the potential to impact 
future obesity and physical activity  guidelines for weight maintenance.  An innovative aspect of our design for 
this initial one -year period is that we will: 1) demonstrate efficacy and the utility of our exper imental design and 
2) provide a participant pool  for future studies on physical activity and weight maintenance .  
 
3. Approach:  
 
Rationale for the studies proposed:  Since the R56 mechanism has one year of research funding , a full study  
on weight loss  (12 weeks) and subsequent exercise/physical activity intervention typi[INVESTIGATOR_164546] (9 to 12 months) is not possible. However, we believe that we can obtain the  necessary data for an 
R01 on this topic by: 1)  Demonstrating that the study team can successfully deliver the weight loss component 
of the trial with high achievement of CWL  in overweight/obese participants and subsequent delivery of the 
exercise training intervention (albeit shorter than a full weight maintenance trial). 2) Obtaining a sample of participants that have achieved 7% -10% weight loss at the beginning of the award from participants  completing 
a weight loss program and randomize them to study groups and subsequently provide data to support our experimental approach.  
 
Study 1: To demonstrate the ability of the  study team to deliver the weight loss program producing clinically 
significant weight loss and retention/ adherence of the exercise training intervention:  
 
Brief Description : We will recruit 39  sedentary overweight with elevated metabolic risk (e.g. pre -diabetes, 
hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], elevated waist circumference) and obese (Class I and II) adults (age: 18- 65 yrs., 
BMI: 25 -39.9 kg/m2) from the Pi [INVESTIGATOR_164547], NC area . We selected these criter ia based on the 2013 
AHA/ACC/T OS Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults  [19]. We will exclude 
individuals with diagnosed T2D or significant cardiovascular diseases, and/or those taking medications or have 
conditions that confound weight loss or regain (e.g. hypo/hyperthyroidism  [both medicated or untreated] , 
bariatric surgery, etc.).  Participants  will undergo an OPTIFAST weight loss program and supervised aerobic 
exercis e training (~550 MET min.) for 10  weeks. Participants who obtain clinically significant weight loss (≥7%) 
will be subsequently randomized to 18  weeks of aerobic training consistent with the minimum physical activity 
recommendations (PA-REC) (~550 MET min.) or weight maintenance recommendations  (WM-REC, ~970 MET 
min.). We will evaluate the percentage 
of participants that obtain at least 7% 
weight loss following OPTIFAST treatment, retention rates in the weight 
loss program and the study as whole, 
and adherence to exercise levels of 
the participants.  We will also evaluate 
cardiovascular risk factor changes due 
to the intervention. A flow  diagram  for 
Study 1 is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
Rationale for inclusion/exclusion:  For the inclusion criteria, we made several key decisions in regard to BMI 
levels, postmenopausal women, and those with advanced cardiovascular diseases/type 2 diabetes. We 
decided to include individuals who were overweight (with an indication of increased risk) . This was based on 
the 2013 AHA/ACC/T OS Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults  [19], which 
provided recommendations for those who needed to lose weight . Since the secondary aims of the study focus 
on changes in CVD risk factors, it is necessary to r ecruit a population that has some derangement in these 
factors at baseline. We decided to exclude participants with morbid obesity  (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) to maintain some 
consistency between absolute (kg) and relative weight loss (%) across participants and thes e individuals may 
have joint/gait issues that  may affect long term exercise [52]. In regard to those with established CVD or other 
conditions, the PREVAIL study represents a  preventive strategy to reduce future  CVD events and/or 
metabolic  disease . Therefore, we feel that the examination of the project objectives in higher risk populations 
(e.g. diabetes, secondary prevention CVD , etc.) would be better addressed in a separate study with outcomes 
measures specific to those conditions. We decided to i nclude postmenopausal women in the present 
application since the current weight maintenance guidelines for physical activity do not exclude them or have different exercise recommendat ions based on menopausal status  [1]. Additionally, previous physical activity 
studies evaluating weight maintenance have included postmenopausal women [5, 53- 55].

plans to become pregnant. Currently engaging a diet  or a weight loss program. Do not own 
smartphone for MyFitnessPal and Centrepoint Apps. Non-compliance during screening visits . 
Recruitment: Participants will be recruited in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_164550], NC area through newspaper advertisement,  
targeted Facebook advertisement (based on age and location), emails to East Carolina University (ECU) employees, web- screening from a study website,  targeted direct mailers,  and fly ers in local physician offices. 
Potential participants will be phone screened for major aspects of the study inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(summarized in Table 1). Based on a completed exercise training study in obese adults in our laboratory, we 
had a phone screen to randomization ratio of about 1:5. Therefore, we estimate that it will require [ADDRESS_190973] screened ~250 individual s per year , which is 110% of the contacts needed for the present 
study. Individuals who remain eligible following phone screen will participate in a screening visit  (SV1). The 
PREVAIL -P study coordinator will consent the participant (e.g. provide informati on about the study,  structure of 
the study, s tudy-related procedures, risks/ benefits, etc.).  Individuals interested in the study f ollowing th e 

consent process  will fill out a calendar where they will indicate when they can attend the OPTIFAST weight 
loss class and the required exercise sessions. Participants will also identify potential back -up times for exercise 
training. In addition, the coordinator will interview the participant to assess for major barriers for study 
completion (e.g. distance from home t o the facility, available time for participation, weekly time commitments, 
acceptability for participation in both weight loss and exer cise components of the study). We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_190974] based these 
numbers on the 1 year period of this initial grant application and the budget provided.  
An ActiGraph accelerometer ( Pensacola, FL) will be used to measure steps, moderate to vigorous 
physical activity, and sleep over the course of 7 consecutive days. Participants will also wear an ActivPAL 
accelerometer (PAL technologies, Glasgow, [LOCATION_006])  to measure the amount of sitting time.  Participants will be 
instructed to wear both devices 24 hours per day and to perform  their normal activities . In addition, participants 
will log their food using My Fitness Pal App (described below) for 7 days. Those that demonstrate non-
compliance (<5 days of physical activity monitor wear or fail to monitor food ) will be excluded from  further  
participation.  After 7 days, the participant will return both physical activity monitors and a nurse will draw blood 
to evaluate  for hepatic, renal, hematological, endocrine,  and metabolic function for inclusion/exclusion 
purposes.  Premenopausal women will  take a urine -based pregnancy test to conf irm that they are not pregnant. 
After this, the participant will be scheduled for all outcome measures  (Discussed in S ection 5: Assessments) .  
 
OPTIFAST Weight Loss Program (Initial Weight Loss) : OPTIFAST is a comprehensive medically 
supervised weight loss program that combines lifestyle education and medical monitoring with portion-
controlled, nutritionally -balanced meal replacement products (shakes, bars and soups) . The major goal of the 
OPTIFA ST program is to provide CWL in PREVAIL participants equal to or exceeding 7% of weight loss. While 
involved in the OPTIFAST program, participants will also perform supervised exercise training at ECU.  
Participants will receive a nutrition assessment by a registered licensed dietician/ nutritionist . The active 
weight loss phase of the program consists of [ADDRESS_190975] provides 160 –  170 calories, 14 gm protein (whey, casein, and/or soy ), 3 gm total fat, 
0 trans -fat, ~20 gm carbohydrate, 220 mg sodium, 470 mg potassium, < 1 gm lactose, and 10 –  30% of the 
RDI for vitamins and minerals. Participant nutrient goals are based on BMI. For the purposes of this study (BM I 
range: 25- 39.9 kg/m2), participants will consume approximately [ADDRESS_190976] products per (800- 820 calories 
per day, protein 70g). Measured resting metabolic rate and the exercise level of the supervised exercise 
training (described below) will also be considered when developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] c aloric goals.  At week [ADDRESS_190977] 
the option of eliminating 2 products per day and introducing 350 calories of food from a Healthy Food 
Exchange lis t. During this time, caloric intake usually reaches 1300– [ADDRESS_190978] 
products will be provided by [CONTACT_164584]’ resources to help recruit a generalizable sample and include 
participants from socioeconomic groups who would otherwise could not afford the program.  
Classes will be delivered in a rolling fashion (e.g. participants can enter the classes at any week and go 
through a 10 -week progression), which will allow the assessment schedule to be feasible when participants 
complete the  weight loss component . The clas s typi[INVESTIGATOR_164551] 20- 25 participants  (and will only contain 
research participants)  and will occur once per week. At each class, participants will weigh in, fill out a 
questionnaire from Nestle (regarding the number  of products consumed,  fluid intake, and any physical 
changes ) and receive a didactic topic relevant to weight loss . About [ADDRESS_190979] 7% 
weight loss at the end of the program to progress into the exercise component of the study.  Those who do not 
meet this threshold will be exc luded from further study participation. Data from VIDANT Wellness Center 
indicate that the OPTIFAST program has achieve d CWL (≥7.0%) in 71.4% of patients who enroll in the 
program and 81.3% of those who complete the program . In the present study, we hope to i ncrease the number  
of participants meeting CWL by [CONTACT_164585]  [19, 57, 58]  and only enrolling participants that do not have major ba rriers to treatment .  
 
My Fitness Pal : During the screening and the weight loss component, participants will enter data through a 
mobile App called MyFitnessPal  (MFP).  The App  allows subjects  to track  the nutritional values of their diets, by 
[CONTACT_164586]/or drink . It 
incorporates elements of social cognitive theory, including self -monitoring, goal setting, and feedback. T otal 
daily intake can be viewed in the form  of calori c, nutrient or macronutrient values as  graphs and pie charts, 
with warnings  when preset calorie or nutrient limits are being approached.  Caloric goals will be entered into 
MFP by [CONTACT_164587]. Research staff will also 
check to assure partic ipants are entering data into  MFP at exercise training sessions. In addition, the research 
staff will enter and track compliance to entering MFP data (days entered/day s required), caloric intake, and 
macronutrient composition (% carbohydrates, fat and protein). MFP data will be used to assist  participants in 
tracking dietary intake. Energy intake study  outcomes will be based on food frequency questionnaire.  
 
Exercise training during weight loss component: Participants will come 
to ECU 2 -3 times per  week for supervised aerobic training during the weight 
loss component. Exercise facilitate s a greater magnitude of initial weight 
loss when combined with caloric restriction  [19] and should the refore 
increase the likelihood of obtaining CWL  after the weight loss component . 
The initial exercise level will be 300 MET minutes per week and increased by 50 MET minutes per week until the participant reaches the full amount of 
exercise during the initi al weight loss component of 550 MET minutes  per 
week  (general public health guidelines  [59]) (Table 2) . Similar exercise 
volumes have been used during the initial weight loss phase [5, 60] .  See 
“Exercise training procedure” for further details on exercise sessions .  
 
Rationale for the selection of CWL of ≥7%: The range for CWL is 
generally considered to be 5- 10% [1] and 7% was criteria for weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program 
[61]. Therefore, we believe that our selection of 7% is a good balance between a magnitude of weight loss that 
confers a clinical benefit, but not  so small that after  minimal weight  regain a participant would no longer be 
classified as having CWL (e.g. a participant with an initial weight loss of 5 % and  regain to 4.7%).   
Tracking of weight loss during initial weight loss phase: During the weight loss  component , percent weight 
loss, m agnitude of weight loss, OPTIFAST product data, estimated intake from MFP data , and weight loss 
class/exercise attendance r ates will be entered into a RedCap database. These data will be monitored weekly 
at study meetings using a SAS scrip t that will query  the main RedCap database and automatically generate the 
percent weight loss and other fidelity data of all active participants .  
Randomization after attainment of CWL : Participants  who achieve 7% weight loss  will be randomized to 
exercise levels consistent with  the minimum  physical acti vity recommendations (PA -REC)  or weight 
maintenance recommendations (WM- REC)  for [ADDRESS_190980] .  
 
Rationale for the selected exercise amounts  during exercise component : The rationale for the PA -REC 
group is this is the recommended amount of exercise by [CONTACT_164588] [59, 62] . Based on previous data, this should support improvements  in cardiometabolic risk factors, but 
be less optimal for weight maintenance. For the WM -REC group, we decided to target an exercise volume  
(MET mi n.) consistent with 250  minutes per week , which is consistent the WM guidelines  (200- 300 minutes per 
week)  [1]. We believe this is feasible in a supervised format of  4 to 5 times per week . To inform this  decision, 
we reviewed data from two aerobic t raining studies performed in our laboratory.  Based on expected 
speed/grade of treadmill exercise at week 12 (similar to week 12 of the present proposal), we estimated that 
the average participant would exercise at a speed of 2.6 mph and 3.0% grade. Based on the proposed 
exercise level of the WM -REC group, this participant would exercise about [ADDRESS_190981] fit participants would exercise at 2.4 mph and 2.0%, 
which would amount to 56 m inutes 5 times per week (see derivation below).  
 
Since t he weight m aintenance recommendations (200 -300 min/wk. at moderate intensity) is based 
solely  [1] on moderate intensity physical activity , we had to translat e this for a program composed of aerobic 
exercise training, which can be perfor med at  moderate and vigorous intensities . Therefore, we decided to 
prescribe the exercise levels in the proposed study using MET min.  The derivation of the exercise 
requirements in each study group  are summarized in Table 3. Based on our laboratory data in obese adults , 
we estimated that the average VO 2 max of participants in PREVAIL would be  23.7 ml.kg.min. We further 
estimated that 50% of VO 2 max (de emed moderate intensity ) [63, 64]  would correspond to a  VO 2 during 
exercise  of 11.5 ml.kg.min or 3.3 MET min. Based on this,  it would require 494 MET min.  per week  at moderate 
exercise intensity to correspond with the current minimum physical activity recommendations of 150 min/ week 
of moderate intensity  exercise.  Similarly, we estimated that moderate exercise at 825 MET min. per week 
would correspond to approximately 250 min. per week of moderate intensity exercise for the WM -REC group. 
Next, we needed to factor in the expected adherence rate s for each group . Based on our laboratory’s data in 
obese adults , we expect at least 92%  adherence to MET min.  goals  in the PA -REC group. Due to the  Exercise amount  
Week [ADDRESS_190982] 85% adherence to MET min. goals. 
Therefore, we set the exercise level of the PA-REC group at 550 MET min.  per week and the WM-REC group 
at 970 MET min.  per week. (Table 3).

Table 3. Summary of exercise amounts in weight maintenance phase of PREVAIL  for a participant with a VO 2 max of 23 ml.kg.min 
Exercise training : Participants will be required to attend supervised exercise training sessions during the 
weight loss component  (10 weeks) and following  OPTIFAST treatment ( additional 18 weeks ) at ECU.  We have  
two different exercise training centers located at the FI TT building (located centrally in Greenville) and at the 
(East Carolina Heart Institute, East Greenville area) . Both centers are primarily used for research participants  
and we regularly  train adult s with obesity and CVD risk factors . Study staff will supervise training sessions at 
both sites . The weekly MET min.  requirements will be divided into 3 -5 sessions  per week  depending on group 
requirements/ participant preferences. After the weight loss component , all participants  in Study 1 should be 
accustomed to exercise at 550 M ET min. (since there was supervised exercise training during the weight loss 
component ). Therefore, participants in the PA -REC group will exercise immediately at  the required l evels . The 
WM-REC group, will start exercise at 600 MET min . and increase 75 MET min.  per week until they reach the 
required ex ercise levels of 970 MET min . Every week, staff will weigh participants using a calibrated scale.  
Following a 5- minute warm -up, participants will exercise at the heart ra te range associated with 50%-75% of 
VO 2 max (determined from the baseline exercise test).  Heart rate will be monitored and collected continuously 
(every second) during exercise sessions with Zephyr Bioharness 3 HR monitors (Medtronic  Annapolis, MD ). 
Following each session, heart rate data will be downloaded and mean heart rate will be averaged for database 
entry. Rating of perceived exertion will be collected every 5 minutes of the exercise session. T raining data (e.g. 
mean heart rate, total energy expenditure, rating of perceived exertion, MET  min. exercise d and total exercise 
time) will be entered into the study database after each session.  
To enhance the accuracy of the calculation of exercise- relate d energy expenditure, we will perform 
monthly submaximal exercise tests to directly measure the energy expenditure rate during steady state 
exercise at the same intensity as the training sessions. A correction factor will be obtained (actual energy 
expendi ture/predicted energy expenditure) to account for individual variability in prediction equations for energy 
expenditure. Indirect calorimetry has been used in previous NIH trials evaluating the effects of exercise training on weight to improve the accuracy  of energy expenditure from aerobic exercise training [65 -67]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_164552] (HI -PACE study, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_164553]).  
In the event  that a participant cannot make an exercise session  (e.g. travel, time commitments, 
unexpected life events etc .), we will provide them a Fitbit charge accelerometer to exercise on their own to 
objectively document their exercise. Participants will be instructed to take a walk and use a Fitbit Charge 3  
GPS function (associated with their smart phone) to log their mean heart  rate, time walked and distance. Study 
staff will use this information to estimate the caloric value of this walk  using the ACSM walking equation [68]. 
Although this is not as accurate as supervised exercise in our facility , we felt this is a better alternative to no 
exercise training. We felt this back -up mechanism of exercise was important to maintain as high an energy 
expenditure difference between the PA -REC and the WM -REC groups  as possible and offer flex ibility to 
participants , which is important for both the primary outcomes of the study and overall study retention.    
Exercise training data quality: Exercise adherence will be quantified in the amount of MET min. exercised 
divided by  [CONTACT_164589]. Exercise compliance will be defined as the amount of sessions attended 
divided by [CONTACT_164590]. We will actively monitor exercise adherence /compliance and other 
indicators of intervention fidelity (e.g. target heart  rate compliance, wear rate accelerometers , participant  
morale, progression rate of speed/grade)  on a weekly basis in study meetings . Our database will be designed 
to compute intervention  fidelity measures in real time using a SAS script that queries the R edCap database 
and produces customized intervention fidelity reports . Proactive monitoring of intervention fidelity measures 
has helped us to obtain excellent training adherence in the past (>90%) by [CONTACT_164591]- compliance.  
 
Nutrition management after weight loss component : By [CONTACT_164592] , the 
participants will be transitioned to all self -prepared food. Participants  will be placed on a weight maintenance 
diet based on the resting metabolic rate (assessed by  [CONTACT_164593]) obtained after the weight loss  
component (with the physical activity level of the study group taken into account) . In both study groups, 
participants will be provided a caloric range to support maintenance and encouraged to follow the 2010- 2015 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans [69] , which includes consuming less than [ADDRESS_190983]. Matarese (Ph.D., R.D.) will use resting metabolic rate (RMR)  data to prescribe caloric ranges.   
 
Behavioral management of participants in exercise groups: Several strategies will be utilized to promote 
high exercise adherence. E xtensive pre- screening will be performed inclusive of  run-in visits ( evaluation of  
available time to exercise, exercise calendars, assessment of time commitments) to screen -out partici pants 
with very high drop-out risk. We will provide monthly progress reports to maintain intrinsic motivation for 
exercise (e.g. attendance rate, changes in speeds/grade, miles walked, etc.).  Other  strategies for reduci ng 
attrition/ poor adherence will be modeled after the retention recommendations provided by [CONTACT_18121] [70].  
We will monitor adherence weekly  in study meetings. Participants with adherence levels <75% or that 
display major warning signs for low adherence (e.g. frequent rescheduling, missed sessions, low m orale) will 
meet with  the research coordinator to problem -solve the causes of poor adherenc e and to c reate a plan to 
improve adherence . If adherence levels remain less <75% or issues related to the low adherence remain 
unresolved, the participant will be referred for motivational enhancement therapy (i.e.  motivational interviewing) 
to increase intrinsic motivation for exercise  which will be performed at the same time of the training sessions to 
not increase participant burden.  Motivational enhancement therapy  [71] will be provided by a doctoral student 
in clinical health psychology trained in the administration of motivational Interviewing. N umerous reviews and 
meta -analyses  support that  motivational interviewing is effective at promoting and maintaining  health behavior 
change, including exercise [72] . Should adherence remain low or deteriorate further, booster motivational 
interviewing sessions wil l be employed. If the previous methods are not effective or drop- out ris k is determined 
to be especially  high, the participant will be referred to the lead behaviorist of the trial (Robert Carels, Ph.D. ). 
 
Tracking of changes in diet and non- exercise physical activity:  Non-exercise physical activity will be 
tracked using a GT9X Link accelerometer  (ActiGraph,  Pensacola, FL) . Devices will be blinded  using the 
ActiG raph software, so participants will not be able to see thei r data. During exercise training sessions , 
accelerometers  will be removed from participants to avoid mixing exercise and non -exercise physical 
activity data . Recharging of the device (14-day battery life)  will be performed during the exercise session by 
[CONTACT_164594]. Study s taff will use ActiG raph’s  database program  (Centrepoint , 
Pensacola, FL) to monitor and download non-exercise physical activity data (e.g. steps, moderate to vigorous 
physical activity , sleep , wear/non- wear rates ). The Centrepoint program will update in our database using an 
app in the participants’ mobile device or can be upl oaded manually at our facility . Our research team  has used 
accelerometers to monitor  non-exercise phys ical activity in a similar manner  with excellent device wear 
compliance in a completed AHA  funded  study  (~96%) and an on- going NIH study ( ~97%) . Block  food 
frequency questionnaires  [73] will be used to  measure energy intake at each study time point.   
 4. Study 2:  The major goal of  Study [ADDRESS_190984] the full weight loss intervention p roposed in the R01 ([ADDRESS_190985] treatment and subsequent randomization to exercise for 36 weeks [48 total weeks]), especially 
when considering anticipated study start -up and recruitment time. Therefore, our plan is to recruit [ADDRESS_190986] program (<[ADDRESS_190987] 7% weight loss) and exercise participants  
for 36 weeks. VIDANT Health documents each participant’s BM I and weight at the beginning of the program. 
Therefore, we can determine the percent weight loss retrospectively and whether the participant was Table 4 . Schedule of assessments Study 1  Baseline  Weight loss

training at 550 MET min.  per week  to equate the exercise volume of the WM -REC group. All exercise training 
sessions methodology will be t he same as described for S tudy 1. In brief, participants will perform exercise 
training 3- 5 times per week dependent on group assignment. The  aerobic  exercise intensity will be the heart 
rate associated with 50% -75% VO [ADDRESS_190992] ivity (devices will be removed during exercise sessions ). 
Exercise compliance and adherence will be monitored in all research participants.  
Behavioral management/nutritional management:  Behavioral and nutritional management of participants 
will be the same p rocedures as described in Study 1.  
5. Assessments: Methodology for primary and secondary measurements are shown below. Train schedules 
for both the S tudy 1 and  Study 2 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 (shown above) , respectively.   
 
Primary Outcome - Change in Weight :  The primary outcome measure of the PREVAIL study is change in 
weight  (as a continuous variable) after obtaining clinically significant we ight loss  to follow- up of the intervention. 
Weight will be evaluated  using a calibrated scale to the nearest tenth of kg with the participant  in a fasted state  
(12 hours) , wearing only a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164554].  
Secondary measures: Secondary measures will be collected  at all 3 assessment points  with the exception of 
accelerometry /doubly labeled water (obtained prior to  each assessment  period) . We specifically chose 
cardiometabolic risk factors which have been shown in the literature to  improve with weight loss, exercise 
training (independent of weight loss), or a combination of both.  The rationale f or this is that it is possible 
that even in the presence of weight regain after CWL, aerobic  training may attenuate the deleterious effect  on 
cardiometabolic risk factors . Thus, we will evaluate the effect of the proposed intervention on traditional (lipid 
concentrations,  brachial  systolic/diastolic blood pressure), non-traditional ( fitness, lipoprotein particles size and 
subclass , c-reactive protein, pulse wave velocity , augmentation index , central blood pressure)  CVD risk factors 
and a type 2 diabetes risk factor  (insulin sensitivity ). In addition, we wil l obtain total energy  expenditure, 
sedentary behavior, non -exercise  physical activity, energy  intake and macro /micro nutrient information to 
inform energy balance apart from exercise training. We will also obtain quality of life (QOL)  via the SF- [ADDRESS_190993] of the intervention. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_164555] [74, 75] , fat loss  [75] and c-reactive protein [76] and lipoprotein  particle  size [75]. Assessments will 
be performed approximately  [ADDRESS_190994] exercise session.  
Categorical w eight maintenance:  We will compare the percentage of individuals in each group that are able 
to maintain at least  3% of the initial weight loss [1]  
Oral glucose tolerance test:  An intravenous (IV) li ne will be placed in an antecubital vein for blood draw 
purposes and will remai n there throughout the testing.  A resting fasting blood sample will be drawn after which, 
participants will drink a sugar solution consisting of 75 grams of glucose. Additional blood samples will be 
drawn 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after drinking the glucose beverage. Samples wil l be archived  at -80°C 
until sample analysis.  Insulin AUC and glucose AUC will be determined following sample analysis.  Insulin 
sensitivi ty will be estimated using the M atsuda index  [77]. At baseline, OGTT measurements will occur prior to 
exercise testing to  avoid confounding these measurements with acute exercise. At follow -up, OGTT will occur 
[ADDRESS_190995]: A modified Balke treadmill  (Trackmaster 425, C arefusion, Newton Kansas)  protocol  
will be used  to determine cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] , and the  appropriate heart rate range for aerobic exercise 
training. Participants will walk at an initial speed of 2.0 m ph with 0% grade for the first 2 minutes after which the 
treadmill speed will increas e to 3.0 mph for the next 2  minutes. Treadmill grade w ill be increased by 2.5% 
every 2  minutes until volitional exhaustion. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_22324] (VO 2, CO 2) and ventilation will be measured 
continuously using a True Max 2400 Metabolic Measurement Cart (Parvomedics, Salt Lake City , Utah).  A 
physician will be present to supervise exercise testing at all study assessment points.  The electrocardiogram 
during the  baseline exercise test  will be cleared by a physician prior to  randomization to study groups.  
Pulse wave velocity and Aortic blood pressure parameters : Participants will refrain from large meals and 
caffeine for at least [ADDRESS_190996] 1 2 hours. 
Testing will occur  in a quiet temperature controlled room [78]. Carotid to femoral  pulse wave velocity  (PWV)  
and aortic blood pressure parameters will be measured using a SphygmoCor  XCEL  (Itasca, IL) .  PWV will be 
obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] a [ADDRESS_190997]. PWV parameters will be obtained in duplicate in concert 
with current guidelines [78] . Aortic blood pressure parameters ( brachial blood pressure, aortic  blood pressure, 
augmentation index)  will be o btained in the seated position after a [ADDRESS_190998].  
Dietary data:  FFQ questionnaire data will be assessed using the NutritionQuest (Berkley Inc.) data -on-
demand system, which will facilitate immediate scoring and estimation of caloric and macronutrient intake.  
Other secondary outcomes:  Body composition will be measured  using d ual energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DEXA). Waist circumference will be evaluated with a gulick  tape measure  at the natural waist. Quality of life  
will be measured by [CONTACT_164596] (SF- 36) [79]. Blood glucose, insulin,  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , c-reactive protein,  
and lipoprotein particle size/class will be measured through standard analytical techniques. Resting metabolic 
rate (RMR) will be assessed via indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood in the  fasted state and in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251].  RMR data will be collected for  [ADDRESS_190999] . An ActivPAL  accelerometer will be 
worn for 7 days to assess time spent sitting/sta nding and total energy expenditure.  
 
6. Data management : Study dat a will be stored in a Red Cap © database  [80]. The database will be designed 
to develop recruitment reports (e.g. total contacts, reasons  for exclusion during screening, screen to 
randomization ratio for recruiting projections ), weight loss program data (% weight loss, class attendance, etc.) 
and exercise traini ng data (e.g. exercise adherence, heart rate compliance) and outcome data. Recruiting, 
weight loss program and exercise  training data reports will be reviewed to monitor the intervention fidelity . 
 
7. Statistical Design: Primary analysis will first check for baseline differences between the groups to help 
determine possible covariates that  need to be taken into account.  Intent to treat analysis will be conducted first 
followed by [CONTACT_164597] (>75%) . The analysis for the primary aim  
(weight change)  will be a mixed effect linear model with change in weight as the outcome. In brief summary, 
this model will use the baseline,  weight loss midpoint, and the follow -up weights all awhile accounting for the 
baseline covariates as well as the weekly weight changes.  Results will be reported as least square means  with 
t-test used to test for differences both between and within groups.  Changes in cardiovascular risk factors will 
be evaluated in a similar manner as weight , with mixed effect linear models.  Partic ular focus will be given to 
both the baseline changes and the changes after the clinically significant weight loss.  Both set of covariates will 
be used with variable selection methodology  to determine if there is a set of covariates that can predict the 
outcome of the weight maintenance phase . To evaluate categorical differenc es between groups in regards 
weight maintenance, we will use a mixed effect logistic model to model the probability of achieving weight 
maintenance, with results presented as adjusted odds ratios.  
 
8. Preliminary data and experience  of the study  team : Collectively, 
the study  team  has significant experience implement ing weight loss and 
exercise training interventions . VIDANT Wellness Center has  
documented success in achieving 7% weight loss (71% of enrolled 
participants, 81% of participant completing the program ). [CONTACT_164610] 
will oversee the delivery of the nutritional intervention. She has 
experience in nutritional interventions as she was the C o-PI [CONTACT_4007] a recently 
completed multi -center study sponsored by [CONTACT_69735] (N=  652). In addition,  
she uses OPTIFAST treatment within her cli nical practice and both Drs. 
Matarese and Pori es have a completed multicenter  randomized trial 
evaluating OPTIFAST weight loss treatment  [81]. [CONTACT_164611] is the 
psychology departments’ director of clinical training.  He has us ed 
motivational interviewing for weight control in obese populations  [82] and 
has performed both weight loss and maintenance interventions  [82-89]. 
His role on the present study will be to provide behavioral support to 
participants demonstrating risk of drop -out or low adherence.  [CONTACT_164612] will be the medical investigator and has served this role on studies 
using an OPTIFAST diet and bariatric surgery . [CONTACT_164613] rby [CONTACT_9195] 
(expertise in energy balance) will serve a s a consultant on the grant .  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Houmard have a history implementing supervised 
exercise studies (Table 5). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16884]  44 publications in exercise training 
and CVD /T2DM  risk factors. He  is a former NIDDK T -32 postdoctoral fellow in Preventive Medicine

Figure 4A shows the cha nge in HOMA -IR in overweight/ obese women participating in 6 months of aerobic 
training. Those that achieved greater than 5% weight loss (and even 3% weight loss) had greater reductions in

HOMA -IR compared to those that did not lose weight (<3%). Figure 4B shows that insulin sensitivity 
(measured via an intravenous glucos e tolerance test) in overweight/ obese adults  participating in 8 months of 
aerobic training. While insulin se nsitivity was improved in participants that did not lose weight (<3% weight 
loss), a greater improvement in insulin  sensitivity was observed in participants who achieved at least 3% 
weight loss . In the same paper, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_164557] a ssociated with improvements in 
triglycerides, non -HDL cholesterol, LDL particle size, total LDL particles  and HDL partic le size  compared to 
those that do not lose weight  [75]. These  results informed incorporating these variables in this proposal.

9. Study Timeline : The timeline  of PREVAIL -P is shown in Table [ADDRESS_191003] art-up wi ll occur during month 1 
and 2 of the grant . The start -up will include the creation of a manual of procedures (MOP) , development of 
standard operating procedures (SO Ps), training of all research staff on procedures/visits , mock run -throughs of 
clinical visits and exercise training methodology . In addition, we will develop a custom -made R edCap database 
to include all study outcome measurements, tracking of recruitment and creation database reports for 
monitoring variables suggestive of the overall intervention fidelity. We plan to begin recruitment of both Study [ADDRESS_191004]. 
Lastly, we plan to complete data collection by [CONTACT_2671] 
11
th month of the study after 
which the research team will then verify study data, perform 
data cleaning/statistical 
analyses and write/submit the 
primary outcomes paper.  
10. Rigor and Reproducibility:  Most  blood analyses will utilize LabCorp Inc ., which has  a CLIA certification 
for accuracy in  methods of  analysis . Gas calibration will occur prior to submaximal or maximal indirect 
calorimetry. Current guidelines will be followed for arterial stiffness measures procedures  and the machine will 
be calibrated annually. Weight will be measured on a calibrated scale in the fasted state. Glucose and insulin from OGTT samples will be measured in duplicate. During study start -up, all procedures  and methods will be 
documented in the MOP and investigators will approve the MOP before the ini tiation of data collection.  
11. Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]: 1) Low adherence and sufficient separation between exercise groups : Obtaining high 
adherence and adequate differences  in the exercise levels are critical to the success of the study. The 
investigative team has demonstrated the ability to implement exercise training with excellent adherence to the 
6-month time point  (>90%)  based on our c urrent AHA /NIH funded exercise trial s. We have established several 
safeguards to reduce the enrollment of participants with high drop- out risk b y evaluating for indicators  of low

quickly intervene on participants who  are not meeting exercise goals . NIH R01s using similar procedures  have 
obtained high exercise adherence (>90%)  and retention (>85%)  [33, 99, 100] .  2) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_164565] :  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a strong hist ory of  publication in exercise amount and CVD risk factors,  and has 
obtained significant research funding as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a junior investigator including a career development grant  
from the AHA  and a R03 fro m NIDDK  (both exercise training interventions) . While the PI [INVESTIGATOR_164566], Joseph  Houmard ( co-investigator)  has substantial experience in 
NIH sponsored exercise trials, and will provide senior mentorship to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_164567] -related issues  
(along with the other co -investigators ). Drs. Pories and Matarese  are Co -PIs of a published 52-week  
OPTIFAST diet study  [81]. [CONTACT_56559]  will visit ECU during st udy start -up and the intervention period to assist 
with MOP  development and early protocol issues  (see letters of support).  3) Failure to recruit : We are confident 
that we can recruit the proposed study as described. To assure that we are able to meet our recr uitment goals, 
we have budgeted ($7,000 dollars) for recruit ment material and for a 20 hour a week  staff member who will 
perform  recruiting calls after hours  (5PM)  and during weekends  during the recruit ment phase of the study .  
    
12. Alternative approaches : We considered using the exercise volume corresponding to 300 minutes per 
week for the exercise prescription in the WM -REC group (which is the maximum  value recommended by [CONTACT_164601]), but this may be burdensome to participants with very low fitness, who would 
have to come more than [ADDRESS_191005] very long exercise sessions (>60 mins. per 
session ). Therefore , we felt that the selection of targeting the exercise volume associated with [ADDRESS_191006] choice to support high retention 
and adherence to the exercise levels in the WM -REC group.  
 
13. Limitations : An important  limitation is  the PREVAIL -P study will occur  under  laboratory conditions  in which 
staff will ensure  high compliance to the amount of  exercise . Thus, the study is not designed to determine 
methods of motivating participants to achieve these exercise levels in a real-life setting , which represents an  
important research question. However , given the lack of data of prospective trials in this area  and that these 
recommendations have been disseminated , we feel that it is necessary to  first determine the effects of 
different exercise levels on weight maintenance and cardiometabolic  risk factors as this  may better inform how 
to properly design future  effectiveness studies. Another limitation is that there are many  nutritional and physical 
activity interventions to induce CWL . Thus,  the proposed study cannot address whether  an interaction effect  
exists between the weight loss regimen utilized and magnitude of weight maintenance . Due to 1- year of 
funding in the present mechanism, we cannot evaluate the impact of the intervention on long- term weight  loss 
outcomes . However, we plan to study the cohort of participants within PREVAIL- P and the subsequent R01 
(future grants  applications ) to begin to address long term weight loss .  
 
14. Conclusion:  The PREVAIL -P study will provide valuable data  to inform the design of  an R01 on the impact 
of exercise level on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors after C WL. We are confident that both projects 
will demonstrate that are approach is robust and will justify further funding of this clinical trial. Study  [ADDRESS_191007] of 
exercise training level on weight, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors directly address es 
limitations in th is research area identified by a recent  ACSM position stand  [1] and an NIH sponsored working 
group [101]  on weight maintenance by [CONTACT_164602] a clinically significant weight 
loss, prospectively measuring exercise training amount ( supervised exercise) , non-exerci se physical activity 
(objective physical activity monitors) throughout the entire  intervention. The results of the PREVAIL study will 
have high clinical implications given the high rates of regain following  weight loss treatment and further inform 
future  physical activity guidelines on weight loss maintenance. If fun ded, subsequent renewals of the R01 
application could aim at following these cohorts to examine long- term weight loss, incorporating apps to 
increase physical activity levels in weight maintenance or  determine the effect of other exercise programs  after 
CWL  (e.g. intensity, modality, etc.). We believe the r esults of this R56 proposal and subsequent R01 proposal  
have the potential to be published in a top tier medical or obesity journal and will be of great interest to 
physicians, clinicians and public health professionals treating overweight and obese adults .

1.1 Preface  
Achieving clinically significant weight loss (CWL) (5- 10%) has been shown to improve important 
cardiometabolic risk factors in obese adults (e.g. insulin sensitivity, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], systemic inflammation, 
blood pressure). However, only 20% of individuals ac hieve weight loss maintenance and even mild weight 
regain (2 -6%) is associated with regression of risk factors toward pre- weight loss levels. Obtaining high 
amounts of physical activity (PA) are critical for successful weight loss maintenance. The Pr escrib ed 
Exercise to Reduce Recidi vism After We ight Loss pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (PREVAIL -P) study will evaluate the effect of 
aerobic exercise training amount on weight maintenance following CWL in obese (BMI: 25- 40 kg/m2) men 
and women ages [ADDRESS_191024] 7% from baseline weight will be subsequently randomized to levels of aerobic training consistent with half of physical activity recommendations (PA -REC)  
or weight maintenance recommendations (WM -REC) group for  [ADDRESS_191025] 7% weight loss will be randomized to either the PA -REC g roup or 
the WM -REC group for the next [ADDRESS_191026] program (achievement of clinically significant weight loss) to follow -up. 
Secondary measures include the proportion of participants achieving weight maintenance, changes in clinically relevant ca rdiometabolic risk factors (insulin sensitivity, arterial stiffness, fitness, fat mass, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
lipoprotein particle size and c -reactive protein), and energy intake between study groups.

compared to participants in the physical  activity recommendations (PA -REC ) group .  
1.[ADDRESS_191028] weight maintenance and 
cardiovascular risk factors.  
1.3.1  Aim 1  
To demonstrate the efficacy of the weight loss program in producing CWL and retention/ adherence of the 
exercise inter venti on. Overweight and obese adults (N=39) will participate in an OPTIFAST weight loss 
program and supervised aerobic exercise training (~550 MET min. per week.) for 10 weeks. Participants 
who obtain CWL will be subsequently  randomized to 16 weeks of aerobic training consistent with the 
minimum physical activity recommendations (~550 MET min per week.) or weight maintenance guidelines 
(~970 MET min per week). We will evaluate the percentage of participants that obtain at leas t 7% weight 
loss following OPTIFAST treatment, retention rates in the weight loss program, adherence to exercise levels, and changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in response to the intervention.  
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_191029] the hypothesis that exercise levels consistent with weight maintenance recommendations leads 
to greater weight maintenance after CWL compared to the minimum physical activity recommendation 
levels. Overweight and obese adults (N=30) enrolled in VIDANT health’s OPTIFAST program and have 
achieved at least 7% weight loss will be randomized to 36 weeks of aerobic exercise training consistent 
with the minimum public health guidelines for physical activity (~550 MET min. per week.) or weight 
maintenance levels (~970 MET min per week). We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on weight 
(primary) as well as main secondary measures (e.g. body fat, visceral fat, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoprotein particles 
size/class, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation, fitness, and quality of 
life). The aforementioned cardiometabolic risk factors were selected because they can be improved 
specifically by [CONTACT_164583].  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
SAP version Final: 06/01/[ADDRESS_191030] classified them as secondary and exploratory outcomes. These additional outcomes are 
presented below and are referenced in the methods and herein. They are not, however, devel oped to the 
same extent as the P rimary Aims . 
1.4.1  Initial weekly wei ght loss  
To examine the baseline factors  of the participant  achieving the clinically significant weight loss of 7% in the 
first 12 weeks of the study  (Study 1 only)  
1.4.[ADDRESS_191031] a  mediating/moderating the effect on 
weight maintenance and cardiovascular risk factors . Association between weight loss, weight maintenance, 
and energy expenditure   
 
To determine if initial weight loss  and weight maintenance in the second phase is related to energy 
expenditure.  
[ADDRESS_191032] program in VIDANT and achieve 
a 7% weight loss will be randomized exercise groups (36 weeks afterwards).  Study 2 will use a parallel arm 
design with two intervention arms.  Primary  outcomes in study 2 will be performed at 0,18, and 36 weeks.   
2.1 Sample  
The inclusion criteria for a participant  include the following:  
• The ages of 18- 65,  
• BMI between 25.0- 39.9 kg/m2, 
• Current sedentary status  (<2 days per week of exercise)  
• Physically capable of exercise 
2.2 Randomization  
After initial weight loss  (in both Study 1 and S tudy 2), participants who achieve 7% weight loss in the 
OPTIFAST program will be randomized to exercise levels consistent with physical activity 
recommendations (PA -REC)  or weight maintenance recommendations (WM -REC) . The randomization for 
the proposed study will be generated by [CONTACT_15282], who will also be responsible for randomizing participants to study groups. No other research staff (including the PI) will have access to the 
study randomization. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_164604] ( overweight, Class I and Class II) 
and gender to assure equal distribution to study groups.  
2.3 Sample size and study power  
The goal of the PREVAIL- P study is to provide feasibility of the weight loss intervention/subsequent 
exercise (Study 1) and power primary and secondary variables for a definitive trial (Study 2). Thus, this R56 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
SAP version Final: 06/01/[ADDRESS_191033] 80% power.  Based on Cocks, we will need at least 9% of the original sample to obtain 
proper estimates.  This initial percent is doubled to 18% to account for the increased complexity as 
compared to t he instance described by [CONTACT_164605].  
2.3.1   Aim 1  
 
To demonstrate the efficacy of the weight loss program in producing CWL and retention/ adherence of the 
exercise inter venti on. Overweight and obese adults (N=39) will participate in an OPTIFAST weight loss 
program and supervised aerobic exercise training (~550 MET min. per week.) for 10 weeks. Participants 
who obtain CWL will be subsequently randomized to 16 weeks of aerobic training consistent with the 
minimum physical activity recommendations (~550 MET min per week.) or weight maintenance guidelines 
(~970 MET min per week). We will evaluate the percentage of participants that obtain at least 7% weight 
loss following OPTIFAST treatment, retention rates in the weight loss program, adherence to exercise 
levels, and changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in response to the intervention.  
 
The goal of this aim is to demonstrate feasibility of the research team to successful ly deliver the weight loss 
program and  subsequent  exercise training.  We estimate that we can obtain at least 76.0% of the 
participants to achieve clinically significant weight loss. Thus, we expect at least [ADDRESS_191034] to complete 90% of the participants who have obtained significant weight loss.  
 
2.3.2  We will evaluate several metrics of feasibility from Study 1 including the percent of 
participants meeting the weight loss goal of 7%, attendance of the weight loss classes, 
attendance at exercise classes, adherence to exercise goals during (MET minutes exercised vs. MET minutes required). 
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_191035] the hypothesis that exercise levels consistent with weight maintenance recommendations leads to 
greater weight maintenance after CWL compared to the minimum physical activity recommendation levels. Overweig ht and obese adults (N=30) enrolled in VIDANT health’s OPTIFAST program and have achieved 
at least 7% weight loss will be randomized to 36 weeks of aerobic exercise training consistent with the minimum public health guidelines for physical activity (~550 M ET min. per week.) or weight maintenance 
levels (~970 MET min per week). We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on weight (primary) as well as main secondary measures (e.g. body fat, visceral fat, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoprotein particles size/class, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation, fitness, and quality of life).

3 STATISTICAL PRINCIPALS  
Analyses will use SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) . The primary methodology will be linear mixed 
effect models.  Repeated effects will account for the patient ’s correlations over time . Further details about the 
covariance structures is given below. Results will be given in the form of both the raw beta coef ficient when 
the predictor is continuous and as least square means when the predictor is categorical. Overall F -tests will 
be done for sets of beta coefficients that correspond to the same groupi[INVESTIGATOR_164572] ( i.e. gender or race 
interactions ). When the overall F- test is significant, pairwise T -test will be investigated, with alpha adjusted 
for the number of comparisons. Whenever possible visualization of these results will be given by [CONTACT_164606].  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
SAP version Final: 06/01/2018 Page 7 of 11 3.1 Distributional assumptions  
Preliminary statistical testing will be performed to investigate homoscedasticity and  normality of model 
residuals . The Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]– Wilk test  will be used to test for normality of  residuals  for outcomes modeled with a 
linear mixed model. For non- normal data, a log or square root transformation will be applied and retested. If 
these transformed data again indicate non- normality , non-parametric tests will be used. The Mann- Whitney 
U test  will be t he primary non- parametric test. This test uses the sum of the ranks to determine if the samples 
are from the same distribution. Due to the large number of possible ties in the data, the Mann- Whitney U test 
may not be the best test. In such  situations, the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test will be used. This test is based on 
the largest difference in the empi[INVESTIGATOR_164573]. As such, it is not as sensitive to 
ties in the data.

3.2.2  Secondary  
For Study 1, s econdary measures will be collected at all 3 assessment points with the exception of 
accelerometetry (obtained prior to each assessment period). We specifically chose cardiometabolic risk factors which have been shown in the literature to improve with weight loss, exercise training (independent 
of weight loss), or a combination of both. The rationale for this is that it is possible that even in the presence 
of weight recidivism, that adherent exercise training may attenuate the deleterious effect of weight regain on 
cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, we will evaluate the effect of the proposed intervention on traditional (lipid 
concentrations, brachial systolic/diastolic blood pressure), non- traditional (fitness, lipoprotein particles size, 
c-reactive protein, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central blood pressure) CVD risk factors as well 
as a type 2 diabetes risk factor (insulin sensitivity), total energy expenditure, energy intake and quality of li fe. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_164575] [6], weight/fat loss and c -reactive protein 
[7] and lipoprotein particle size. Quality of life (QOL) will be measured via the SF- 36 questionnaire. QOL 
improves with aerobic training in a dose response manner [8]  and also improves with weight loss [9-11], and 
thus may vary between groups in the present proposal.  
For Study 2, secondary measures will be assessed at baseline and follow -up (with the exception of 
weight and body composition which will also be assessed at mid- intervention). Covariance structures  
The variance- covariance structure of the repeated effects will be dependent on the variability among all 
participants. A preliminary test will be conducted to assess significance of the homogeneity of variances  [10-
12] for between treatment arm  differences. The within -patient  variability will be modeled  with an  unstructured 
covariance matrix . Correlation patterns will be assessed with Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to make 
final selections.  
3.3 Covariates  
Covariates  in the generalized linear mixed  model will include, but not limited to the follow:  
• time point  
• time point *treatment interaction  
• age 
• gender  
• initial weight  
• race/ethnicity  
• socioeconomic status  
Other  potential  covariates may include using the baseline measures of several of the primary and secondary 
outcomes .   
Variable selection in select  linear models will be determined though model fit statistics such as AIC . 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
SAP version Final: 06/01/[ADDRESS_191038] the relationship between weight gain and the 
intervention  [13]. Mediation analyses will be applied us ing both structural mean models  and principal 
stratification  [14]. Preacher and Hayes bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_63980], as well as the Sobel test, will be used to test 
potential mediations of the outcomes.  The advantage of using the Preacher and Hayes bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_164576].  Mediation will 
be done using the CALIS procedure in SAS along with the MIXED procedure and IML for the bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_164577].   
We will use the Baron and Kenny method and bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_164578]. A statistically 
significant interaction will define age as a moderator. This interaction will only be removed from the model 
when not statistically significant.  
While any of the covariates could be potential mediator or  moderators, we only investigate a subset of 
these variables.  Weight change will be the primary variables of interest.    
3.[ADDRESS_191039] differences between each subgroup, these 
results will be invaluable by [CONTACT_164607] .  
3.6 Missing data  
Data may be missing because participants drop out or fail to complete an instrument or assessment. Three 
patterns of missing data will be considered: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random 
(MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). Data are M CAR if events that lead to all missing values are 
independent of both the observed and missing values. Data are MAR if the events depend on the observed 
values but are independent of the missing values. If the missing data mechanism depends on specific reasons related to the missing data themselves, then the values are MNAR.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate whether different analyses under different assumptions provide robust inferences. Four analyses will be used: 1) a mixed effects l inear model for repeated measures 
that makes use of all data irrespective of missing data; 2) completers analysis with participants who have 
complete data on the primary outcomes ; 3) mixed effects linear time trend model with random coefficients; 
and 4) multiple imputation analysis  using the MCMC methods . The robustness of the inferential findings to 
the analytic methods will be assessed by [CONTACT_164608].  
3.[ADDRESS_191040]. For all 
outcomes, all continuous variables will be summarized using n (non -missing sample size), mean, standard 
deviation (SD), standard errors (SE), correlations (R), minimum (Mi n), maximum (Max), and coefficient of 
variation (CV). The frequency and percentages (based on the non -missing sample size) of observed levels 
will be reported for all categorical measures, unless otherwise specified.  
 
All tables, figures and data listings  will be presented in portrait orientation, unless landscape orientation 
suggests that the information is easier to view. All titles will be centered on a page. For tables, sample sizes 
for each treatment group will be presented as totals in the column header (N=xx), where appropriate. 
Sample sizes shown with summary statistics are the number (n) of patients with non -missi ng values. 
Summaries for categorical variables will include only categories that patients had a response in. Percentages corresponding to  null categories (cells) will be suppressed.  
3.[ADDRESS_191041] (xx.x%). If percentages are reported as integers, percentages greater 
than 0% but <1% will be reported as <1%, whereas percentages greater than 99% but <100% will be reported 
as >99%. A percen tage of 100% will be reported as 100%. No value of 0% will be reported. Any computation

value to three decimal places with a leading zero (0.001).  P-values <0.001 will be reported as “<0.001”.   
3.[ADDRESS_191042] models will use the 
outcome  as the response for the primary outcomes .  Full details about each set of models is given in 
Section 3.  
4.1 Analysis Populations 
The primary statistical analyses will rely on intent -to-treat (ITT) methodology, with all patients’  data included 
who have a measurement  at baseline and follow -up. A per protocol analysis will also be conducted as a 
secondary analysis . 
4.2 Demographic and Baseline Variables  
These data will include (but are not limited to) height, weight, BMI, body composition, and blood pressure 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], fitness, sitting behavior, total energy expenditure, accelerometers results, food frequency 
questionnaire, and SF -36. F-tests followed up by [CONTACT_164609] T-tests and chi -squared test will be used to 
determine if any differences occur between groups. Baseline variables for all psychological, behavioral, and physical measures will also be investigated to ensure a random and balance sample.  
4.3 Analyses of the primary aims  
4.3.1  Aim  1 
4.3.2  To demonstrate the efficacy of the weight loss program in producing CWL and 
retention/ adherence of the exercise inter venti on. Aim  2 
Although the primary purpose of the present study is to evaluate feasibility/efficacy of the weight loss 
intervention/exercise (Study 1) and powering weight maintenance variables (Study 2). We will still evaluate 
the impact of the intervention outcome vari ables. For both Study 1 and Study 2, weight will be the primary 
outcomes measure and the other cardiometabolc variables will be considered secondary outcomes. In 
addition, the percent of participants maintain weight (categorical analysis) will also be cons idered a 
secondary endpoint.  
Primary outcome: To determine the magnitude of weight maintenance (as a continuous variable) in 
response to different levels of exercise training after CWL   
 
Initial results will be based on a linear mixed effect model with the change scores as the outcome. The 
model will use random effects to account for the correlation in a participant over time.  Results from this 
model will be reported as least square means, with p- values based on t -tests.  Two different sets of models 
will be used.  The first set of models will contain only treatment, while the second is will also contain the 
covariates based on the model selection process. Pairwise post -hoc comparisons of the category variables 
will be corrected for multiple comparisons wi ll be made when necessary.  
Secondary outcomes:  
 
To determine the percentage of individuals (as a categorical variable) who are able to maintain weight loss 
maintenance in response to different levels of exercise training after CWL  
 
Logistic mixed effect model with the probability of achieving weight maintenance, with results presented as 
adjusted odds ratios. The model will use random effects to account for the weight differences at baseline.  
Results from this model will be reported  as odd ratios, with p- values based on Chi -squared statistics.  Two 
different sets of models will be used. The first set of models will contain only treatment, while the second is

SAP version Final: 06/01/[ADDRESS_191043] -hoc comparisons of 
the category variables will be corrected for multiple comparisons will be made when necessary. To 
determine the change in clinically relevant cardiovascular risk factors in response to different levels of 
exercise training after CWL  
 
Models similar to the ones used in Aim 1 will be used here as well. Outcomes for this aim include both 
traditional (lipid concentrations, brachial systolic/diastolic blood pressure), non- traditional (fitness, 
lipoprotein particles size, c -reactive pro tein, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central blood 
pressure) CVD risk factors as well as a type 2 diabetes risk factor (insulin sensitivity), total energy 
expenditure, energy intake and quality of life.  
4.[ADDRESS_191044] predicts the weight at week 10 .  
4.4.2  Mediator and moderator analyses  
Baseli ne covariates will be tested as both mediating/moderating effects on weight maintenance and 
cardiovascular risk factors . See section 3.[ADDRESS_191045] alternative model will use the baseline time in addition to the follow -up times. This model allows for 
testing of change in group means over time as opposed to the primary model that tests individual change 
over time. The second alternative model will use only the follow -up times and with initial time as a 
covariate. This model assumes that baseline group means are equal and the follow -up values are adjusted 
for this overall baseline value.  Comparisons and contrasts will be made between all three model for similar 
tests when possible.

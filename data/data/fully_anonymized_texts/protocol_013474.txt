1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the usage and acceptability of the Soberlink’s blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) unit in collaboration  with  Aware  treatment to assess increased  sobriety within patients 
suffering from  alcohol use disorder (AUD).   
The specific AIMS will be: 
1)To determine the effectiveness of Soberlink’s  ability  to increase  abstinence 
2)To evaluate the impact  of Soberlink’s device on the participant based on their  quality  of health and 
sobriety.
3)To evaluate the extent  to which need  for higher levels of follow-up care and treatment  is reduced  for 
individuals who  have had access to the Soberlink  device.
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
The duration of the time of the study  will be two years to complete.  This  will include  (as seen on Figure 1) 
time for IRB approval and recruitment, randomization and completion the study,  follow-up and lastly analysis 
with dissemination.

3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Alcohol dependence (AD) has been characterized as a chronic disorder that presents an enduring vulnerability 
to relapse.  Unfortunately, AD treatment is commonly delivered as a series of acute care sessions (Etheridge, 
Craddock, Dunteman, & Hubbard, 1995; McLellan, Lewis, O'Brien, & Kleber, 2000), which means  that 
individuals seeking treatment often face the challenge of maintaining sobriety  upon returning to the same 
environment where  they had struggled  with alcohol  dependence previous to seeking treatment. Studies  have 
shown that 40%– 60% of patients  treated  for alcohol problems relapse within 3 months, and this rate 
increases to 70%–80% within  12 months (Bradizza, Stasiewicz, & Paas,  2006; McLellan et al., 2000;  Witkiewitz  
& Marlatt,  2004). medical  costs associated  with  alcohol use disorders (AD) are over $120 billion per year,  until 
very recently, there has been  relatively  little involvement of physicians  or other general healthcare providers 
in the treatment of AUDs  (Sacks et al., 2015).  By [CONTACT_559], most contemporary AUD treatment  has been 
delivered outside mainstream  healthcare  by [CONTACT_101699]  “treatment programs” that are time-limited  by 
[CONTACT_440763]  a standardized “program”  of care (McLellan et al., 
2005; Foll et al., 2009).

Page  3 of 21Outcome research has typi[INVESTIGATOR_440748] “graduation” rates and “posttreatment” 
abstinence as standard measures of treatment  “success” or “failure” (McLellan et al., 2005).There are 
conceptual (McKay and Hiller-Sturmhöfel, 2011; McLellan  et al., 2014)  and some  methodological indications 
(Kim et al., 2011; Oslin et al., 2014) that ADs may be better managed using a chronic illness  approach. 
However, for the reasons described above, there is not yet the evidence-base needed to guide a 
personalized, chronic care approach to the treatment of ADs, or even  to guide the use of monitoring 
technology within that treatment approach.  Previous  research on the use of mobile phones for AD treatment  
include telephone-based monitoring of medication adherence  (Stoner & Hendershot, 2012), behavioral self-
control training to withstand cravings  (Yu et al., 2012),  and video-recording breathalyser tests to measure  
breath alcohol content (BrAC) combined with contingency  management procedures (Alessi & Petry,  2013). 
Two recent studies  used, the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support  System  (ACHESS)  
(Gustafson et al., 2014) and Location-Based Monitoring  and Intervention  for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) 
(Dulin, Gonzalez, & Campbell, 2014)  to monitor  patients  with AD. These two smartphone applications with 
composite functions have proven effective  in reducing  the incidence of hazardous drinking and promoting 
abstinence. 
Soberlink is a comprehensive  alcohol  monitoring system  designed to remotely  monitor  a person’s Blood 
Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Combining a professional grade handheld breathalyzer with  wireless  
connectivity, the technology  includes real-time facial recognition, robust tamper detection  and real-time 
alerting. The Soberlink System  also provides professionals  with a password protected, HIPAA compliant 
healthcare portal  where they can set up a variety of advanced reporting tools. Soberlink is designed and 
assembled in the [LOCATION_002] and is one of the few FDA 510(k) cleared  medical devices in remote alcohol 
monitoring. The breathalyzer device  uses fuel cell technology  to detect  BAC, is handheld, and includes  an 
embedded camera. It uses  wireless technology to send the data  in real-time.  The cloud-based monitoring 
system includes  a scheduler that automatically tracks scheduled  tests and sends reminders to the client for 
testing. Retesting is automatically scheduled if a positive test is received or if a client’s identity  cannot be 
verified. The device locks out for [ADDRESS_558901]. Facial  
Recognition software ensures  identity  is approved or declined in real-time. Artificial  intelligence is used  to 
report on testing and Green, Yellow and Red visual icons are used in all reporting  to identify events.
Aware Recovery Care (ARC) is an in-home  addiction treatment program that provides highly intensive,  
rigorously monitored, [ADDRESS_558902] used  in 2012 and delivers a four-phased, year-long program treating substance use disorder. 
The approach  implements principles  of evidence-based  practices including  Motivational  Interviewing, 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, in the home setting. Additionally, all 
families are offered education and the opportunity to participate  in the treatment  process. ARC works  to 
transform the home  environment into a healthy,  healing  environment for clients and families to recover.  ARC 
supports clients in creating  and maintaining both  structure and recovery that is tailored to each  individual's 
needs. 
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.

Aware Treatment: Aware Recovery Care  (ARC)  is an in-home addiction treatment program that provides highly 
intensive, rigorously monitored, 52 weeks of intensive  outpatient care,  based on a chronic disease  model  of care.  
The approach  implements principles  of evidence-based  practices including  Motivational  Interviewing, Cognitive  
Behavioral Therapy,  and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.  Additionally, all families are offered education and the 
opportunity to participate in the treatment process. The client's individualized treatment  team consists of a 
licensed professional  (nurse  or master’s level clinician), two Certified Recovery Advisors (CRAs),  and an LMFT. The 
clients care team is overseen by a master's  level  alcohol and drug counselor, an advanced practicing nurse, and an 
addiction psychiatrist. The licensed professional is responsible for leading the team, collaborating with external 
providers, communicating with family  members and providing  referrals  to external providers as needed.  The  
CRAs are lived-experience advisors, at least  one of whom is both age and gendered match  in order to provide  a 
more intimate therapeutic relationship. CRAs are responsible for delivering  a staged biopsychosocial  curriculum.  
Familial involvement  is another key component of this model, with education and frequent  communication  
provided. All care teams include a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_65585] [ADDRESS_558908] assessments to evaluate alcohol 
use. Eligible patients will be assigned to one of the two groups using randomization sequence. The 
randomization sequence  will allow for equal representation between  two groups without bias on gender, age 
or ethnicity given all individuals will be categorized as single  variable

audio-taped  scenarios. Patients are instructed to imagine that they  are in the situation and 
provide a detailed account to how they  would respond to that situation. Patient accounts are 
recorded and scored by [CONTACT_407920]. The instrument provides 4 measures: the number of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25133], the number of activities per response, the quality of the best response and the 
quality of the overall response. The measure has been show to mediate days of drug abstinence

All research personnel are required to participate in and document training in protection of human subjects 
and the responsible conduct of scientific research. Data entry and review in this study will be conducted using a 
web-based data collection and monitoring system. Another set of automatic email reports, sent on a weekly or 
less frequent basis, provides a set of designated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (e.g., the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32755]) with information 
about study logistics, such as number of subjects enrolled, number of subjects active in the protocol, gender 
composition of the sample, percentage of missing data by [CONTACT_280429], or any other 
information necessary to monitor the progress of the project and the compliance with the protocol. A fully 
computerized system allows this type of monitoring without furnishing investigators with data that could 
influence the outcome of the study. The system meets the highest security and reliability standards. All 
connections to the systems are secured and encrypted using 128-bit strong encryption protocols and only 
authorized users are able to access the system.

9.How will eligibility be determined,  and by [CONTACT_20898]?  
Subjects will be interviewed by a trained and supervised research assistant to determine interest in 
participating in the study and eligibility.  Participants will be interviewed at the Aware facility prior during the 
admission process, or via Zoom or telephone if the subject is unable to present to the clinic, using standardized 
psychological assessments or will complete similar standardized self-report forms. Eligibility will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_440770] [INVESTIGATOR_280399]
10.Risks: Describe the reasonably  foreseeable risks, including risks to subject  privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with  subjects  participating in the research. 
The main  risk associated  with the study is the possibility that confidential  information obtained during the 
study will be disclosed, given the social and legal sanctions associated  with  the use of psychoactive 
substances and psychiatric symptoms.  Patient names  and other identifying  information do not appear on 
research records. Finally, we will clearly explain our mandated obligation to report incidents, as well as 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440753],  and risk of harm to self or others, and advise subjects  that continued  
alcohol use alone does  not require reporting to child protection  services.
Soberlink: All Soberlink results are sent directly from devices to Soberlink web portal where they are stored 
under specific password protected  account,  that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_440754].  
Soberlink uses Rackspace servers  to host our sites which all use a Secure Sockets Layer  (SSL)  certificate and 
our public  facing sites go beyond that and use an Extended  Validation SSL (EVSSL or EV SSL) certificate.  These  
Certs prevent online transaction fraud, EVSSL certificates help organizations gain consumer  trust  by [CONTACT_440771].   All of the SSL Certificates  use AES [ADDRESS_558911].
Rating Scales and Assessments: These are all noninvasive and should add no risk. The major  disadvantage is 
the time  it takes to complete them. Confidentiality of these results is specifically protected by [CONTACT_392987], 
and all records  will be identified by [CONTACT_120467], with the master file kept under lock by [CONTACT_9532].

kept in a secured cabinet by [CONTACT_978], separate from the subject records.  All collected materials will be kept in 
locked file cabinets in a secured office. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the use of trained clinical 
interviewers in the assessment phase of the study will help to avoid the acceptance of subjects into this study 
who have either insignificant substance abuse or significant psychiatric contraindications to both treatments in 
this study.  In cases of psychological deterioration or worsening substance abuse, we will recommend to 
patients to contact [CONTACT_440772].  When necessary subjects will be withdrawn from this study and research staff will assist 
patients with appropriate sites for treatment such as the care coordinator, their sponsor or the emergency 
room.  In instances of suicidal or homicidal risk, appropriate authorities including their primary provider will be 
informed and necessary actions (seeking crisis/suicidality evaluations and possible hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) taken. 
Soberlink have  facial  recognition to confirm its the correct  participant testing, while also have internal sensors 
and algorithms that can detect if the participant  is using an alternative air source (i.e. air pump) or sample is 
not consistent with human breath.  
 
12.Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan:  Include  an appropriate Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plan (DSMP) based  on

subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects  participating in this 
study? The risks  associated with  participating in this study  can be categorized  as minimal (i.e., 
risks are commensurate with  everyday risks associated with drug  abuse treatment  and data have 
adequate protection  for maintaining confidentiality).
b. If children are involved, what  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating  in this study? N/A

of serious adverse  events within 5 days  of the event becoming known to the principal investigator.
13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design. 
A sample size of 110 would provide >80% power (α= .05) to detect a medium to large effect size (d= .65) and 
allow to fully evaluate gender differences. Greater power  is provided by [CONTACT_440773]/month  of self-
reported illicit drug use. Sample size calculations for LMM  are dependent on the number of repeated events,  
the retention rate, and the interclass correlation, in addition to the alpha  level,  the expected  effect size, and 
the statistical  power 198. The current  randomized  trial would provide  estimates to guide  a power  analysis for 
a large Stage  II study. Statistical procedures and models for analyzing data have been selected according  to 
the research  hypotheses being  investigated  and the types of data  available.  We will use α< .05, but will use 
appropriate corrections  for multiple tests. Statistical  analyses will be conducted  on an intention-to-treat 
sample using  SPSS. Using chi square and t-tests,  we will first conduct  preliminary analyses of the adequacy  of 
the randomization procedure, the comparability of baseline measures for the two groups,  and the possible 
need for covariates in the analyses of treatment outcome data.

about information about the study will be screened based on inclusion criteria and ability to understand and 
read English.  Individuals who meet the criteria will meet with the research assistant either in person, via Zoom, 
or via telephone to be evaluated for eligibility.
c.Who is recruiting potential  subjects? Research Assistants and/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966] 
4.Assessment of Current  Health Provider Relationship for HIPAA Consideration:
Does the Investigator or any member of the research team have a direct existing clinical relationship  with any 
potential subject? 
☐Yes, all subjects
☐Yes, some of the subjects
☒No
If yes, describe the nature of this relationship. Write  here
5.Request for waiver  of HIPAA authorization: (When  requesting a waiver of HIPAA Authorization for either  the 
entire study, or for recruitment  purposes  only.  Note: if you are collecting PHI as part of a phone or email  
screen, you must  request  a HIPAA  waiver for recruitment purposes.)
Choose one: 
☐ For entire  study  - –
☒ For recruitment/screening purposes only– 
☐ For inclusion  of non-English speaking subject if short form is being  used  and there is no translated HIPAA  
research authorization form available on the University’s  HIPAA website at hipaa.yale.edu.
i.Describe why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for use/disclosure of this 
data: It would be impracticable to obtain signed  authorization prior to screening since the subjects  
will either  call into the lab for screening  or will be referred  by [CONTACT_102]’s clinician. 
ii. If requesting a waiver of signed  authorization, describe why it would be impracticable to obtain the 
subject’s signed  authorization  for use/disclosure of this data:  After seeing a flyer or being referred to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_440760],  potential subject who call the PI/research  team  will be screened  for eligibility  
over the phone or via Zoom.  The waiver of written  authorization  allows for the collection  of PHI. If 
the subject is found to be ineligible,  the PHI will not be kept.  It would be impractical  for all 
participants to have a signed authorization prior to enrollment  in the research study as some will be 
calling from an off-site location  and asking them to physically sign something  may not be possible. 
Not enrolling these subjects into this minimal risk study because they are unable to sign a form could 
negatively influence the analysis. 
The investigator assures that the protected health information for which  a Waiver of Authorization has been 
requested will not be reused or disclosed to any person  or entity other than those  listed in this application, except 
as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight  of this research study, or as specifically approved for use in another 
study by [CONTACT_2717].
Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of the Yale HIPAA-Covered 
entity must be accounted for in the “accounting  for disclosures log”, by [CONTACT_20911],  purpose,  date, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  
and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be forwarded to the Deputy  HIPAA Privacy Officer.

Page  16 of 216.Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, 
including parental permission  or surrogate permission  and the steps taken to ensure  subjects’ independent 
decision-making. 
The process of consent will take place in person during the first study visit when possible. However, if the 
participant cannot meet with the research team due to one of the following: 1) not able to transport 
him/herself to the location,  2) autoimmune disease or 3) due to social distancing requirements, the consent 
process will take place remotely (see below),.  All potential subjects interested in the study will be fully 
informed about all aspects of the study using the appropriate consent attachment (adult consent or parental 
consent with child assent) and invited to participate. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a research assistant will meet with them to read 
through the informed consent document to ensure that they each understand the content and to answer any 
potential questions that may arise.  Potential participants will be given a copy of the consent forms if they 
would like more time to decide if they wish to participate. Participants can request and keep a copy of the 
informed consent document. Participants will be informed that they are free to decline participation and 
withdraw from the study at any time and that neither action will adversely affect their relationship with study 
personnel or their clinic staff.
If the consent is not completed in-person, a secure email will be sent to the individual with an attached specific 
Zoom (www.zoom.com) ID, and time to meet online. The participant will meet with the either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_440761]. Signature [CONTACT_440780]. Zoom has the 
capabilities to allow participants to electronically sign (e-sign) their names, through manually signing their 
name [CONTACT_440781] a mouse on a computer. Patients can retain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_440762] a secondary secure email sent directly to them by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_175921].  Given 
that all clients at Aware have access to an online capability and have a secure registered email, there is no 
additional risks to the client. 
7.Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide  Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining 
consent will assess the potential subject’s  ability  and capacity to consent to the research being proposed. 
For all participants, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a research assistant will meet with them to read through the informed consent 
document.  Each participant will be asked repeatedly throughout the consent whether they understand what is 
presented.  In addition, subjects will be asked to provide a summary of their understanding of the consent. 
Participants will also be asked what questions they have about the study procedures, their rights and 
obligations and the expectations and obligations of the study staff. When it is clear that they understand the 
material, both the research staff and the participant will sign two consents and the participant will retain a 
copy for their records
8.Non-English  Speaking  Subjects:  Explain  provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving  
non-English speaking subjects.  If enrollment of these  subjects is anticipated, translated  copi[INVESTIGATOR_20885].

SECTION  IV: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH  SUBJECTS
    Confidentiality & Security  of Data:
1.What protected health information (medical  information along  with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected  and used for the research?   We will collect names, addresses, email  addresses, phone numbers, 
birth date and admission, discharge  dates, and psychiatric diagnosis. 
2.How will the research data be collected, recorded  and stored? 
Data will be stored two in two servers: 1) Soberlink uses Rackspace servers to host our sites which all use a 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and all of the SSL Certificates use AES [ADDRESS_558915] and store all data regarding any data that is inputted from 
the Soberlink device.   2) All surveys will be stored through Qualtrics. Qualtrics is an approved vendor of Yale 
University, and will securely  store, record and store all participants surveys.   
3.How will the digital data be stored?  ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive   ☐Portable Hard  Drive   ☒Secured Server   
☒Laptop Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4.What methods and procedures will be used  to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated  above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
All survey  information will be stored on a privately maintained, Yale approved vendor (Qualtrics) for all data 
collection.  Specific native IPADs will be utilized for intake/admission  only.   All other survey’s will be completed 
online in the participant’s  home through a secure  link sent directly to them.  Soberlink uses Rackspace servers to 
host our sites which  all use a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  certificate and our public facing sites go beyond  that and 
use an Extended Validation  SSL (EVSSL or EV SSL) certificate. These Certs prevent online transaction  fraud,  EVSSL 
certificates help organizations gain consumer trust by [CONTACT_440778].   All of the SSL 
Certificates use AES [ADDRESS_558916] access to coded information  and will be responsible  for all data 
collection and analysis.  All information  will be stored  on Yale’s secure  server  and will be encrypted. 
Information will not be uploaded to the sponsored server  as identifiable data. Only aggregate 
information that does not consist of identifiers will be distributed to Soberlink,  and Aware Recovery

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits  that may be reasonably expected to result  from  the research, either  to 
the subject(s) or to society  at large. (Payment  of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
There is no direct benefit to  individuals. We hope individuals who  are randomized into the Aware+Soberlink 
group will receive access  to the Soberlink  device to monitor their  alcohol usage and give them a permanent 
product measurement. Those  who  are not randomized into the control group  will still have access  to the Aware  
Model.  All individuals will have access to the Aware In-home treatment model. A five-phase step down model  
that provides  access to continual care through an integrated  team  of medical,  nursing, counselors and home 
health advisors coming to the patient’s home.   
The study will assist in evaluating the efficacy of the combined effect of Soberlink and Aware Model and given 
the limited risks of the current study the study would be categorized as minimal (risks are commensurate  with 
everyday risks associated  with alcohol abuse treatment as an adequate protection of confidentiality).  T his 
information is important in order to develop cost-effective treatments for alcohol dependence,  which ultimately 
would be of great benefit  to society. Given the anticipated benefits to subjects and to society, the low risks to 
subjects are reasonable.
Patients who  are randomized to the Soberlink group will have receive the Soberlink device  and four months of 
service for no charge (390 USD).  Soberlink will purchase  gift cards for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177591]/RA will distribute them to the 
participant. 
         SECTION  VI: RESEARCH  ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC  CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other  alternatives are available to the study subjects outside  of the research? 
Patients are not restricted  from seeking any ancillary treatment (i.e. Alcoholic Anonymous). 
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments,  and the conditions for receiving  this compensation.

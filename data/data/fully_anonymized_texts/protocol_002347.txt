 5PROTOCOL SUMMARY: 
The objective of this study is to determine whether, in children receiving low-dose ICS, 
quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the “yellow zone” based upon a symptom-
based action plan reduces the rate of severe asthma exacerbations treated with oral 
corticosteroids.  The study design is a double-blind, parallel-group trial, including a total of [ADDRESS_440512] 1 asthma exacerbation treated with oral corticosteroids in the prior year. 
Participants will undergo a 4-week run-in on low-dose ICS to assess adherence and adequate 
control (c-ACT>19). After randomization, participants will be treated for 48 weeks with open-
label fluticasone 44 mcg 2 puffs twice daily. During the 48-week treatment period, participants 
will receive blinded therapy for 7 days each time they enter the “yellow zone”. Yellow zone 
therapy will be fluticasone 44 or 220 mcg 2 puffs twice daily. 
  
The primary outcome is the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids.  
 
The estimated total study duration is approximately 24 months, which includes a 12-month recruitment/enrollment period for the 9 centers and associated participating sites, and a one-
year study period (4-week run-in plus 48-week treatment period).

I. BACKGROUND 
 
Asthma exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity in children with asthma and current therapeutic strategies are only of limited efficacy in exacerbation prevention. The NHLBI EPR-3 
guidelines recommend that patients be provided with a written asthma action plan for home management. However, there is limited evidence to guide clinicians in the selection and 
implementation of “yellow zone” strategies with in these guideline recommendations that are of 
proven benefit in exacerbation prevention ( i.e. preventing the patient from entering into the “red 
zone”)(1). While frequently utilized in clinical practice, doubling the dose of ICS has not been 
shown to reduce prednisone-requiring exacerbations(1). Quadrupling the dose has 
demonstrated potential efficacy in adult patients, but this step-up short term intervention 
strategy(2) has not been studied in children(3). This protocol is designed to determine whether 
step-up short-term ICS as a “yellow zone” strategy can prevent severe asthma exacerbations in 
children. It will address a critical gap in guideline-based care of children with asthma. 
 
A. ASTHMA POPULATION 
EPR-3 divides asthma assessment and treatment recommendations into 3 age groups: 0-[ADDRESS_440513] illnesses and tend to be completely well between epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841](4). During the early sc hool years (5-11 years), children tend to 
develop more persistent asthma symptoms, but asthma exacerbations remain a critical component of disease. Data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) 
clearly highlight that exacerbation frequency is much greater in this age group than in individuals 12 years and above(5). In addition to the significant morbidity and cost 
associated with exacerbations of asthma, ther e is growing evidence that exacerbations may 
lead to progressive loss of lung function(6, 7).   
Low-dose ICS monotherapy and low-dose ICS + LABA combination therapy have been 
shown to reduce exacerbations and improve asthma control in children in this age group; 
however, many children have exacerbations despi[INVESTIGATOR_353750] (8-10). Currently, the best predictor identified for the development of subsequent exacerbations is a prior history 
of exacerbations, and indeed, the rate of ex acerbations in the PACT(9) and BADGER(10) 
trials in children with a history of exacerbations at study entry was ~0.9 exacerbations/year despi[INVESTIGATOR_353751] [ADDRESS_440514] not proven beneficial for exacerbation prevention in this age group(11). Budesonide/Formoterol as a single inhaler for both maintenance and reliever therapy has 
been shown to further reduce exacerbation risk in this age group(12); however, this 
approach is not FDA approved. Finally, omalizum ab (anti-IgE) as add-on therapy has also 
been shown to reduce severe exacerbations in this age group(13, 14), but high cost and 
lack of FDA approval for use in patients <[ADDRESS_440515] exacerbations despi[INVESTIGATOR_353752]-dose ICS or low-dose ICS + LABA 
therapy.

 7B. INTERVENTION  
The intervention to be tested in this trial is quintupling the dose of ICS (fluticasone) at the 
onset of yellow-zone symptoms in patients treated with fluticasone 44 mcg 2 puffs twice 
daily. The intervention will be continued for 7 days each time the participant enters the yellow zone. This strategy will be compared in a blinded fashion to maintaining the 
participants’ low-dose ICS during the yellow zone. 
 
C. RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 
The concept of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-up asthma therapy has recently been considered in at least three 
contexts (Figure 1).(2) First, if lack of control is persistent over long periods of time (e.g., 2-3 
weeks or longer), an increase in the overall medication regimen will be prescribed by [CONTACT_353804]-3 or GINA asthma guideline recommendations. This particular intervention has been termed “ step-up long-term (SLT) ”. This step-up in 
overall therapy is usually continued for 3-6 m onths to evaluate the ability and consistency of 
the new regimen to maintain adequate asthma control. At this point, consideration could be given to steppi[INVESTIGATOR_353753] 1-2 months to 
determine the consistency of 
control that this step-down 
regimen is able to maintain 
over time.  An example of a 
clinical trial in children that evaluated this step-up long-
term approach was the 
BADGER trial performed by 
[CONTACT_353805] 
(CARE) Network.(10)  
A second approach to step-up 
therapy may occur in relationship to an anticipated brief loss of control (days) or actual brief 
loss of control, such as at the onset of a viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_301865](15) or as a 
consequence of an acute short term exposure (e.g., a furred pet) that has been known to 
induce a temporary loss of acceptable asthma control.(16) In most cases, this will entail a step-up in therapy consisting of more frequent short acting beta agonist (SABA) use and, 
potentially, an increase from baseline in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) aimed at 
preventing a more significant exacerbation requi ring oral corticosteroid treatment. This step-
up in therapy is usually discontinued in 3-10 days once asthma control has been satisfactorily achieved; at this point, a st ep-down to the baseline medication regimen is 
instituted. This particular intervention strategy has been termed “ step-up short-term 
(SST)”.(2) The SST strategy most closely represents what many clinicians label “yellow 
zone” treatment. Examples of clinical trials  that have evaluated this type of therapeutic 
approach include the IMPACT(17) trial in adults conducted by [CONTACT_353806] (ACRN) and the AIMS(18) and MIST(19) tr ials in preschool ch ildren conducted by 
[CONTACT_353807]. 
Figure [ADDRESS_440516] (SABA) or a long 
acting beta agonist (LABA) has been evaluated. While this type of therapy has been studied 
in clinical trials and approved for use in many par ts of the world, it is currently not approved 
in the [LOCATION_002]. This particular intervention strategy has been termed “ step-up 
intermittent (SUI).” Interestingly, this approach has been used in clinical trials involving both LABAs(20, 21) and SABAs, with the SABA trials being performed by [CONTACT_353808] 
(TREXA(11)) and ACRN (BASALT(22)) NHLBI-funded networks, and others(23, 24). When 
applied in the 5-[ADDRESS_440517] been conducted thus far. In the EPR-3 guidelines, the importance of the use of written asthma 
treatment plans is stressed. These treatment plans use the terms “green zone”, “yellow 
zone”, and “red zone”, with the yellow zone being defined as some type of step-up in 
treatment that will hopefully reestablish asthma  control and prevent the patient from entering 
the red zone, which in most cases involves some type of oral or parenteral corticosteroid 
intervention.  
Interestingly, guidelines as to what determines when a patient is entering or is in the yellow zone are never precisely defined due to lack of evidence to base precise recommendations 
upon. The examples that are used in the sample asthma action plan use peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_353754] (PEFR) values as one criterion, and symptoms consisting of wheezing, coughing 
and shortness of breath as another. As such, these plans have been labeled PEFR-based 
or symptom-based, respectively. In 2007, the expert panel felt that studies did not clearly show that a peak flow monitoring-based action plan was better than a symptom monitoring-
based plan in improving outcomes, but that it did show similar benefits. The committee felt 
that the plan should direct the patient to adjust medications in response to particular signs, 
symptoms, and peak flow measurements and should state when to seek medical help. The 
clinician should tailor the plan to the needs of individual patients. EPR-3 further states that 
the nature of the plan, whether it is based on symptoms or based on peak flow, is not the 
important issue; rather, it is having a plan in place versus not having one at all. 
Paradoxically, although action plans are a fi rm recommendation by [CONTACT_353809], guidance to clinicians as to the specifics of how these plans should 
be formulated are not provided. For example, what level of symptom severity, rescue albuterol use, activity limitations etc. would warrant a step-up (short term or intermittent) in 
therapy into the yellow zone? While quantitative cut points for PEFR that would constitute 
being in the yellow zone are suggested (50-80% of the patient’s personal best), similar 
threshold guidelines for quantifying symptom severity are never specifically provided. 
Moreover, once a given threshold is reached, what therapeutic intervention should be 
recommended once the patient enters into the yellow zone? Higher than usual doses of 
inhaled corticosteroids? A burst of oral corticosteroids? Other or additional strategies? 
These gaps in the asthma guidelines, and a need to provide more evidence-based 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 9recommendations for yellow zone therapy were the major impetus for the design and 
development of the current protocol. 
 
II. OBJECTIVES & RE SEARCH HYPOTHESES 
 
A. PRIMARY 
 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether in children receiving low-dose 
ICS therapy, quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the “yellow zone” (at the onset 
of symptoms previously associated with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_353755]) reduces the rate of severe asthma exacerbations treated with oral 
corticosteroids.   
 
Primary Research Hypothesis 
The primary research hypothesis is that in ch ildren receiving low-dose ICS, quintupling the 
dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the yellow zone will reduce the rate of severe asthma exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids. 
 
B. SECONDARY 
 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary research objectives of this study include determining whether, in children 
receiving low-dose ICS, quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the “yellow zone” 
leads to reductions in symptoms [assessed by [CONTACT_170264] (AUC) for total daily symptoms(18) and the asthma index(25)] time to first asthma exacerbation, and rate of 
treatment failures. Additionally, we aim to a ssess overall corticosteroid exposure, and the 
potential for growth effects of increased ICS exposure.   
Secondary Research Hypotheses 
The secondary research hypothesis is that quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in 
the yellow zone will lead to reductions in symptoms [assessed by [CONTACT_353810]] more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_353756]. We also hypothesize that quintupling the ICS dose in the yellow zone 
will lead to greater time to first asthma exacerbation and a lower rate of treatment failures. 
Further, we hypothesize that this intervention will reduce overall corticosteroid exposure, 
and will not lead to significant reductions in growth velocity over 1 year. 
 
C. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES 
Exploratory research objectives include comparing the timing of yellow zone initiation using 
a symptom-based action plan (STICS gold standard, appendix C) vs. a peak-flow based 
action plan by [CONTACT_353811]. 
 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 10Further, we will identify predictors of asthma exacerbations in this exacerbation-prone 
population and identify predictors of response to the study intervention and assess the cost-
effectiveness of the yellow zone strategies.

B. RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY DESIGN 
The STICS trial is designed to address 
an important clinical question: should 
clinicians recommend quintupling the 
dose of a patient’s ICS therapy at the 
onset of yellow zone symptoms in order 
to prevent progression to the red zone? 
As illustrated in Figure 2, the timing of 
the initiation of the yellow zone 
intervention likely should be at the point at which symptoms are just beginning to 
escalate in terms of them not 
responding in the usual way to rescue 
therapy (i.e., relief onset, duration, or 
need for repetition). Alternatively, some other change in asthma control measures could be 
considered to define this yellow zone threshold. This timing for beginning yellow zone 
therapy is likely a critical factor in altering subsequent outcomes. Indeed, a number of trials 
that have been unable to show efficacy with inhaled corticosteroid interventions have been 
criticized for the escalation in therapy being started too late.(26) However, starting an intervention too early may lead to overtreatment and potentially unnecessary side effects of 
medication. 
Studies performed by [CONTACT_353812]. In adults, the ACRN developed a symptom based action plan that was 
used in the IMPACT study as part of a step-up short-term yellow zone strategy. The 
participant was considered to be in the yellow zone when one of the following thresholds 
were met: awakening from asthma three or more times in a two-week period or on two 
consecutive nights; using albuterol for relief of symptoms four or more times/day for two or 
more consecutive days; albuterol relieved symptoms for less than four hours after each 
treatment over a 12-hour period; using albuterol  for relief of symptoms daily for seven days, 
and this use exceeded two times the weekly use of albuterol during the baseline period; or 
exercise induced unusual breathlessness.(17) If any of these criteria were met, the 
participant was instructed to use open-label budesonide, [ADDRESS_440518] a year trying to develop a 
set of uniform criteria that could be used by [CONTACT_353813] (step-up short term or yellow zone 
medication) should be initiated. Interviews with parents eventually led the committee to 
realize that the threshold for initiation of the intervention needed to be individualized for each participant.(27) Thus, in preschool children, the criteria for beginning the yellow zone 
therapy differed among participants. Once these criteria were met, the children received 
scheduled albuterol, oral montelukast, or high dose nebulized budesonide (1 mg twice

 12daily). None of these three interventions reduc ed the use of oral prednisone (i.e., preventing 
escalation into the red zone). However, a subset of children with a positive modified asthma 
predictive index (mAPI)(28) (at high risk of subsequent asthma development) did experience 
a significant reduction in symptom burden when treated intermittently with high-dose ICS 
therapy during respi[INVESTIGATOR_301865]. The same criteria for yellow zone therapy were 
utilized in the CARE Network MIST trial which showed that intermittent high-dose 
budesonide was associated with a similar rate of severe exacerbations, when compared to 
daily, low-dose budesonide, used over the course of 1 year in preschool children with a 
positive mAPI(19). Another preschool study demonstrated some interesting results. The 
study examined the efficacy and safe ty of preemptive treatment with very high-dose 
fluticasone (750 mcg twice daily or placebo) in reducing the severity of recurrent virus-
induced wheezing in children 1 to 6 years of age(29).  Treatment was started at the onset of 
an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_353758] a maximum of 10 days. The primary 
outcome was rescue oral corticosteroid use. Over a median period of 40 weeks, 8% of 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_353759], as compared with 18% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.83). Importantly, treatment with this very high dose of 
fluticasone was associated with a smaller gain in height and weight. The authors concluded 
that, given the potential for overuse by [CONTACT_353814] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_353760], this preventive approach should not be adopted in clinical practice until long-term adverse effects could be further clarified. 
Although the data generated in the above studies provide insight into timing of yellow zone 
strategies, it is important to point out that the age range for participants to be enrolled in the STICS protocol was not included in either of these three study populations. Additionally, 
these studies involved patients with intermittent or very mild persistent asthma. Nonetheless, 
based on these results and published studies, the steering committee developed the following criteria for defining the threshold for entering the yellow zone in the STICS 
protocol: 
 Rescue albuterol 2x (4 puffs) in 6 hours OR 
 Rescue albuterol 3x (6 puffs) in 24 hours OR 
 [ADDRESS_440519] been evaluated in both children and adults. Although very frequently utilized in clinical practice, doubling the dose of ICS in both adults(30-32) and children(33) has not been shown to be effective. However, it should be noted that these 
studies all had relatively small sample sizes and often delayed the yellow zone intervention 
until quite significant symptoms and/or reductions in PEFR were present(26). In contrast, 
preliminary data generated a number of years ago suggested that quadrupling the dose of 
an ICS for [ADDRESS_440520] appearance of worsening symptoms, may prevent 
exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids.(34) These intriguing data were 
subsequently further evaluated in a trial specifically designed to ascertain the value of 
quadrupling the dose of ICS in reducing the need for subsequent oral corticosteroid 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 13administration. The primary outcome of this trial was progression of yellow zone symptoms 
to the point of being sufficient enough to warrant oral corticosteroid treatment.(3) Overall, 
the primary outcome was not significant. However, in a post hoc analysis of the data, 
reductions in prednisone use were significantly noted in those participants who initiated step-up therapy per protocol. The authors concluded that, although the primary outcome did 
not reach statistical significance, quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when 
asthma control starts to deteriorate appears to reduce acute exacerbations of asthma and is 
deserving of further investigation. Further, in this study, the quadrupling of ICS dose 
occurred after significant symptoms had developed, and it therefore could be suggested that 
earlier institution of quadrupled ICS dosing may be more likely to prevent exacerbations 
successfully. Finally, this study included adults across a spectrum of asthma severity, but whether the participants’ baseline ICS dose or concomitant treatment with a LABA altered 
response to therapy was not reported. 
In summary, the current literature indicates that doubling the dose of ICS is not an effective 
strategy for attenuating and/or abrogating progression from the yellow zone into red zone 
therapy. However, in adult patients, quadrupling the dose may achieve these outcomes. Since the data in children to address this particular form of intervention are nonexistent, the 
steering committee felt it extremely relevant to design a trial in school-aged children (5-11 
years of age) that would provide evidence to guide therapy in this regard.  Based upon ICS 
dose preparations available, we have chosen a protocol in which step-up short term or 
“yellow zone” therapy consists of quintupling the dose of the participant’s “green zone” or 
baseline therapy. This gap in our evidence base is important in children treated with either 
low-dose ICS or low-dose ICS + LABA therapy, but due to the potential for interaction by 
[CONTACT_353815], we will include only children treated with low-dose ICS in the STICS trial. 
 
C. OUTCOME MEASURES 
 
Primary outcome 
The primary outcome is the rate of severe exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids 
(prednisone). Oral prednisone will be administered for the treatment of impending epi[INVESTIGATOR_353761](35). The decision concerning 
the initiation or continuation of a course of oral prednisone will be at the physician’s 
discretion, based upon criteria previously published by [CONTACT_353816].(13) Prednisone should be 
prescribed if: 
 The participant used more than [ADDRESS_440521] bronchodilator or 6 puffs of albuterol (3 treatments of 2 puffs each) in the 
prior 4 hours for relief of asthma symptoms OR 
 The participant used [ADDRESS_440522] 24 hours for relief of asthma 
symptoms OR 
 The participant awakened due to cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or 
wheezing AND needed to use albuterol at least 2 of the previous 3 nights OR 
 The participant used [ADDRESS_440523] to be obtained in this study include 
additional outcomes in domains of impairment and risk.  These secondary outcomes include 
the following:

Study specific risks 
 
Risks and benefits of study procedures 
 
Venipuncture:  Blood samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_353817], peripheral blood eosinophils, and for DNA extraction for future 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_50391]. 
 
Risks: The risks of venipuncture are minimal. The possible risks include bruising and/or 
infection at the site of the venipuncture and vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_353765]. Pressure will be applied to the venipuncture site to prevent bruising. Aseptic 
technique will be used to prevent infection. Blood will be obtained while the participants are 
in a seated position and medical and nursing personnel will be available at the study sites to 
treat and manage vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Benefits:  The DNA isolated for future genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_353766]. 
The potential benefits justify the potential risks. 
 
Questionnaires.  
 Risks:  Answering questionnaires and daily diaries about asthma is of minimal risk.  If 
participants feel uncomfortable they are welc ome to discuss the questions with the study 
coordinator.   
 
Benefits:  There are no direct benefits to the participant. 
The potential benefits justify the potential risks.

medications will be available at the study sites to treat and manage bronchospasm. 
Inhalation of a SABA (albuterol) will be used to assess maximum reversibility. The possible risks of inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists include tachycardia and hand tremors. These 
side effects are non-life threatening and are short-lived. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) will also 
be performed in a subset of participants. There are no significant risks associated with IOS. 
 
Benefits:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_353769] a SABA and IOS will be 
utilized to characterize the participants and to determine whether they are potential 
biomarkers to predict asthma exacerbations or response to therapy. 
The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
Methacholine inhalation challenge :  
 
Risks:  The major risk of methacholine challenge is the induction of severe 
bronchoconstriction.  As a precaution, participants will not undergo methacholine challenge 
if their FEV
1 is less than 70% of predicted. Methacholine challenges have been performed 
with high levels of safety in children in both the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and the Childhood Asthma Research & Education (CARE) Network. Medical and nursing personnel, medications and equipment will be available at the study sites to treat 
and manage any bronchoconstriction epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
Benefits:  Methacholine challenge will be utilized to characterize the participants and to 
determine whether it is a potential biomarker to predict asthma exacerbations or response to 
therapy.  The potential benefits justify the potential risks. 
 
Exhaled nitric oxide:  This measures the amount of nitric oxide in the exhaled breath and is 
thought to increase when the lungs are irritated or inflamed.  
Risks: There are no known risks associated with this procedure. 
 
Benefits:  Participants may benefit from knowing the amount of inflammation in their airways 
as measured by [CONTACT_353818]. 
The potential benefits justify the potential risks. 
 Nasal blow for virus detection:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_353770]. Collecting samples at home during yellow zone epi[INVESTIGATOR_353771] (April/Ocelot & Infant/Avica) will allow us to 
assess the pathogens involved in the yellow zone epi[INVESTIGATOR_353772]. 
 
Risks:  There is a small chance of lavage fluid going down the throat leading to an 
uncomfortable feeling.  Benefits:  Nasal sampling will allow investigators to identify pathogens involved in 
exacerbation epi[INVESTIGATOR_353773]

The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
 
 Risks and benefits of study drugs 
Fluticasone 
 
Risks:  Daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with a small, but 
statistically significant reduction in growth ve locity.(36) High-doses of inhaled corticosteroids 
used for prolonged periods of time have been associated with additional side effects, 
including hoarseness, sore throat, and thrush, adrenal gland suppression, weight gain, bruising of the skin, and diabetes. These side effects are not anticipated in STICS because 
of the 7-day yellow-zone treatment period and the maximum of 6 yellow zone courses per 
participant in the trial. We will monitor growth throughout the trial (see secondary outcomes). 
 
Benefits : The efficacy of fluticasone at low dosages has been well established in both adults 
and children(9, 37) In a meta-analysis of 71 randomized trials (14,602 adults and children) comparing fluticasone to budesonide or beclomethasone, at a dose ratio of 1:2, significant 
improvements in lung function (FEV
1, FEF 25-75) and morning peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_353774]-treated group(38). Low-dose ICS is the current preferred therapy for step 2 
treatment of asthma in children 5-11 years of age(1). Quadrupling the dose of ICS in the 
yellow zone may reduce oral steroid requiring exacerbations in adults(3). This study is 
designed to determine whether quintupling the dose of ICS in the yellow zone, an approach 
currently utilized in clinical practice, is efficacious in children 5-[ADDRESS_440525] (DSMB), however, will be monitoring all of the safety data throughout the course of the trial and will 
be notified within 72 hours of any serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur. 
 
F. ETHICAL ISSUES 
Participation of children 
 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 18Asthmatic participants ages 5-[ADDRESS_440526] 40% females, as approximately 60% of children in this age group with asthma are males.  
 
Participation of minority groups 
 
The target recruitment goal will be to enroll 30% minorities. Asthma affects African Americans more frequently and more severely than other ethnic groups. Some subsets of 
Hispanics (e.g., Puerto Ricans) have particularly frequent and severe asthma, while others 
(e.g., Mexican-Americans) do not. In the present study, we will classify race and ethnicity 
separately, in line with HHS guidelines, and allow individual participants to identify their 
racial category. The reporting of such data will allow for numbers of individuals who indicate 
more than one racial category insofar as it does not interfere with individual participant 
confidentiality.  Based on the demographics of our clinical research sites and our experience 
in other AsthmaNet studies, which up to this time have enrolled approximately 50% 
minorities, it is highly likely we will be able to meet our race/ethnicity targets. If individual 
AsthmaNet centers are unable to meet minority targets from initial recruitment efforts, they 
will redirect their recruitment strategies to use local newspaper and radio advertising that 
have more focused minority demographics. Other efforts that have been successfully used 
for minority recruitment include the targeting of clinics, work sites, schools, churches, and civic groups with high minority representation.

B. STUDY INTERVENTION 
Description and frequency of drug/ modification 
 
For the purpose of this study, each participant will receive three study inhalers ( green zone  
= fluticasone 44 mcg, yellow zone = fluticasone 44 mcg or 220 mcg, SABA).  The green 
zone inhaler will contain fluticasone 44 mcg (not blinded) to be used as a daily controller (twice daily) throughout the trial, but stopped when the participant is in the yellow zone . 
The yellow zone  inhaler will contain fluticasone [ADDRESS_440530] inhaler will contain SABA and will not be blinded (90 mcg/inhalation of albuterol sulfate) 
and used as needed throughout the study.  
 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 22Prednisone.   All participants will have access to prednisone (2 mg/kg/day for 2 days 
[maximum 60 mg/day], followed by 1 mg/kg/day  for 2 days [maximum 30 mg/day]) for 
treatment of an exacerbation.  
 
Promoting medication delivery 
 
Demonstrating medication delivery techniques at  each study visit will maximize delivery of 
the medications.  To minimize the variability in the dose, the patient’s medication technique 
will be reviewed at each study visit.  Objective feedback will be given to each participant to 
improve performance.  Participants will be instructed in proper valve holding chamber 
cleaning techniques, including air-drying. Instructional tools, memory aids, and electronic 
diary prompts will also be administered to participants to ensure proper medication delivery, 
safety monitoring, and adherence.  Additionally, we will review the asthma action plan at 
each study visit. Further, to help avoid confusion between green and yellow zone 
medications, we will color-code (green or yellow) the outside of the inhalers to match the action plan. 
 
Rescue therapy 
 
Participants will use open-label SABA as needed for symptoms throughout the study, 
regardless of treatment assignment.  All participants will be managed with rescue algorithms 
and/or short courses of prednisone for asthma exacerbations in a manner consistent with 
the NAEPP guidelines(1) and previous CARE Network & Inner City Asthma Consortium 
(ICAC) protocols(10, 11, 13).  If a participant experiences two exacerbations requiring oral 
corticosteroids in [ADDRESS_440531] 6 hours prior to the visit. After the 
screening visit, use of SABA within 6 hours should result in rescheduling of the visit, unless 
no other appointments are available. (After the screening visit and prior to randomization, 
the visit should be cancelled and if it cannot be rescheduled the patient must be excluded 
from the study.) At the screening visit, the most recent use of SABAs and LABAs should be noted, but spi[INVESTIGATOR_353776].

Yellow Zone Phone Calls 
Participant care-givers will be asked to notify the study site within 72 hours of initiating the 
yellow zone medication. During this call, the participant’s clinical status will be assessed and 
their action plan will be reviewed, including criteria for initiating red zone therapy. 
Additionally, participant care-givers will be asked to notify the study site if the participant 
continues to meet yellow zone criteria at the end of the 7 day yellow zone treatment period. 
In these cases, the participant’s clinical status will be assessed by [CONTACT_353822]. The clinician will then decide whether to start prednisone 
by [CONTACT_353823], where a decision would be 
made on whether to start prednisone, start an antibiotic (for sinusitis), or otherwise treat as 
medically indicated.   
 
Exacerbation (Red Zone) Phone Call (5 days after exacerbation onset ± 2 day window) 
This phone call will be initiated by [CONTACT_353824]-scheduled study 
visits. This will be performed for safety purposes. If the participant is not improving on prednisone therapy, a follow-up phone call or study visit will be scheduled. 
 
Exacerbation (Red zone) Clinic Visit (optional)  
This visit will be performed if the participant experiences an exacerbation between 
scheduled study visits and needs to be seen at the c linical site. If this visit is necessary, the 
following will be performed:

2. Asthma symptoms and medical history, including healthcare utilization reviewed 
 
3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
 
4. Long physical exam 
 
5. Treatment recommendations given 
 
Description of Procedures 
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_353779].  All participants will undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_353780]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_353781] (American Thoracic Society, 1987) and AsthmaNet manuals of procedure 
(MOP). All participants will undergo methacholine bronchoprovocation at visit 2 in 
accordance with ATS recommendations (American Thoracic Society, 1999) and AsthmaNet 
MOP. A positive response is considered a drop in the FEV
[ADDRESS_440533]-diluent FEV 1 ≥20%.  
 
Bronchodilator reversibility phenotype.  Participants will undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_353782] 1 after 4 puffs albuterol at visit 1. Participants will withhold medications as 
per the AsthmaNet MOP.  
 
Asthma symptoms and control. Asthma symptoms  will be assessed by [CONTACT_353825]-control days (ACD), days recorded in t he daily diary without any asthma symptoms 
or rescue albuterol use, at all visits. Asthma control will be assessed by [CONTACT_353826] (c-ACT)(39) at V1, randomization, regular visits and phone calls.  
 
Fraction of exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO ).  Levels of exhaled nitric  oxide (FeNO) are elevated 
in people with asthma. In addition, FeNO may be involved in airway inflammation.  The 
FeNO collection procedures should precede any pulmonary function testing procedures at a 
given visit.  FeNO will be performed at visits 2-8 using the Aerocrine NIOX MINO device. 
 
Impulse Oscillometry (IOS). IOS will be performed at a subset of study sites. Recent data 
suggests that IOS measurement may predict loss of asthma control in children(40). 
 
 
E. STATISTICAL METHODS 
Sample size determination 
 
The primary hypothesis for STICS will be evaluated by [CONTACT_353827] (expressed as number per year) in the two treatment groups.   A total 
sample size of 250 randomized participants will provide 90% power to detect a 40% 
difference in exacerbation rates, while allowing for up to 15% drop-out.  This is based on the 
assumption that the larger exacerbation rate of the two treatments is at least 0.9 
exacerbations per year.   
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 28 
Method of randomization and blinding 
 
Randomization 
Children between the ages of 5 and 11 years who satisfy all eligibility criteria during the run-
in period will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, 1xICS or 5xICS during yellow 
zone epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], with clinical center serving as a stratifying factor.  Each of the nine clinical 
centers and their associated satellite sites is expected to randomize 28 participants.  
However, enrollment will not be constrained to require exactly 28 participants per clinical 
center.   
 
Blinding 
To minimize the bias due to possible knowledge of the sequence assignment, the study will 
be double-blinded.  Thus, the investigators and the participants will not know which 
treatments are being received. 
 
Assessment of treatment group comparability 
 
The run-in period is considered the baseline evaluation period.  The initial statistical analysis 
will focus on summarizing the baseline characteri stics of the study participants.  Descriptive 
statistics (means and standard deviations, or medians and inter-quartile ranges) will be 
calculated for continuous baseline measures such as current age and asthma symptom severity.  Frequency tables will be generated for categorical baseline measures such as sex 
and prior medication history.  
 
Efficacy analyses 
 
Primary analysis 
The primary outcome is the rate of exacerbations per year.  It is important to note that the 
primary clinical question is whether the strategy  of identifying yellow zones and then using 
either 5xICS or 1xICS during the yellow zone makes any difference on the rate of 
exacerbations over the course of the study.  The question is not whether treatment with 
either 1xICS or 5xICS during any particular yellow zone treatment makes a difference on the 
likelihood of an exacerbation occurring during that particular yellow zone.  That is, a patient 
who has no exacerbations and no yellow zone courses during the study is equivalent to a 
patient who has no exacerbations and [ADDRESS_440534] under 1.0 (48 
weeks/52 weeks).  However, estimates based on that model will be biased unless all 
participants complete the full 48 weeks of follow-up, which is unlikely under the STICS study 
design. When there is unequal follow-up time, better estimates can be obtained by [CONTACT_353828] ‘offset’ in the model, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_353783]-up 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 29time.  Estimates from models incorporating follow-up time as an offset are generally 
unbiased as long as the follow-up time is independent of the outcome frequency.    
 
In STICS, however, follow-up time is not necessarily independent of exacerbation frequency.  Apart from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_353784]-up time due to early drop-out common 
in clinical trials, two additional aspects of ST ICS will likely contribute to truncated follow-up.  
As described below in section V.H., study participants will be withdrawn for safety reasons after the [ADDRESS_440535] exacerbation, if the 2nd 
didn’t occur within the first [ADDRESS_440536] exacerbation and will be analyzed within the framework of proportional hazards 
regression.  This can be done incorporating treatment assignment as a fixed covariate, as opposed to a time-dependent covariate, which will result in a comparison of treatment 
strategies.    Exploratory analyses  
Exploratory analyses will examine possible effe cts of participant baseline characteristics the 
primary outcome.   Multivariable regression analyses, under the model framework described 
above, will be applied.  Characteristics to be explored include history of exacerbations in 
prior year, atopic characteristics, spi[INVESTIGATOR_353785]
1, maximum 
bronchodilator reversibility, IOS, methacholine responsiveness, F ENO, atopic dermatitis, 
race/ethnicity, body-mass index and gender. 
 
Economic analyses will also be undertaken and will reflect the societal perspective for the 
yellow zone high-dose ICS approach for treatment of grade-school aged with persistent 
asthma.  There are several limitations for these analyses in this trial.  Most important are the 
potential lack of generalizability due to population selection and the fact that the protocol 
mandates closer monitoring of patients than would be expected in general practice.  However, major advantages of economic analysis in  the randomized, controlled clinical trials 
are that detailed assessments of prospectively defined resource utilization can be obtained 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 30and that treatment selection bias or confounding is eliminated by [CONTACT_17628].  Cost of 
treatment medication as well as rescue medications and prednisone used to treat 
exacerbations requiring systemic corticoste roids will be evaluated as wholesale costs.  
Costs of unscheduled physician or ED visits or other costs related to diagnosing and treating 
anticipated adverse events will be standardized across clinical centers.  The goal of the 
cost-effectiveness analysis will be to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for study treatment.  Standard methods for cost-effect iveness analysis in clinical trials will be 
used.  Bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_353786], and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be produced in order to determine the probability that 
the intervention in cost-effectives under a range of willingness-to-pay scenarios. 
 
Interim analyses 
 
The [ADDRESS_440537] (DSMB). The DSMB will receive reports of 
serious adverse events as they occur throughout the course of the trial and will meet semi-annually to review non-serious adverse event data and quality control reports. No formal 
interim analyses for futility/efficacy are planned because the length of follow-up is 
approximately the same length as the recruitment so that enrollment will be completed well 
before there is sufficient information to allow an efficient interim efficacy analysis.    A 
feasibility analysis will be performed after 50% of the participants have completed at least 6 months of follow-up.  The purpose of this analysis will be to check whether the assumptions 
regarding loss to follow-up, rate of yellow zone treatment initiation, and rate of treatment 
failure are being borne out.  If the assumptions are not borne out, additional power analyses 
will be conducted to examine study feasibility. The two treatment arms will be combined for 
this analysis.  Based on these results, the DSMB may recommend changes to the study 
design.

Recording of all data including informed consent and assent, history, physical examination, adverse events, confirmation of medication dispensation, and initial data entry will be done 
at each Clinical Center and forms will be forwarded to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) 
for confirmatory entry.  Results from all tests and compliance will be transmitted 
electronically to the DCC where all data will be stored and analyzed. 
 
The DCC will be responsible for generating the data collection forms based on input from 
the clinical centers.  Once the data collection forms have been completed and reviewed, the 
Clinic Coordinator will log into the AsthmaNet Network web site and enter the data within [ADDRESS_440538] study specific procedure and ends with completion of 
study participation with the exception of  SAEs potentially attributed to study 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 32drug/interventions. Throughout the reporting period all adverse events (AEs) related to study 
mandated procedures must be reported. Other AEs (not related to study procedures), which 
occur prior to study drug administration should not be reported (as AEs but may be reported 
as medical history). All serious adverse events (SAEs) from the first study specific procedure 
through study completion must be reported. Any SAE thought to be related to the study 
intervention or a study mandated procedure should be reported if the onset is within 30 days 
of study completion. 
 
B. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
An adverse event is an unfavorable occurrence in a study participant that begins or worsens during the study (from the time of informed consent through study completion). The 
reporting of an adverse event does not imply a causal relationship between the event and 
study participation. Determination of the relationship between the event and study drug or a 
study mandated procedure must be made by [CONTACT_353829] V.E.  
 
Eliciting adverse events should be spontaneous or in response to an open-ended question, 
such as “How are you?” or “Have you noticed any changes in your health since your last 
visit?” Directed questions may be used to follow up spontaneous reporting of events for 
clinically relevant details. All spontaneously re ported adverse events (in the judgment of the 
investigator) should be recorded. 
 
Scheduled outpatient procedures or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29128]-urgent interventions (e.g., 
cataract surgery or knee replacement surgery) should be reported in 
treatments/interventions. For example, cataracts should be included in the patient’s medical 
history prior to beginning treatment. The treatment (surgery) can be added with the 
indication of cataracts when appropriate. If there were worsening of vision in a patient with a 
history of cataracts during the study, that should be reported as an AE (as it represents worsening of a baseline condition) and the procedure can be reported in the treatment. 
The following conventions should be used for reporting AEs: 
 If a specific diagnosis is unclear at the time of reporting, descriptive terms should be 
used. For example, a patient with cough and a headache may later be diagnosed with influenza. Initially “cough” and “headache” may be reported and later changed to 
“influenza” after the diagnosis is evident. 
 Multiple symptoms or signs related to the same event should be reported as a single 
event, unless complications of the same event are considered medically relevant and 
not adequately captured in an existing AE. For example, the single AE ” influenza” 
should be reported rather than headache, cough, sore throat and myalgia if these 
symptoms are considered related to the infection. However, if the same patient 
develops renal failure due to severe dehydration with influenza, the renal failure should be reported as another AE. 
 The onset of the AE is the date of the first symptom or sign as noted by [CONTACT_76409] a 
care provider. For example, a patient ma y have a cough for several days followed by 
[CONTACT_353830]. The AE 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 33should be reported as “pneumonia”, with the onset being the date of the first symptom 
or sign (cough, in this case). 
 Worsening of pre-existing conditions should be reported with a description of the change 
in status. For example, “worsening allergic rhinitis” may be reported in a patient with a 
medical history that includes allergic rhinitis while reporting in “allergic rhinitis” in such 
an individual is not informative. 
 Lab or other test results outside the normal range should be reported as AEs if there are 
associated signs or symptoms or further evaluation or more frequent monitoring is 
required. Isolated lab findings may be reported as such (e.g., hypokalemia) if no 
diagnosis is apparent while lab abnormalities associated with a reported AE should not 
be reported unless they are of independent signifi cance. For example, leukocytosis in a 
patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia should not be reported whereas leukocytosis (to >60,000 cells/ml
3) in a patient with pneumonia and potential hematologic malignancy 
should be reported. 
 Adverse events are reported by [CONTACT_353831] a diagnosis rather than the 
patient’s own words. Every effort should be made to report the patient’s description of an 
event, however clinical accuracy is paramount. For example, reporting “chest pain” with no 
treatment for the event on the case report form because the patient used the word “chest 
pain” but the physician ascribed the chest discomfort to gastroesophageal reflux for which 
the patient was already receiving treatment provides information that cannot be interpreted 
clinically. 
 Adverse events due to concurrent illnesses other than asthma may be grounds for 
withdrawal if the illness is considered signifi cant by [CONTACT_353832]. Participants experiencing minor intercurrent illnesses may continue in the study provided that the nature, severity, and 
duration of the illness are recorded and that any unscheduled medications required to treat 
the illness are also recorded. Examples of minor intercurrent illnesses include acute rhinitis, 
sinusitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis. 
Medications are allowed for treatment of thes e conditions in accordance with the judgment 
of the responsible study physician. 
 
C. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
An AE is serious if the event has had or may have any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
o Any events that are life threatening, or would have resulted in death in the 
absence of an intervention, must be reported as SAEs in addition to events that 
result in death. 
 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
o Any events that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353787].  
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 34o Events that are managed in an emergency room without resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353788] (e.g., life-threatening; 
required intervention to prevent permanent  impairment or damage; other serious 
medically important event) and reported as appropriate. 
 
 Disability or permanent damage 
o Any events that interfere with an individual’s ability to perform their usual 
functions or maintain their quality of life should be reported as SAEs. 
 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 
 Required an intervention to prevent disability or permanent damage 
 
 Medically important events 
o Events that do not meet any of the listed criteria for an SAE but are nevertheless 
medically significant should be reported as SAEs. A seizure or syncope may not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353789]. 
 
SAEs that are both unexpected (see Safety Plan section III.E above) and possibly related 
(see Section V.E. below) to study drug/intervention must be reported to the DCC 
expeditiously as described below. 
 
D. GRADING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
The severity of AEs should be determined according to the following scale: 
Severity Characterized by: 
[CONTACT_353833]’s ability to perform usual activities 
Moderate Event interferes with ability to perform usual activities 
Severe Event prevents the individual from performing usual activities 
 
It should be noted that severity and seriousness of AEs are separate assessments.  
E. DETERMINING RELATEDNESS 
 
The investigator must determine if an AE is “possibly related” or “not related” to the study drug or a study mandated procedure. Determinations should be based on the biologic 
plausibility, the temporal relationship, and the presence or absence of an alternative 
explanation for an AE. Events thought to be related to study drug with a high degree of 
certainty (e.g., temporal correlation between the administration of the drug and the onset of 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 35the AE with resolution after withholding treatment and recurrence following a challenge) 
should be reported as possibly related. In the context of an alternative explanation (e.g., 
recent introduction of a concomitant medication known to be associated with the event, with 
resolution of the event after discontinuing the concomitant medication and continuing study drug), AEs should be reported as not related. In general, most events without an alternative 
explanation should be reported as “possibly related”. 
 
F. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
As with all study data, AEs should be reported in a timely fashion. Specific expedited safety reporting requirements are applicable as follows: 
 
 Any SAE which is both suspected of being related to study drug or a study mandated 
procedure and is unexpected must be reported to the DCC within 7 calendar days. 
 
 Any AE which is both suspected of being related to study drug or a study mandated 
procedure and suggests a level of risk to study participants that was previously 
unrecognized or unknown must be reported to the DCC within 30 calendar days. 
 
 Pregnancy requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_440539] be followed (and documented on case report forms) until one of the 
following criteria is met: 
 
 Resolution 
 
 A documented plan for further evaluation and management, including the overseeing 
care provider, is provided. 
 
 The event is considered and documented to be stable and adequately managed, though 
ongoing. 
 
 
H. ADVERSE EVENTS RE LATED TO ASTHMA  
 
Asthma exacerbations 
Safety net procedures, including visits and frequent telephone contacts, are in place to 
identify participants who experience an asthma exacerbation during the study.  
 
Asthma exacerbations are severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_353790], 
defined by [CONTACT_319564]: 
 
1. Oral/injectable corticosteroid due to asthma 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 362.   Need for emergency treatment at a medical facility that is related to, or complicated by, 
the participant’s asthma and which results in systemic corticosteroid treatment or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353791], or can be brought to the attention of the sites by [CONTACT_3038]' action plans. 
 
Between in-person study visits (as described above), participants will be contact[CONTACT_353834] 8, 16, 24, 32, [ADDRESS_440540]. The coordinator will attempt to determine 
whether the participant is showing signs of as thma exacerbation using criteria identified 
below.   
Adjustments of Trial Medications a nd Rescue Algorithms  during Asthma 
Exacerbations  
 Participants who develop an exacerbation during the run-in period (pre-randomization) will 
be terminated from study enrollment and managed as  clinically-indicated, with treatment 
based on clinical standard and initiated by/in accordance with the participant’s usual asthma care provider. Once the asthma exacerbation has resolved for at least four weeks, the participant may be rescreened for entry into the study once. 
 
For participants who meet criteria for an exacerbation during the post-randomization phases 
of the study, prednisone will be prescribed at a pre-specified burst at 2 mg/kg/day for 2 days 
[maximum 60 mg/day], followed by 1 mg/k g/day for 2 days [maximum 30 mg/day].  
 For those participants experiencing worsening control as demonstrated by [CONTACT_164435], the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_353835], 
a clinic visit or follow up phone call is required. 
 
Prednisone Treatment   
Oral prednisone will be administered for the treatment of impending epi[INVESTIGATOR_353792](35). The decision concerning the 
initiation or continuation of a course of oral prednisone will be at the physician’s discretion, 
based upon criteria previously published by [CONTACT_3433] e ICAC.(13)  Prednisone should be prescribed 
if: 
 The participant used more than [ADDRESS_440541] bronchodilator or 6 puffs of albuterol (3 treatments of 2 puffs each) in the 
prior 4 hours for relief of asthma symptoms OR 
 The participant used [ADDRESS_440542] 24 hours for relief of asthma 
symptoms OR 
 The participant awakened due to cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 37wheezing AND needed to use albuterol at least 2 of the previous 3 nights OR 
 The participant used 8 or more puffs of albuterol per day during 2 of the previous 3 days 
for relief of asthma symptoms. 
The recommended prednisone dose for acute exac erbations is 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 
mg) as a single morning dose for two days fo llowed by 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 30 mg) as a 
single morning dose for two days.   All adm inistered doses should be rounded down to the 
nearest 5 mg. 
In order to limit variability in prednisone prescribing habits across multiple clinicians in the 
various AsthmaNet partnerships,(41) all providers will be educated regarding the above 
criteria for prednisone use. They will additionally be provided with a wallet-sized card for 
easy reference. The DCC will track the reasons for prednisone administration, particularly 
clinician discretion outside of the above criteria. The DCC will report to the steering 
committee if excess variability is occurring among sites, and an open discussion regarding 
these discrepancies will be utilized. This proces s has successfully been implemented in the 
NIAID Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC). 
  
Asthma Rescue Plan Algorithm 
 
Rescue Algorithm for Acute Loss of Asthma Control 
The approach to rescue medications will be based on the consensus report presented in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Guidelines(1).  Each patient will be given specific 
guidelines for decision-making and institution of rescue management (action plan).  Two 
medications, albuterol and/or oral prednis one, will be employed when increasing symptoms 
require treatment.  For a severe acute asthma exacerbation, patients will be medicated according to the best medical judgment of the treating physician (see above).  
Home care: 
Caretakers and patients will be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of an asthma exacerbation early so that prompt rescue treatment may be instituted and morbidity 
decreased. The onset of an asthma exacerbation will be recognized by [CONTACT_162012], dyspnea, chest tightness and/or wheezing that either  become more severe 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_353793], or they are severe enough on 
baseline therapy based on the following criteria. 
 
The threshold for defining entry into the red zone (i.e., exacerbation) will be determined 
based on the adequacy of the participant’s response to albuterol to treat these asthma 
symptoms. Patients who experience symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, and/or 
wheeze, will initiate use of albuterol (2 pu ffs) by [CONTACT_162013] 20 minutes for up to 1 hour and 
then every 4 hours if necessary.  If the patient’s symptoms persist after [ADDRESS_440543], a clinic visit may be necessary.  The initiation of oral prednisone therapy will 
be based on specific guidelines and on physician discretion. 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 38If symptoms are severe, the child has re tractions, evidence of cyanosis based on 
saturations on room air of < 90% based on pulse  oximetry, has evidenc e of increased work 
of breathing, shortness of breath and/or “air hunger”, the patient must seek immediate 
medical care  and should contact [CONTACT_5243]. 
Physician’s office or emergency room: 
In the primary physician’s office or emergency room, the patient with an acute asthma 
exacerbation will be treated with nebulized albuterol or high dose MDI albuterol (6-8 puffs 
every 20 minutes x three or more often if needed).  The dose of albuterol for the doctor-
supervised situation is 0.10 – 0.15 mg/kg up to 5 mg per treatment.  Albuterol can be 
delivered by [CONTACT_353836], and treatments will be given every 20 minutes for 
up to 3 treatments. If after 3 treatments, the child is not stable as described below, the 
physician may use additional albuterol treatments or other medications as is in his/her best 
clinical judgment.  The child will be assessed for general level of activity, color, pulse rate, 
use of accessory muscles and airflow obstruction determined by [CONTACT_162014], and FEV1 
and/or PEF before and after each bronchodilator treatment.  Measurement of oxygenation 
with a pulse oximeter may also be indicated for complete patient assessment during the 
acute exacerbation. The following assessments will also be made. 
 If the patient has a favorable response to initial albuterol nebulizer treatment (FEV1 
at least 80% predicted and/or PEF at least 80% post-randomization reference value), 
the patient will be observed for 1 hour prior to being discharged home with instructions to continue albuterol every 4 hours as needed and to report any decline in PEF and/or symptom fluctuation promptly. 
 If the patient does not improve (FEV1 less than 80% predicted or PEF less that 80% 
post-randomization reference value) after the initial albuterol nebulizer treatment, nebulized albuterol therapy will be continued for at least 2 more trials (for a total of 3 
times in 1 hour).  If the patient’s clinical symptoms are stabilized and FEV1 or PEF is 
between 50-80% of predicted or post-randomization reference value, the patient will be discharged home to continue use of albuterol (2 puffs every 4 hours) and to start a four-day course of oral prednisone. 
 If the patient’s FEV1 is less than 50% of predicted or PEF is less than 50% of post-
randomization reference value after 3 treatments with nebulized albuterol in 1 hour, the physician may use his/her best medical judgment to treat the patient.  Such 
clinical judgment may include the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353794]. 
 
 
Criteria for Study Withdrawal 
 
If a participant experiences 6 yellow zone courses in 12 months, they will be withdrawn from the study. Additionally, if a participant experiences 2 severe exacerbations treated with oral 
corticosteroids in 6 months or 3 within 12 months, they will be deemed a treatment failure 
and withdrawn from the study. Finally, if a participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353795] >24 hours, they will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 39I. UNBLINDING 
 
Unblinding to determine treatment group assignment in the event of medical necessity will 
be performed by [CONTACT_353837] [INVESTIGATOR_353796].  
 
 
VI. STUDY COMPLETION 
 
Study completion is defined by [CONTACT_294819], random ization, receipt of study drug/intervention 
and follow up through Visit 8. 
 
A. STUDY TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
 
Study treatment discontinuation occurs if the patient, Investigator, or Sponsor stop treatment 
prior to the last scheduled dose per protocol. Study treatment discontinuation does not 
necessarily result in early termination; a patient may continue study participation without 
receiving treatment if at least one dose/intervention has been received. 
 
B. EARLY TERMINATION 
 
Early termination occurs if the participant, Investigator, or the Sponsor does not permit the 
participant to complete the last scheduled study visit or assessment. By [CONTACT_108], early 
termination during the treatment period of the study will result in study treatment 
discontinuation.  
VII. STUDY SITES 
A. SITE RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
A single Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_353797]. 
 
B. INFORMED CONSENT 
 
The process of informed consent should be led by [CONTACT_353838] a res earch study to potential participants. Ideally, 
someone who is not directly involved in the patient’s usual clinical care should lead informed 
consent. The informed consent process must be completed before any study procedures 
can be performed for the purpose of this protocol. Verbal assent and written assent will be 
obtained based on age determined by [CONTACT_50810]. 
 
C. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
 
Each institution conducting research must have a federal wide assurance and an IRB registered with the Office of Human Research Subjects’ Protection prior to study 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 40participation. Individual IRB’s policies regarding reporting practices and communication must 
be adhered to throughout the conduct of the study.

 48APPENDIX D:  PROCEDURES FOR MEASURING HEIGHT  
Equipment and Standardization 
 
A Harpenden stadiometer, eit her wall-mounted (Holtain M odel #602VR) or portable 
(Holtain Model #603), will be used for hei ght measurements. M easurements will be 
in centimeters. The stadiometer will be calibrated daily. The wall-mounted stadiometer is calibrated 
by [CONTACT_353840]. The portable 
stadiometer is calibrated by [CONTACT_353841] r of the stadiometer. 
The stadiometer is designed so that if so mething breaks, it will be the counter. At 
least one extra counter should be available at all times. The stadiometer platform 
should be moved slowly; moving it too fast could cause it to break. 
Height Measurement Procedure 
 
Height will be measured in all children.  The child should be barefoot or wearing thin 
socks for the height measurem ent. Follow the steps below to obtain standing height: 
1. Raise the platform of the stadiometer well above the child's head. 
2. Have the child stand erect, with his/her back against the stadiometer. 
3. In positioning the child for measurement, start at the child's feet and go upward. 
4. The heels should touch the back of the stadiometer, with the ankles and feet 
touching each other. 
5. The knees should be straight and locked. 6. The heels, buttocks and shoulders should be against the stadiometer. 7. The arms should hang freely by [CONTACT_353842]. 
8. The operator may need to push in on the child's abdomen slightly to minimize 
lordosis. 
9. The child should look straight ahead and not raise his/her chin. 10. The middle of the ear and the corner of the eye shoul d be in a straight line. 
11. When standing properly, the child should take a deep breath, hold it, and 
maintain a fully erect position for the measurement. 
12. To make the measurement, lower the pl atform to the child's head; the operator 
should be at eye level with the child's head. 
13. Record the height in centimeters. 
AsthmaNet STICS Protocol 
 
 4914. The platform is lifted and the child  steps away from the stadiometer. 
15. Repeat these steps twice to obtain [ADDRESS_440545] their hair “high” since hair has to be flattened 
during the measurements. Younger children may need tw o operators (one can be a 
parent), with the second operator helpi[INVESTIGATOR_353803]'s feet flat on the ground 
since some children tend to stand on their toes.

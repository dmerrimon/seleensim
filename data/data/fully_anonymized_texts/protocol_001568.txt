08/31/2016   1. OBJECTIVES  
 
The overall objective is to evaluate the safety and toxicity of topi[INVESTIGATOR_873804] 1% gel to the breast in healthy 
women  at high risk for breast can cer and bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue . 
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1220373] a trial to determine the recommended phase II dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_873804] 1% (w/w) gel for 
evaluation in healthy women. This will be determined by [CONTACT_873834][INVESTIGATOR_873805] (tested at three different dose levels  by [CONTACT_517382] , 10 mg (1  mL) every other day, 
10 mg (1 mL) daily, or 20  mg (2 mL) daily  to an unaffected breast of healthy wome n at high risk for breast 
cancer for a duration of [ADDRESS_1220374] an intervention of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1% bexarotene gel to an unaffected breast of healthy women at high 
risk for breast cancer for 4 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined during the dose 
escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue.

3. To investigate the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_873806]:  
i. Lipid Biomarke rs (Total Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL)  
ii. Thyroid Function Biomarkers (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), T4, T3)  
iii. Calcium  
 
1.3 Exploratory Objective (Dose Expansion Group)  
 To examine changes in gene expression associated with retinoid action.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1220376] common malignancy among women in the US, and prevention of this disease is 
therefore a major public health concern. Chemoprevention with anti -estrogens, including tamoxifen, raloxifene, 
and exemestane, has been shown to reduce the  incidence of hormone receptor (HR) -positive breast cancer. 
However, agents that can reduce the incidence of hormone receptor negative breast cancer are currently lacking.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1220377] been shown to be invo lved in cell differentiation, growth, and 
apoptosis  (1). They exert their effects by [CONTACT_873835] (RAR ) and retinoic X receptors (RXR).  Once activated, RARs and RXRs form heterodimers and 
function as transcription factors and subsequently bind to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and regulate 
DCP Protocol Number  MDA2016 -08-02 
Protocol Version 14, Date d 4/27/2021 
 
DCP Protocol Template Version 8.5 –8– 
08/31/2016   gene expression regulating cell differentiation, growth, a nd apoptosis  (2, 3) . Rexinoids are similar agents but 
only activate the RXR receptors without activating the RAR nuclear receptors. Bexarotene is a rexinoid that 
has been studied extensively and is currently an FDA approved treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma  
(CTCL) . 
 
Oral bexarotene was evaluated in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for refractory or persistent early stage CTCL. 
Duvic  et al. randomized 58 patients to two doses of bexarotene at 6.5mg/m2 per day and 650mg/m2 per day 
which was later modified to 300mg/m2 per day for at least 16 weeks or until progression. Responses of greater 
than 50% improvement in skin lesions were noted  in 20% of patients at 6.5mg/m2 and 54% of patients had a 
response at  300mg/m2 and 67% of patients at doses greater than 300mg/m2. Seventy -three percent of patients 
that crossed over from 6.5mg/m2 to higher doses responded with the increased dose. H ypertri glyceridemia, 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], headache, and hypothyroidism were noted in a significant number of patients and were 
reversible with discontinuation of drug. Since increased toxicity was noted at dose level greater than 300mg/m2, 
recommended dose is 300mg/m2 in patients with refractory CTCL (4). 
 
Bexarotene has been developed as a gel and has been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with early stage 
CTCL . Based on the positive results of these studies, topi[INVESTIGATOR_873807] . In phase I and II trials conducted by [CONTACT_873836], topi[INVESTIGATOR_873808] 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% bexarotene gel. 
Patients started at the lowest concentration and applied the gel to affected skin lesions daily and titrated to twice 
daily dosing after 2 weeks and were tolerating the medicati on. As patients were able to tolerate gel application, 
bexarotene concentration was increased to 0.5% and then 1% and applying gel up to [ADDRESS_1220378] patients were able to tolerate 1% gel at twice daily dosing. The total dosage each pat ient received depended 
on the size and the number of lesions.  Bexarotene gel was well tolerated and the most frequent adverse events 
in 67 patients were rash (73%), prurit us (33%), and pain (24%) with most being mild to moderate in severity. 
Systemic concentrations of bexarotene were extremely low and systemic side effects noted with oral bexarotene 
such as hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypothyroidism, and hypertriglyceridemia were not detected when medication was 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (5). Bexarotene 1% gel was also evaluated in a PhaseI/II trial for alopecia areata and was 
applied to half of participants’ scalp to assess response. Out of 42 patients,  31 (73%) experienced some dermal 
irritation with only [ADDRESS_1220379] common adverse event noted was 
mild erythema in the area of treatment that resolved with discontinuation of the drug  (6). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1220380] cancers, bexarotene showed significant activity in 
delaying mammary tumor development. In p53 -null mice, bexarotene was given at 10mg/kg and 100mg/kg by 
[CONTACT_873837] a 75% reduction in mammary tumor development was found in virgin mice at the higher 
dose level (7). In mouse mamm ary tumor virus (MMTV) -ErbB2 transgenic mice, focal tumors develop at eight 
months. Similar to humans, (MMTV) -ErbB2 mice undergo a multistage process of mammary tumorigenesis 
that progresses from normal mammary tissue to hyperplasia, mammary intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l neoplasia (MIN) and 
finally invasive cancer. Li and colleagues gave bexarotene at 100mg/kg by [CONTACT_27176] 2 to 4 months in 
MMTV -erbB2 transgenic mice starting at three months of age. They found that bexarotene prevented the 
development of premalignan t mammary lesions such as hyperplasia and MIN that is similar to human ductal 
carcinoma in situ (8). 
 
Based on these preclinical findings, oral bexarotene  at 200mg/m2 has been evaluated in women at high risk for 
breast cancer based on their genetic risk. Bexarotene was found to reduce cyclin D1 RNA expression in breast 
cells from postmenopausal women  (9). A nonsignificant reduction in Ki -[ADDRESS_1220381]-menopausal women. Significant systemic side effects such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, 
and hypothyroidism were also found and were reversible after discontinuation of the drug (9). These results 
demonstrated that bexarote ne has a biological effect on breast cells in women at high risk of breast cancer.

08/31/[ADDRESS_1220382] cancer cells, bexarotene has shown effects on cyclin D1 in lung 
cancer cell lines. Dragnev et al. showed that the combination  of bexarotene  1-4µmol/L  plus erlotinib 1-4µmol/L  
significantly decreased cyclin D1 expression in cyclin -E- and KRAS/p53 -driven transgenic lung cancer cell 
lines. The combination of bexarotene 400mg/m2 per day plus erlotinib 150mg daily was evaluated in early stage 
non-small cell lung cancer patients in a window of opportunity trial and significant decreases in cyclin D1 were 
noted as well as an induction of necrosis and inflammatory responses (10).  
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_873809]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_873810]. Mauvais -Jarvis and colleagues evaluated trans -4-
hydroxytamoxifen (4 -OHT), a n active metabolite of tamoxifen, by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_873811]. They 
evaluated [ADDRESS_1220383] and delayed plasma concentrations of 4 -OHT when compared to application on the abdomen  
(11). 
 
Rouanet et al.  evaluated [ADDRESS_1220384] cancer. Patients applied 4 -OHT for 2 to 3 weeks at various dose levels compared to another group 
receiving oral tamoxifen at 20mg/day. They found that tissue proliferation decreased as measured by [CONTACT_15915] -67 
levels between baseline and after treatment. There was a significant decrease in proliferation in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_873812] (12). Lee and 
colleagues evaluated 4 -OHT in women with DCIS for 6 to 10 weeks prior to surgery. Women were randomized 
to either 4 -OHT (4mg/day) or oral tamoxifen (20mg/day) and assessed change in Ki -[ADDRESS_1220385] skin reactions than 4 -OHT (13). 
 
We hypothesize that topi[INVESTIGATOR_873813] a chemoprevention agent with 
penetration to the breast tissue and without havin g high systemic levels of drug and subsequent side effects and 
toxicity as seen with oral bexarotene. Data from chemoprevention studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_873814] l activity in the tissue. 
Preclinical models have clearly shown the effect of bexarotene in reducing the incidence of estrogen receptor 
negative breast cancer. Based on this data, we propose a phase I study to evaluate topi[INVESTIGATOR_873815].  
 
Rationale for including Alcohol and Tobacco Assessment Questionnaires  
Increasing evidence suggests that tobacco and alcohol use are risk factors in the development of intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_873816]. In addition, tobacco and alcohol use may adversely affect agent intervention, for example 
by [CONTACT_873838] a drug. Standardized assessments of tobacco and alcohol use 
during clinical trials will aid in understanding the potential relationship between the use of these products and 
clinical endpoints or cancer prevention biomarkers. Therefore, NC I, DCP is including assessment of tobacco 
and alcohol use at baseline and (include follow -up timepoint), to determine the potential impact of tobacco and

3. SUMMARY OF STUDY PLAN  
 
A. Dose Escalation Group  
We will recruit women at high risk for breast cancer to this phase I study. We will use topi[INVESTIGATOR_873804] 1% 
gel and this will be applied to one unaffected breast for 4 weeks. Participants will be ass igned to one of three 
different dose levels . Bexarotene gel volume  is estimated to be 1ml for 1g of gel which contains 10mg of 
bexarotene. Therefore, the three dose cohorts will be 10mg (1ml)  every other day, 1 0mg (1ml) daily, 2 0mg 
(2ml) daily. Dose Limiti ng Toxicity (DLT) is defined as a grade [ADDRESS_1220386] “3+3” design will be applied. The first three participants will be  assigned to the 
lowest dose level. New cohorts of 3 -4 participants  will not be treated until toxicity has been evaluated for all 
current participants  for 4 weeks.  Group assignment algorithm is explained in Section 13.4  and dose escalation 
is illustrated in Figure 1 .  The Maximum Tolerated Dose  (MTD)  will be defined as the highest dose level with  
at most 2 participants  with DLT in 10  participants  treated.   
 
Figure 1: Dose Escalation Schema for Bexarotene 1% gel  
 
 
 
 
Bexarotene gel will be provided by [CONTACT_873839]. Participants will begin application of the gel to the upper 
outer and upper inner quadrants of one breast every other day for one week and then increase to daily for 3 
weeks if  they are assigned to daily dosing arm. If participants are assigned to every other day dosing, they will 
continue in this manner for the entire 4 weeks. Participants that are assigned to 20 mg  (2ml)  daily will first start 
with application of 10mg  (1ml)  to the breast every other day for 1 week, then increase to 10mg (1ml) daily for 
1 week, and then increase to 20mg (2ml) daily for the remaining [ADDRESS_1220387] biopsy of the upp er outer or inner quadrant at the end of study 
treatment and receive compensation for additional expenses associated with the biopsy, such as additional travel 
expenses, time missed from work or other expenses associated with the biopsy visit . All particip ants will need

up phone call from the site investigator or designee 30 days ± [ADDRESS_1220388] 
dose level due to concerns for toxicity. MTD i s 10mg/breast/every other day.  
 
B. Dose Expansion Group

bexarotene gel  per pump.  Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 1 bexarotene gel canister  contain ing 30  reliable doses . 
Cohort 3 will receive 2 bexarotene gel canister s contain ing 30  reliable doses each for a total of 60 reliable doses. 
The expansion cohort will receive either 1  or 2 bexarotene gel canister s depending on the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) as determined during the dose escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the 
breast tissue.  
 
 
5.2 Gel Administration/ Run-in Procedures   
 
Each Bexarotene gel cani ster will contain [ADDRESS_1220406] metered to dispense 1mL per actuation, 
1g of bexarotene gel per actuation. One gram of bexarotene gel contains 10mg of active bexarotene.  
 
Participants in all dose levels will be instructed to apply the gel at 10mg  (1 mL)  every other day to one 
unaffected breast for the first 7 days of treatment. After the Day 8 phone call  and confirmation that toxicity is 
at an acceptable range, participants assigned to 1 0mg/breast/daily will increase applications to daily. 
Participants assigned to 1 0mg/breast/eve ry other day will continue to apply gel every other day.  Participants 
assigned to 20mg/breast/daily will increase from  10mg (1mL)  every other day to daily application for another 
7 days. After the Day 15 visit and confirmation of acceptable toxicity, parti cipants will increase to 20mg (2 
mL) to the one unaffected breast daily for the remaining [ADDRESS_1220407] as directed for a duration of 4 weeks.  Participants in the dose expansion group wil l 
apply the gel with the same ramp up schedule as those in the dose escalation group for that dose level.  
 
Participants will also receive moisturizing lotion [CeraVe] that can be applied to the breast to reduce and prevent 
redness that can be related from the study drug. CeraVe will be provided to all participants  and they will be 
instructed to apply to the treated breast in the evening or at least [ADDRESS_1220408] limit vitamin A intake to <5,000 IU/day. Participants

6. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
6.1 Bexarotene  (IND #, NCI, Division of Cancer Prevention )   
 
Targretin® (bexarotene) 1% gel contains bexarotene and is inten ded for topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407] . Bexarotene is a 
member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors 
have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4 -[1-(5,6,7,8 -
tetrahydro -3,5,5,8,8 -pentamethyl -2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as 
follows:  
 
Bexarotene is an off -white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of 
C24H28O2. It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Bexarotene gel is a 
clear gelled solution containing 1.0% (w/w) bexarotene in a base of dehydrated alcohol, USP, polyethylene 
glycol 400, NF, hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF, and butylated hydroxytoluene, NF.  
 
Plasma concentrations of bexarotene were determined during clinical studies in pati ents with CTCL or 
following repeated single or multiple -daily dose applications of bexarotene gel 1% for up to 132 weeks. Plasma 
bexarotene concentrations were generally less than 5 ng/mL and did not exceed 55 ng/mL. However, only two 
patients with very in tense dosing regimens (> 40% BSA lesions and QID dosing) were sampled. Plasma 
bexarotene concentrations and the frequency of detecting quantifiable plasma bexarotene concentrations 
increased with increasing percent body surface area treated and i ncreasing quantity of bexarotene  gel applied. 
The sporadically -observed and generally low plasma bexarotene concentrations indicated that, in patients 
receiving doses of low to moderate intensity, there is a low potential for significant plasma concentrations 
follow ing repeated application of bexarotene gel.  Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins.  The 
plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace 
drugs bound to plasma proteins and the abi lity of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied.  
The uptake of bexarotene by [CONTACT_873844].  
 
 
Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma following oral administration of bexarotene: [ADDRESS_1220411] that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the 
major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative 
metabolites may be glucuronidated.  The oxidative me tabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor

08/31/[ADDRESS_1220412] which is approximately 
1% of the body surface area. The mean duration of therapy for these [ADDRESS_1220413] 10% in patients with CTCL 
were rash, pruritus, skin disorder, and pain. Adverse events leading to dose reduction or study drug 
discontinuation in at least two patients were rash, contact [CONTACT_8748], and pruritus.  
Of the 49 patients (98%) who experienced any adverse event, most experienced events categorized as mild (9 
patients, 18%) or moderate (27 patients, 54%).  There were 12 patients (24%) who experienced at least one 
moderately severe adverse eve nt.  The most common moderately severe events were rash (7 patients, 14%) and 
pruritus (3 patients, 6%).  Only one patient (2%) experienced a severe adverse event (rash). In the patients with 
CTCL receiving bexarotene  gel, adverse events reported regardles s of relationship to study drug at an incidence  
of ≥5% are presented in Table 2 (5).

8. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITION  
 
8.1 Primary Endpoint : Toxicity and Safety  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1% bexarotene gel 
application to the breasts of healthy women at high risk for breast cancer for duration of [ADDRESS_1220434] cancer survivors (DCIS or invasive) ≥ 5 years from their diagnosis, BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_1220435] cancer ≥1.7% in 5 years or lifetime risk ≥20% will 
be recruited. Three dose levels are considered (1 0mg every other day, 1 0mg daily, and 20mg daily). Dose 
Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as a grade  [ADDRESS_1220436] “3+3” design will be applied. The f irst cohort of [ADDRESS_1220437] dose level 
(10mg every othe r day). New cohorts of participants  will not be treated until toxicity has been  fully evaluated 
for all current participants  for 4 weeks. We  will add another 4 participants  when only 1 or less participants  
experience DLT in 6 treated participants .  We will  only escalate dose to the next higher level when 20% or less 
of total participants  experience a DLT . At any dose level, the algorithm is as follows:  
 
(1) If 0 or 1 out of 3 participants  experience DLTs (≤1/3), an additional cohort of 3 participants  will be 
treated at the same dose level. If total number of participants  experiencing DLT at that dose level is 1 
or less out of 6 (≤ 1/6), we will enroll another 4 at the same dose level.  
(2) If at any time 2 or more  participants  experience DLTs in 3 or 6 (≥ 2/3 or ≥ 2 /6) or 3 or more  experience 
DLT in 10 participants  (≥3/10), then the dose escalation will stop, and the next lower dose will be 
considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
(3) In 10 participants  at each dose level, if we observe 2 or less DLTs, a cohort o f 3 will be treated at the 
next higher level.   If 3 or more in 10 participants  experience DLT, we will stop accrual to that level and 
above, and claim the regimen as to be too toxic for that level or above.

DCP Protocol Template Version 8.5 –26– 
08/31/[ADDRESS_1220438] 20% exceeds 70%, i.e., Pr(DLT rate >=0.20 | 
Data) >70%, given the prior of the DLT rate of beta (0.2, 0.8), we will stop the trial and claim the dose is too 
toxic.     Given the above rule, the boundaries for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_873821]/Total Number of Participa nts >= 4/11~14, 5/15~19, and 6/20.   Combining with the 
boundaries during dose escalation phase, i.e., stop accrual at the dose level if Total Number of Participants  with 
DLTs/Total Number of Participants  >= 2/3, 2/6, 3/10, 4/11~14, 5/15~19, and 6/20, the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_873822] 15%, 51%, 82% if the true DLT rate is 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30, respectively.  
 
Given that there are [ADDRESS_1220439] been defined in Section 5.5 to guide management of  
participant experiences of an adverse event   
 
CTCAE criteria for skin will be modified (Table 3) for this study  as adverse events are expected to be localized 
to the breast area. This modified criteria was also utilized by [CONTACT_873849]. when they evaluated bexarotene 1% 
gel on the scalp of participants  with alopecia areata (6). Please see Table [ADDRESS_1220440] is considered 25% of the treated area so they can 
clearly describe their symptoms and the extent of the affe cted area.  They will also be instructed to draw around 
reddened areas so they can clearly see if an area is expanding or improving and relay that information to the 
study team.

8.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
8.2.1  Markers of Systemic Toxicity:  Based on data from oral bexarotene in women at high risk for breast 
cancer, bexarotene alters lipid levels, thyroid function, and calcium levels. Therefore, serum biomarkers to be 
tested will be  Total Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, TSH, free T4, free T3, and calc ium. Evaluation and 
changes in these biomarkers will be done at baseline , 15, and Day 28 visits.  
 
8.2.2  Bexarotene Concentration : Bexarotene concentration will be determined using LC -MS/MS (5500 or 
similar; AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA) according to methods d eveloped and qualified at IIT  Research Institute 
(IITRI)  for the study.

11. REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
DEFINITION: AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with participation in a study, whether or not related to that 
participation. This includes all deaths that occur while a participant is on a study.  
 
Please note th at all abnormal clinical laboratory values that are determined to be of clinical significance based 
on a physician’s assessment are to be reported as AEs. Those labs determined to be of no clinical significance 
or of unknown clinical significance (per the physician’s assessment) should not be reported as AEs. Any lab 
value of unknown clinical significance should continue to be investigated/followed -up further for a final 
determination, if possible.  
 
A list of AEs that have occurred or might occur  can be fo und in §6.2 Reported Adverse Events and Potential 
Risks , as well as the Investigator Brochure or package insert.  
 
 
11.1 Adverse Events  
 
11.1.1  Reportable AEs  
 
All AEs that occur after the informed consent is signed and baseline assessments are completed (including run -
in) must be recorded on the AE CR F (paper and/or electronic) whether or not related to study agent.  
 
11.1.2  AE Data Elements:  
 
The following data elements are required for AE reporting.

• Severity grade  
• Attribution to study agent (relatedness)  
• Whether or not the event was reported as a SAE  
• Whether or not the subject dropped due to the event  
• Outcome of the event  
 
11.1.3  Severity of AEs  
   
[IP_ADDRESS]   Identify the AE using the CTCAE version 4.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology 
(MedDRA lowest level term) and a grading scale for each AE listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
AEs will be assessed according to the grade associated with the CTCAE  term. AEs that do not have a 
corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE 
v4.0. as stated below.  
 
 
CTCAE v4.0 general severity guidelines:  
 
Grade  Severity  Description  
1 Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;  
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living

This study will report clinical data using the Data Management Initiative (DMI) web -based application managed 
by [CONTACT_873851] m Biostatistics and Data Management Core.  Data Management Initiative (DMI) infrastructure 
has been developed in the Division of Quantitative Sciences (DQS), MD Anderson Cancer Center.  This 
infrastructure supplies integrated database and software services  for web -based data collection, randomized 
treatment assignment, reporting, query, data download, and data quality management.  The DMI will be the 
database of record for the protocol and subject to NCI and FDA audit.  All DMI users will be trained to use the 
DMI system and will comply with the instructions in the protocol -specific “DMI User Manual” as well as 
applicable regulatory requirements such as 21 CFR; Part 11.  Data management procedures for this protocol 
will adhere to the Data Management Plan (DM P) on file at the DCP for contract HHSN261201200034I.  
 
 
12.2 Case Report Forms  
 
Participant data will be collected using protocol -specific case report forms (CRF) developed from the standard 
set of DCP Chemoprevention CRF Templates and utilizing NCI -approv ed Common Data Elements (CDEs). 
The study will utilize  electronic CRF (e -CRF) only, which will be viewed as screens in the DMI application. 
Site staff will enter data into the e -CRF in DMI. CRF amendments will be submitted to the DCP Protocol 
Information O ffice for review and approval.  Approved changes will be programmed into the DMI database by

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION S 
 
13.1 Study Design/Description  
 
This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of bexarotene 1% gel in healthy women  at elevated 
risk for breast cancer . A phase I dose escalation trial was designed to test the safety of three different dose levels 
and ensure the lowest dose level is safe prior to enrollment into the second dose level and so forth. Please see

DCP Protocol Template Version 8.5 –37– 
08/31/2016    
 
13.2 Randomization/Stratification  
 
A conservative modification of the standard “3+3” design will be applied. The first three participants will be 
assigned to the lowest dose level.  New cohorts of 3 -4 participants  will not be treated until toxicity has been 
evaluated for all current particip ants for 4 weeks.  Group assignment  algorithm  is explained in Section 13.4 . 
 
 
 
 
13.3 Accrual and Feasibility  
 
Treatment will be initiated in 10 participants per group up to 40 participants. Participants found eligible but 
who withdraw without initiating tr eatment will be replaced and will not be followed or evaluable for DLTs.  We 
plan to screen (consent) 60 participants to enroll  (initiate treatment in)  up to 40 participants.  Our estimated 
screen out rate after consent prior to study participation  is approximately 25%.  We anticipate accrual of approx. 
3 participants per month. Since accrual is done in groups of 3 -4 participants, there will be a 4 week hold in 
accrual to assess for toxicity  in the currently enrolled participants. Assumi ng that all dose levels are maximally 
accrued to, there will be 9 months of intentional hold on accrual to assess for safety and toxicity. Therefore, it 
will take approximately 21 months to complete accrual to the three dose levels and an additional 4 mont hs to 
accrue to the dose expansion cohort.  
 
 
 
13.4 Primary Objective, Endpoint(s), Analysis Plan  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1% bexarotene gel 
application to the breasts of healthy women at high risk for breast cancer for a duration of [ADDRESS_1220459] cancer survivors (DCIS or invasive) ≥ 5 years from their diagnosis, BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_1220460] cancer ≥1.7% in 5 years or lif etime risk ≥20%  will 
be recruited. Three dose levels are considered (10mg every other day, 10mg daily, and 20mg daily). Dose 
Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as a grade [ADDRESS_1220461] “3+3” design will be applied. The first c ohort of [ADDRESS_1220462] dose level 
(10mg every other day). New cohort of participants  will not be treated until toxicity has been fully evaluated 
for all current participants  for 4 weeks. We  will add another 4 participants  when only 1 or less participants  
experience DLT in 6 treated participants .  We will only escalate dose to the next higher level when 20% or less 
of total participants  experience DLT. At any dose level, the algorithm is as follows:  
 
(1) If 0 or 1 out of 3 participants  experience DLTs (≤1/3), an additional cohort of 3 participants  will be 
treated at the same dose level. If total number of participants  experiencing DLT at that dose level is 1 
or less out of 6 (≤ 1/6), we will enroll another 4 participants the sam e dose level.  
(2) If at any time 2 or more participants  experiences DLTs in 3 or 6 participants  (≥ 2/3 or ≥ 2/6) or 3 or 
more participants  experience DLT in 10 participants  (≥3/10), then the dose escalation will stop, and the 
next lower dose will be considere d as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
(3) In 10 participants  at each dose level, if we observe 2 or less DLTs, a cohort of 3 participants  will be 
treated at the next higher level.   If 3 or more in 10 participants  experience DLT, we will stop accrual to 
that level and above, and claim the regimen as to be too toxic for that level or above.

08/31/[ADDRESS_1220463] 20% exceeds 70%, i.e., Pr(DLT rate >=0.20 | 
Data) >70%, given the prior of the DLT rate of beta (0.2, 0.8), we will stop the trial and claim the dose is too 
toxic.     Given the abov e rule the boundaries for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_873829]/Total Number of Participants  >= 4/11~14, 5/15~19, and 6/20.   Combining with the 
boundaries during dose escalation phase, i.e., stop accrual at the dos e level if Total Number of Participants  with 
DLTs/Total Number of Participants  >= 2/3, 2/6, 3/10, 4/11~14, 5/15~19, and 6/20, the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_873822] 15%, 51%, 82% if the true DLT rate is 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30, respectively.  
 
Given that there are 3 dose levels and 10 participants  enrolled  and treated  at each level, and 10 additional 
patients at MTD, it is anticipated that 40 participants will be treated  and up to 40 will be evalua ble at the end 
of this study.  
 
 
At the end of the study, the toxicity data will be summarized for each dose level using frequency tabulation.  
The compliance of treatment application for each dose level will be presented using descriptive statistics.  
 
 
13.5  Secondary Objectives, Endpoints, Analysis Plans  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
1. To detect bexarotene concentration in the serum at baseline  and at [ADDRESS_1220464] tissue at 4 weeks of treatment  in the dose escalation 
group . 
3. To investigate th e effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_873830]:  
i. Lipid Biomarkers (Total Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL)  
ii. Thyroid Function Biomarkers (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), T4, T3)  
iii. Calcium  
 
These measurements will be summarized using mean, standard deviation and median (range) for continuous 
variables at each time point. Wilcoxon rank -sum test may be used to examine the difference of continuous 
variables between participants ’ characteristics groups. Participants ’ demographic characteristics will be 
compared between different dose levels by [CONTACT_80094] -sum and Fisher’s exact test for continuous and 
categorical variables, respectively.  In order to explore the changes over time, values of bexarotene 
concentration and biomarkers in serum will be plotted as functions of time (baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 
4). Linear mixed effect model will be applied to model the biomarker change over time for all participants .  
Appropriate transformation an d regression model will be used to ensure the model fit. Estimated bexarotene 
concentration mean in the breast tissue at 4 weeks will be calculated along with a 95% confidence interval. 
Other statistical methods may be applied when appropriate.  
 
 
13.6 Reporting  and Exclusions

08/31/[ADDRESS_1220465] be assessed for respons e to intervention, even if there are major 
protocol deviations or if they are ineligible.  
 
All of the participants who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who did not   receive 
study agent) will be included in the main analy sis. All conclusions regarding secondary efficacy measures 
requiring breast biopsies will be based on eligible participants  selecting this option . 
 
Subanalyses may be performed on the subsets of participants, excluding those for whom major protocol 
deviati ons have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of intervention, 
major protocol violations, etc.). However, subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions 
concerning efficacy, and the reasons for excl uding participants from the analysis should be clearly reported. 
For all measurements of response, the 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.  
 
 
13.9 Interim Analysis  
 
There is continual  interim analysis in a modified 3+3 design for this study.

GEL APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS  
 
1. Flammable: do not apply near fire, flame or heat, or while smoking  
 
2. Apply the gel to your breast after bathing, preferably in the morning and at approximately the same time each 
day. Apply approximately [ADDRESS_1220474] prime it by 
[CONTACT_873857] (point the spout toward a sink or wastebasket and 
do not use the first dos e, which may be incorrect).  
 
4. Once the bottle is primed, hold it in one hand and place the palm of your other hand under the pump to catch 
the gel. Be sure to press down completely on the pump and release it completely to dispense one dose of gel.  
 
5. Apply one dose of gel to one breast (dosage is indicated on the bottle label). Do not apply more or less than 
one dose to the breast. If you are assigned to the 20mg dose level (which requires two (2) pumps ), be sure to 
release the pump completely between both actuations  (pumps) . Application of gel will always be to only one 
breast and the same breast each time. Do not alternate doses between breasts.  
 
6. If you accidentally pump more than is needed, please discard this dose and try agai n to get the correct dose. 
If you do discard pumped doses, please record this on your Gel D iary.  
 
7. Spread the gel evenly over the upper outer and upper inner quadrant of your breast, without rubbing. Start 
from above the areola and spread outwards to be low the clavicle and  up to the midsternal edge  which is the 
midline of your chest . Avoid spreading the gel in the nipple and areola area of the breast.  Avoid spreading the 
gel below the nipple or underneath the breast.  Please see diagram below.  
 
 
 
8. Wash  your hands immediately after applying the gel.  
 
9. Allow the gel on your breast to air dry for 2 minutes and then immediately cover with clothing (the gel is 
colorless and will not stain your clothing). Do not expose your bare breasts to sunlight or ultraviolet light 
(tanning beds) at any time while on the study.  
10. Do not apply any other cream, lotion or moisturizer to your breast immediately after application of the study 
drug.  
 
11. Do not wash your breast or immerse in water (bath, swim) for at l east 4 hours following application of the

08/31/[ADDRESS_1220475] the cap on the bottle.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
 
1. Be sure to apply after bathing or showering, each day during the study and preferably in the morning.  
 
2. You may use CeraVe  moisturizing cream , a moisturizer that will be supplied to you, to apply to the same 
breast that you are applying the study gel. CeraVe  moisturizing cream can be used in the evening or at least [ADDRESS_1220476]  moisturizing cream can be 
applied daily to help with any skin redness.  
 
3. If you forget to apply a dose, do not double the dose to “catch up”.   
 
If you are applying the gel daily :  If your next dose is scheduled within the next [ADDRESS_1220477] to wait; 
if it is more than 12 hours until your next dose, apply the dose you missed and resume your normal dosing after 
that.  
 
If you are applying the gel every other day : If your next dose is scheduled within the next [ADDRESS_1220478] to wait; if it is more than [ADDRESS_1220479] betwe en the application area and the skin of other individuals 
(i.e. your child, your sexual partner, or other persons). If necessary, skin contact [CONTACT_873858]. As noted above, you must wait at least [ADDRESS_1220480].  
5.  Avoid using sprays containing DEET (i.e. bug spray) to the treated area and limit vitamin A intake to <[ADDRESS_1220481] day of use on the bottle label.  
 
8. If the pump doesn’t come back up correctly or if there’s no gel delivered when you press down on the pump, 
notify your doctor immediately. A replacemen t bottle will be shipped to you.  
 
9. After the end of study treatment, be sure to take back to your doctor all the gel bottles you have been given 
(even if empty or not used). This is very important for the success of the study .  
 
10. If any ulcerations, blisters or open areas start please notify the research team the next day for guidance.  
 
STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS:  
 
1. Keep your gel bottles in a cool room temperature - 59°F to 77°F .  
 
2. Keep the gel bottles out of the reach of children.

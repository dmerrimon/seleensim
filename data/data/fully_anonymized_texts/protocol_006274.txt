Study Overview
Background
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating problem among  women. 
A practical clinical definition of CPP is non-cyclical  pelvic pain that is  of at least 6 
months duration1.   CPP occurs below the umbilicus and is severe enough to cause 
functional impairment  or require  treatment.   CPP affects  approximately 15% of women 
and the health  care burden  is substantial.  The  direct cost of physician/clinician visits  is 
estimated to be over $[ADDRESS_709659] work is  estimated at 
$[ADDRESS_709660]  diagnosis  and subsequent improvement in their 
symptoms3, 4.  Depending on the treating specialists, patients may be diagnosed with  
bladder pain syndrome/interstitial  cystitis (BPS/IC), endometriosis, vulvodynia, or 
irritable bowel syndrome.   A definitive  diagnosis may be lacking in up to 60% of 
patients seeking treatment for CPP5.  Patients  with CPP report that their  quality of life is 
diminished and their relationships  with loved ones are often damaged6, 7.  They may 
have lost their job as a result of missed work days or inability to function appropriately 
due to pelvic pain symptoms.  
The musculoskeletal system  is an important factor in  chronic pelvic pain, specifically  
the persistent and refractory type8.  Myofascial  pain and hypertonic  pelvic floor 
dysfunction are present in as many  as 85% of patients with bladder pain  
syndrome/interstitial cystitis and/or  chronic  pelvic pain syndromes9. The pelvic floor 
muscles are arranged  in deep  and superficial layers and act as a sling to support the 
pelvic organs and the bones  and ligaments of the pelvis  provide support to the pelvic 
muscles. The deep levator ani muscles, often referred to  as the pelvic diaphragm, are 
the most important of the pelvic  floor muscles and consist of the pubococcygeus, 
iliococcygeus, and the coccygeus.  The  main function of the muscles are  to control 
continence and both bowel and urine  elimination. 
 An important  concept  to understand when treating pelvic pain is that of  cross-system  
interactions.  This  is a loss of peripheral  specificity when a stimulus arrives in the 
central nervous system making  it difficult  to sort out the exact source of the stimulus10.  
In the case of pelvic  floor dysfunction,  the levator muscles may be stretched and 
irritated but the patient may perceive  it as bladder pain  or vaginal pain.  Studies have  
IRB NUMBER: 2015-008
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/12/[ADDRESS_709661]  been described.  These  hyperirritable 
bands of muscle can be palpated through the vaginal walls.  They  are often knot- like or 
taut and are painful on compression, reproducing  the patient’s pain symptoms12,13.   
Trigger points  are thought to be discreet  areas of abnormal muscle spasms whereas  
high-tone pelvic floor muscle dysfunction (HT-PFD) refers  to a more global pelvic floor  
hypertonicity causing diffuse spasm of the levator complex14. Both have been  
implicated in chronic pelvic pain but in our experience, patients  with chronic pelvic pain  
present with more global  pelvic  floor hypertonia than one area of tenderness  as the 
term trigger point would  suggest.  
Prior studies of treatments directed towards hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction in 
women with CPP have  been promising. In a recent NIH-funded multicenter  study,  
investigators found that 59% of patients  receiving myofascial  physical therapy reported 
moderate or marked improvement in their symptoms compared to 29% of the control 
group of patients  receiving global  therapeutic massage15.  This  and other studies  have 
resulted in pelvic floor physical therapy to be first line treatment of women with chronic  
pelvic pain and hypertonic pelvic  floor dysfunction16.
In patients that fail non-invasive techniques, intralevator trigger point  injections (TPIs) 
are often  the next step.  This is often combined with physical therapy  and typi[INVESTIGATOR_543563] 3-[ADDRESS_709662]  
and coworkers injected palpable vaginal  trigger  points with 5cc of a mixture  of 10 cc of 
0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  10 cc of 2% lidocaine and 1cc of 40 mg triamcinolone17.  Success, 
defined as a decrease in pain of 50% or more, occurred in 73% (13/18) with 33% (6/18) 
being completely pain free.  
 
Intralevator trigger point  injections  with onabotulinumtoxinA has  also been shown to 
improve pain in patients with chronic pelvic pain and is often the next step following  
steroid trigger point  injections.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_543564].  OnabotulinumtoxinA has been shown  to 
provide relief  for 6-9 months with minimal side effects including,  infection, hematoma, 
and pain all of which are similar  to traditional  TPI16.   
In a study  of 30 patients that received  80 units of  onabotulinumtoxinA and 30 patients 
that received placebo  (saline)  injection into the pelvic floor muscles for dysmenorrhea, 
dyspareunia, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic, there  was a significant change in 
baseline in the onabotulinumtoxinA  group  in nonmenstrual  pelvic pain18.  Both groups  
had changes in dyspareunia and pelvic  floor pressures (cm H20) but these  patients 
were also allowed to undergo pelvic  floor physical therapy during the course of 
treatment, which may have affected the results in both groups.  OnabotulinumtoxinA   
150U-400U has also been shown  to be very effective in treatment  of women with 
refractory vaginismus19.

Page 3 of 14OnabotulinumtoxinA  injection has been compared to 80 mg methylprednisone  injection 
in patients with chronic myofascial pain in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_268363] (100u), iliopsoas (150u)  or 
scalenus anterior  (80u) muscles and was found  to have similar results at [ADDRESS_709663]  failed 
conservative therapy with medications,  pelvic floor physical therapy and/or steroid 
trigger point injections.  However, the optimal  dosing and frequency  of use has  not been 
determined and needs further study.   In addition, the effect of onabotulinumtoxinA   
injections on the need for additional therapy is unclear but may be  beneficial  for several 
reasons.  First, if relief  is able to be maintained over a longer  time period initially, 
patients may be able to avoid having  to undergo repeated  TPI [CONTACT_46431]  [ADDRESS_709664] global  intralevator trigger  point 
injections to be more  effective than single site injections. Lastly, we know that chronic  
pelvic pain is associated with anxiety  and depression and  we hope  that the more 
immediate and prolonged result  of onabotulinumtoxinA will provide patients with 
improved mental health scores.
Objectives and/or Endpoints 
The primary objective of this study  is to assess changes in overall  pain score using  
the visual analog scale  (VAS) (Appendix  1), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
(Appendix 2) and Global Response Assessment  (GRA)(Appendix 3) questionnaire 
at one month following transvaginal trigger point  injections with a steroid 
(triamcinolone) and a local anesthetic  (ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) vs. onabotulinumtoxinA  and a local 
anesthetic (ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319])  in patients  with CPP and high-tone  pelvic floor dysfunction.  We 
hypothesize that patients in the Botox group will have lower pain  scores following 
treatment and that the treatment will have a longer  effect compared  to patients in the 
Kenalog group. 
The secondary objective  is to determine  if there are persistent changes in pain scores  
using the VAS, BPI, and GRA  at [ADDRESS_709665] been  needed 
since the original  TPI (Appendix 4).    
IRB NUMBER: 2015-008

muscle relaxants or narcotics, they will need to either remain  stable or decrease the 
dosage and frequency of the medication.   If patients are  already receiving pelvic floor 
physical therapy, they may continue treatment. If patients require increased use of 
these medications or additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_543565], 
these treatments will be provided at the discretion  of the treating clinician.  These 
patients will then be evaluated as an intention to treat cohort. In addition, at the one 
month follow-up visit with the clinician, further  treatments will be offered based on the 
patient’s need for further symptom control.   
We hope that the information obtained by [CONTACT_543575]-tone pelvic floor 
dysfunction. 
Methodology
A randomized, double  blind two arm study.  Up  to [ADDRESS_709667] at the Women’s Urology Center  in the south  
tower of Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Royal Oak.
Screening
Subjects are eligible to participate in this study  if they are a woman greater than [ADDRESS_709668] menstrual  period  (LMP) and a urine pregnancy test.   If the woman  has had a 
tubal ligation or a hysterectomy,  the pregnancy test will be waived. 
A vaginal exam will be performed obtaining a pH and wet mount.   If the woman  has 
vaginitis on her wet mount at screening, she may be given a prescription for the 
appropriate medication per standard of care and be  re-screened. She must wait  at least 
[ADDRESS_709669] the finding of high tone pelvic floor 
dysfunction.  This will be determined  by [CONTACT_543576]. Pain scores from 0-10 on the VAS will 
be recorded according to positions on a clock  as rated by [CONTACT_102]  (Figure 1).  
IRB NUMBER: 2015-008
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/12/2017
Page 5 of 14Informed consent will be obtained from women  meeting the screening  and inclusion  
criteria (see below).  
Following screening, consent and enrollment, a complete medical history  will be 
obtained and/or confirmed from a prior visit.  The intake form will be the same history 
form that all patient’s presenting  to the Women’s Urology Center  are asked to fill out.   
Information obtained includes demographics, current and past medical conditions, 
surgical history, social history (smoking,  drugs, education, caffeine use, and 
employment), current medications,  and allergies.  Past treatment history for pelvic pain 
including physical therapy, trigger  point  injections, hydrodistension, cystoscopy,  and 
surgery will be recorded.    Subjects in both groups will then be asked to fill out baseline 
questionnaires including pain score on the VAS and the BPI.   
The woman will then be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms  in a 1:1 pattern.
Proposed intervention,  if applicable (e.g., study visits, surgical procedure, 
administration of drugs, etc.) or collection of data  (e.g., survey, questionnaire, 
etc.).
Subject enrollment and treatment  may both occur at the initial visit.  If desired, these 
visits may also be scheduled as separate  visits within a 7-[ADDRESS_709670] arm (Group 1) will receive TPI [CONTACT_4490] a steroid and a local anesthetic followed by 
[CONTACT_543577] (Group 2) will receive a local anesthetic followed by a 
mixture of 200u of Onabotulinumtoxin A and saline.   Each group  will receive  injections 
globally throughout  the pelvic floor at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 o’clock  (Figure 1). See below.
Intralevator trigger point  injections  will then be performed as follows:   With the subject in 
lithotomy position and blinded by a drape, the clinician will perform a pelvic exam  to 
palpate the muscles  of the levator  complex.  Pain scores from 0-10 on  the VAS  will be 
recorded according to positions on a clock as rated  by [CONTACT_102].  The pharmacy  will 
provide the injection medications in dark syringes in the following solutions:  For 
patients randomized  to group 1, a mixture of 40mg/1 ml  of triamcinolone (40 mg) and 
29cc of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360]  0.5% (5cc/6  sites) will be used first followed  by 6 cc of saline 
(1cc/injection site).   In Group 2, patients will receive an injection of 30  cc of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] 
(5cc/6 sites) followed by a mixture of 200 u of onabotulinumtoxinA and 6cc of saline.  In 
patients weighing  less than 58kg, the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_543566]  a maximum of 
2.5mg/kg/dose.  A 7 inch 22 gauge spi[INVESTIGATOR_543567] a needle guide  will be used to 
administer the injections.  A tampon  will be inserted following the injection  for 
approximately 5 minutes and then removed.
IRB NUMBER: 2015-008
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/12/[ADDRESS_709671] 30 minutes following TPI.  An ice pack to the 
vulva, warm blanket and water  or juice will be provided as needed for patient comfort.  
Side effects  will be monitored by [CONTACT_543578] (Blood  pressure, pulse, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]) within 10 minutes of the injection  by [CONTACT_49885]  (medical assistants)  
and monitoring subject-reported symptoms such as those most commonly noted with 
trigger point injection such as pain, hematoma, light-headedness, and hypertension  (all 
<1 %).  Vital signs and any adverse  effects  will be reported to the study  physician 
performing the injections.  An  overall  pelvic pain score  (0-10) prior to  departure will be  
obtained
For in office follow up visits the following  will take place:
30 days (+/- 7 days) following  the first TPI, the subjects will return to the WUC for a 
follow up visit.  Follow  up questionnaires  will be given (VAS, BPI, GRA) and subjects will 
have an office  visit with one of the study  clinicians.   A pelvic exam will be performed and 
levator pain scores from 0-[ADDRESS_709672]’s symptoms will be assessed and other  
treatments will be initiated as needed.
90 days (+/- 30 days) following  the initial TPI, patients will return to  the WUC  for a follow 
up visit.  Pelvic pain scores will be assessed  using the VAS  and BPI.  GRA will also be 
determined.  Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding  other  treatments 
they have  had since the initial TPI (Appendix 4).  A pelvic exam will be performed  by [CONTACT_543579] 0-10 on the VAS will be  recorded according 
to positions on a clock as rated by [CONTACT_102].
At 180 days (+/- 30 days) following the initial TPI, patients  will return to the WUC  for a 
follow up visit and a study exit interview.  The  VAS, BPI, GRA and additional treatments 
questionnaires will be obtained.  A pelvic exam will again be  performed by [CONTACT_543580] 0-10 on the VAS will be recorded  according to positions 
on a clock as rated by [CONTACT_102].
* While  in-person study visits are preferable, the follow up  visits  may be completed as a 
phone call visit, if the participant is otherwise  unable or unavailable. The questionnaires  
will be collected via mail.
In the event the follow  up study  visit is not conducted in-person, the visit may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_17084]/or  mail and Research Staff will:
Send the follow up questionnaires to the participant for completion with  a self-
addressed Stamped envelope  for questionnaire  return
Review the questionnaires and completion dates with the participant

Subjects may be permitted to withdraw  from the study if they have poor resolution of 
their pain or worsening of their symptoms.  If they feel that they need  other therapy 
during the first 30 days that is not permitted by [CONTACT_1758]  (additional physical therapy,  
higher or more frequent  doses  of vaginal  valium or  pain medications, repeat TPI, etc.) 
they may be withdrawn  and will be evaluated by [CONTACT_543582]. 
Patients who withdraw from the study  will be asked if they are willing to  fill out post 
questionnaires. Either group can get additional therapy  following the first [ADDRESS_709673] repeat TPI [INVESTIGATOR_543568].  If additional TPIs with 
kenalog and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_543569], the injections will be 
prepared and administered  in the Woman’s Urology Center,  per routine standard of  
care.  In no way will their withdrawal from the study impact what  treatments will be  
offered to them.  Subjects  may also withdraw from the study without any reason given.   
If they do not feel comfortable continuing treatment by [CONTACT_543583], they will be referred  to another  provider/site not involved in the study.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/12/[ADDRESS_709674] effectiveness  of two different  means of 
intravaginal trigger point injections for patients  with PFD.   We hope  that identification of 
successful therapi[INVESTIGATOR_543570]’s  quality of life, decrease the requirement for 
narcotic pain medications and decrease medical costs to the patient.
In this patient population, pain during  the exam  and trigger point is common and 
expected.  However, the goal of this treatment  is to decrease the pain long term.   
Anecdotally, patients are able to put up with temporary  pain during the treatment to gain  
the benefit of prolonged  relief that comes  with injections.  
Potential risks to the subject include:
Risks of Trigger Point Injections:
Most Frequent (occurring more  than  10% of the time):
Slight  discomfort during  the vaginal exam
Light bleeding  at the trigger point injection  site
Pain during the trigger point injection
Rare (occurring less than 1% of the time):
Vaginal hematoma (collection  of blood  in the tissue)
Infection
Risks of OnabotulinumtoxinA:
Less Frequent  (occurring from 1% to 10% of the time):
Transient  urinary retention  (temporary  inability to urinate)
Transient  flatal incontinence  (temporary accidental passing of  gas)
Transient  fecal incontinence  (temporary accidental loss of  stool) 
Slight  temporary fatigue 
Rare (occurring less than 1% of the time):
Botox toxicity/intolerance 
Lower extremity weakness 
Lower extremity numbness

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/12/2017
Page 12 of 14An independent  physician  (not connected with the study,  but familiar with the use of 
trigger point injections) will review study records  at the half-way point of enrollment for 
each arm of the study to ensure the safety  of subjects and lack of  significant adverse  
effects.  As an on-going plan,  any adverse effects (prolonged bleeding, hemodynamic 
changes, significant  patient pain, or other deemed significant  by [CONTACT_15098]) will be 
reported to the research nurse and then to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_543572]. Adverse 
events, serious adverse events,  and unanticipated problems not listed in the risks 
section of this protocol will be reported  per federal regulations and IRB guidelines.
Stipend 
Participants will receive a check for $15 from William Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543573]. A total stipend  of $75 will be paid to  those who complete  all study 
visits.

OBJECTIVES:  
 
AIM 1. Compare performance of VAD self -management skill of sterile dressing changes and VAD -
related controller functions, between SBML -trained and the usual VAD training group immediately 
following training, and at one and three months after VAD implantation.  
 Hypothesis 1a:  VAD patients and their caregivers will demonstrate bet ter VAD self -
management skills when trained wit h the SBML intervention compared to the usual VAD training 
group.  
 Hypothesis 1b:  VAD patients and their caregivers will demonstrate better VAD self -
management skill retention at one and three months compared to the usual VAD training group.  
 
AIM 2. This exploratory aim will examine VAD -patient driveline infections, and all -cause and 
infection- related re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488190], between 
the SBML intervention group as compared to the usual VAD training group.  
 Hypothesis: Patients who complete the SBML VAD curriculum with their caregivers will 
have lower infections and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488191].  
  
BACKGROUND:  
Over 5.1 million Americans suffer from heart failure (HF), with over $32 bi llion expended annually.
1 
Although survival from HF has improved, a diagn osis of HF is similar to some forms of cancer, 
with 50% of patients dying within [ADDRESS_627150] devices (VADs) have 
improved survival in patients with advanced HF.[ADDRESS_627151] decade, and implantation rates are expected to increase with newer 
generation devices.3 VADs may be used as “destination” (e.g., permanent) therapy or as a “bridge 
to transplant.” Patients on Destination Therapy will remain on the VAD for the rest of their lives. 
Bridge to Transplant patients will remain on the VAD until time of heart transplant. VAD devices 
are surgically implanted into the apex of the left ventricle of the heart and are connected to the 
aorta, providing circulatory support to the patient. A driveline pass es from the device through the 
skin, connecting to a system controller that in turn is connected to external power. A frequent and 
often deadly complication after VAD implantation is driveline infection. Infection can cause pump 
failure from thrombosis, wh ich requires surgical pump exchange if the patient survives the event.4  
 
STU# : STU00203530  
Version #:   1 Version Date:   7/3/17 Page 2 of 11 Immediately prior, and around the time of VAD implantation, patients and their caregivers are 
educated about VAD self -management . However , patients are often critically ill during this 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and caregivers  (often family)  are under emotional duress ; thus skill retention with 
this traditional education may be lacking. After discharge, patients and caregivers are required to 
engage in significant daily VAD self -management including: driveline exit site dressing changes; 
performing controller self -tests; changing power sources; troubleshooting emergent VAD -related 
malfunction; and recognizing VAD -specific signs and symptoms requiring immediate contact [CONTACT_488202]. With insufficient VAD -related knowledge and improper VAD self -management, 
these patients can die from preventable  complications including driveline infections.5 
 
Unfortunately, no rigorous standardized training exists for patients and caregivers to ensure mastery of VAD self -management. Traditionally, VAD trainin g occurs via the "see one, do one, 
teach one" method, where a VAD patient and caregiver watches a video or live demonstration of VAD -related techniques (e.g., dressing changes), and are then expected to perform the task, 
first under supervision, and, withi n days, independently. This process leads to uneven skill 
acquisition and may cause unnecessary harm to the patient. Simulation- based mastery learning 
(SBML) can be used to prevent such uneven skill acquisition and potential patient harm.
6-14 
Mastery learning is an intense form of competency -based education in which learners are 
required to meet or exceed a predetermined level of skill.15-17 In mastery learning, training time 
varies, but outcomes  (skill achievement) are uniform. Current technology allows for SBML, in 
which learners must demonstrate mastery in a simulated setting before performing the skill in 
actual cl inical practice. Our research demonstrates that SBML is a more effective strategy than 
traditional education in improving various clinical skills and patient care for procedures such as 
Advanced Cardiac Life Support,14,18,[ADDRESS_627152] an SBML intervention for VAD 
self-management skills and compare the intervention to traditional (usual) VAD training.

INCLUSION AND EXCLUS ION CRITERIA : 
Patient inclusion criteria include being a previous or current VAD implantation patient, age >18, 
English -speaking, receiving implantation and VAD care at NMH, and meet hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488192]. We expect to recruit 75 patients. Caregiver inclusion criteria include being a 
caregiver i dentified by a previous or current VAD implantation patient, age >18, and English-
speaking. We expect to recruit 75 caregivers.  
 
Vulnerable populations of patients will not be included in this study (including fetuses, neonates, 
children, pregnant women, p risoners, mentally retarded or incompetent individuals, 
institutionalized individuals, or individuals unable to give consent due to their medical condition). 
Fetuses and neonates are not the focus of our study.  Pregnant women will not be included 
STU# : STU00203530  
Version #:   1 Version Date:   7/3/17 Page 4 of 11 since pre gnancy is a contraindication to VAD implantation It is possible that VAD caregivers 
may be pregnant at the time of the study. . Patients with mental retardation, mental 
incompetence, or patients who are unable to give consent due to their medical condition will not 
be included as they will not be able to complete measures. Lastly, institutionalized individuals 
will not be included as access will be a problem, and these individuals are rarely referred for 
VAD implantation  
 STUDY TIMELINES:  
Each individual enrolled will participate in the study for approximately 3 months. We anticipate 
enrollment of study subjects will take approximately 15  months. We hope to complete all 
analyses 2 two years.  
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS : 
The primary study endpoints are we have enough patients enrolled to compare VAD-care SBML 
training and usual training groups.  
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVED : 
Approximately 60 advanced HF patients undergo VAD implantation at NMH yearly. During our 
15-month study period, up to 75 participating patients and 75 caregivers will be eligible to 
receive either the SBML VAD self -management curriculum or usual VAD training. Eligible 
patients will be about to undergo VAD implantation at NMH, age >18, and English- speaking. 
Eligible caregivers will be identified by a VAD implantation patient, age >18, and English-speaking. Advanced HF patients who are scheduled for VAD implantation will receive information about the study at their pre -implantation clinic visits or during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Consenting patients will be asked t o provide the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_488203]; we will contact [CONTACT_488204]. Patients 
and caregivers must both agree to participate in the study to be enrolled. All Patient and 
caregi ver VAD self -management training begins before implantation and continues up to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488193].  
 Study randomization will be conducted via random number generator. After randomization, 
demographic data including age, sex, race/ethnic ity, and socioeconomic (SES) factors such as 
zip code, highest level of education, and employment status will be collected from patients and 
caregivers.  
 
Two VAD nurses will perform usual training only, which is the current standard of care. First, 
patient s and caregivers watch a video produced by [CONTACT_488205]. Subsequently, the 
VAD nurse trains the patient and caregiver per usual routine with a non- implanted VAD. These 
meetings occur [ADDRESS_627155] 1) watch the 
VAD video, then 2) participate in pre -intervention assessments using the simulator for a) 
driveline exit site sterile dressing changes; b) performing controller self -tests; c) changing power 
sources; d) troubleshooting emergent VAD -related malfunction; and e) recognizing specific 
signs and symptoms requiring immediate contact [CONTACT_488206]. The patient and caregiver 
STU# : STU00203530  
Version #:   1 Version Date:   7/3/[ADDRESS_627156] -intervention assessment on the simulator 
using the checklists. At the end of training, the patient and caregiver will complete the written 
examination to assess knowledge and will be required to meet or exceed the MPS on the 
checklists  and written examination. If they fail to meet the MPS, they will receive additional 
training until they meet the MPS. If the patient is ever too ill, only the caregiver will participate in 
the training and the patient will be trained during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s tay for implantation.  
Both training groups. After training, we will ask participants to rate their educational experience and their confidence in performing each of the 5 VAD self -management tasks [via a 
questionnaire adapted from our previous work. All participants will demonstrate the five skill 
domains on the actual VAD patient during the implantation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Time 0), and at one 
and three months after training to assess skill retention. Assessments will be performed during 
office visits, as pati ents are seen at least monthly after VAD implantation, or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
If caregivers cannot attend, assessments will be performed via internet video. We anticipate the majority of enrolled patients will have internet access; alternatively, we will arrange sessions at 
their local library.  
 
A trained VAD nurse (who is not assigned to teach the curriculum) will perform all patient and 
caregiver assessments using the checklist. In the absence of this nurse, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co- I will 
perform assessments; we expect this to be rare. The trained VAD nurse, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_488194]- I will 
be blind to the intervention received by [CONTACT_488207]. A random sample of 25% of 
all assessments will be double scored by [CONTACT_488208] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I to assess inter -
rater reliability.  
 
After VAD implant, patients are managed by [CONTACT_488209]. 
Complications and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488195]/or inpatient medical 
records. Patients admitted to a local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488196]. If patient 
is admitted to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they are customarily transferred to NMH to manage the VAD. We 
believe we will be able to capture all data about driveline infections and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488197].  
 
NMH’s inf ection prevention department also tracks all VAD related driveline infections using 
definitions in the INTERMACS database.37 We will assess pa tient factors at time of infection and 
during re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488198], sex, body mass index, and the Charlson comorbidity codes . The Charlson 
score is based on 19 chronic disease comorbidities derived from the International Classification 
of Disease Revision 9 (ICD -9) codes and predicts one- year mortality for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. We 
can obtain all admission ICD -9 codes from our En terprise Data Warehouse93 which also convert 
ICD-10 codes to their corresponding ICD -9. We will obtain additional data using the INTERMACS 
database (includes  all NMH patients), which provides type of VAD, VAD indication (DT vs. BTT), 
and infection and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285].  
 
 
 
DATA AND SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT : 
Primary outcome measures are comparisons of VAD -care checklist assessments on the patient 
and written examination scores between SBML and usual training groups. Secondary outcome 
measures include self -management skill decay in the five domains from [ADDRESS_627157] -training questionnaires between groups.  
STU# : STU00203530  
Version #:   1 Version Date:   7/3/[ADDRESS_627158] scor e inter -rater reliability using the Kappa ( κ) coefficient84,87 Our prior 
work shows the difference between traditional training and SBML interventions is approximately 
33%; traditionally trained simulated skill checklist performance averages 61.47% (SD=24.48) 
items correct while SBML training performance averages 94.88% (SD=6.63).9,48,51,53,88 We 
anticipate the usual training group in our study will perform similarly to the traditionally trained 
healthcare providers in our prior studies. Sample sizes of 65 in each group (total =130) achieve 
82% power to detect at least 10% differenc e between the usual group and the SBML training 
group assuming a mean checklist score of 85% in usual group (SD=25) and 95% in the SBML 
training group (SD=10) with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_627159]. As the distribution 
of % items correc t is likely to be non -parametric, adding 15% requires [ADDRESS_627160] a 33% difference. We will compare checklist 
scores on actual patient assessments between usual care and SBML- trained groups using the 
independent t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test (if data are non- parametric). We will  compare age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, employment status, zip code, type of VAD, and VAD 
indication (DT vs. BTT) between groups using either Chi Square test or independent t-tests. If 
there is a difference between the randomized groups in any of these variables at the level of p  ≤ 
0.1, we will use multiple linear regression or multiple quantile regression (for non- parametric data) 
to assess these variables independently on scores between the two groups. We will measure 
skills decay between g roups using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a non- parametric analysis 
of variance at 0, [ADDRESS_627161], recognizing that we may be underpowered for this exploratory aim due to the short study time 
frame. We will compare age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, employment status, zip code, 
type of VAD, VAD indication (DT vs. BTT), and Charlson scores between groups using either the 
Chi Square test or independent t -tests. If there is a difference between the randomized groups in 
any of these variables at the level of p ≤ 0.1, w e will perform multiple logistic regression to control 
for these independent variables between groups. If some patients have more than infection, we 
will use random effects modeling to account for clustering by [CONTACT_4676].  
 
The study PIs, co- investigators, as needed, VAD nurse, and Research Coordinator (RC) will have 
access to individually identifiable data. Otherwise, a unique identification code will be assigned to 
each enrolled patient, and all of the data entered into the system for that patient will be identified 
by [CONTACT_488210].  
 
Socio -demographic and medical records data will be collected by [CONTACT_488211] 
a secure web server at Northwestern University. Socio -demographic data collected from VAD 
caregivers and c hecklist  of VAD self -maintenance tasks -performance data will be collected on 
paper but will be de- identif ied using a unique identifier for each patient or caregiver. This data will 
be stored on a Northwestern Server that is password protected and encrypted. All data will be collected specifically for research purposes.  
 
 
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANT S: 
Participants are f ree to withdraw from the study at anytime without consequences.  
 
 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANT S: 
STU# : STU00203530  
Version #:   1 Version Date:   7/3/17 Page 7 of 11 There are two potential risks of participating in this study for patients:  
1. Potential for breach of patient confidentiality. This is a very serious potential risk to patients , 
but safety measures, as described above, have been put into place and are monitored by [CONTACT_488212].  
 
2. The simulation training may be superior or inferior to usual care, which means patients assigned 
to either simulation or usual care groups may receive worse VAD related self -management care 
training. We will review data from our study every 3 months and if there are significant differences  
in complications between groups, we will either stop the study or provide a cross -over arm.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS T O PARTICIPANT S: 
There may be no potential benefit to the individuals participating in this study if the intervention 
proves equipoise with the usual care. However, the information gained from these results will 
inform healthcare providers how to better train patients and their caregivers in self -management 
techniques. Furthermore, if the intervention is successful, the benefit to patients and their caregivers could be improved knowledge of VAD self -management techniques and reduction in 
VAD-related complications.  
 
SETTING : 
Patients will be recruited either at the medical center (while the patient is  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_057]) or during 
a clinic visit.  Training and assessments will take place in the patient room or in NMH 
conference rooms.

Our institution will contribute to the probability of the success of this project in multiple important 
ways.   First, w e implant a large number of ventricular assist  devices  (VADs)  compared to other 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Second, our ability to recruit patients for studies through our recruitment and 
enrollment efforts at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (NMH)  and our outpatient clinics  will also 
ensure success .  We also have expert clinicians, research experts in qualitative study design, 
experts in simulation- based education, a statistician, and research staff who will be valued

RECRUITMENT METHODS : 
The research settings for recruitment and enrollment of patients is Northwestern Memorial 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Northwestern University, Chicago, IL. Patients will be recruite d either at the medical 
center (while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or during a clinic visit. The co -investigators, who provide 
care to patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs) will share information about the study with 
patients.    If the patient’s  caregiver is not present at this time, we will contact [CONTACT_488215].   
           The PI, CO -I or VAD nurse, will further explain the study to patients and caregivers, 
encourage them to ask questions, and obtain written informed consent. Patients  and caregivers  
will be informed that if they decline to participate in the study, it will not prejudice current patient 
care, and they may discontinue participation at any time during the study with no adverse

also be provided.   Patients will also be shown their study results, if desired. Patients who are 
enrolled in INTERMACS will also be informed that INTERMACS will securely transmit data to 
Northwestern, as well , which is already done for other studies.  We will also incorporate 
language into their cons ent form that includes a statement about INTERMACS protected health 
information being transmitted securely to Northwestern. Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign an informed consent form. A copy of the signed consent form will be given t o the 
patient, a second copy of the consent form will be placed in the patient’s medical record, and the original copy will be kept and filed by [CONTACT_488216] S: 
We expect to recruit [ADDRESS_627166].  
 CONFIDENTIALITY : 
Procedures are in place to ensure the confidentiality of identifying information in INTERMACS, 
the Enterprise Data Warehouse, and Northwestern University protected research servers. These 
procedures are described in detail below.  
                  We will incorporate a section into the informed consent that authorizes the study investigators to 
share personal health and other information from this s tudy with persons and/ or entities identified 
on the form, according to the rules and regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA). These procedures will thus inform patients of authorized personnel with whom data will be shared in a secured fashion and contribute to the con fidentiality of a 
subject’s identifying information and its protection from unauthorized access.  
 .   
INTERMACS currently follows Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) 
guidelines using the National Institute of Standards and Technolo gy (NIST) Special Publication 
(SP) 800 -53 Rev 4 for the protection of federal data. This security guideline helps ensure that all 
data entered and processed within INTERMACS is protected using specific security controls for 
integration of information secur ity and privacy into organizational processes including enterprise 
architecture. INTERMACS also uses HIPAA overlays in addition to FISMA requirements for the 
protection of sensitive information. In addition to federal requirements, all sensitive data is sent to 
its recipi[INVESTIGATOR_488201] e- mail. The INTERMACS Data Coordinating Committee facility 
has limited access via the use of electronic locking mechanisms and tracking. Only authorized INTERMACS personnel (CO -I) will have access to INTERMACS data.  
  
All data will be stored on the research assistants’ or PI’s computer that is encrypted and password protected.  Each patient and caregiver will be assigned a unique ID used to identify 
them.  All paper records, including checklists, surveys, consent f orms, and manual chart review 
forms will be locked in the Research Assistant’s office in a locked file cabinet. Only IRB approved investigators on this IRB protocol form will have access to collected data.  All data will 
be destroyed one year after study publication.  
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANT S: 
Individual’s participation will be voluntary. Only the PI, and co- investigators will have access to 
the data. The information gathered will not effect the patient or their care in any way other than 
for educational research purposes to improved communicati on skills training. Each patient and 
caregiver will be assigned a unique ID used to identify them.

Patients  
Patients who participate in our proposed research will provide informed consent. Patients will be 
recruited either at the medical center (while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), during a clinic visit, or 
via an opt -out letter and follow -up telephone call. The co -investigators who provide care to 
patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs) will share information about the study with 
patients.    
 
The PI, CO -I or VC, will further explain the study to patients, encourage them to ask questions, 
and obtain writt en informed. Patients, will be informed that there will be no penalty for not 
participating in this study. Verbal and written information provided to potential participants during 
informed consent will include the following: the purpose of the study, the m ethod and frequency 
of skills assessment completion, the length of time required, the voluntary nature of participation 
in the study, the ability to not respond or participate in any parts if requested, the freedom to 
withdraw from the study at any time wi thout consequences, the potential risks and benefits of 
study participation, and the confidentiality of information gathered. Patients who are enrolled in 
INTERMACS will also be informed that INTERMACS will securely transmit data to 
Northwestern, as well, which is already done for other studies. We will also incorporate 
language into the consent form that includes a statement about INTERMACS protected health 
information being transmitted securely to Northwestern. Patients who agree to participate in the

6 Version Date:April 3, 2019INTRODUCTION
Angiosarcoma is  an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma of endothelial differentiation. 
Angiosarcoma has a particularly poor prognosis with 5 year overall survival rates of 
approximately 30-40%. Deaths are almost universally attributable to distant metastatic 
disease. Median overall survival of metastatic angiosarcoma is less than one year (1). In 
addition to clinically aggressive behavior, survival is limited by a paucity of efficacious 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The identification of novel, active agents is urgently needed to improve 
the duration and quality of life for angiosarcoma patients.
1.[ADDRESS_962694], ANGIOTAX, examined 
weekly paclitaxel in 30 patients with metastatic or unresectable angiosarcoma 
between April 2005 and October 2006 (1). Progression-free survival at 4 months was 
45%. Response rate was less than 20% and median overall survival was 8 months. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_708267], retrospective analysis has demonstrated that weekly 
paclitaxel is slightly more active than single agent doxorubicin – the mainstay of 
metastatic soft tissue sarcoma therapy (2). A small retrospective series of [ADDRESS_962695] activity in 
this disease (3).
The inability  of traditional cytotoxins to durably control angiosarcoma coupled with the 
observation this malignancy displays endothelial differentiation prompted interest in 
targeted anti-vascular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Consequently, the two additional phase II trials in 
this setting have examined agents that antagonize the VEGF-VEGFR signaling axis. 
Agulnik and colleagues reported their phase II experience with bevacizumab in 
unresectable and metastatic angiosarcoma  (4). Between August 2005 and April 2011, 
23 angiosarcoma patients were treated with single agent bevacizumab. The median 
progression-free and overall survival were 3 months and 1 year, respectively.
Responses were rare  with only 2 (9%) experiencing a partial response. The French 
Sarcoma Group reported the third phase II trial in angiosarcoma examining the multi- 
targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, in 41 patients treated between June 2008 
and June 2009 (5). Although progression-free and overall survival rates were 
disappointing, a 40% tumor control rate and 23% response rate were observed in 
patients previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Taken together,  these data suggest both (A) conventional cytotoxic therapy is 
inadequate in angiosarcoma and (B) the most promising approach observed in phase 
II trials is multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition after failure of conventional cytotoxic 
therapy. As discussed in detail below, regorafenib is a highly promising agent in 
angiosarcoma. Similar to bevacizumab and sorafenib, regorafenib antagonizes the 
endothelial VEGF-VEGFR axis. However, in contrast to these agents (and other 
tested VEGFR antagonists such as sunitinib), regorafenib also displays potent activity 
against the endothelial Tie2 tyrosine kinase receptor – a newly identified therapeutic 
target in human angiosarcomas. Consequently, we have hypothesized that 
regorafenib will display clinically meaningful activity in patients with refractory, locally 
advanced and metastatic angiosarcoma.
1.2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY
The greater  activity of sorafenib in advanced angiosarcoma compared to 
bevacizumab and sunitinib prompted the hypothesis that this enhanced activity

7 Version Date:April 3, 2019derived from  a broader range of kinase inhibition. In particular, the greater activity of 
sorafenib was hypothesized to result from inhibition of the Tie2 kinase receptor.
Sorafenib displays  modest activity against Tie2 in cell-based assays (IC 50 330 nM).
To determine  if Tie2 receptor kinase antagonism may be a viable therapeutic strategy 
in advanced angiosarcoma, expression of Tie2 signaling components (Tie1, Tie2, 
Ang1 and Ang2) was assessed in [ADDRESS_962696] ligand, Ang1, was 
observed in > 80% of human samples (6). To extend these observations, the effects 
of VEGFR and Tie2 antagonism on angiosarcoma growth were assessed in vitro and 
in mouse xenograft models (7). As hypothesized, a highly selective Tie2 receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in 
vivo. Moreover, the Tie2 antagonist displayed synergistic antiproliferative activity 
when combined with a VEGFR antagonist in a model of aggressive, high-grade 
angiosarcoma. More recently, stable and selective knock-down of the Tie2 receptor 
has been shown to reduce angiosarcoma cell proliferation in vitro and potently inhibit 
tumor growth in vivo (Kozak, unpublished results). These data strongly suggest 
concurrent, potent inhibition of VEGFR and Tie2 represents an attractive therapeutic 
strategy in angiosarcoma.
Regorafenib displays  potent VEGFR inhibition with IC 50s generally half that observed 
with sorafenib. Moreover, regorafenib displays approximately 10-fold greater potency 
against the Tie2 receptor (as assessed in cellular kinase activity assays) compared to 
sorafenib (8,9). Beyond these favorable characteristics, regorafenib also possesses 
far greater activity than sorafenib (and other related TKIs) against additional potential 
targets in angiosarcoma including PDGFRs, RAF, KIT and FGFR (9). Taken together, 
these data raise the possibility that regorafenib will have considerable activity in the 
treatment of angiosarcoma.IC 50
The proposed  single-arm phase II trial will assess progression-free survival at 4 
months as the primary efficacy endpoint. If this trial meets efficacy criteria, it would be 
prudent for subsequent phase III or other large-scale confirmatory trials to employ an 
interim analysis to provide a double-check on the efficacy results.
1.3 REGORAFENIB
Regorafenib is a  small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and 
intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes 
such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor 
microenvironment (9,10). In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its 
major human active metabolites M-[ADDRESS_962697] enhanced 
(DCE) – magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
1.3.1Preclinical  experience
In vivo,  regorafenib exhibited anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects in 
human colon and breast xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in 
microvessel area, reduced Ki-67 staining, and reduced pERK1/2 staining in 
tissue sections from tumor xenografts, and dose-dependent inhibition of

pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian). (9) Immunohistochemical ex-vivo studies with a 
phospho –specific monoclonal anti-ERK 1 / [ADDRESS_962698] five days after treatment with regorafenib in 2 of 3
tumor models  examined (MDA-MB 231 and BxPC-3), but not in NSCLC 
(H460).
In addition,  all tested human tumor xenografts (MDA-MB-231, H460, BxPC-3 
and Colo-205) demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by 
[CONTACT_39698] a murine CD31 
antibody. (9) These data suggest that regorafenib can target the tumor cell 
MAPK pathway  (tumor  cell survival)  and tumor vasculature  in some but not all 
tumors.
1.3.2Clinical experience
Two phase  III global randomized studies have evaluated the efficacy of 
regorafenib. The CORRECT (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
treated with  regorafenib or placebo after failure of standard therapy) trial is an 
international, multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
that enrolled [ADDRESS_962699] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (11). Metastatic colorectal cancer patients were 
randomized to regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus 
BSC. Treatment cycles consisted of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching 
placebo) once daily for three weeks on / one week off plus BSC. The primary 
endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included 
progression-free survival, objective tumor response rate and disease control 
rate. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups were also 
compared.
At a  preplanned second interim analysis, there was a statistically significant 
survival benefit for regorafenib. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival 
was 0.773 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.635 to 0.941; 1-sided p = .0051). 
Patients treated with regorafenib had a median overall survival of 6.4 months, 
compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% increase in survival. In 
addition to improved overall survival, progression-free survival was superior; 
median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.88 to 2.17) for
regorafenib and  1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated
hazard ratio  for progression-free survival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.418 to 0.581; 
1-sided p< .000001). There was a substantial difference in disease control 
rate in the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 15%; p<.000001).
Regorafenib demonstrated  comparable efficacy benefits across patient 
subgroups analyzed including age, number of mets, number of lines of prior 
therapy, and kras status.
The most  frequent grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were 
hand–foot skin reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (8%), and hypertension (7%). The efficacy and safety from 
the CORRECT study supported FDA approval in September 2012.
The efficacy and  safety of regorafenib were examined in the Phase III GRID 
trial in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had 
exhausted all other treatment options (12). The study involved 199 patients 
with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant to 
imatinib and sunitinib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg

supportive care.
The results showed  that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically 
significant 3.9-month improvement in progression-free survival
(PFS), compared with  placebo (4.8 months vs. 0.9 months; hazard ratio [HR]
= 0.27;  p <.0001). Overall survival was statistically similar between groups as 
expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to regorafenib for 
disease progression. The median survival period without tumor growth 
among patients on regorafenib was 4.[ADDRESS_962700] 12 weeks was 53% 
with regorafenib compared with 9% in the control group. The most common 
grade ≥3 adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand-foot skin 
reaction (56.1%), hypertension (48.5%), and diarrhea (40.9%). GRID study 
data recently prompted FDA approval of regorafenib for treatment of 
previously treated patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic 
GIST.

4.2 TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION
Regorafenib will be administered  orally at a dose of 160 mg regorafenib for 3 weeks 
on followed by 1 week off. One cycle is 4 weeks (28 days). Patients will be instructed 
to take 4 40mg regorafenib tables every morning with approximately 8 fluid ounces 
(240 mL) of water after a low-fat (< 30% fat) breakfast. Patients will be given 
examples of low fat breakfasts, such as:
•Two slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low-fat margarine and 1 tablespoon 
of jelly and 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk (approximately 319 calories and 8.2 g 
of fat).
•One cup of cereal (i.e. Special K), 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk, one pi[INVESTIGATOR_39668] (no butter or marmalade), apple juice, and one cup of coffee or tea

4.3.1Dose Reductions/Re-escalations
The starting dose  of regorafenib is 160 mg once daily. Study medication will 
be administered on a schedule of 3 weeks on followed by 1week off (1 cycle = 
4 weeks). Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant 
hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities that are related to protocol 
therapy according to the guidelines shown in Table 1 below. Dose 
modifications will follow predefined dose levels. Dose adjustments for 
hematologic toxicity are based on the blood counts obtained in preparation for 
the day of  treatment.
NOTE: In  some cases, dose re-escalation may be permitted at the discretion 
of the treating investigator. Please refer to the tables below for details 
regarding when this is acceptable and under what conditions.

Bayer Healthcare Study Number: ONC-2013-[ADDRESS_962731] 2019 204.3.5Prevention/Management Strategies for Diarrhea
Diarrhea can  be a common side effect of regorafenib. The 
preventive/management strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with local 
institutional standards (e.g., anti-diarrheals and optimized hydration status).
Anti-diarrhea medications  may be introduced if symptoms occur. Previous 
trials have shown that the diarrhea could be managed with loperamide. The 
recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_962732]’s welfare, and which is not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the 
discretion of the investigator. All medications (including contrast media) taken within [ADDRESS_962733]’s source documentation and in the appropriate eCRF (including start/stop 
dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication).
Co-administration of a  strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single  160 mg dose of 
regorafenib decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib, increased the mean 
exposure of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the mean 
exposure of the active metabolite M-2. Avoid concomitant use of regorafenib with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
and St. John’s Wort)
Co administration  of a strongCYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160mg 
dose of regorafenib increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and decreased the 
mean exposure of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5. Avoid concomitant use of 
regorafenib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit 
juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazadone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and 
voriconazole).
4.4.1Permitted Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
•Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_708270].
•Supportive care for any underlying illness.
•Palliative radiation therapy is allowed if the target lesion(s) are not 
included within the radiation field and no more than 30% of total bone 
marrow is irradiated to a total of 20 Gy (EQD2). Protocol treatment 
should be held [ADDRESS_962734]. Palliative radiation 
cannot include target lesions.
•Palliative surgery: Protocol treatment should be held [ADDRESS_962735] 
can restart treatment. Palliative surgery cannot include surgery on target 
lesions.
•Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic 
growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as 
febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, they may not be substituted for a required dose 
reduction. Subjects are permitted to take chronic  erythropoietin.

permitted.
4.4.2Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_280499]:
•Other investigational treatment during study  treatment.
•Prior use of sorafenib.
•Use of cytotoxic  chemotherapy within 21 days of registration.
•Use of targeted therapy  within two half-lives  of registration.
•Radiation directed at target lesion within 28 days of registration.
•Concurrent systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal 
transduction inhibitors, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy.
•Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue.
•Subjects  taking narrow  therapeutic index medications should be monitored 
proactively (e.g. phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Phenobarbital, 
cyclosporin, and digoxin). NOTE: Warfarin is metabolized by [CONTACT_708296]2C9 and it’s levels may be especially affected by 
[CONTACT_39707]; therefore, only prophylactic  doses of warfarin  are permitted.
•Use of drugs that induce CYP3A4 including (but not limited to):
oGlucocorticoids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, 
methylprednisone, dexamethasone)
oAnticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbarnazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  phenobarbital,

4.8 STUDY DURATION AND WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA
Patients will  continue treatment until disease progression or development of 
unacceptable toxicity. In addition, patients may be discontinued from treatment and/or 
withdrawn from the study for other reasons, as outlined below. Any subject removed 
from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is 
medically acceptable. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the 
appropriate eCRF and in the subject's medical records. Patients will be followed once 
off-treatment for up to [ADDRESS_962737]  be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for 
the following reasons:
•Subject  withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures. A 
subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the 
request of his/her legally acceptable representative. At any time during 
the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate 
further. The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.

4.8.2Possible Withdrawal  Criteria
Subjects may  be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
•The subject is non-compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; 
including the use of anti-cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_17143]. Subject compliance with the treatment and protocol includes 
willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, and to have blood 
collected for all safety evaluations. At the discretion of the investigator, a 
subject may be discontinued  from the  trial for non-compliance with follow- 
up visits or study drug.
•Severe allergic reaction to regorafenib (such as exfoliative erythroderma 
or Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction).
•The development of a second cancer.
•Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the 
judgment of the investigator, significantly affect  assessments of clinical 
status and trial  endpoints.
•Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 4.
•Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or 
otherwise skewing trial  result.

6.1 DEFINITIONS AND RESPONSE  CRITERIA
Response and  progression will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) v 1.[ADDRESS_962741] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions are used in RECIST v 1.1.
Note: Lesions  are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided 
below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.
6.1.1Measurable and non-measurable disease
Measurable tumor  lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_962742] (with less than 5 mm slice thickness) or ≥ 10 mm by [CONTACT_708297]. For superficial lesions measured by 
[CONTACT_4733], documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler in the field of 
view is strongly recommended. MRI may be used in clinically appropriate 
circumstances to measure tumor lesions. Measurable lymph nodes are 
defined as those that can be accurately measured as > [ADDRESS_962743].
Lesions failing  to reach size criteria above and those that are not reproducibly 
measurable including leptomeningeal disease, effusions/ascites, inflammatory 
breast disease, diffuse lymphangitic disease and blastic bone lesions are 
defined as non-measurable. Previously irradiated lesions will also be 
considered non-measurable except if unequivocal progression is documented 
and radiation was greater than 28 days prior to study entry.
6.1.2Target and non-target lesions
All measurable  lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
[CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the diameter for all target lesions 
(long axis for tumor  lesions and short axis for lymph nodes, if included) will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum 
diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_36928].
All other  lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Non-target lesions include 
measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of 
all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions. Measurements of 
these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted.
6.1.3Guidelines for evaluation of  response
Target lesion measurements should  be obtained at baseline (within 4 weeks 
from initiation of regorafenib). Repeat measurements will be performed using 
the same technique  as that used at baseline.  For each measurement,  a sum

26 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019of diameters  will be calculated and non-target lesions will be followed as 
“present”, “absent” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”
6.1.3.1Target lesion  responses
Target lesions  will be evaluated as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all 
target lesions
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Partial response (PR): > 30% decrease in the 
baseline sum  diameters of target  lesions
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to 
qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Progressive disease (PD): > 20% increase in the 
sum diameters  of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on study. The sum 
diameters must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of 5 mm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions also qualifies as PD.
6.1.3.2Non-target lesions responses:
Non-target lesions  will be evaluated as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all non- 
target lesions with all lymph nodes < 10 mm in short 
axis.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non- 
target lesions
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Progressive disease (PD): Unequivocal  progression 
of non-target lesions (meriting discontinuation of 
regorafenib). The appearance of one or more new 
lesions also qualifies as PD.
6.1.4Evaluation of best overall response
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until the end of treatment taking into account requirements for 
confirmation. Please refer to Table 8 below.
Table 7: Evaluation  of Best Overall Response
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response

should be made to document the objective progression, even after 
discontinuation of treatment.
6.1.5Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response
6.1.5.1Confirmation
To be  assigned a status of confirmed PR or CR, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_274214] 
[ADDRESS_962744] once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.
6.1.5.2Duration of overall response/stable disease
The duration of  overall response is measured from the time that 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is recorded 
first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease 
the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started).
The duration of  overall CR is measured from the time that 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the date that recurrent 
disease is objectively documented.
Stable disease  is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since treatment started.
6.2PRIMARY ENDPOINT ASSESSMENT
The primary  endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival (PFS) at [ADDRESS_962745] 2 
cycles of study treatment to be considered evaluable for this endpoint.
6.3SECONDARY ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
The progression-free  rate (PFR) at 3 and 6 months will be defined as the number of 
patients with progression absent at these timepoints divided by [CONTACT_708298]. Median PFS (defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
until time of progression or death, whichever occurs first) will be estimated as a 
secondary endpoint. Overall survival will be defined as the time from start of treatment 
until death by [CONTACT_55544]. Response rate (by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1) will be calculated using 
the definitions above. The rate and duration of tumor control will be defined as the 
number of CR+PR+SD responses. Patients must complete at least [ADDRESS_962746] 
one dose of study treatment will be considered evaluable for the safety analysis.
Safety variables  will include the following: AEs, laboratory changes (complete blood 
counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), changes in vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) and results of clinically 
indicated studies outside study guidance, such as ECG or chest x-ray images, as 
produced at the investigator’s discretion. All AEs whether considered drug-related or 
not, will be reported with a diagnosis, start/stop dates, action taken, whether treatment

causes. For all events, the relationship to treatment and the intensity of the event will 
be determined by [CONTACT_093]. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study 
treatment will be recorded and included in the final report. This trial will use the NCI 
CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_962747] to 
toxicity grade.
ADVERSE EVENTS  AND SAFETY MONITORING
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of 
the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please refer to 
Appendices for additional information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires High 
Intensity Monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP. In addition, the study will abide by [CONTACT_708299], as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations and as required by [CONTACT_708300].
Investigators should  refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for regorafenib, 
including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected side effects of 
regorafenib. As with any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected AEs, including 
hypersensitivity reactions. The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are 
obtained.
7.[ADDRESS_962748] be 
carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory tests. 
Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and 
relationship to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment. Adverse events are 
reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. Additionally, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal 
monitoring of patient safety and care.
All patients experiencing  an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study 
drug, will be monitored until:
•the adverse event resolves  or the symptoms  or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline;
•any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;
•there is a satisfactory explanation  other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
•death  occurs.
Therapeutic monitoring should  be performed following dose modification of 
regorafenib in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care. In general, 
subjects should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications 
regardless of the path of drug elimination.
7.2 DEFINITIONS & DESCRIPTIONS
7.2.1Adverse event  (AE)
An adverse  event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal

 UniversityLead Site Study Number: NU 13S02 
Bayer Healthcare Study Number: ONC-2013-129
29 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019relationship with  this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, 
whether or not related to the intervention.
7.2.2Severity of AEs
All adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse  Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE  v. 4 is available 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.
If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
7.2.2.1Mild (grade 1): the event  causes discomfort without disruption  of 
normal daily  activities.
7.2.2.2Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal 
daily activities.
7.2.2.3Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform 
normal daily activities  or significantly affects  his/her clinical  status.
7.2.2.4Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death  at the time 
of the  event.
7.2.2.5Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.
7.2.3Serious adverse events (SAEs)
All SAEs,  regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within [ADDRESS_962749] be reported upon discovery 
or occurrence. Additional expedited or routine reporting may be required, 
depending on the nature of the SAE (as outlined in 7.3 below). A “serious” 
adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical 
occurrence that:
7.2.3.1Results in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.
7.2.3.2Is life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.
7.2.3.3Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959]  ≥ 24hours.
7.2.3.4Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
7.2.3.5Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
7.2.3.6Is an important medical  event.
Any event  that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse event. The event may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.
Examples: allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.4Medical History vs. Adverse Event
7.2.4.1A surgical procedure  that was planned prior to the start of the study 
by [CONTACT_708301] #: STU00087654-CR0004 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/19/2019 through 8/18/2020.

AE if worsens compared to baseline).
7.2.4.2Conditions that started  before  registration and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until after registration are recorded as 
medical history  (e.g. seasonal allergy without acute  complaints).
7.2.4.3Conditions that started  before  registration and for which  symptoms or 
treatment are present after registration, at unchanged intensity, are 
recorded as medical history (e.g. allergic pollinosis).
7.2.4.4Conditions that started or deteriorated after registration will be 
documented as adverse events.
7.2.5Exceptions to the Definition of SAE
Certain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708272], including those that meeting the following criteria:
7.2.5.1An admission resulting in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours.
7.2.5.2An admission that is pre-planned (i.e. elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study).
7.2.5.3An admission that is not associated with an AE (i.e.  social 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708273]).

frequency;
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_962750] or others at a different or 
greater risk of harm; AND
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Are deemed to be related or possibly related to 
participation in the study.
7.3 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING
7.3.1Routine  Reporting
All routine  adverse events, such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to study participation, are to be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF according to the time intervals noted in the Schedule of 
Events. Routine AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1578] 
(DMC) according to the study’s phase and risk level, as outlined in the DSMP.
7.3.2Steps to determine if expedited reporting is required
This includes  all events that occur within [ADDRESS_962751] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.
7.3.2.1Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.0.
7.3.2.2Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.0.
7.3.2.3Determine  whether the adverse event  is related to the protocol 
therapy.
Attribution categories  are as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Definite: AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Probable: AE is likely related to the study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Possible: AE may be related to the study treatment.

treatment.
7.3.2.4Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event is 
considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 the current protocol;
[IP_ADDRESS].2 the drug package insert;
[IP_ADDRESS].3 the current Investigator’s Brochure.
7.3.3Documentation of  AEs
Each event should  be described in detail along with start and stop dates, 
severity, relationship to regorafenib, action taken and outcome.
Any action  on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF using the categories listed below:
•Drug withdrawn
•Drug interrupted
•Dose reduced
•Dose not changed
•Dose increased
•Not applicable
•Unknown
In addition,  the outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:
•Recovered/resolved
•Recovering/resolving
•Recovered/resolved with sequelae
•Not recovered/not resolved
•Fatal
•Unknown
7.3.4Expedited Reporting of SAEs
Completion of  the Medwatch form is the preferred method of reporting. This 
form can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/.
7.3.4.1Reporting to the Northwestern University  QAM/DMC
All SAEs  must be reported to the assigned QAM within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. Completion of the NU CRO SAE Form, 
provided as a separate document, is required.
The completed  form should assess whether or not the event qualifies 
as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]. The report should also include:
•Protocol description and number(s)
•The patient’s identification number
•A description of the event, severity, treatment, and outcome (if 
known)
•Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics
•The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458] (if available/applicable)

STUDY MANAGEMENT
10.1INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) APPROVAL AND CONSENT
It is  expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent 
form and protocol.
In obtaining  and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with 
the applicable  regulatory requirement(s),  and should adhere  to Good Clinical  Practice 
(GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

follow-up, must be taken care of in an ethical  manner.
10.10 PUBLICATION  POLICY
All potential publications  and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, 
abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with 
the policies and processes set forth in the Lurie Cancer Center DSMP. For trials that 
require high intensity monitoring, the assigned QAM will prepare a preliminary data 
summary (to be approved  by [CONTACT_1363]) no later than 3 months  after the study reaches 
its primary completion date (the date that the final subject is examined or receives an 
intervention for the purposes of final data collection for the primary endpoint). If the 
investigator’s wish to obtain DMC-approved data prior to this point (or prior to the 
point dictated by [CONTACT_91939]), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163202] a written request for data to the 
QAM which includes justification. If the request is approved, data will be provided no 
later than [ADDRESS_962759] approval. The data will be presented to the DMC 
at their next available meeting, and a final, DMC-approved dataset will be released 
along with any DMC decisions regarding publication. The investigators are expected 
to use only DMC-approved data in future publications. The investigators should 
submit a copy of the manuscript to the biostatistician to confirm that the DMC- 
approved data are used appropriately. Once the biostatistician gives final approval, 
the manuscript may be submitted to Bayer Healthcare(funding  source).
Bayer recognizes  the right of the investigator to publish results upon completion of the 
study. However, the investigator must send a draft manuscript of the publication or 
abstract to Bayer at least 30 days in advance of submission in order to obtain 
approval prior to submission of the final version for publication or congress 
presentation. This will be reviewed promptly and approval will not be withheld 
unreasonably. In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_708281](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution which satisfies both parties. All relevant aspects regarding data reporting and 
publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution.

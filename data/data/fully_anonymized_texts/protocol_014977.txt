Protocol  
 
Research Design . A randomized clinical trial will be conducted to determine the benefits of 
omitting aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96346] (RGC) prior to feedings on nutritional outcomes 
and gastrointestinal integrity and functioning of premature, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. 
VLBW infants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group [ADDRESS_106466] care; that is, physical parameters of feeding intolerance and NEC will be assessed and RGC will 
be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96347]. In Group 2, physical parameters for feeding intolerance and 
NEC will be assessed but RGC will not be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831]. To determine nutritional outcomes, the  
following factors will be evaluated: (1) weekly enteral intake for the first 6 weeks of l ife, (2) time 
to reach full enteral feedings, (3) hours of parenteral nutrition (PN), (4) diagnosis of parenteral 
nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD), (5) growth indices, (6) hours of central venous line 
(CVL) access, (7) epi[INVESTIGATOR_96348] (LOS), (8) length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and inflammation will be measured by (1) presence of blood in the 
stool, and (2) fecal calprotectin levels. Furthermore, plasma levels of gastrointestinal peptides 
including serum gastrin and motilin will be measured as indicators of gastrointestinal function. 
See Table 1.  
 
Sample and Setting . The proposed study will follow a prospective cohort (N = 120) of racially 
and economically diverse VLBW infants for 6 weeks following birth. The infants will be born to 
mothers who are English or Spanish speaking and who are 18 years of age or older. VLBW 
infants will be sampled by [CONTACT_96380] (NICU) at Shands 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a Level III tertiary care center. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96349] a 52 bed NICU. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96350], a predominantly rural and semi -rural population. Approximately 
100-110 VLBW  infants are delivered there per year. In the preliminary study, 70% of mothers 
consented for the study.  Inclusion criteria for the infants are as follows: (1) born at 32 weeks or 
less of gestational age, (2) birth weight  equal to or less than 1,250 grams, and (3) infant 
receiving some enteral feedings by 72 hours of age and parenteral feedings by 24 hours of age.  
Exclusion criteria for the infants are as follows: (1) congenital or chromosomal abnormalities, (2) complex  congenital heart diseases and congenital anatomic gastrointestinal abnormalities, (3) 
Infants will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occur: grossly bloody stools, 
radiologic evidence of NEC, or other  intestinal complications such as perforation. 
 Sample Size Determination / Power  Analysis. In the preliminary study, 40 premature, VLBW 
infants had a mean enteral intake at 14 days of 72 mL/kg/d  (SD=65). To detect a 50% 
improvement to 108, we would require 104 evaluable subjects in a non -sequential  design for 
Primary 1.1 to achieve 80% power at P=0.05 (two- sided). To accommodate one interim 
analysis, we employed the minimax method of Shuster et al (2002), with first look after [ADDRESS_106467] been accrued. If |Z|>2.28 we shall stop for significance. If |Z|<1.12, the 
study will be reviewed for possible futility.  There will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589]. Otherwise, the 
study will accrue 120 evaluable subjects (54 more). No competing two stage design can achieve 
a lower worst case scenario average sample size than this one’s 89 evaluable. Intent -to-treat 
will be followed as closely as possible. However, to accommodate dropouts  including deaths 
(15%) and infants who develop NEC (7%) we expect to accrue 160 subjects.  Randomization . Within 72 hours of life and within 24 hour of initiating feeds of less than 20 
mL/kg/d, informed consent will be obtained from the mothers, and infants will be randomly 
assigned to one of two groups by [CONTACT_96381] 4, 6, or [ADDRESS_106468] an orogastric (OG) or 
nasogastric (NG) tube placed upon admission to the NICU and begin receiving  enteral feeding 
of less than 20 ml/kg/d within 72 hours. Length of insertion of the OG/NG tube is determined by  
[CONTACT_96382] (Ellett  et al., 2011). Minimum insertion length based on the 
weight of the infant (Cordero et al., 2011).  If the infant receives an X- ray upon admission, 
placement of the OG/NG tube is verified. Placement is also  verified if additional X -rays are 
taken during the study as per usual OG/NG placement protocol in the NICU.  Depending on the 
infant’s gestational age, weight, and clinical status, feedings are initiated at up to 20mL/kg/d  
and advanced daily by [CONTACT_23818] 20mL/kg/d toward a goal of 120- 150mL/kg/d divided into 8 
equal feedings  per day using the established University of [LOCATION_012] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96351] . Mom’s own breast milk is encouraged, and donor breast milk provided if 
mothers own breast milk is  unavailable. Prior to each feeding, the OG/NG tube is checked for 
proper placement by [CONTACT_96383]. In addition, the nurse assesses the infant for any signs or symptoms of feeding 
intolerance or NEC (i.e., abdominal  distension and/or tenderness,  increased abdominal girth, 
visible bowel loops, presence of emesis, and visible blood in the stool). It is  standard protocol to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96352]. However, for this study, this will only occur in infants  
randomized to Group 1.  Kangaroo Care (holding of an infant dressed only in a diaper upon 
someone’s bare chest) can positively affect  growth and improve feeding tolerance (Conde -
Aqudelo et al., 2011)) Kangaroo care is encouraged in this  NICU and nursing protocols have 
been established to provide support to all mothers regarding provision of  kangaroo care.  
 Research Procedure . The procedures used in this study will be the same as those successfully 
used in the preliminary study.  Following consent by [CONTACT_96384], infants will be randomized, and 
baseline demographic data will be collected from their medical charts . Over the first 6 weeks of 
life the following additional information will be collected at specified time periods from their 
medical charts: weekly enteral intake, days to full enteral feedings  (120 mL/kg/d), hours of PN, 
evidence of PNALD (level of direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)), growth indices (weekly weight, head circumference 
and length) , medications, hours with a CVL, epi[INVESTIGATOR_96353]   
(occurring > 7 days of life), days to discharge, evidence of stage [ADDRESS_106469] for serum gastrin and  motilin levels. If ventilated, tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96354] 1, 3, 5,7,14, 21, 28 and 35 from  routine tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96355]. As kangaroo care is a potentially confounding factor, epi[INVESTIGATOR_96356]’s bedside by [CONTACT_96385]. See Table 1. 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_106470] a sign placed on their isolettes 
stating which group they are assigned to and whether the  nurse should or  should not aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96357]. Although already documented on the infant’s flow sheet, the sign will also include an area 
for the nurse to document the OG/NG insertion depth. Those personnel who are not  involved 
with the study infants will be unable to be blinded since information regarding gastric residual 
volume and color is placed in the chart by [CONTACT_96386]. The PI [CONTACT_832] a neonatal nurse practitioner in the NICU 
and will not be involved in the feeding  plans for any subject in the study . The nurses at this 
research institution were willing to comply with the protocol in the past and have agreed to do so 
again. During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_96358]. 
The only difference in care is that the infants in Group [ADDRESS_106471] RGC aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831]. RGC are  obtained by [CONTACT_96387][INVESTIGATOR_96359]/NG tube into a syringe. Decisions  
regarding advancement of feedings will be made according to the University of [LOCATION_012] 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96360], including consideration of the physical assessment 
for signs and symptoms of  feeding intolerance and NEC. Data to be collected for Aim [ADDRESS_106472] kits, with the results recorded on the infant’s flow sheet. 
Subsequently, this information will be collected and recorded by [CONTACT_96388] . Stool 
will be collected by [CONTACT_96389] 3 and 6 weeks of  age and placed in a vial which is 
enclosed in a Ziploc ® plastic bag and attached to the infant’s isolette. Initial inflammatory 
changes have been seen in the  intestinal tract of infants [ADDRESS_106473] at 3 and 6 weeks was made to allow  sufficient time for intestinal inflammation to occur 
from GRC aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ( Saarinen et al., 2002). . The vial will be collected by [CONTACT_96390]- investigator’s (J. Neu, MD) existing  research 
laborat ory where the calprotectin level will be analyzed. This lab is currently successfully 
involved  with and is proficient in fecal analysis of calprotectin levels. The results will be collected 
and recorded by [CONTACT_65460] . 
 Aim [ADDRESS_106474]. All samples will be sent to the laboratory at Shands Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96361], and lab values will be extracted and recorded by [CONTACT_96391] . 
 
 
Statistical Analysis. Data will be entered into the RedCap system by [CONTACT_17033]. 
For the primary hypothesis (P1.1), the  total weekly enteral intake will be compared between the 
two randomized treatment groups via a two- sided Welch -corrected T -test. For sample sizes of 
this magnitude, the central limit theorem assures us that this is an assumption -free analysis, 
even if the underlying population variances differ. An interim analysis of P1.1 will  also be done 
as described in the Power Analysis section below. Secondary hypotheses S1.1 -S1.7 will be  
tested in the same manner as the primary hypothesis P1.1. For secondary Hypothesis S2.1 
(S3.1), [S3.2], we  shall compare the personal fractions of positive stools (gastrin levels) [motilin 
levels] respectively via two -sided Welch -corrected T -tests. For secondary hypothesis S2.2, we 
shall use a repeated measures analysis of  variance to compare the groups with respect to week 
3 and week 6 calprotectin levels. . Actual P -values will  be reported, and each hypothesis will be 
accompanied by a point estimate and 95% confidence interval  estimate for effect size. For 
desc riptive purposes, a P- value of under 5% will be declared significant. The study  is powered 
strictly around the primary hypothesis P1.1. Withdrawal rates will be compared between the  
treatments in a tertiary manner using survival analysis (time to withdrawal), via a logrank test.  
 
Expected outcomes. Based on the preliminary study, it is reasonable to expect that infants 
who do not receive routine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_96362], evidence of 
less gastrointestinal bleeding and inflammat ion, and  improved gastrointestinal function. 
 
Data Entry and Management . All data will be entered into a REDCAP database having 
integrated data quality and consistency checks (e.g.,  data-range) as part of the data procedure.  
Data quality will be  monitored and assured: 1) as reported; and 2) as entered into the database. 
For the former, all hardcopy forms  will be visually inspected before data entry. Furthermore, a 
manual comparison of randomly selected data hardcopy forms with data output listing 
generated  from the study database will be performed, and consistency  checks will be generated 
by [CONTACT_89141].  All subjects eligible for 
enrollment will be registered and entered into the study database designed by  [CONTACT_96392].

PI [CONTACT_15261]: 11/23/154.   Who is paying for this research study? 
The sponsor of this study is the National Institute of Health
5.   Why is this research study being done? 
In most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], babies such as yours are being feed both through their mouth and 
through their veins.  The feeding goal is to slowly increase the amount of food given 
to your baby [CONTACT_96395], so that we can stop feeding through his\her vein.  
Currently, right before we give your baby [CONTACT_96396], we suck out 
anything remaining in their stomach, through a feeding tube that your baby [CONTACT_96397].  The main reason for checking what is left over is to make sure we are not 
over-feeding your baby.  This checking can happen up to [ADDRESS_106479] suggested that checking for this left over food can cause more 
harm by [CONTACT_96398]’s stomach, and that by [CONTACT_96399], it takes 
longer for your baby [CONTACT_96400].
The purpose of this research study is to find out the risks and benefits of checking or 
not checking the amount of formula or breast milk remaining in your baby’ stomach 
before every feeding.  
You are being asked to be in this research study because your baby [CONTACT_832] a premature 
baby [CONTACT_96401] a tube that goes from the mouth or nose to the 
stomach.
A description of this clinical  trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as 
required by  U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify 
you.  At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search 
this Web site at any time. 
WHAT  CAN YOU EXPECT IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?
6.   What will be done as part of your child’s normal clinical care (even if he/she did 
not participate in this research study)? 
Other than checking or not checking the left over food in your baby’s stomach before 
each feeding, the care your baby [CONTACT_96402] 1250 grams (about 3 pounds). Feeds will be given through a 
tube into their stomach and will be increased daily until full feedings are reached.  
Administration of a special type of nutrition through the veins called parenteral 
nutrition will be provided until they are taking enough feeding for good nutrition and 
growth.  Medications will be used as necessary per normal clinical care.  Risks 
include feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis (an intestinal infection that occurs 
in 7-10% of premature infants) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (when a 
premature infant develops a hole in their intestines which occurs in 5% of very 
premature infants).

PI [CONTACT_15261]: 11/23/15Donated pasteurized breast milk will be used for feeding until your infant has reached 
32 weeks gestation (2 months before they were due to be born) if the mother is 
unable or unwilling to provide their own breast milk.
7.   What will be done only because your baby [CONTACT_96403]? 
If you decide to have your baby [CONTACT_96404], your baby [CONTACT_96405] (like the flip of a coin) to either have the leftover food in their  
stomach removed before each feeding, or not have the leftover food removed before 
each feeding. 
You and your baby’s doctors and nurses will know whether your baby [CONTACT_96406]. Infants in this study will all receive breast 
milk.  If the mother is unable or unwilling to provide breast milk, donated pasteurized 
breast milk will be fed to the infant.  
If your infant is receiving donor milk and is discharged before the end of the study, 
he/she will be transitioned to formula according to normal NICU care.
When your baby [CONTACT_96407], we will take some of 
that blood and find out the amount of certain hormones (gastrin and motilin) the blood 
contains.  We will do that when your infant is between [ADDRESS_106481] one of 
the research team members listed in question 3 of this form.
8. How long will you be in this research study?
Study procedures will be done until your baby [CONTACT_832] [ADDRESS_106482] medical information until he/she is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96372]/she 
reaches 20 weeks of age.
9. How many people are expected to take part in this research study?
170 infants will be enrolled in this study.

PI [CONTACT_15261]: 11/23/15WHAT ARE  THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY AND 
WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS ?
10.What are the possible discomforts and risks from taking part in this research 
study?
The risks of this study are those that may occur if your baby’s left over food is not 
removed prior to each feeding.  We are not sure what those risks will be, but we don’t 
expect them to be different from the normal risk of feeding premature infants.  These 
risks are minimized by [CONTACT_96408], changes in the color of the abdomen, 
vomiting, changes in the infant’s breathing or heart rate, and loose or bloody stools. 
Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information they collect about 
your baby.  However, there is a slight risk that information about your baby [CONTACT_96409].  Depending on the nature of the information, 
such a release could upset or embarrass you, or possibly affect your insurability or 
employability.  Questions 17-[ADDRESS_106484] your baby [CONTACT_96410]. 
If you wish to discuss the information above or any discomforts your baby [CONTACT_96411], please ask questions now or call one of the research team members 
listed in question 3 in this form.
11a.What are the potential benefits to your child for taking part in this research       
study?
There may or may not be any benefits for the subjects participating in the study.  If 
your baby [CONTACT_96412], then there is no benefit to 
your baby.  If your baby [CONTACT_96413], 
the potential benefits may be that your baby [CONTACT_96414]\she 
eats faster than normal which could increase growth, and improved ability to accept 
feedings, which could result in removing the food being given by [CONTACT_96415].

PI [CONTACT_15261]: 11/23/1511b.How could others possibly benefit from this study?
The results from this study may help investigators to better understand the risks and 
benefits of checking or not checking the amount of formula or breast milk remaining in 
a premature baby’s stomachs before every feeding which in turn may lead to 
improvement in patient care.  
11c.How could the researchers benefit from this study?

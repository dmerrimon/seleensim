subcutaneously (SC) to patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Approximately 230 
patients with peripheral blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/ μL will be randomized globally to 
receive SC benralizumab 30 mg or placebo. 
After enrolment, eligible patients will enter a 5-week screening/run-in period. Patients who 
meet eligibility criteria will enter a 12-week treatment period and receive 30 mg benralizumab 
or placebo at Day 0, Day 28 (+/- 3 days), and Day 56 (+/- 3 days). An End-of-Treatment 
(EOT) visit will be conducted at Day 84 (Week  12) and a follow-up (FU) visit will be 
conducted at Day 112 (Week 16).

Edition Number 2.0Date [ADDRESS_1251168]-baseline timepoint where the p-value for the mean difference between 
benralizumab and placebo is ≤0.[ADDRESS_1251169]. The 
average over the mean differences between benralizumab and placebo based on the change from baseline (Visit 4) to Days 28 (Visit 8), 56 (Visit 9), and 84 (Visit 10) in pre-BD FEV
[ADDRESS_1251170]. 
The results of the Phase 2b study, MI-CP220 ( Castro et al 2014 ) and the Phase 3 asthma 
exacerbation studies, SIROCCO ( Bleeker et al 2016 ) and CALIMA ( Fitzgerald et al 2016 )
were used as a basis for the sample sizing.  From these studies, it is expected that around 115 
patients per treatment arm (230 in total ) will provide approximately 90% power for the 
primary endpoint pre-BD FEV 1with type I error controlled at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 
if the true average over the mean treatment differences (benralizumab – placebo) across Days 
28 (Visit 8), 56 (Visit 9), and 84 (Visit 10) is [ADDRESS_1251171] approximately 80% power for an average over the mean treatment difference of 
[ADDRESS_1251172] deviation of 375 mL and 
within-patient correlation of 0.6.  If the within -patient variability is reduced to 350 mL, the 
sample size would be sufficient 80% power for an average of [ADDRESS_1251173] 80% power to detect a true 
treatment difference (benralizu mab – placebo) of [ADDRESS_1251174] ically 
significant at the 5% level ranges from appr oximately 85 to 100 mL. The sample size was 
estimated using nQuery + nTerim version 3.0 using methodology by [CONTACT_279131] ( Liu et al 2005 ).
2. ANALYSIS SETS
2.1 Definition of analysis sets
Five analysis sets are defined below: 
! All patient analysis set
! Full analysis set (FAS)
! Sub-study analysis set
! Safety analysis set
! Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis set
Patients must have provided their informed consent. If no signed informed consent is 
collected (major protocol deviation), the patient will be excluded from all analysis sets defined below.
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Study Code  D3250C00038
Edition Number 2.0Date 13 Aug 2018
14All efficacy will be performed according to the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) principle based on the 
FAS. For consistency, demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented using the
FAS. Safety objectives will be analyzed based on the safety analysis set.
2.1.[ADDRESS_1251175] (IP) w ill be 
included in the FAS, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in 
the study. Patients will be analyzed according to their rando mized tr eatment, irrespective of 
whether or not they have prematurely discon tinued, according to the ITT principle. Patients 
who withdraw consent, and assent when applicab le, to participate in the study will be included 
up to the date of their study termination. All efficacy and patient-reported outcome (PRO)
data will be based on this analysis set. 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1251176] 1 dose of IP w ill be included in the safety analysis set. 
Patients will be classified according to the treatment they actually received. A patient who 
has on 1 or several occasions received active tr eatment will be classified as active. All safety 
summaries and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) analyses will be based on this analysis set.
2.1.[ADDRESS_1251177] upon the 
interpretation of the primary endpoint in the study . Only important protocol deviations will be 
listed and tabulated in the CSR.
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Study Code  D3250C00038
Edition Number 2.0Date 13 Aug 2018
15The following categories of protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_893418], with additional details provided in Appendix 8.3:    
! Patients who do not meet key inclusion criteria (patients incorrectly randomised)
! Patients who meet any of the key ex clusion criteria (patients incorrectly 
randomised)
! Patients who developed IP discontinuation criteria during the study but were not 
discontinued
! Patients who received prohibited/ restricted concomitant medication(s)
! Deviations from study procedures
Patients for whom significant protocol deviations were recorded that impact the interpretation 
of the study safety outcomes will have a footnote added to applicable output to describe the deviation and its potential impact. Such patients will be identified as part of the protocol 
deviation review process prior to database lock.
Patients who received incorrect study treatmen t will be identified after database lock and 
unblinding. Patients will be classified according to the treatment they actually received for the 
safety analysis set according to the following rules, based on the unblinded data from the
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) system:
! Patients assigned to benralizumab treatment regimen who receive only placebo will 
be assigned to the placebo group.
! Patients assigned to the placebo group who received 1 or more doses of 
benralizumab will be assigned to the benralizumab group.
2.2.2 Visit window definitions
No visit windows will be defined for screeni ng visits. For local laboratory and all vital signs, 
safety labs other than white blood cell (WBC) cell count and differentials, and 
ADA/neutr alizing anti bodies (nAb), the visit recorded in web-based data capture (WBDC) 
will be used. For endpoints that present vi sit-based data including WBC cell count and 
differentials (including eosinophil count d ata), spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], FeNO, body plethysmography
(sub-study), and patient reported outcomes (PROs), the variables will be summarized based on 
the scheduled days with adjusted analysis-de fined visit windows. The adjusted analysis-
defined visit windows will be based on the collection schedule listed in the protocol and variables will be windowed to the closest scheduled visit for that variable. 
The adjusted analysis-defined visit windows for assessments conducted are summarized in 
Table 1 .

Day 84 (Week 12/EOT) 85 71 ≤Study Days ≤98 
Day 112 (Week 16/Follow-up) 113 99 ≤Study Days
For assignment of data to adjusted analysis-defined visit windows, study day will be defined
as follows: (Date of assessment – date of randomization) +1
For example, by [CONTACT_13748], the day of randomization will be Study Day 1 and the planned 
date of Week 4 will be Study Day 29 (=28+1).  
If multiple assessments are recorded within a single visit window, please refer to the rules 
below:
! If there are [ADDRESS_1251178] to the scheduled visit will be used in the analysis. 
! If 2 observations are equidistant from the scheduled visit, then the non-missing 
observation with the earlier collection date will be used in the analysis. 
! If 2 observations are collected on the same day, then the non-missing one with the 
earlier collection time will be included in the analysis. 
If a visit window does not contain any observations, then the data will remain missing. For pre-BD FEV
1(L) and body plethysmography data, th e non-missing value with acceptable 
quality (acceptable or borderline quality grade) which is closest to the scheduled visit will be 
included in the analysis.  For post-BD FEV 1, the highest value with acceptable quality from 
the same date as the pre-BD FEV 1result will be used.
2.2.[ADDRESS_1251179] dose 
of study treatment will serve as the baseline measurement for safety endpoints. If there is no 
value prior to randomization (or the first dose of study treatment, depending on the endpoint), 
then the baseline value will not be imputed and will be set to missing. No data known to be 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Study Code  D3250C00038
Edition Number 2.0Date [ADDRESS_1251180] dose will be used in determining the baseline value, unless otherwise 
specified.
For categorical (yes/no) baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_568950] , if ‘yes’ is indicated in any 
visit during enrollment (scheduled or unscheduled), ‘yes’ will be used.  
There are 2 pre-BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757] – 30 and 60-mins prior to IP administration on 
Day 0 of randomization visit. Day 0 pre-BD FEV1 value w ill be set to:
-The average of the two if both have acceptable quality, or 
-the value of the one with acceptable quality if only 1 has acceptable quality, or
-missing, if none of the two has acceptable quality
Day 0 pre-BD value of FVC, FEF 25-75% and ratio of FEV1/FVC will be calculated using the same logic as for Day 0 pre-BD FEV1.
For pre-BD FEV
1(L) and sub-study assessments from whole body plethysmography, the last 
non-missing value with acceptable quality (acceptable or borderline quality grade) on or prior 
to the date of ra ndomizatio n will be used as baseline. The first dose of study treatment is 
scheduled to be administered on the date of randomization (Visit 4); however, if the first dose 
of study treatment is delayed until after the date of rando mization, the last r ecorded value with 
acceptable quality prior to the first dose of study treatment will be used as baseline measurement for spi[INVESTIGATOR_328649]. Baselin e of pre-BD FVC will be assigned in the 
same way as for pre-BD FEV
1.
For FeNO, the mean of repeated assessments at Week 0 (Visit 4) prior to randomization w ill 
be used as baseline values. If the first dose of study treatment is delayed until after the date of 
randomization, the mean of last recorded values pri or to the first dose of study treatment will 
be used as baseline. If the assessments prior to randomization/first dose are missing, the mean 
value from Day -21 (Visit 2) will be used for baseline.
ACQ-6, SGRQ, and PGI-S assessments  at Week 0 (Visit 4) prior to rando mization will be 
used for calculating the respective baselines. For ACQ-6, if the value at Week 0 (Visit 4) is missing, the non-missing value from Day -35 (Visit 1) w ill be used for baseline.
For summaries of vital signs and laboratory result s by [CONTACT_893419], the last non-missing assessment prior to first dose of study treatment will be used as baseline.
2.2.4 Prior/concomitant medications
All patients are required to be treated with stable dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/ Long-
acting β
2agonists (LABA) for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 and during the course of the 
study.  
The background asthma controller medicatio ns should be maintained at a stable dose from 
Visit 1 until the end of the study. No ch anges are allowed to background me dications 
throughout the duration of the study except during the treatment of an asthma exacerbation.
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Study Code  D3250C00038
Edition Number 2.0Date 13 Aug 2018
18Short-acting β2agonists (SABAs) may be used as rescue medication during the study in the 
event of a worsening of asthma symptoms.
A medication w ill be regarded as ‘prior’ if it was st opped on or before the date of 
randomization (medication stop d ate ≤ date of randomization).
A medication will be regarded as ‘concomitant’ if the start date is after the date of 
randomization, or if it star ted on or prior to the d ate of rando mization and was ongoing after 
the date of randomization.
3. EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES
3.[ADDRESS_1251181]-baseline visit will be defined as a patient who had 
improvement on FEV1 by [CONTACT_893420]-offs: 50, 100, 150, 200, [ADDRESS_1251182] with a change from baseline in FEV1 greater than or equal to the cut-off at a visit will 
be categorized as a responder at that visit.  A patient with missing value of change from baseline at a visit will be excluded from the calculation of proportion of responders at that 
visit.
3.2.2 Eosinophil counts in the blood
Absolute and percentage changes from baseline Week 0 (Visit 4) in blood eosinophil counts
(from h ematology) at each post-baseline vi sit are the secondary eff icacy variables.
These variables will also be used to assess the treatment effect over time of eosinophils in the 
blood.
3.2.3 Pre-bronchodilator forced vital capacity
The change from baseline (Visit 4) in FVC to each of the post-baseline visits will be a 
secondary efficacy variable for this study.
3.2.4 Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 
The Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) is a shortened version of the ACQ that assesses 
asthma symptoms (nighttime waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of

Study Code  D3250C00038
Edition Number 2.0Date [ADDRESS_1251183] use) omitting the FEV 1measurement from the 
original ACQ-7 score.  
Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by [CONTACT_893421] 1 bronchodilator use question and 5 symptom que stions. Questions are weighted equally 
and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is 
the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores 
between 0.75 and <1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.[ADDRESS_1251184] 0.5 are considered to be clinically 
meaningful.
The questionnaire will be completed at the study  center via provided site tablet (ePRO) in 
accordance with schedule provided in  CSP Section 4, Tables [ADDRESS_1251185]-randomization periods. There will be no imputation for missing values. 
Patients will be categorized according to the following limits ( Juniper et al 2005 ):
! ACQ-6 (post-baseline visit – baseline) ≤-0.5 → Improvement
! -0.5 < ACQ-6 (post-bas eline visit – baseline) <0.5 → No change
! ACQ-6 (post-baseline visit – baseline) ≥0.5 → Deterioration

The questionnaire is divided into 2 parts: 
! Part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_893409] 4 weeks; 
! Part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of 
the individual’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_22342]. 
The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The 
total score indicates the impact of disease on overall health status. This total score is 
expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which [ADDRESS_1251189] possible health status. Likewise, the domain scores range 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment. Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by [CONTACT_3433] e developer in a user manual ( Jones et al 2009 ).
The change in mean total score in SGR Q from baseline (Visit 4) to each of the 
post-randomization periods in total score will be  a secondary efficacy variable for this study.
For the responder analysis of SGRQ, a responder will be defined as an individual with a 
≥4-point decrease (improvement) in SGRQ total score from baseline to each post-baseline 
visit.

213.3 Exploratory efficacy outcome variables
3.3.1 Patient Globa l Impression of Severity 
Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) is a single question asking the patient to rate 
the severity of their symptoms using a 6-point categorical response scale (0=no symptoms, 
6=Very severe symptoms).  Improvement from ba seline using the PGI-S will include changes 
from moderate, severe, and very severe to no symptoms, very mild, and mild.
3.3.2 Clinician Global Impression of Change and Patient Global Impression of 
Change 
Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGI-C) instruments are used for an overall evaluation of response to treatment. The 
Investigator (clinician) and the patient will be asked to rate the degree of change in the overall asthma status compared to the start of treatmen t, ie, randomization visit. A 7-point rating 
scale will be used: 1=Very Much Improved, 2=Much Improved, 3=Minimally Improved, 
4=No Changes, 5=Minimally Worse, 6=Much Worse, and 7=Very Much Worse.
The Investigator and the patient will be asked to rate the degree of change in the overall status 
compared with the randomization visit. There will be no imputation for missing values.
Patients will also be categorized according to the following responses post-baseline, 
separately for CGI-C and PGI-C:
! Very much improved, much improved, minimally improved → ‘Improved’
! Very much improved, much improved → ‘Much improved’
! Very much improved → ‘Very much improved’
Agreement between CGI-C and PGI-C will be assessed at each visit, where agreement is 
achieved when both the Investigator and the patient provide the same response (eg, if both the 
Investigator and the patient indicate a response of 1 (very much improved) at a particular visit, 
agreement is achieved for that visit). Agreement will also be assessed for categorized responses at each visit.
A responder will be defined for CGI-C and PGI-C separately as anyone with a response of 
Improved, Much improved, or Very much improved at the EOT visit.

233.5.2 Laboratory variables
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry,  hematology, and urinalysis 
parameters will be taken at the times detailed in the CSP and will be assessed in a central 
laboratory. The parameters outlined in Section 5.2.1, Table 4 of the CSP will be collected. 
In summaries, figures, and listings, lab results and normal ranges will be presented in System 
International (SI) units. Eosinophil data will be presented in both SI and conventional units 
(cells/μL) in summaries. 
For the purposes of clinical chemistry,  hematology, and urinalysis shift tables, baseline will be 
defined as the last available non-missing assessment prior to first dose of randomized 
treatment, and maximum or minimum value post-ba seline will be calculated over the entire 
post-baseline period, including the post-treatment period.
Changes in h ematology and clinical chemistry variables between baseline and each 
post-baseline assessment will be calculated.  The change from baseline is defined as the 
post-baseline visit value minus the baseline visit value. There will be no imputation for missing values.  For values recorded with a leading greater than or less than (‘>’, ‘<’) symbol, 
the reported numeric value will be used for analysis and the value with the symbol will be 
included in the listings, unless otherwise specified. For example, a value of <0.01 will be analyzed as 0.01 and listed as <0.01.
Absolute values will be compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below 
range), normal (within range or on limits), or high (above range). The central reference ranges will be used for laboratory variables. All values (absolute and change) falling outside 
the reference ranges will be flagged.
Urinalysis data will be categorized as negative (0), positive (+), or strongly positive (++, +++, 
or >+++) at each timepoint.
For the liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-GT (GGT), and total bilirubin (TBL), the 
multiple of the central laboratory upper limit of the normal (ULN) range will be calculated for 
each data point.

recorded as not clinically significant or clinically significant.
3.5.4 Physical examination
Complete and brief physical examinations will be performed at timepoint specified in Tables 2
and 3 of the CSP. 
Baseline data will be collected at Visit 1. Any new finding(s) or aggravated existing 
finding(s), judged as clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], will be reported as an AE as 
described in Section 6.3 of the CSP.
3.5.5 Vital signs
Pre-dose vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487],
and body temperature) will be obtained in accordance with the visit schedule provided in the 
CSP.
Changes in vital signs variables between baseline and each subsequent scheduled assessment 
will be calculated. Baseline is defined as the last value prior to the first dose of randomized
treatment. The change from baseline is defined as the post-baseline visit value minus the 
baseline visit value. There will be no imputation for missing values.
Absolute values will be compared with the reference ranges in Table 2 and classified as low 
(below range), normal (within range or on limits), or high (above range). All values (absolute 
and change) falling outside the reference ranges will be flagged.

4. ANALYSIS METHODS
4.1 General principles
The analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will incl ude all data captured 
during the 12-week double-blind treatment period, defined as the period after administration 
of randomized IP at Visit 4 (Week 0) and the conclusion of Visit 10 (Week 12), inclusive. This includes data regardless of whether study treatment was prematurely discontinued or 
delayed, and/or irrespective of protocol adhere nce, unless the patient withdraws consent to 
study participation. The statistical analyses  will compare benralizumab with placebo. The 
analysis of safety endpoints will include all data captured during the on-study period, defined 
as the period after first administration of randomized IP at Visit 4 (Week 0) and the 
conclusion of the scheduled post-tr eatment FU visit (Week 11), inclusive.

values recorded against the scheduled timepoints listed in the protocol will be used. When 
assessing minimum/maximum increases or decreases during the study, all assessments, including unscheduled assessments will be used. For analysis assessing change from baseline, 
only patients with both baseline and at least [ADDRESS_1251196]-baseline measure will be 
included. 
Given there is a single primary endpoint and treatment comparison, no formal testing strategy
will be used for the analysis in this study.
All hypothesis testing will be reported using 2-sided tests. All p-values apart from the 
primary analyses of the primary endpoint will be nominal. All p-values will be rounded to 4 
decimal places. 
The absolute change from baseline is computed as ( visit value – baseline value ). Percent 
change from bas eline is computed as ([ visit value – baseline value ]/baseline value )×100%. If 
either a visit value or the baseline visit value is missing, the absolute change from baseline 
value and the percent change from baseline will also be set to missing.

1and at least [ADDRESS_1251199]-baseline 
protocol specific visits (up to and including the EOT Visit). Treatment group will be fitted as 
the explanatory variable, region, visit and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects, and
baseline pre-BD FEV 1will be fitted as a covariate. The variance-covariance matrix will be 
assumed to be unstructured. If the procedur e does not converge, then a compound symmetric 
variance-covariance matrix will be used instead. The model is:
Change in FEV 1=treatment+baseline pre-BD FEV 1+region+visit+treatment*visit
The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of benralizumab on the time 
course of change (onset and maintenance of effect) of pre-BD FEV 1using the model 
described above. The first post-baseline timepoint where the p-value for the mean difference between benralizumab and placebo is ≤0.[ADDRESS_1251200]. 
The average over the mean differences between benralizumab and placebo based on the 
change from baseline (Visit 4) to Days 28 (Visit 8), 56 (Visit 9), and 84 (Visit 10) in pre-BD FEV1 will be used to determine if the study is positive as well as to determine the

[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup analysis
To explore the uniformity of the detected overall treatment effect on the primary efficacy 
variable, subgroup analyses, in cluding statistical modelling where the interaction between 
treatment and covariates to estimate the treatment effect within each subgroup, may be 
performed for the following factors for mainten ance of effect: OCS use at baseline (yes/no) ,
gender, race, age group categories (<65, ≥65 years), geographic region, BMI ( ≤35, >35 
kg/m2), the number of exacerbations during the previous year (2, ≥3 exacerbations), nasal 
polyps (yes/no), baseline immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration (<150kU/L, ≥150kU/L ),
baseline EOS and FeNO. In addition, an overall standardized effects plot and forest plot 
across all subgroups will be produced for maintenance of effect. ANCOVA will be utilized in 
the overall standardized effects plot to assure convergence and avoid run-time issue. Average value from Day 28, [ADDRESS_1251202] (LOCF) prior to the average of Day 28, 56 and 84 
is derived.
Additionally, subgroup analysis of pre-BD FEV
1will be performed to explore the relationship 
with baseline blood eosinophil counts using the categories ≥300-449/μL and ≥450/μL, and 
with baseline FeNO using the categories of ≤50 and >50 ppb. Blood eosinophil data collected 
at Screening visit will be used for this categorization to ensure that all subjects can be 
classified and included in the summary.
It is important to note that the study has not been designed or powered to assess efficacy 
within any of these pre-defined subgroups, and as such, these analyses are considered
exploratory.

[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive analyses
The modelled treatment response as well as differences between benralizumab and placebo 
using the mean change from baseline in pre-BD FEV 1endpoint using an exponential model 
over time will be estimated. The model will be used to determine the modelled time to onset 
of effect.
Onset of effect will be defined as: (i) the time taken for benralizumab and placebo to reach a 
pre-defined change from baseline value, (i i) the time taken for the difference between 
benralizumab and placebo [change from baseline v alues to reach a pre-defined value.  
As detailed in the study protocol, the main focus is to estimate onset of effect using the 
primary variable, pre-BD FEV1.  Onset of effect will be estimated using change from baseline 
measurements which were scheduled on days 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84, actual day that data is collected in study is utilized. An e xponential relationship will be assumed over time (Gelman, 
et al 2013), using Bayesian methodology (Marostica, et al 2013) to fit a nonlinear mixed 
effects model to the observed data. The fitted model will then be used to estimate onset of 
effect for the set of change from baseline values 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mL and the 
set of differences 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mL . In addition, an average change from 
baseline will be estimated for days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28, 56, 84, and the proportion of subjects with a change from baseline value greater than or equal to {50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 
and 300 mL} will be estimated for days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84.  Differences between 
proportions and odds ratios will also be estimated.
It is anticipated that an exponential model will  adequately describe pre-BD FEV1 change from 
baseline over time, based on (Gelman, et al 2013) and modelling similar data taken from the 
Phase III SIROCCO and CALIMA trials.  However, if the data show that an exponential 
model is a poor choice, an alternative model w ill be investigated following the same principles 
outlined below.
In addition to pre-BD FEV1, one or more secondary variables may also be investigated.As described in the protocol, measurements for pre-BD FEV1 will be recorded on day 0, 3, 7, 
14, 28, 56, 84. For every subject, pre-BD FE V1 change from baseline values w ill be 
calculated for day 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 84.  If a ba seline value or post-baseline measurement is 
missing, the corresponding change from baseline value will be set to missing.  Onset of effect 
will be estimated for subjects in the full analysis set (FAS) with a baseline value and at least 
one pre-BD FEV1 measurement recorded after the first dose of study drug.
Model
For each treatment separately, Bayesian methodology will be used to fit the following 
nonlinear mixed effects model to the observed pre-BD FEV1 change from baseline data

Alternative models
Convergence issues may arise when carrying out the planned analysis and it may be deemed 
necessary to consider alternatives for (i) the set of priors, (ii) the distributions associated with the model parameters describing the data and (iii) the exponential model.  
However, if such changes still lead to convergence issues, a simplified analysis will be carried 
out whereby [CONTACT_893435] (or alternative) will be fitted through the mean change from baseline values for each treatment.  Consequently, focus will be based on point estimates 
only, without any measures of precision, given that between-subject and 
within-subject components could not be incorporated in the model successfully.  In this case, we will estimate

47related reason for discontinuation, as defined in Tables 1 and 2).  Dependent on these outputs 
additional exploratory analyses may be produced as deemed necessary to further understand 
the pattern of missing data.
Primary analysis under the Treatment Policy Estimand using the Missing at Random
assumption
The primary analysis of the pre-BD FEV 1is under the treatment polic y estimand wh ich allows 
for differences in outcomes over the entire study treatment period to reflect the effect of 
initially assigned randomized treatment as well as if subsequent treatments are taken. This 
primary analysis includes all data until patients wi thdraw from the study regardless of if they 
discontinue from randomised treatment. The Mixed Model Repeated Measures model 
(MMRM) used is a direct likelihood approach (DL) which is valid under the Missing at 
Random (MAR) assumption.
Sensitivity analysis under the Treatment Policy Estimand using both MAR and MNAR 
assumptions
To examine the sensitivity of the results of  the primary analysis to departures from the 
underlying assumptions, sensitivity analyses of the repeated measures analyses will be 
performed for the pre-BD FEV 1using controlled sequential multiple imputation methods 
based on pattern mixture models, as described in the European Medicines Agency Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (EMA 2010). As with the primary analysis, 
the sensitivity analyses include all data unitl p atients withdrew from the study regardless of if 
patients discontinue from randomised treatment.
The imputation process consists of a sequence of multiple imputation (MI) steps, where each 
step is intended to impute missing values at [ADDRESS_1251226] correlations with 
future (unobserved) visits similar to  patients in the placebo arm. This allows us to assess 
various deviations from the MAR assumption.
The assumptions that will be used to impute the missing data who withdraw early are as 
follows:
(a) MAR: Assumes that the trajectory for patients who dropped out in each arm is 
similar to those observed in their own treatment arm
(b) DRMI: Assumes that the trajectory for patients in the benralizumab arms who 
dropped out for a treatment related reasons (according to the classification for
DRMI) is similar to that of the placebo patients, whereas the remaining patients who has dropped out are imputed assuming MAR.
Approach b) can be considered more conservative than the approach for the primary analysis 
because the assumptions mean that as soon as patients withdra w for a treatment related reason, 
they begin to worsen immediately.

48The MNAR imputation is achieved by [CONTACT_893450]. Imputation will be done in 2 steps,  the non-monotone (intermediate) missing 
FEV 1values will be imputed first (Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] method is used to 
partially impute the data using SAS PROC MI) a nd then the missing value at each visit will be 
imputed using a sequential regression method (using MONOTONE REG option of SAS 
PROC MI). 
For example, to impute missing values at time tfor patients in the benralizumab arms who
dropped out due to an AE, include only placebo observations up to and including time t, plus 
observations from patients in the benralizumab arms, that dropped out due to an AE, up to and including time t-1. This is carried out for each visit, 1 at a time using observed data, and 
missing values imputed up until that visit. Placebo missing observations and benralizumab 
observations that are not missing due to AEs are imputed assuming missing at random (MAR) and follow the pattern of observed placebo observations in each treatment arm, respectively. 
One-hundred imputations  will be carried out.  A seed of 784088 will be used for the monotone 
imputation step and a seed of 409345 will be used for the sequential regression imputation step. The analysis of each imputed dataset will be as described for the primary analysis in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and these will be combined using SAS procedure PROC MIANALYZE.
To avoid possible convergence issues when fitting MMRM models to [ADDRESS_1251227] imputation where the model 
converges will be used as the starting values to fit the models for all imputed datasets.
A summary of reasons for patients withdrawi ng from the benralizumab treatment arm and the 
corresponding treatment arm used to calculate the imputation under MAR, and DRMI is given 
in Table 1.

Patient decision Benralizumab Based on review prior to study

Other Benralizumab Based on review prior to study

*Development of study-specific discontinuation criteria are based on the following:  anaphylactic reaction to the 
IP requiring administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], development of helminth parasitic infestations requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], [ADDRESS_1251228] case assumptions about missing data.  The MAR multiple imputation approach is expected to correspond clos ely to the primary analysis, and is included 
to allow for comparisons with MNAR assumptions (specifically methods b) using the same 
multiple imputation methodology.
The dropout reason-based multiple imputation (DRMI) approach was selected as the most 
conservative approach based on the fact that placebo patients are receiving standard of care 
and are not expected to change to a substantially more effective treatment after withdrawing from study or study treatment. For patients receiving benralizumab who withdraw from the 
study due to treatment related reasons, it is assumed that, at worst, they would be on the 
standard of care treatment, ie, the placebo arm.  For patients receiving benralizumab who 
withdraw from the study due to non-treatment re lated reasons, it seems reasonable to assume 
they would be similar to those patients who complete treatment.
Overall summary of analyses to account for missing data
A summary of the different analyses to be carried out under different estimands and
assumptions are described in Table 3.

51Forest plots will be used to show the primary and sensitivity analysis under the different 
estimands.
It is noted that if the primary analysis is statisti cally significant, it is not necessarily expected 
that all sensitivity analyses will also give statis tically significant results. If the results of the 
sensitivity analyses provide reasonably similar estimates of the treatment effect to the primary 
analysis, this will be interpreted as providing assurance that neither the lost information nor 
the mechanisms which cause the data to be missing have an important effect on primary analysis conclusions. Based on these out puts and the drug’s mechanism of action, the 
plausibility of the assumptions made about missing data in the different analyses will be 
considered and described in the clinical study report.

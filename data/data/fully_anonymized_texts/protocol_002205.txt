Our study, which will enroll and track a representative cohort of 2,160 persons (540 family clusters) for SARS -
CoV -[ADDRESS_658945] federally qualified health center (FQHC) in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Second, we will be able to observe how the risk of infection is evolving differently in low -income underserved 
populations as compared to the general population. Thir d, repeat antibody testing of those who were seropositive 
in the first wave of testing will allow us to test how well antibodies maintain their presence at a second test 6-
months later. There is preliminary evidence that antibodies wane over time, however current evidence is limited 
to few studies and small sample sizes.[ADDRESS_658946] had COVID-19. About 20% of 
the sample reported 7 or higher on this 10-point scale, however only 4% of the sample tested positive. This suggests antibody testing has a large potential to correct beliefs about past infection and promote retesting for those who are 
antibody negative. However, a positive test could potentially reduce willingness to participate in repeat testing. 
Among those who tested positive, about 23% of the sample reported a [ADDRESS_658947] the immune 
response over tim e. Underserved populations face different barriers to testing and these may vary within different 
communities and households. The diversity in Los Angeles allows us to assess how barriers to antibody testing differ for vulnerable groups. Data from our prior study show that Blacks and Latinos were 27 percentage points and 14 percentage points less likely to participate in testing compared to their white counterparts .
2 We also find 
that those with household income less than $50,000 were 17 percentage points l ess likely to take-up antibody testing 
compared to those with household income greater than $100,000. It is important to understand why these disparities exist. The proposed research will shed light on this issue by [CONTACT_509665]/facilitators of test ing including 
Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV- [ADDRESS_658948] a larger increas e in economic activity for 
this population if their perceived risk of leaving the house for work is reduced. This study will allow for improved 
understanding of the factors contributing to uptake of COVID -19 testing in underserved populations, and enhance 
our understanding of public health and health behaviors.

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
The potential risks associated with participation in this study include 1) disclosure of survey responses, 2) disclosure 
of test results and 3) small levels of discomfort from a needless blood draw. It is also possible that participants do 
not know how to interpret their results, which could cause anxiety or undue reductions in prevention behavior. The 
antibody test involves a skin prick on rare occasion lead to prolonged bleeding. People who take medicines called 
blood thinners may have some bleeding from the site for a short time after the test is over.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_658949] disclosure risks: Disclosure of survey responses or test results is highly unlikely. The CLIA lab will only have participant study ID and specimen barcode; they will not have any patient 
identifying information. Data will be recorded with SSL protected web sites to a data warehouse, and transferred over secure network protocol. Data will be kept in a HIPAA compliant version of REDCap and 
in encrypted files on a secure research computing cloud at USC Schaeffer Cent er facilities.  
2. Protections against risks associated with learning results: All participants will receive a debrief after each 
serology test to inform them of what their test results mean for them. Communication of test results will 
align with the Abbott assay Fact Sheet provided by [CONTACT_1622]. The results communication will also follow 
CDC guidelines which suggest that individuals should continue preventive behaviors irrespective of test results and those who are symptomatic should obtain PCR test to check for active infecti on. We will also

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
Social determinants need to be understood in the context of actionable facilitators (things COVID -19 policymakers 
can do) to encourage repeat testing. We will study two types of facilitators (messaging and financial incentives) 
and evaluate the heterogeneity of treatment response based on the characteristics of those tested. We will conduct 
a 2 x 2 (messaging x financial incentive) factorial design (Aim 3) that stratifies on social and behavioral 
determinants (Aim 2) collected as part of an initial survey (Aim 1). We have been studying ways to identify 
powerful incentives for repeated health behaviors. We have found that providing at -risk incentives that can be 
insured with repeat health behavior outperforms direct cash payments of the same expected value. Individuals were 
70% more likely to return to a health screening when insuring against losing a baseline incentive than they were 
when paid cash (p < 0.01). [ADDRESS_658951] losing a weekly incentive than if they were paid equivalently in cash (see Figure 1; p < 0.05).

disadvantaged persons (N = 151)  
 
 
 
2 x 2 Stratified Randomization Messaging  (Factor 1): We will develop simple messaging that frames the decision to test in terms of either: 
(i)family risk, or, (ii) personal risk. These methods will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219], but will be of the form "Antibody testing will 
help you understand your family's risk of getting COVID -19"; and, "Antibody testing will help you understand 
your risk of getting COVID -19". Family risk framing may engender concern for loved ones. It may also make it 
easier to mentally simulate family burdens with COVID-[ADDRESS_658952] the lives of everyone in the family. We hypothesize that the family framing will result in greater uptake of testing and greater repeat testing.  
 
Incentives (Factor 2): We have been studying incentives for repeat testing since 2015.
 [ADDRESS_658953] you are given as an incentive that offers an 80% chance of winning $52. You 
then are told you can guarantee winning this lottery by [CONTACT_7661] a second COVID -[ADDRESS_658954] in 8-months. This is 
preferable to a $10 cash paymen t (i.e., the cost of the insurance  against losing an 80:20 bet on $52) in 8- months. 
To low -income persons, delivering an attractive lottery incentive for baseline testing and then letting persons insure 
this lottery with repeat testing may better encourage retesting by [CONTACT_509666] -of-mind  and relieving them of 
worrisome distractions about money that they may already face. We will construct two incentives for this factor: 
(i) a baseline incen tive offering a 90% chance of $60; (ii) a repeat financial incentive. For (ii) Group 1 receives 
insurance on winning the baseline incentive; Group 2 receives a lottery incentive offering  a 1 in 25 chance of 
winning $150. The expected reward for both Group [ADDRESS_658955] is $6 0 
(i.e., program costs are the same). In prior work, we've shown that insuring against losing a lottery was more 
effective than cash payments in the cost of insurance. Here we explore if this also holds true against low-probability 
and high-reward lotteries for which people may be optimistic about winning.  
 
Messaging and incentives may interact. For example, thinking about the safety of your family after a family-framed message may make insuring against losing a lottery more attractive than another risky lottery.  
 
Testing in a Diverse Population:  Sampling low -income populations is important for research on disparities, 
however, recruiting this population is challenging because they often lack consistent contact [CONTACT_3031], do not 
have internet access, and mistrust research. We will use a novel way of recruiting this population by [CONTACT_509667]- [ADDRESS_658956] 2 days at a 
local FQHC. AltaMed Health Services is our partner on our parent grant R33 AG057395; we have worked with 
them for over 10 years. We will work with the AltaMed Patient Centered Research Advisory Committee (PC -RAC) 
which is committed to ensuring that all research conducted within or in collaboration with AltaMed addresses 
patient and community needs. This committee aims to create a research program that is responsive to patient priorities and concerns, emphasizes community-based participatory research principles, and assures research 
findings improve patient health through strategic program and policy recommendations to promote economic, social, and racial justice. The PC -RAC is administered through AltaMed's Health Equity and Access for Latinos 
(HEAL) project whose mission is to develop a patient/community engaged research process. We will recruit two patients who have tested positive for COVID-[ADDRESS_658957] immunity. 
Many questions about social barr iers and behavioral facilitators remain unanswered.  
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
Social determinants need to be understood in the context of actionable facilitators (things COVID-19 policymakers can do) 
to encourage repeat testing. We will study two types of facilitators (messaging and financial incentives) and evaluate the 
heterogeneity of treatment response based on the characteristics of those tested. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (messaging x 
financial incentive) factorial design (Aim 3) that stratifies on social and behavioral determinants (Aim 2) collected as part 
of an initial survey (Aim 1). We have been studying ways to identify powerful incentives for repeated health behaviors. We 
have found that providing at -risk incentives that can be insured with repeat health behavior outperforms direct cas h 
payments of the same expected value. Individuals were 70% more likely to return to a health screening when insuring 
against losing a baseline incentive than they were when paid cash (p < 0.01).[ADDRESS_658958] losing a weekly incentive than if they were paid equivalently in cash 
(see Figure 1; p < 0.05).[ADDRESS_658959] completed the study if he or she has completed the baseline assessment, 
participated in antibody testing and the 6 -month follow -up assessment.   Participants will be debriefed at the end 
of the study.  
 
The end of the study i s defined as completion of the 6 -month follow -up assessment shown in the Schedule of 
Activities [(SoA), Section 1.3 ]. 
[ADDRESS_658960] of patients on the registries of AltaMed’s [ADDRESS_658961] 2 days.  
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
We will use simple random sampling within the AltaMed patient registry to identify AltaMed patients (and family 
members) for study recruitment.   Adults and children [ADDRESS_658962] of patients on the registries of AltaMed’s  [ADDRESS_658963] meet the inclusion criteria prior to enrollment. We will use stratified random 
sampling within the AltaMed patient registry to identify AltaMed patients (and their family members) for study 
recruitment. Stratification will be by [CONTACT_509668]: using zipcodes, we identified the median distance 
of patients empanelled in any Los Angeles County AltaMed clinic to the testing site, and we then identified roughly equal random samples of those living less than this m edian distance (n=3148) and those living more than 
this median distance (n=3074). In contact[CONTACT_509669], all adults and children 5 years of age and older will be invited to participate in testing; at least one adult and one child from a household must be willing to 
participate in order to be eligible for testing. 
 
 
Only one adult member (head of household) will be completing the survey.   Minors will not be completing survey 
questions. Children under [ADDRESS_658964] devices are not 
recommended for children under 5.   
 
Study participants will be recruited via phone by a culturally competent, bilingual research coordinator from 
The Henne Group. Consent for participating in the study will be a two -part process. As part of the initial 
recruitment call, The Henne Group callers will describe the study and ask adult (head of household) if they would like to participate in a survey about COVID -[ADDRESS_658965] testing 
decisions. Participants who decline participation will be asked for reasons why they declined.  
Adult participants who provide verbal consent for the survey will complete the baseline survey, a one time survey 
which takes approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. Survey responses will be documented in the participant's 
REDCap record. After the baselin e survey is completed, participants and their family members will be scheduled 
for antibody testing at a time convenient for them. After the baseline survey is completed we will ask if the 
participant is interested in participating in testing. If yes, the coordinator will explain the risk and benefits of testing. 
S/he will also inform participants that if they accept testing they will receive a lottery ticket that carries a 90% 
chance of winning $[ADDRESS_658966]; and that for rete sting they will receive either insurance 
on their initial lottery ticket or will be given an addition lottery ticket with a 4% (1 in 25) chance of winning $150. 
Each participant who consents to participate in the baseline survey will receive an incentive p ayment of $[ADDRESS_658967] their lotteries played. Participants who consent for baseline survey but decline testing will be asked for reasons why they declined.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
We will study two types of facilitators (messaging and financial incentives) and evaluate the heterogeneity of 
treatment response based on the characteristics of those tested. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (messaging x financial 
incentive) factorial design that stratifies on social and behavioral determinants collected as part of an initial survey. We have been studying ways to identify powerful incentives for repeated health behaviors. We have 
found that providing at -risk incentives that can be insured with repeat health behavior outperforms direct cash 
payments of the same expected value. Individuals were 70% more likely to return to a health screening when 
insuring against losing a baseline incentive than they were when paid cash (p < 0.01).
 [ADDRESS_658968] losing a weekly incentive 
than if th ey were paid equi valently in cash.  
Messaging (Factor 1): We will develop simple messaging that frames the decision to test in terms of either: (i) 
family risk, or, (ii) personal risk. These methods will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219], but will be of the form "Antibody testing will help 
you understand your family's risk of getting COVID -19"; and, "Antibody testing will help you understand your risk 
of getting COVID -19". Family risk framing may engender  concern for loved ones. It may also make it easier to 
mentally simulate family burdens with COVID-[ADDRESS_658969] the lives of everyone in the family. We hypothesize that the family f raming will result 
in greater uptake o f testing and greater repeat testing.  
Incentives (Factor 2): We have been studying incentives for repeat testing since 2015. [ADDRESS_658970] you are given as an incentive that offers an 80% chance of winning $52. You then are told you can guarantee winning this lottery by [CONTACT_7661] a second COVID -[ADDRESS_658971] in 8 -months. This is 
preferable to a $10 cash paymen t (i.e., the cost of the insurance  against losing an 80:20 bet on $52) in 8-months. 
To low -income persons, delivering an attractive lottery incentive for baseline testing and then letting persons 
insure this lottery with repeat testing may better encourage retesting by [CONTACT_509666] -of-mind  and relieving them 
Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV- [ADDRESS_658972] two incentives for this factor: 
(i) a baseline incentive offering a 90% chance of $60; (ii) a repeat financial incentive. For (ii) Group 1 receives 
insurance on winning the  baseline incentive; Group 2 receives a lottery incentive offering a 1 in 25 chance of 
winning $150. The expected reward for both Group [ADDRESS_658973] is $60 
(i.e., program costs are the same). In prior work, we've sh own that insuring against losing a lottery was more 
effective than cash payments in the cost of insurance. Here we explore if this also holds true against low-
probability and high-reward lotteries for which people may be optimistic about winning.  
Messaging and incentives may interact. For example, thinking about the safety of your family after a family-
framed message may make insuring against losing a lottery more attractive than another risk  lottery.  
 
 
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
Clinical research coordinators will be blinded to the participant’s condition. Participants will receive information 
on the intervention arm as part of the initial recruitment phone call and will also receive a reminder at the time of 
initial test visit. This will be provided as either a sealed envelope or email/text (based on participant preference) 
with test return instructions and information on the incentive they will be receiving.   Lotteries will be played and 
incentives paid at the time of Wave [ADDRESS_658974] TRAINING  AND TRACKING  
All recruitment callers will be trained on the randomization process and the relevant scripts household members 
should receive depending on intervention arm assignment. CRCs are blinded to intervention assignment; site 
monitors will cross check intervention assignment and ensure participants are getting correct reminder instructions.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Randomization will occur at the beginning of the study using the following steps:  

Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV- [ADDRESS_658975] of 6,222 names from AltaMed Health Services (3074 in the “far” 
group and 3148 in the “near” group; “far”/”near” based on further/nearer than the median 
distance of LA AltaMed patient zip codes from the testing site’s zip code).   
o Using this list, The Henne Group will reach out to these participants asking if they would 
like to participate in the study and have a child in the household.   
o Each household will be assigned a study ID; each participant will have a Study ID 
number as well as a medical record number (for patients only) from AltaMed to 
incorporate into the EHR.  
o A list of eligible participants will be available in our HIPAA compliant version of 
REDCap  with their name, research ID and script option (4 options - 2 for messaging/ 2 
for financial incentives)   
o Using the randomization feature in REDCap , we will be able to randomize the scripts 
that each participant will receive.  
 Onsite Clinical research coordinators will be blinded to the participant’s condition.

8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ).  OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, 
in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described 
in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. ] 
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
 
Unanticipated Problems that are unexpected, related or possibly related to this research (including anywhere there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident or outcome may have been caused or associated with the study) and that 
suggests that the resear ch places clinicians or patients at greater risk of harm than was previously known or 
recognized will be thoroughly and promptly investigated. The Unanticipated Problem will be investigated, formally 
written down with a corrective plan and measures to prev ent reoccurrence. This report will be shared with the NIA 
Program Officer within 48 hours of study’s knowledge of the problem.  
 
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_658979] the following hypothesis based 
on analysis of literature on testing for HIV and Hepatitis as well as preliminary analysis of data from our prior study:  
Hypothesis 1: Those who believe that they have been infected in the past would be more likely agree to testing  to confirm 
that they have antibodies and potential immunity; Hypothesis 2: People with poor health literacy w ill be less likely to 
agree to testing  as they might find it daunting to understand what the test does and how to interpret results ; Hypothesis 
3: Those who are risk averse would be more likely to agree to testing as it reduces uncertainty about serostatus; 
Hypothesis 4: Those with preexisting health conditions would be more likely to agree to testing  as they face higher risks 
from COVID -[ADDRESS_658980] more to gain from learning serostatus; Hypothesis 5 : Minorities and those in lower socio -
Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV- [ADDRESS_658981] in health care/research, 
poor past experience, and perception of being at low risk of infection.  We also generate hypotheses for facilitators to 
retesting (r) relative to those who take a first test Hypothesis 1r: Persons who practice low COVID-[ADDRESS_658982] incentive. Hypothesis 2r:  Those persons with 
low income, unemployed, or have high stress or anxiety may respond most to insurance of incentives. Hypothesis 3r: 
Persons who are sero+ at baseline will be less likely to return for a retest. Hypothesis 4r:  Lottery insurance and family 
messaging will induce higher retesting rates. Hypotheses [ADDRESS_658983]. 
Hypotheses 1r and 2r refer to heterogeneity of treatment effects for retesting, while 3r and 4r are main effects  on retesting.

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
We will recruit a cohort of 2,160 people (540 families ), and  stratify into 3 subgroups based on predictors of 
commitment to participation in testing programs. Randomizat ion will be clustered by [CONTACT_5569]. Sub -group 
membership will be based on the mean household survey response to the survey component. For the purposes of 
power analyses, we assume high Intra Cluster Correlation within family on uptake of repeat testing (>0.90).

Assuming a similar effect size to prior studies in similar populations, we expect a [ADDRESS_658985] 
as little as 3 percentage point difference between interventions and controls in the 540 households we will enroll. 
To assess heterogeneity of treatment effects (THE) , there is more than 80% power to detect a between -subgroup 
difference of [ADDRESS_658986] information.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Aim 1 (Hypotheses 1 -5): Data from the baseline survey combined with data on which heads of households 
attended Time 1 testing will be used to address Aim 1. In particular, we will estimate logistic regressions where 
the dependent variable will be the binary indicator whether the head of household attended Time 1 testing (yes 
vs. no). The key independent variables will include:1) prior COVID -19 testing, 2) which SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_658987] trusted, 3) risk aversion, 4) heads of households or fami ly member diagnosis of a 
health condition (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and, 5) race/ethnicity, income, discriminatory incidences, household receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) benefits, and ci ting money as the biggest vaccine barrier.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  Involving Humans   
each head of household reported social determinant of health. This will allow us to identify significant social 
and behavioral determinants for heterogeneity of effects (currently hypothesized in Hypotheses 1 -5 above).  
Aim 2 (Hypotheses 1r-4r): Aim 2 will involve regressing Time 2 retesting (yes vs. no) on the following items 
for Hypotheses 1r -4r: 1r) risk aversion, essential worker status, access to personal protective equipment, and 
risky forms of transportation (e.g., personal vehicle, carpool , bus), 2r) income, discriminatory incidences, 
employment status, whether heads of households personally, or other family members suffer from depression 
and/or mental health issues, and household receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, 3r) Time 1 seropositivity status and, 4r) the Financial Incentive 
and Messaging study arms.

9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
We will explore heterogeneity of treatment effects by [CONTACT_509670] 2 to assess whether receptivity to 
study arm (e.g., personal messaging/loss protection) differs by [CONTACT_509671] 1 through 5. To assess seroprevalence trends, we will use separate hierarchical 
models with a random household intercept to regress seropositivity status (yes vs. no), IgG value, and IgM va lue on testing time (Time 1 vs. Time 2). 
9.4.3  SAFETY ANALYSES  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. We 
will establish a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) in the first month of the project. The Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in a n advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor 

Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_658988] (DSMB) in the first month of the project. The board will be composed of 
experts in behavioral economics, a physician with expertise in COVID-19, and a biostatistician. The 
DSMB is granted full power to recommend discontinuation of the study to the consolidated IRB, if safety 
concerns are found. A detailed Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be submitted for IRB approval prior 
to the accrual of human subjects.  
 
9.4.4  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics (e.g., demographics , laboratory 
measurements, behavioral characteristics)  using descriptive statistics.  
 
9.4.5  PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
There will be no interim analysis on the primary outcome. However, we will look at demographic 
characteristics of participants after 1 week of testing to determine stratification thresholds.  
9.4.6  SUB -GROUP ANALYSES  
All individuals meeting the study inclusion criteria will participate in the study. We will not under sample 
or oversample women and/or members of minority racial and ethnic groups, so we expect to enroll them 
in proportion to their population prevalence. We will have access to the sex/gender and race/ethnicity of 
participants and will conduct analyses to invest igate any differences between groups. This project aims to 
evaluate the effectiveness of risk -based messaging and incentives that promote repeated testing for 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_658989] party call center, The Henne Group (https://www.thehennegroup.com/). Consent for 
participating in the study will be a two -part process. First, participants will be asked if they would like to 
Use of Behavioral Economics in Repeat SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_658990] the informed 
consent process with participants in their preferred language.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Each participant will sign a paper form (children 5 -13 will sign the assent form; minors 14-17 and adults 
18 and over will sign the consent form) and the CRC will take a photo of the forms and upload into the 
participant’s REDCap record using the study iPad. Participants will be given the paper forms for their 
personal records.  All participants will also sign the [LOCATION_004] Bill of Rights; AltaMed patients will be 
required to sign HIPAA authorization.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
A photo of the signed informed consent and assent forms will be uploaded into the participant’s REDCap 
record using the study iPad. All study participants will receive a copy of the signed and dated consent 
document. The name [CONTACT_509679].  
 
If a consent document is revised due to changes in study procedures, subjects who were enrolled prior to 
the change, but are affected by [CONTACT_134404], will be informed of the changes and will sign the amended 
consent document.   If a consent document is revised due to changes in the risks or safety of the study, all 
active participants must sign the revised consent.  Informed consent will only occur at one time point (first 
test). If a minor turns [ADDRESS_658991], we will re -consent them as an adult . 
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
Although we do not anticipate this happening, t his study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely 
terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study 
suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_509672], 
investigator, funding age ncy, and regulatory authorities . If the study is prematurely terminated or 
suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study participants, the In stitutional Review 
Board (IRB), and sponsor /funding agency and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. 
Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance of study staff to the protocol  (ie, significant protocol violations)  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  
 
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed , 
and satisfy the funding agency, sponsor, IRB,  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA), or other relevant 
regulatory or oversight bodies (OHRP, DSMB) .

10.1.11  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY   
Our Resource Sharing plan is committed to the ideals of collaborative research, and as such, will adhere 
to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy on rigor and reproducibility and data and resource 
sharing. Oversight of the data and resource sharin g will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jason Doctor, PI [INVESTIGATOR_509663].  
Study data will be maintained on a HIPAA compliant server where PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators will have full 
access. All members of the investigative team are to share access to the data generated by [CONTACT_509674]. The project manager will prepare and 
make available meeting minutes from all study meetings through Box, a secured access server extensively 
used by [CONTACT_509675]. We 
will use data repositories such as github to post analysis code and data.  
All data and resources generated through this project will be available for replication on a website or 
repository hosted on the Schaeffer research cloud. This will include a study protocol (with detailed 
information on recruitment, randomization, and workflow specifications), analytical codes, and any other 
study specific resources necessary to facilitate replication. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_509664] a timely manner, and no later than t he 
online publication date of any publications. To the extent allowed by [CONTACT_509676]. We will present preliminary findings at scientific 
conferences.  
Data will be a HIPAA-compliant, limited data set. Prior to sharing of data, data use agreements will be 
executed and data will only be made accessible to key project staff. The data use agreement will include 
language requiring the user(s) to certify that no attempt will be made to reidentify participants from de -
identified data. We will obtain consent to share de-identified primary data to the scientific community. These data will be available post publication of results to the network and broader scientif ic community. 
All project personnel handling study data will be certified by [CONTACT_509677] (CITI) program, which consists of courses in the Protection of Human Research Subjects for Biomedical 
Research and added to the study IRB . These measures should be effective in minimizing breaches of 
confidentiality.

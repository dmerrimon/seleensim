Project Summary  Provide a succinct and accurate description of the proposed research. State the purpose/aims. Describe 
concisely the research design and methods for achieving the stated goals. This section should be 
understandable to all members of the IRB, scientific and non-scientific.   
DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED . 
Purpose/Objectives : Current pharmacologic agents for neuropathic p ain (NP) in Spi[INVESTIGATOR_174452] (SCI) provide 20 -30% pain 
reduction at best; so there is clear need for research studies on new promising evidence-b ased therapeutic agents. Animal spi[INVESTIGATOR_174453], member 1 ( TRPV1 ) defunctionalization with capsaicin 
decreases nociceptor hyperactivity. Human trials are needed to subs tantiate this effect. Most systemic effects of oral agents often limit 
tolerability, especially as doses are titrated up to achieved maximum clinical effect. Analgesics that can be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_174454]; the only published study of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_174455] [ADDRESS_203732] prospective trial  of Capsaicin 8% (C8P )  in persons with SCI, with hopes to provide SCI patients and 
clinicians with evidence for a much -needed alternative topi[INVESTIGATOR_174456].  
 
Research Design/Plan :  Randomized dual balanced 2- sequence 2-treatment, 2-period (each period is 12 weeks long) , crossover 
study ; with an additional prospective trial arm  
 
Methods : 
Randomized control trial : We will recruit 25 patients with chronic SCI and chronic focal neuropath ic pain (>6months) below level of 
injury who have failed multiple pharmacological agents. Pre- study data collection will include subjective description of pain, baseline 
visual analog scale ( VAS) and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS ) values , LANNS pain score survey to accurately determine source of 
pain is neuropathic in origin,  a numerical scale such as  World Health Organization Quality of Life- (WHOQOL) brief survey 
(WHOQOL -BREF ) that measures quality of life parameters, subjective SCIM ( spi[INVESTIGATOR_174457]) scores, SCI specific 
pain measures (MPI -SCI), and pain diagrams will be obtained on each participant. Written informed consent will be obtained. Each 
participant will be randomized to one of two sequences:  
Sequence 1: C8P application followed by [CONTACT_174469] a low dose capsaicin control patch (0.025% Well Patch)  (available 
over the counter)  
OR 
Sequence 2: C ontrol patch (0.025% Well Patch)  followed by [CONTACT_174470] C8P . as indicated in Table 1.    
Measurements of the primary outcome of pain (VAS) will occur every 2 weeks and all secondary outcomes will be measured  at 4,8 and 
12 weeks within each period in each sequence.  
 
Substudy:  Non-randomized, non-controlled sub-study : We will also have a non -randomized non- controlled sub-study  to increase data 
obtained to help calculate Number needed to treat  and minimal clinically important difference for the RCT. . Patients with SCI 
undergoing patch as routine medical treatment for refractory neuropathic pain will be recruited and enrolled immediately after patch 
application. Subsequently, they will be be followed for a [ADDRESS_203733] , without 
reapplication of a control patch.   
 
Clinical Relevance:  Potentially giving analgesic pain relief for spi[INVESTIGATOR_174458], take oral tablets/ca psules, or apply a transdermal patch, cream or ointment on a daily basis.

uses of this drug/device in Capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza) is an FDA approved treatment for neuropathic pain in post herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN) . After the FDA approval of Qutenza several studies have been published assessing the 
effica cy and safety in patients with HIV autonomic neuropathy and PHN. In a meta -analysis examining 
2057 persons with PHN and HIV -AN, the proportion of responders  with relief (>30% improvement in pain 
lasting from 2- 12 weeks) over a 12 -week treatment period was 43% in the C8P group and 34% in the 
control group, a statistically significant difference.   
A retrospective review  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Trbovich and [CONTACT_174480] pending publication in the American 
Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation also supports that  Capsaicin 8% patch provided all three 
patients in the study had complete relief of pain on average after 2 weeks for an average duration of 169 
days.

 If you cut and paste from

sure the excerpted material 
answers the question  While low dose capsaicin cream has shown efficacy with minimal side effects in radicular pain of 8 SCI  
persons, short dosing inter vals (every 1 -4 hours) and poor manual dexterity of persons with SCI (e.g.,  
tetraplegia) can impair efficacy and adherence. Thus the novelty of high dose capsaicin is that a single 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_174459] C8P for only 1 hour could potentially provide pain relief for 8 -12 weeks.

Research Plan / Description of the Research Methods  a.  Provide a comprehensive narrative  describing the research methods .   
Provide the plan for data analysis  (include as applicable the sample size calculat ion). 
 Step -by-Step Methods:  
 
RECRUITMENT:  
RCT: We will identify  25 patients with chronic SCI  from our VA SCI clinic, UH SCI and Rehabilitation Clinics, and/ or local SCI 
population. We will recruit with flyers at the VA and UHS . We will utilize chart review and patient interview to ensure 
patients ) meet inclusion criteria above and have failed multiple pharmacological agents. We will gather demographics, 
clinical history, and imaging on each patient via chart review.   SCI attending [CONTACT_174481] or one of the four 
residents participating in this research - Esha Lukose , Wesley Peace, Brett Helmonds, or Colby [CONTACT_174471] - will contact [CONTACT_174472].  Each patient’s pain will be classified based on a taxonomy utilized 
by [CONTACT_174473][INVESTIGATOR_174462] (ISCIPDS). The ISCIPDS classifies NP into 
three groups: “at level”, “below level”, and “other.” 24 “At level” and “below level” pain must be directly related to SCI 
(central nerve injury) and are the only subjects that will be included in this study.  Pain will also be validated with the 
LANNS pain score survey, which is an accurate tool for validation of pain which is neuropathic in origin.  
 
Substudy:  Non - randomized, non -controlled arm: The VA SCI clinic routinely a pplies the C8P to patients as an off -label 
treatment  for refractory pain control. When a patient has been identified to have had the patch placed, we will consent, 
enroll him/her and follow him every [ADDRESS_203735]. We a im to enroll 50 persons in this arm of the trial.  
 
CONSENT:  
RCT and substudy:  
Patients will be approached in a private outpatient room in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_174463] .or via telephone . 
Risks, benefits, alternative options will be shared and the subjects will be allowed to ask any questions they may have to 
ensure they understand the risks, benefits and goal of study.     
 
PRE STUDY DATA COLLECTION:  
 RCT: Pre-study data including subjective description of pain, baseline VAS , LANNS  and NPRS . Pre -study data collection will 
include an intake form with subjective description of pain, baseline VAS / LANNS/ NPRS, a numerical scale such as SF36 
that measures quality of life parameters, subjective FIM scores, and pain diagrams will be obta ined on each participant via 
the outpatient spi[INVESTIGATOR_174464], or inpatient spi[INVESTIGATOR_174465].   
 
Substudy:  Non randomized, non- controlled arm: no pre -study data collection.  
RANDOMIZATION:  (RCT only)

Inclusion criteria: >1year post SCI, chronic neuropathic pain with VAS>3, pain below the level of injury and failure of at least 
3 oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_174466].  Exclusion criteria: painful area >1120cm2 (4 patches), skin breakdown over area 
and uncontrolled hypertension.   
 
Methods:  
RCT: Each participant will be randomized to one of two sequences:  
Sequence 1: C8P application followed by [CONTACT_174474] a low dose capsaicin control patch (0.025% Well Patch) 
(available over the counter)  
OR 
Sequence 2: Control patch (0.025% Well Patch) followed by [CONTACT_174470] C8P, as indicated in Table 1.    
 
Patch application method: Per manufacturers’ application directions, the painful area will be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] 
15-322H, Trbovich, Form BC, 07- 24-19, AMD.docx  
vSept3 -2014  5 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5% for [ADDRESS_203737] patch (es). Active and control patches will then be ap plied and 
left in place for one hour.  After removal, the cooling gel will be applied to decrease any burning sensation from the capsai cin, 
per manufacturers’ protocol.  Blood pressure will be monitored every 30minutes after the capsaicin (control or treat ment) 
patch over the hour of application.  
 
Substudy:  Non-randomized, non-controlled prospective arm: Patients with SCI undergoing patch as routine medical 
treatment for refractory neuropathic pain will be recruited and enrolled immediately after patch appl ication. Subsequently, 
they will be followed for a [ADDRESS_203738] patch application data collection  (RCT and substudy) : Measurements of the primary outcome (VAS) will occur every 2 
weeks and all secondary outcomes will be measured at 4,  8 and 12 weeks within each period in each sequence.  Every 2 
week VAS scores will be collected via phone at weeks 2,6,10 and in person at weeks 4, 8,  12. All secondary outcomes 
surveys will be done at a face to face visit at weeks 4,  8, 12.  
 
  
Outcome measures:   (RCT and substudy)  
: Primary efficacy endpoint is the visual analog scale (VAS) score at the end of each of the three 12-week periods (at weeks 
12 and 24). Secondary outcome measures include the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) Pain Severity Subscale,  MPI-
SCI, International SCI Pain Basic Data S ubset (SCIPBDS), WHOQOL -BREF,  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_174467] (SCIM) 
and number of concomitant pain medications  
 
Specific Aims:   
1. Determine the effect of the capsaicin 8% patch on VAS scores.  
2. Determine the effect of the 8% Capsaicin (C8P) on QOL.  
3. Determine the effect of the C8P on physical function. . 
 
 
UHS clinic sites:  Patients will be approached by [CONTACT_39487] (who are also investigators in this study), regarding being 
contact[CONTACT_174475]. If agreeable patient’s name [CONTACT_174479]/verbally to the study team at the VA in order to contact [CONTACT_174476]. No PHI will be transferred 
electronically between UHS and the VA. Data for the study will be provided by [CONTACT_174477].  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
RCT: Due to the small population of individuals with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_174468] 8% patch, we felt a small group of [ADDRESS_203739] injury 
studies.  This study will serve as pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger study in the future.  
Substudy:  Non -randomized, non -controlled arm: [ADDRESS_203740] a nd substudy: Data analysis will be performed on subjective description of pain at baseline from NPRS, VAS and 
evaluated at 2, 4, 8, [ADDRESS_203741] application to determine efficacy of capsaicin 8% patch in regards to point value and 
percentage of reduction compared to baseline. L ongevity as recorded by [CONTACT_174478], weeks, and months of relief until pain returns to baseline. We will also compare our quality of life scale ( WHO -QOL)  
and SCIM  scores from pre study to post study and evaluate for more subjective measures of improvement in quality of life 
and functional improvement respectively.  In the RCT trial we will assess for significant differences is outcomes between 
the treatment and con trol groups over time whereas, in the non -randomized, non -controlled trial we will compare 
baseline scores  to [ADDRESS_203742] order carryover.  All statistical testing will be two -sided with a significance 
level of 5%.  SAS Version 9.4 for Windows or later, SAS  Instititue, Cary, North Carolina, or R will be used throughout.

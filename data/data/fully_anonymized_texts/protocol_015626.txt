deficiencies to the aging face.3 Among them  are two well- known injectable  agents : Sculptra® 
(Galderma, New Jersey , [LOCATION_003]) and Radiesse® (+) (Merz  Pharmaceutical , Wisconsin , [LOCATION_003] ). 
Sculptra® is a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)  biostimulator  and Radiesse® (+) is a calcium 
hydroxylapatite (CaHA)  filler. Both treatments are currently FDA -approved in the [LOCATION_002] 
for correction of facial wrinkles and folds. Both provide a delayed but progressive volumizing effect 
by [CONTACT_581267] .4, [ADDRESS_764157] of  PLLA and CaHA  injectables  in the treatment of 
nasolabial folds (NLFs) .  
5. STUDY OBJECTIVE S AND CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
5.1 Study Objectives   
The primary o bjective of this study is to compare gene expression stimulated by a semi -
permanent filler and a biostimulator via punch biopsy . 
The secondary objective of this study is to assess and compare volume c hange in the NLF 
via clinical photography.  
5.2 Clinical Hypothesis  
When each treatment is injected to the skin, it tri ggers a series of biochemical reactions  
and inflammatory responses that contribute  to the production of collagen and other protein 
structures in the extracellular matrix . The result is an aesthetic  increase in skin volume at 
the treated facial area.

7.6 T reatment  Dosage and Mode of Administration 
The injection technique (skin disinfection material, type of syringe, type and gauge of the 
intradermal needle, penetration angle, depth) will be the technique customarily used by [CONTACT_3786] . The type of gauge of the injection needle will be recorded  in the CRFs.  
PLLA : two  treatment sessions at 4-week interval  with the first treatment at Visit 1  and the second 
treatment at Visit 3. Each treatment session will be consisted of multiple deep dermal injections, 
up to 9 mL/session ( or up to  4.5 mL/ NLF/session), into the left and right NLFs  of each subject  
according to the IFU.  The treatment amount for each PLLA subject will be determined at  the 
Investigator discretion to achieve an optimal correction. Within each PLLA subject, t he amount of 
each treatment needs to be equal at the left and right NLFs because of the identical WAS scores. 
The treatment volume injected during each treatment session for each subject will be recorded in the CRFs .  
CaHA :
 up to two treatment sessions at [ADDRESS_764165] treatment at Visit 1 
and an optional  second  treatment at Visit 3  to achieve an optimal cosmetic correction. Each 
treatment session will be consisted of multiple subdermal injections , up to 1.5 mL/session (or up 
to 0.75 mL/NLF/session) , into the left and right NLFs  of each subject according to the IFU. The 
second treatment is optional and will be determined based on the I nvestigator  assessment. If the 
subject needs a second treatment,  an appropriate amount will be determined at the Investigator  
discretion to achieve an  optimal outcome . The amount of each treatment needs to be equal at the 
left and right NLFs because of the identical WAS score s. The treatment  volume injected during 
each treatment session for each subject  will be recorded in the CRFs.  
8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS

12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
adverse event CRF/ eCRF without omitting any requested and known information. When AEs 
occur, the main concern is the safety of the study subjects . At time of the informed consent 
signature, each subject must be given the name [CONTACT_357588].  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, 
the Investigator  should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_243932]:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change, as determined by [CONTACT_737] , in 
concomitant medication(s) that is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change 
from baseline in a subject's medical health following exposure to the study treatment.  
Changes from baseline in any protocol -specific parameter evaluated during the study are to be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . In addition, the subject’s responses to any questionnaire utilized 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change from baseline in a protocol -specific parameter or question response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , is to be reported as an AE. These clinically 
relevant changes will be re ported regardless of causality.  
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject taking part in the clinical study, and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship w ith the 
investigational product and/or a clinical trial procedure.  
An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether 
or not related to this product.  
When an AE has a likely or very likely causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
a clinical trial procedure, it is named undesirable effect or related AE (see Section 3).

Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
12.1.2.  Local tolerability signs and symptoms (only applicable for cosmetic safety studies)  
In cosmetic studies, local skin tolerability includes some expected functional and/or physical signs 
on the application area, observed by [CONTACT_581274]. Those signs are 
collected in the final report based on scales or a diary. If the severity of a local skin tolerability 
sign or symptom, is such that the product application is permanently discontinued and/or a 
corrective concomitant treatment (except moisturizer or emollient) is prescribed, it is recorded as 
an undesirable effect (related AE). 
12.1.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  and serious undesirable effect/related SAE  
A serious adverse event (SAE) involves a serious injury that is life threatening, results in 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure or 
necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function 
or permanent damage to a body structure, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581259].  
Notes:  
The term “immediate vital risk” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
was more severe.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77231] a night at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357562] a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE), elec tive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357563], admission to a day -care facility, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no 
place to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a yearly examination) should not be 
considered as a SAE.  
A serious undesirable effect/related SAE is defined as any SAE which the Investigator  classifies 
as having a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
the clinical trial procedure.  
12.2 Severity Assessment  
For all AEs occurring during the clinical trial, the Investigator  is to classify and report t he intensity 
of AEs using the following definitions as a guideline:  
- Mild: awareness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated  
- Moderate: discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
- Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform usual activity. 
12.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator  is to assess the causal relationship (causality) between an adverse event and 
the investigational product and/or the clinical trial procedure according to the following definitions (Decision of 25 November 2013 on Guideline on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 
(2013/674/EU) - Causality assessment of undesirable effect caused by [CONTACT_357579]):  
• Very likely  
• Likely  
• Not clearly attributable  
  Page 21 of 27 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .020 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
• Unlikely  
• Excluded 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors 
including the pattern of reaction, temporal relationships, positive de -challenge or re -challenge, 
relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent dis eases.  
12.4 Collection, M anagement and Reporting Procedures 
The period of collection of adverse events starts from the time of signature [CONTACT_42956] (ICF) by [CONTACT_423] (and/or, for subjects who are minor, by [CONTACT_7903]/legal 
representatives)  until the end of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is on -going at the final clinical trial visit, it should be followed by 
[CONTACT_581275] a stable condition.  
After the subject completes the clinical study, the Investigator  should also inform the Sponsor 
(see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_2212]) if he/she becomes aware of an SAE involving a subject who has participated in the clinical study.  
At each post -enrollment  visit, the Investigator  will question the subject about AEs using an open 
non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs, for example “ Have you noticed any change in 
your health since the last visit? ” Direct questioning and examination will be performed when 
appropriate.  
The Investigator  will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical records, and (if 
applicable) information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow- up of the subject.  If necessary, the Investigator  will contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99391].  
As a minimum, Investigator s are requested to report in the Case Report Form (CRF) and in 
the report all related adverse events (i.e. undesirable effects) and all Serious Adverse 
Events, whether related or not.  
12.4.1.  Management and reporting procedures for undesirable effects (i.e. related adverse events  
Undesirable effects should be recorded in the CRF and summarized in the report in a summary table with at minimum the subject number, AE number, AE diagnosis or signs and symptoms, 
location, date of onset, seriousness, severity, action taken, relationship, date of resolution and 
concomitant treatment associated as well as a detailed narrative of the event.  
In addition, based on his/her medical judgment, the Investigator  will assess whether an 
undesirable effect requires immediate (i.e. within 24 hours) reporting to the Sponsor. In such cases, the summary table will be sent to the Sponsor, along with the AE narrative and any other 
relevant information (concomitant treatments, product weighing, …).  
All undesirable effects should be appropriately documented, i.e. any relevant information such as 
demographics, medical history and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581260].  
The Investigator  is to monitor and record the progress of the adverse effect until the last subject’s 
study visit.  
The Investigator  is to update the AE narrative as appropriate, each time follow -up information is 
collected and when the final outcome of the adverse effect is known.

12.4.2.  Management and reporting procedures for Serious Adverse Event s  
The Investigator  is to take the following steps:  
1. Take prompt and appropriate medical action, if necessary. The safety of clinical trial 
subjects is the first priority  
2. Ensure the AE is classified as an SAE. Immediately inform the Sponsor’s representative 
of the event by [CONTACT_71345] (see  both contact [CONTACT_2212]) and discuss further actions to 
be taken:  
Global PV email: safety.q -[EMAIL_11059]  
US PV email :  [EMAIL_11060]  
3. Complete the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form provided by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
representative Within 24 hours, fax or send by e- mail to the Sponsor’s representative  
the completed SAE form, accompanied any other relevant information (e.g. test results or medical records).  
4. Monitor, record and send to Sponsor’s representative the progress of the event until it 
resolves or reaches a stable outcome, with or without sequelae (send the updated SAE 
form with follow- up information and any other relevant information to Sponsor’s 
representative).  
5. Obtain and maintain in the subject’s file all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject. If necessary, contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298423].  
6. If applicable, comply with the regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) . 
12.[ADDRESS_764178] should be withdrawn from the clinical study and Sponsor’s representative (see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_357581]) should be informed within [ADDRESS_764179] be recorded as a reason for discontinuation in the exit form of the CRF.  
No specific follow- up of pregnancy is required, except if it is a regulatory requirement in the 
country(ies) where the clinical trial is conducted.

APPENDIX I: BIOPSY PROCEDURE AND POST -CARE  
1. Biopsy Visits  
a. Prepare the Area to be Biopsied  
i. After the patient, guardian, and/or power of attorney have been consented, 
initials are completed the area of skin where biopsy will be performed 
needs to be identified and circled with surgical marker. Once area is 
identified – a photo of area being biopsy is mandatory. Next, the area of 
skin where the biopsy is taking place will be prepared with an alcohol swab 
to ensure sterile conditions prior to procedure.  
b. Anesthetize the Skin 
i. Once the skin has been identified, photo is taken, and prepared wi th 
alcohol  swab - the next step is to anesthetize the area to be biopsied by 
[CONTACT_44579] a solution of Lidocaine 1% and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_581263] 1% with no Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ( if patient is allergic to Epi[INVESTIGATOR_581264]) just 
under the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] (sub -epi[INVESTIGATOR_581265]) using a Syringe. The slight burning 
will quickly subside and the site will become numb. Once area has been anesthetized, it is critical for area to be tested to make sure the area of skin 
being biopsy is indeed numbed.   
c. Biopsy the Skin  
i. After the  area to be biopsied is anesthetized, the biopsy continues. Using 
a sterile 3 mm skin punch, the study investigator applies pressure and twisting in a “drilling” motion until the blade of the skin punch has pi[INVESTIGATOR_581266].  
ii. After the blade has sufficiently “cored” or carved out a 3mm cylinder of skin the punch is removed.  
iii. Nurse assists with hemostasis - gauze, gloves, etc. for bleeding purposes. 
Once specimen is removed by [CONTACT_48368], [ADDRESS_764185] -Biopsy Procedure  
a. Keep the initial dressing/bandage in place and dry for up to [ADDRESS_764186] stitches , you may 
use cotton tipped applicators (Q -tips) around the stitches. It is okay if the 
stitches get wet in the shower after the first 24 hours.  
iii. Gently pat dry the area . 
iv. Apply antibiotic ointment (Polysporin, Bactroban, Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], Gentamicin, Neosporin, Aquaphor, Vaseline) to the affected area.  
v. Cover with Band -Aid or telfa pad (non- stick) dressing and tape.  
c. Repeat this process daily until the wound is healed (usually 5 -7 days) or the 
stitches are removed.  
d. If your wound becomes red, warm, painful, begins to drain or you develop a fever 
of [ADDRESS_764187] pressure to the bandage continuously for fifteen minutes. If the bleedi ng persists 
after fifteen minutes call your provider.  
f. Return to your provider in 5- 14 days for suture removal (Depending on area being 
biopsied) and/or follow up.

3. Suture Removal Visits  
a. Patient will come into office for suture removal visit . 
b. Biopsied area will be cleansed with alcohol swab prior to suture removal . 
c. Sutures will be removed from the biopsy sites.  
d. Once sutures are removed, patient will be instructed to apply antibiotic ointment 
(Polysporin, Bactroban, Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], Gentamicin, Neosporin, Aquaphor, Vaseline) 
to the affected area. Also,  patient will be instructed to keep area covered with a 
Band- Aid or telfa pad dressing and tape.  
e. Repeat this process daily until the wound is healed (usually 5 -7 days) . 
f. If you wound becomes red, warm, painful, begins to drain or develop a fever of 
[ADDRESS_764188] your provider immediately.

Nicotine addiction is a major public health concern.  The purpose of this study is to examine whether 
short -term progesterone administration reduces withdrawal symptoms, cigarette craving , and smoking 
behavior in female and male smokers who abstain from smoking for three days.  In addition, we seek to 
determine whether progesterone administration alters brain gamma -aminobutryic acid (GABA) levels and 
whether neurotransmitter changes are related to changes in withdrawal, craving , and smoking behavior  
 
Background  
 
Sex differences in response to nicotine  
Recently there has been an increased awareness of how sex affects disease states and drug responses, 
including response to drugs of abuse, in humans.  For nicotine response, several recent studies suggest 
differences between men and women.  Women, without pr evious discrimination training, were less able to 
discriminate the effect of nicotine nasal spray on a broad range of doses, compared with men (Perkins, 
1995).  Women may also be less able to titrate their smoking in response to changes in cigarette brand o r 
with prior nicotine administration, compared with men (Perkins et al., 1992).  In addition, among those 
quitting smoking, men but not women, self -administer nicotine nasal spray more than placebo suggesting 
sex differences in reinforcing effects of nicoti ne (Perkins , 1996). Men and women may also differ in 
suppression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms by [CONTACT_38724].  Others have observed that women had less 
suppression of cigarette withdrawal symptoms with 2 mg nicotine polacrilex, compared with men 
(Hatsukami et al., 199 5). Further supporting this observation, several studies reported that female 
smokers might benefit from nicotine replacement treatment for smoking cessation less than men 
(Benowitz and Hatsukami, 1998; Gritz et al., 1996; Wetter et al., 1999).  Since nicotine seems to be less 
reinforcing in women, it has been suggested that non -nicotine smoking stimuli may be more reinforcing in 
women, compared with men (Perkins, 199 6; Perkins et al., 2002).  This idea, if proven, may have 
important treatment impl ications.  Altogether, these studies suggest that women, compared with men, may 
be less sensitive to the subjective and reinforcing effects of nicotine.  
 
Menstrual cycle effects in nicotine dependence  
The menstrual phase effects on nicotine response were i nvestigated in a recent study.  No menstrual 
cycle phase effects were observed on the subjective and physiological response to nicotine nasal spray 
(Marks et al., 1999).  The main limitation of this study was a large dropout rate, [ADDRESS_1113843] to nicotine response, two recent studies reported significant menstrual phase effects in 
response to cocaine and amphetamines.  Sofuoglu and colleagues (1999) investigated sex and menstrual 
phase differences in response to single and repeated doses of smoked cocaine in humans.  They found 
significant sex differences on subjective ratings of cocaine effects, with women reporting lower ratings 
compared with men.  However, when the phase of the menstrual cycle was taken into consideration, a 
clearer pi[INVESTIGATOR_806868].  Women in the luteal phase reported diminished ratings of subjective effects of 
cocaine, compared with both women in the folli cular phase of the menstrual cycle and men.  The average 
plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations during the luteal phase were 156 pg/ml and 6.1 ng/ml, 
respectively.  For the follicular phase, the corresponding values were 61 pg/ml and 0.43 ng/ml, 
respectively.  These higher progesterone levels in luteal phase, compared to the follicular phase, suggest 
that progesterone may contribute to the diminished response to stimulants during the luteal phase.  
Similar menstrual phase effects were also re ported in response to amphetamines in healthy women 
(Justice and de Wit, 1999).  Women had diminished subjective response to oral amphetamines during the 
luteal phase, compared with the follicular phase.  Whether or not the luteal phase also attenuates the d rug 
use behavior has not been investigated.  These studies are relevant for nicotine considering the common 
neural substrate, the dopaminergic system, proposed to mediate the reinforcing effects of stimulants 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_806869]., 1997).

 [ADDRESS_1113844] the severity of tobacco withdrawal symptoms.  One study reported 
greater withdrawal symptoms in women who abstained from smoking during the late luteal phase than 
either women in the mid -cycle or men (Craig et al., 1992).  A number of other stud ies also reported 
increased intensity of tobacco withdrawal symptoms from abstinence during the late luteal phase (4 -5 
days before menses) (Allen et al., 2000; DeBon et al., 1995; O'Hara et al., 1989; Pomerleau et al., 1992; 
Sofuoglu et al., 2001), another  study showed increased withdrawal during the luteal phase (Perkins et al., 
2000).  Although other studies showed no menstrual cycle effects on tobacco withdrawal severity , (Allen et 
al., 1999; Pomerleau et al., 1994b)  menstrual cycle phase may also affect smoking behavior in women. 
Around menses and during the late luteal phase, increased smoking behavior was reported in some 
(DeBon et al., 1995; Mello et al., 1987; Pomerleau et al., 1992; Snively et al., 2000; Steinberg and 
Cherek, 1989) but not in other s tudies (Allen et al., 1996; Pomerleau et al., 1994b).  Altogether, these 
results suggest that menstrual phase may affect nicotine withdrawal symptoms and perhaps smoking 
behavior in female smokers.  The main limitation of these studies examining menstrual cy cle phase effects 
is the use of various and sometimes imprecise terms and methods to define the phases of the menstrual 
cycle which makes it difficult to compare the findings from these studies.  
 
The increased severity of tobacco withdrawal symptoms and t he smoking behavior in late luteal phase or 
menses, coincides with rapid decrease in plasma estradiol and progesterone levels suggesting hormonal 
influence on the severity of withdrawal symptoms and possibly on smoking behavior.  Unfortunately, little 
is kn own about the hormonal mechanisms that mediate the menstrual cycle phase effects on tobacco 
withdrawal symptoms or smoking behavior.  To determine the hormonal mechanisms of menstrual cycle 
effects, a reasonable approach is to administer sex hormones, estra diol and progesterone, to normally 
menstruating women and characterize the dose -related effects of these hormones on selected outcomes. 
The main difficulty with this approach is the interaction of exogenous sex hormones with endogenous 
estradiol and proges terone that  fluctuate during the menstrual cycle.  That is, estradiol or progesterone 
treatment given during the follicular or luteal phase is expected to have different effects because the 
endogenous levels of estradiol and progesterone highly vary in thes e phases.  This problem is in large 
part resolved by [CONTACT_806884].   
 
Early follicular phase to study the effects of sex hormones  
The early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is defined as the first 7 days after the onset of menses. 
While the endogenous estradiol levels are low and remain stable, below 85 pg/ml, during the early 
follicular phase, their levels start to increase,  up to 400 pg/ml, during the late follicular phase, 8 -13 days 
after the onset of menses.  The progesterone levels remain low throughout the follicular phase, below 1.1 
ng/ml (Speroff et al., 2007).  The low and stable levels of estradiol and progesterone in the early follicular 
phase minimize the interaction between the endogenous and exogenous sex hormones.  In addition, 
disruption of the menstrual cycle or withdrawal bleeding are unlikely to occur since the endogenous 
estradiol levels are minimal.  Several st udies have used early follicular phase to administer exogenous 
estradiol or progesterone to normally menstruating women.  In a series of studies, Tan et al. administered 
estradiol and progesterone for six days to women in the early follicular phase during t wo consecutive 
cycles (Tan et al., 1996; 1997b) and progesterone to healthy males (Tan et al., 1997a).  More recently 
Justice and deWitt (2000b) used a similar approach to examine the effects of estradiol patch treatment on 
amphetamine response during the e arly follicular phase of two consecutive menstrual cycles.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_30274], we examined the feasibility of administering progesterone treatment during the early follicular 
phase of the menstrual cycle to female smokers (Sofuoglu et al., 2001) and fema le cocaine users 
(Sofuoglu et al., 2002a).  These results suggest that the low and stable endogenous estradiol and 
progesterone levels during the early follicular phase provide a unique opportunity to administer 
exogenous sex hormones to normally menstruati ng women.

 4 1 Study  Objectives  
1.1 Overall Objectives  
The overarching goal of this study is to examine progesterone's effects on brain GABA concentrations 
and to determine whether these neurochemical changes are related to behavioral changes/experiences 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_806870] -term abstinence.  
1.2 Primary Outcome Variable(s)  
Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_806871].  GABA 
concentrati ons will be obtained using the non -invasive neuroimaging method of proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (1H -MRS) both before and after progesterone and placebo administration and 
smoking abstinence.  We will also admi nister an fMRI task called the N -back and measure BOLD signal  
and an fMRI task called the c ue task,  in addition to a resting state task where participants are asked to 
focus on a crosshair symbol. In total subject s will undergo 3 combined 1H-MRS  and fMRI  scans during 
each study phase over a period of approximately 1 month for  men and approximately 2 to 4 months for 
women.  
1.3 Secondary outcome variable(s)  
Withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Checklist (NWSC).  
Craving will be assessed using the Brief Questionn aire on Smoking Urges (BQSU) and mood will be 
assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS) , 
the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  The above secondary 
outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, on the day of scans, and at  each abstinence check -in 
with research staff.  The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_141965] (CES -D), adverse events 
form (AEF), Adverse Childhood Experi ences  (ACE) questionnaire, and Tiffany QSU will also be included 
as secondary outcome variables.  Premenstrual syndrome symptoms will be assessed daily throughout all 
study phases  using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).   
[ADDRESS_1113845] seeks to determine , during a 3-day period of abstinence, whether progesterone 200 mg/d 
administration for four days modulates cortical amino acid concentration as measured using proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H -MRS), reduces w ithdrawal symptoms and cigarette craving and 
alters smoking behavior in male and female smokers.  This study utilizes a double -blind, randomized 
placebo -controlled, cross -over design.  We will recruit [ADDRESS_1113846] the right to decline pre -
screening procedures and complete these procedures after full consent. Should the participant not  be 
qualified based on pre -screening procedures, the records will be destroyed  and they will be dismissed 
from the study visit . If the participants are eligible based on pre -screening procedures, full, written ICF will 
be reviewed and signed with the study  CRC.  After giving full written informed consent , subjects will 
undergo a structured psychiatric evaluation using the SCID -IV Non -Patient and several behavioral ratings  
and questionnaires concerning personal history . The Fagerstrom scale  and urine cotinine  level will be

 [ADDRESS_1113847] of Severity of 
Problems (DRSP) daily throughout all study test phases  and during washout  to assess presence of 
premenstrual symptoms . Women who have not had a menstrual cycle for [ADDRESS_1113848] 2 hours and subjects will smoke thei r cigarette brand of choice.  Subjects will 
smoke through a plastic cigarette holder fitted to the filter end of a cigarette connected to a smoking 
topography device (CreSS from Plowshare Technologies).  This device will ass ess the smoking 
topography (e.g., puff frequency, puff volume, puff duration, inter -puff interval, maximum flow rate , and 
inter-cigarette interval).  Upon completion of the smoking session, subjects will complete additional 
questionnaires. CO level will als o be assessed pre - and post - smoking session.  
 
In preparation for their first scan day, subjects are instructed to smoke as usual but to make sure that they 
have at least on e cigarette upon awakening and to have their last cigarette right before entering t he 
Stellar -Chance Laboratories where the Center for Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging ( CMROI ) is 
located.  This final cigarette will insure that subjects are not in nicotine withdrawal at their baseline scan. 
CO level will be assessed immediately follo wing the completion of the participant’s final cigarette. 
Subject s may be asked to abstain from consuming alcohol the evening before scan sessions at the 
principal investigator ’s discretion.   
 
Prior to undergoing scans  on Test Day 2 , subjects will complete behavioral questionnaires to assess 
mood, anxiety, nicotine craving , and withdrawal.  Subjects will also provide blood samples. They will then 
undergo a baseline 1H -MRS  and fMRI scan, which requires approximately 90 minutes.  They will be taken 
out of the scanner and asked to self-administer either the oral micronized progesterone (Prometrium) [ADDRESS_1113849] Day 2 . 
 
Prior to the participant’s first dose of study medication, a supplemental informed consent form pertaining 
to the study medication and placebo will be reviewed with the participant and signed by a physician listed 
on this study protocol.  
 
All subjects wil l be met by a member of the study staff twice on Test Days 3 and 4  (morning and 
afternoon) and once (morning) on Day 5 prior to the chronic treatment scan session to assess abstinence 
(expi[INVESTIGATOR_806872] 10 ppm  or a continually decreasing CO level  during days 3 -5 that is greater 
than 10 ) and to obtain behavioral measures.  At the morning visits on Test Days [ADDRESS_1113850] -

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_806867], CN 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_1113851]’s smoking session on Test Day 5.  
 
All subjects complete behavioral ratings to assess m ood, anxiety, nicotine craving and withdrawal as well 
as expi[INVESTIGATOR_806873].  
 
Upon completion of Test Day 5, a ll male subject s will then undergo a n approximately  one- to two -week 
wash -out and a ll menstruating female subjects will u ndergo a n approximately [ADDRESS_1113852] 
before continuing to the second paradigm.  
 
The primary investigator and research staff will unblind themselves to the drug treatment that was 
administered in each study phase upon each participant’s completion or discharge from the study. The 
research  staff will unblind the participant by [CONTACT_806885]. Research staff will also reach out to IDS to confirm the nature of each participant’s 
randomization schedule.  
 
NOTE: GABA data will not be obtained at the 3T MRI scanner  because proton magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy is not reliable on the [ADDRESS_1113853] 
coils suitable for brain studies and CAMRIS approved RF pulse sequence adapted from that Greutter's 
group at the University of  Minnesota (Terpstra et al., 2002).  Side-to-side head movements will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_806886]’s ears and the volume coil. GABA data will be 
acquired using the MEGAPRESS pulse sequence and from [ADDRESS_1113854] s will  be prescribed progesterone 200  mg capsules or a look alike placebo by [CONTACT_9154] 
(Epperson, M.D .) or another doctor listed on this protocol . Subjects will take 200 mg of progesterone or a 
placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_806874] 4 days.

 8 enroll a socioeconomically and racial/ethnically diverse group  such that the compositi on of the proposed 
study population will reflect the greater Philadelphia referral base.  The projected composition from 
Philadelphia is African American 42.58%, Hispanic 8.5%, Asian 4.42%, Other 2.04% and White, not of 
Hispanic Origin, 42.46%.  The size of our expected sample may allow us  to detect effects due to ethnicity 
or minority status.  
3.2 Accrual  
For our primary outcome variable --GABA concentration:  Based upon pi[INVESTIGATOR_806875] 800 mg admin istration on healthy human subjects, we anticipate that an 
acute dose of progesterone will alter GABA concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 15% on average.  We will 
conservatively estimate a 10% reduction in occipi[INVESTIGATOR_806876].  In order to detect a 10% 
change in GABA concentrations with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1113866] a 10 -15% drop out rate 
between study sessions.  This study’s inclusion/exclusion criterion  may also account for some drop -off 
after the initial screening visit. Thus, we will recruit [ADDRESS_1113867], many of the subjects waiting to participate in their 
treatment study could participate in our neuroimaging prior.

4 Analysis Plan  
4.1 Statistical Ana lysis 
The independent variables will be treatment and sex.  For treatment there will be 2 levels: progesterone 
(200 mg/d ay) or placebo.  Sex will have 2 levels: male and female.  
 
The primary dependent variables will be 1) GABA concentrations  (see note in Study Design) , 2) 
measures of smoking behavior: alveolar carbon monoxide, and smoking topography variables (number of 
cigarettes, puff number, puff volume, puff duration and inter -puff interval), and 3) tobacco withdrawal 
symptoms measured with nicotine withdrawal symptom checklist (NWSC).  
 
The secondary dependent variables will include progesterone and estradiol levels, Pro file of Mood States 
(POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS), Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Checklist 
(NWSC), Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (BQSU), State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS), Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_806877] (CES -D), Tiffany QSU, Daily 
Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP ), adverse events form (AEF), and Daily Record of Severity of 
Problems (DRSP).  
 
The analysis will include only data from subjects who complete the study, were compli ant with the study 
medication and abstinent from smoking.  Based on our previous experience with similar studies, the 
dropouts are expected to occur early in study participation.  For this reason we are not proposing detailed 
methods to handle missing data w hich are more appropriate for outpatient clinical trials. However, if we 
have a dropout rate over [ADDRESS_1113870] a sensitivity analysis (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 
2000) to examine the influence of missing data on our statistical model.   
 
The pr imary analysis of the data will be done with analysis of variance.  In this model, the main effect of 
treatment (progesterone versus placebo), sex (male vs. female) and the interaction between treatment 
and sex will be analyzed.  Standard F -tests from the an alysis of variance will be used to assess 
significance of treatment effects on GABA concentrations. Post hoc analyses will be conducted where 
significant differences are found, using Bonferroni adjustments and/or Dunnett multiple -comparison tests 
to preser ve the overall experiment wise error rate in the case of multiple testing.  Secondary dependent 
variables including progesterone and estradiol levels, POMS, PANAS/NWSC/BQSU, CES-D, Tiffany QSU, 
AEF, and DRSP, will be examined in an analogous fashion to the p rimary outcome variable.  
 
In addition, regression analysis will be conducted using plasma progesterone concentrations as a 
predictor of GABA concentrations, tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and craving.  Likewise, GABA 
concentrations will be used as a predictor  of tobacco withdrawal symptoms, nicotine craving, smoking 
topology, nicotine liking and mood.  
4.2 Rationale for sample size  
 
NOTE: As per updated funding requirements in [ADDRESS_1113871] 
increased recruitment numbers to 150 participants to account for a high number of incomplete and 
ineligible participants. The information below pertains to the origin al grant submission and original 
recruitment numbers.  
 
Sample size is estimated for the 3 primary outcome measures: GABA concentrations, tobacco withdrawal 
symptoms, nicotine craving, smoking topology and subjective effects of nicotine.

 10 GABA concentratio n: Based upon pi[INVESTIGATOR_806878] 
600 mg administration on healthy human subjects, we anticipate that an acute dose of progesterone will 
alter GABA concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 15% on average.  We will co nservatively estimate a 10% 
reduction in occipi[INVESTIGATOR_806876].  In order to detect a 10% change in GABA concentrations with 
a power of 80 % and an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1113872] a 10 -15% drop out rate between study sessions.  Thus, we 
will recruit 32 male and 32 female subjects for a total of 64 subjects  
 
Smoking behavior:  Power analysis for the study is based on progesterone effects on smoking self -
admin istration session, from Sofuoglu et al, 2001.  In that study, under placebo treatment, an average of 
3.[ADDRESS_1113873] indicates a 
power of 80 percent for 28 male and 28 female subjects.  
 
Subjective effects of smoking:  Similar to the smoking behavior, power analysis for subjective effects will 
be based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. One of t he Nicotine Effects Questionnaire items, Good Effects was used for 
power analysis.  Under placebo treatment the average rating following sample smoking was 65.9. The 
corresponding value was 51.[ADDRESS_1113874] indicates a power of 97 percent for 28 female and 28 male subjects.  
 
Tobacco Withdrawal Symptoms:  From our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], one of the tobacco withdrawal symptoms, Craving 
for cigarettes, was used for power analysis.  Under placebo treatment the average rating for this item was 
3.[ADDRESS_1113875] indicates a power close to 90 pe rcent for 
28 female and 28 male subjects.  
5 Safety and Adverse Events  
5.1 Potential Risks  
Risks of Progesterone : Progesterone administration can cause sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], nausea, fatigue, and 
headaches in men and women, and menstrual irregularity, spotting or breakthro ugh vaginal bleeding, and 
breast tenderness in women. Use of progesterone simultaneous to use of contraceptives is highly unlikely 
to lead to adverse health outcomes or interfere with contraceptive efficacy.  Other less common side 
effects include depressio n, blockage of blood vessels, and increased risk for heart attack or stroke. 
However, these side effects mostly occur after long -term use of progesterone and are unlikely to occur 
with 4 days of treatment. The effects of progesterone and nicotine combined are not known.  
 
Risks of 1H -MRS  Operating at 3T: To date no persistent adverse effects have been reported by [CONTACT_806889] 3.0T.  
 
Functional Imaging Tests : It is possible that staring at the projected screen during tasks could 
result in some eyestrain, mild headache, or nausea, however this unlikely. If subjects begin to feel 
uncomfortable while viewing the screen during tasks, they may look away and let the research 
staff know of their discomfort.  
 
Flying Object Clause:  The known risks associated with this study are minimal. The greatest risk 
is a metallic object flying through the air toward the magnet and hitting an employee or patient.  To 
reduce this risk we require that all people involved with the study remove all metal from their 
clothing and all metal objects from their pockets.  No metal objects are allowed to be brought into 
the magnet room at any time. In addition, once a patient is in the magnet , the door to the room 
will be closed so that no one inadvertently walks into the magnet.  
 
Experimental Device Clause: Some of the pulse sequences and/or RF coils are not FDA 
approved but are considered non -significant risk investigational devices.

 11 Pregn ancy Clause:  Although there are no known risks of MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, 
there is a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks.  Since there is no direct benefit 
from participating in this protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclu de pregnant women. 
Attestation of pregnancy suffices as evidence that the participant is not pregnant at the time of an 
MRI scan.  
 
Magnetic Field Risk Statement:  Because the magnetic field of the MRI scanner attracts metal, 
these studies will not be perfo rmed on anyone with a pacemaker or any non -removable metallic 
foreign objects in their body. The use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and  subdermal implants has 
not shown to present any risk when operating at a 3T MRI. (Zeiman and Kanal, 2007; Kaunitz. 
2012 ; Correia, 2012).  
 
Health Risk Statement:  There are no known health risks associated with exposure to magnetic 
fields during an MRI.  There are minimal risks from the loud noise associated with the MRI 
scanner and from the discomfort of lying on a hard sur face.  We shall provide subjects with 
protective earplugs as necessary and make every attempt to ensure their comfort during their 
time in the scanner.  The MRI performed under this protocol is not for medical purposes and the 
images are not planned to be in terpreted by a physician   
 
Clinician Administered Interview : Subjects will be administered the SCID -NP at the screening visit.  The 
risk associated with administering this type of interview is minimal; however, subjects  may find it upsetting 
to discover that they have a psychiatric diagnosis of which they were unaware.  As research staff 
associated with this study have training rega rding how to screen for the presence of psychiatric disorders, 
it is unlikely that a subject with a psychiatric diagnosis would not be identified during the initial phone 
screen and thus present for the in -office screen and SCID interview. If this were to occur however, the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_806879].  
 
Blood Drawing : Blood drawing may cause fainting, bruising, discomfort, or rarely, infe ction.  A total of one 
half of a cup of blood will be drawn over the course of the entire study.  There will be a total of 8 blood 
draws during the study:  four during Phase 1 and four during Phase 2. 
 
Smoking Abstinence : Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_806880] a nicotine wi thdrawal.  Nicotine is the main ingredient in 
cigarettes.  Nicotine withdrawal can cause changes in mood such as sadness, irritability, nervousness, 
and anxiety. During the smoking abstinence portion of the study, we will help him or her  by [CONTACT_806890].  This plan provides daily support during the contingency management Test 
Days of Phases [ADDRESS_1113876] after office hours, they will be instructed to please call 911 and ask for assistance.  
 
For Women of Childbearing Age : Since this research may have bad effects on a fetus and should not 
be done during pregnancy, it is necessary that a pregnancy test be do ne first.  In order for female subjects  
to participate in this study, they must report that to their knowledge they are not pregnant at the present 
time.  They will  also agree to avoid becoming pregnant (i.e., to use an acceptable method of  contraceptive 
such as condoms, and to take precautions against becoming pregnant) during the study.  We will do a 
pregnancy test during the screening visit and before subjects start Phase [ADDRESS_1113877] bad effects on a newborn , female subjects  agree not to breastfeed during the study 
participation.  
 
Genetic Testing : In the laboratory, genetics sample s will be labeled with a number only. Subject  name [CONTACT_806895]. This 
measure is taken to protect confidentiality,  in addition to the following specific measures:  
 
Investigator’s Protocol – Version 25 (August 1 , 2017)   
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_806867], CN 
 
 
 12 a) The genetic testing of all sample s will be used for  research purposes only. No results of 
genetic testing from this study will appear in any subject’s  medical record.  
b) Genetic test results will not  be made available to subjects , to their doctors, or to other 
clinicians or any other clinical staff.  
c) To pr otect confidentiality as much as possible, no computer records will be created that 
could be used to identify a subject’s  genetic or medical information individually. Thus, 
even if a “hacker” breaks into the laborato ry computer system, there will b e no inform ation 
stored there that can identify any individual subject.  
d) Information about your genes will only be stored in [CONTACT_252134]’s laboratory, using 
procedures described above to protect your confidentiality, unless the information has 
become completely stri pped of information that could identify an individual subject.  
  
In our experience at a pre vious academic institution, in which many hundreds of samples have been 
collected, no outside agency has ever tried to gain access to any research subject ’s genetic s samples. 
[CONTACT_252134]  believes that the risk of this happening to any sample  collected as part of this study  is 
extremely small.  
 
The goal of the genetics testing for this study is exploratory, not predictive: we seek to examine the 
interaction between g enetic makeup and nicotine addiction.  
5.[ADDRESS_1113878] benefits for subjects in this study.  Their participation may benefit individuals with 
nicotine addiction if these data indicate that progesterone has benefits on withdrawa l symptoms, cravings 
and smoking behavior.  
5.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
This study represents more than minimal risk to the subject as individuals will undergo neuroimaging and 
treatment with progesterone which they may not have otherwise taken. Should this study show that 
progesterone administration improves outcomes of interest and are correlated with changes in brain 
GABA and glutamate concentrations, we will have additional evidence that this hormone and 
neurotransmitter system may be targets for the  treatment of nicotine addiction.

Planned exposure (e.g. duration of study drug administration) : Healthy, smoking adults, (age range 
18-50 years)  without psychiatric or substance use history will be enrolled in this study to assess the 
impact of progesterone administration on  GABA in individuals with nicotine addiction using a 3T 
magn et. In addition, we will explore the impact of [ADDRESS_1113883] Days 2 -5.  
7.2 Overview of Previous Human Experience —Progesterone and Nicotine Effects  
Sofuoglu and colleagues (2001) previously studied the direct effects of oral progesterone treatment on 
smoking behavior in female smokers. In ea ch experimental session, following overnight abstinence from 
smoking, subjects received a single [ADDRESS_1113884] cigarette following abstinence is regarded to be highly rewarding and 
linked to relapse in smokers trying to quit (Kenford et al., 1994). The progesterone effect s on the 
subjective rewarding effects of smoking and craving for cigarettes suggested that this hormone may have 
significant effects on smoking behavior and tobacco withdrawal symptoms. More recently Sofuoglu et al. 
(in press) studied the effects of two do ses of progesterone 200 mg/d and 400 mg/d versus placebo on 
measures of attention (Stroop and Digit Symbol Substitution Test) and smoking urges in 35 female and 
34 male smokers. The 200 mg/d dose improved cognitive performance, while the 400 mg/d dose redu ced 
smoking urges. All subject tolerated both dosages without serious adverse events. There were no effects 
of progesterone administration on mood, and only modest effects on blood pressure and heart rate, 
reducing heart rate in males and diastolic blood p ressure in females.  
 
The same group conducted a similar preliminary study to examine the progesterone effects on smoked 
cocaine responses in which cocaine -dependent women, following progesterone or placebo treatment, 
received three deliveries of 0.4 mg/kg smoked cocaine, [ADDRESS_1113885] by [CONTACT_767785] (Sofuoglu et al., 2002a). Preclinical studies provide possible  mechanisms to 
explain these findings. Progesterone has wide -ranging effects in the brain including the activation of 
GABA type A receptors (Majewska, 1992). Progesterone also affects the dopaminergic system, a 
neurotransmitter system, which is implicated to be an important neural substrate for both the reinforcing 
effects of stimulants including cocaine and nicotine and withdrawal symptoms from stimulants (Watkins et 
al., 2000). Preclinical studies suggest that estradiol and progesterone may have opposing effects on the 
dopaminergic system. While estradiol has stimulatory effects on the dopaminergic system, progesterone 
may have inhibitory effects (Becker and Rudnick, 1999; Dluzen and Ramirez, 1987; Fernandez -Ruiz et 
al., 1990; Michanek and Meyerson, 1982; Morissette and Di Paolo, 1993). These preclinical studies 
suggest that progesterone may potentially modulate the actions of nicotine through its effects on the 
dopaminergic system.  
 
In light of these clinical findings, it is plausible that attenuation of t he rewarding effects of nicotine effects

cyclical increases in progesterone levels during the luteal phase may attenuate the effects of nicotine and

 15 may co ntribute to decreased sensitivity of women to the nicotine effects, compared to men. Whether 
these effects of progesterone administration on craving and smoking behavior are secondary to effects on 
dopamine or GABAergic function or both is not known. Precl inical data and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (not shown) 
suggests that progesterone has moderate to profound effects on GABAergic function. In some women 
oral progesterone administration decreased occipi[INVESTIGATOR_806882] 11% -40%. With the 
research paradi gm proposed in this protocol, we hope to further our understanding of how progesterone 
may modulate nicotine craving and smoking behavior by [CONTACT_19201] a central measure of the hormone's 
effect on brain GABA concentrations.  
 
Interestingly, there is a growi ng interest in the neuroprotective effects of progesterone administration for 
the treatment of traumatic brain injury in both men and women. In a randomized, placebo controlled trial, 
Wright and colleagues (2007) gave both males and females presenting with  acute brain injury a loading 
dose of progesterone 0.71 mg/kg intravenously followed by [CONTACT_3450] 0.5 mg/kg per hour for 11 
hours. For the following three days, subjects received progesterone 0.5 mg/kg per hour or placebo for 12 
hours each day. At this  rate, an average man of 170 pounds (77 kg), would have received a 54.[ADDRESS_1113886], 30 -day mortality rate was significantly less in those subjects randomized to 
progesterone compared to those randomized to placebo. This smaller study has led to a large NIH -
funded Phase III clinical trial of  progesterone administration for traumatic brain injury.

8.5 Environmental Analysis Requirements  
As progesterone  is a marketed medication, we believe an environmental analysis is not required.  
9 Pharmacology and Toxicology  
After oral administration of progesterone as a micronized soft -gelatin capsule formulation, maximum 
serum concentrations were attained within 3 hou rs. The absolute bioavailability of micronized 
progesterone is not known.  Table 1 summarizes the mean pharmacokinetic parameters in 
postmenopausal women after five oral daily doses of Prometrium Capsules 100 mg.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serum progesterone concentrations appeared linear and dose proportional following multiple dose 
administration of promethium capsules 100 mg over the dose range 100 mg/d to 300 mg/d.  The 
pharmacokinetic parameters in male volunteers were generally consistent with hose seen in 
postmenopausa l women.  Progesterone is approximately 96% to 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily 
to serum albumin and transcortin.  Progesterone is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_806892].  The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and 
pregnaolone are excreted in the bile and urine . Progesterone metabolites are eliminated mainly by [CONTACT_50833].

treatment groups were Prometrium Capsules at the dose of 200 mg/d for 12 days per 28 -day cycle in 
combination with conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/day (n=120); conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/day only 
(n=199); or placebo (n=119).  The subjects in all three treatment groups were primarily Caucasian women 
(87% or more of each group).  The results for the incidence of endometrial hyperoplasia in women 
receiving up to 3 years of treatment are shown below.  A comparison of the Prometrium Capsules plus 
conjugated estrogens treatment group to the conjugated estroge ns only group showed a significantly 
lower rate of hyperplasia (6% combination product versus 64% estrogen alone) in the Prometrium 
capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group throughout [ADDRESS_1113891] 90 days, administration of 10 days of Prometrium Capsules therapy 
resulted in 80% of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding with in [ADDRESS_1113892] dose of Prometrium 
Capsules, 300 mg/d (n=20), compared to 10% of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding in the placebo 
troup (n=21).  The rate of secretory transformation was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double -
blind clinica l study in estrogen -primed postmenopasusal women.  Prometrium Capsules administered 
orally for 10 days at 400 mg/d (n=22) induced complete secretory changes in the endometrium in 45% of 
women compared to 0% in the placebo group (n=23).  
10.2 Prior Clinical Resear ch Experience  
Sofuoglu and colleagues (2001) previously studied the direct effects of oral progesterone treatment on 
smoking behavior in female smokers.  In each experimental session, following overnight abstinence from 
smoking, subjects received a single [ADDRESS_1113893] cig arette following abstinence is regarded to be highly rewarding and 
linked to relapse in smokers trying to quit (Brandon et al., 1990; Kenford et al., 1994).  The progesterone 
effects on the subjective rewarding effects of smoking and craving for cigarettes suggested that this 
hormone may have significant effects on smoking behavior and tobacco withdrawal symptoms.  More 
recently Sofuoglu et al. (in press) studied the effects of two doses of progesterone 200 mg/d and 400 
mg/d ver sus placebo on measures of atte ntion (Stroop and Digit Symbol Substitution Test) and smoking 
urges in 35 female and 34 male smokers.  The 200 mg/d dose improved cognitive performance, while the 
400 mg/d dose reduces smoking urges. All subject tolerated both dosages without serious advers e 
events.  There were no effects of progesterone administration on mood, and only modest effects on blood

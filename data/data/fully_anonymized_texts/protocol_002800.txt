Hypothesis : we hypothesize  that cancer -associated Volatile Organic Compounds 
(VOCs ) will vary significantly following therapeutic intervention in patients with 
esophageal cancer (EC) and that variation will predict treatment response.  
 
Primary aim : to determine longitudinal variation in exhaled VOC concentrations  
during intended curative therapy for EC cancer.  
 
Secondary aims : 
i. To validate the previously published model for a exhaled VOC breath test of EC 
cancer  
ii. To correlate the exhaled VOCs of EC cancer patients to important clinical 
parameters  
iii. To determine the relationship between exhaled VOCs and response to 
neoadjuvant chemoradiother apy 
iv. To study changes in exhaled VOCs following tumor resection and their association 
with disease recurrence.  
v. To correlate the exhaled and urinary VOC concentrations in EC cancer p atients  
vi. To longitudinal variation in the upper gastrointestinal microbiome and its 
relationship to exhaled and urinary VOC concentrations.  
 
 
STUDY OUTCOMES  
 
Primary outcome  
i. Confirmation of exhaled and urinary VOC biomarkers of EC cancer  
 
Secondary outcomes  
i. Verification of changes in VOC concentrations that occur in response to 
therapeutic intervention

 BACKGROUN D AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Background : The global prevalence of esophag eal cancer ( EC) in 2016 was 2.75 million 
cases with an estimated 1.60 million new cases and 1.25 million deaths during the 
same year (1, 2) . Early EC cancer typi[INVESTIGATOR_430766] -specific symptoms that are 
commonly ascribed to benign conditions. Current guidelines recommend referral for 
endoscopy , only in the setting of ‘red flag’ symptoms that are frequently associated 
with inoperable disease. As a consequence , 7 out of 10 new cases of EC cancer 
diagnosed are consid ered to be at  an advanced stage with less that 1 in 3 patients 
eligible for potenti ally curative therapy and less than 1 in 5 patients alive at 5 years 
(3). 
 
Volatile organic compounds and EC cancer biomarkers :  
Our approach to this clinical challenge is to establish a non -invasive test for the 
detection of EC cancer that is base d upon the unique signature [CONTACT_430785] (VOCs)  within exhaled breath . 
 
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon -containing molecules that are 
sufficiently volatile to be detectable in a gas form at room temperature. VOCs may 
emanate from numerous sources within the human body as well as our local 
environment. Established uses of VOC measurements include the assessment of 
environmental contamination, the flavor and fragrance industr ies and in counter -
terrorism. There is now established evidence that VOCs which are released from the 
human body in breath and urine can be used as a non -invasive method of detection 
and monit oring (patho)physiological processes.  
 
The analysis of VOCs excreted within exhaled breath is a particularly attractive 
diagnostic prospective as it offers a potentially non -invasive window on to normal 
human physiology and diseases states within the body. Examples of the analysis of 
exhaled VOCs within clinical practice include breathalyzer devices for ethanol 
detection, 13C urea breath testing for H. pylori, exhaled Nitric Oxide in asthma and 
Hydrogen/Methane testing fo r small bowel bacteria overgrowth (4-7). There is now 
an appreciation that increased production of certain VOCs may be associated with 
cancer . In a recent literature review , we identified [ADDRESS_544874] cancer subtypes. Pooled analysis of these studies 
revealed a combined sensitivity and specificity of 79% (95% CI 77% -81%) and 89% 
(95% CI 88% -90%) respec tively for a ‘cancer breath test’.  This review included six 
publications concerning the VOC -based breath tests for the diagnosis of EC cancers (8-
13). VOC s released from the urine of E C cancer patients has also been shown to 
contain a unique profile, although no study has directly compared this to breath 
signatures (14). 
 
Our approach to addressing this clinical challenge is to establish a non -invasive breath 
test for early detection of EC cancer based on its unique profile of volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs). Our previous studies have reported higher concentrations of 
specific VOCs, including volatile fatty acids  (butanoic -, pentanoic - and hexanoic acid), 
within the breath, gastric conten t and urine of EC cancer patients (1 -4). We have also 
Version 2.0  IRB18 -101 
3/18 /2020   CRP190 15 
Page 4 of 19 
 established standardi zed and quality controlled protocols for breath sampling, 
transfer and storage that ensure accuracy and reproducibility of VOC analysis by [CONTACT_430770] (5 -9). 
 
Infrastructure for research  
Existing infrastructure at Virginia Mason Medical Center that will support the 
proposed study include: high volume center for the management of esophageal 
cancer; support from the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason including 
access to study coordinators , and; a track record for conducting high quality research 
in esophageal cancer.  
 
The proposed study will be conducted in collaboration with the volatile biomarker 
research group, based at St Mary’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (Imperial College London). The primary 
focus of this group ’s research has been the non -invasive diagnosis of gastrointestinal 
cancer through the detection of VOCs within exhaled breath. They have previously 
established diagnostic models of gastroesophageal and color ectal cancers (8, 9, 15, 
16). In a recent multicenter validation study they  demonstrated a diagnostic 
performance of a breath test for gastroesophageal cance rs based on five VOCs, with 
an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.85 and sensitivity and 
specificity of 80% and 81% respectively (15). Their  previous work has alluded to 
importance of volatile fatty acids, aldehydes and p henols as tumor  markers. In parallel 
to these clinical trials they  have sought to investigate the mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_430771] -vitro and in -vivo 
studies.  Specifically they have demonstrated an assoc iation between 
gastroesophageal  cancer, its predominant associated bacterial species (E.coli, K. 
pneumoniae and S.  anginosus) and VOCs production (unpublished data). Whilst these 
findings give support to the hypothesis that cancer has associated bacteria , no study 
has sought to directly compare the intestinal microbiome and exhaled VOC levels.  
 
Critical knowledge gap : Previous studies have established a n important link between 
deregulated  VOC production  and EC. These studies have all assessed exhaled VOCs at 
a single point in time using a  cross -section study design. Longitudinal variation in 
exhaled and urinary VOCs , the contribution of the upper gastrointestinal microbiome  
and the effect of  therapeutic intervention in EC cancer patients remain  unknown.  An 
understanding of this variation is critically important in establishing intra -subject 
variability  and likely mechanisms of VOC production and release . Furthermore the 
expected decline in target VOCs following chemoradiother apy and/or tumor resection 
would both v erify the link between the tumo r and aberrant VOCs production as well  
as offering an opportunity to utilize VOCs as a means to assess treatment response 
including the early detection of recurrence.

resection  for esophageal cancer  
vi. inability or unwillingness to provided written informed consent  
 
 
Study time points : subjects w ill be asked to provide exhaled breath , urine and saliva 
samples  at the  following time points during their routine care:  
i. Before commencing treatment for esophageal cancer*  
ii. Following conclusion of neoadjuvant therapy  (at the time of a routine outpatient 
appointment or on the day of surgery)  
iii. Following surgical resection ( after the removal of the nasogastric tube, during the 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] ) 
iv. At the time of routine postoperative follow -up at VM  (between six month s to one-
year following surgery)  
 
Subjects will also be asked to complete an engagement questionnaire at one of the 
study timepoints. See “Subject Engagement” section of the protocol.  
 
*Where feasible at the time of initial breath sampling  subjects will be  asked to provide 
breath samples  on two separate routine clinical appointments (often on consecutive 
days) in order to assess  short -term temporal variation  in exhaled VOC levels . At the 
Version 2.0  IRB18 -101 
3/18 /[ADDRESS_544875] rou tine clinical 
appointments on consecutive days.  
Any data that are not able to be collected with reasonable efforts will not be 
considered protocol deviations.  
 
Exhaled breath collection  and analysis : Subjects will be asked to fast for a minimum 
of 1-[ADDRESS_544876] of 4 hours or longer . Where 
possible sampling will be performed on a day when subjects are fasting as part of their 
routine care (e.g. prior to CT -PET or endoscopy). Before breath sampling, subjects w ill 
also be asked to rinse their mouth with water.  Following a period of relaxed tidal 
breathing s ubjects will be asked to exhale directly in to double thickness Nalophan ® 
bags (Scentroid, Canada ).  
 
Breath samples will be immediately (within 30-120 mins o f collection , target: 30 
minutes ) transferred from Nalophan sample bags to thermal desorption (TD) tubes 
(Markes International, Llantrisant, [LOCATION_006]) pre -packed with 200 mg of Tenax and 100 mg 
of Carbograph 5 . 500ml aliquots of breath will be transferred to fou r TD tubes  via a 
handheld precision pump ( Easy -VOC, Markes International, Llantrisant, [LOCATION_006] ). TD tubes 
will be securely capped and stored at -80oC prior to being transferred to Imperial 
College London for analysis.  
 
TD tubes containing exhaled VOCs will be analy zed by [CONTACT_430772] (GC -MS). For thermal desorption GC -MS analysis, adsorbent tubes will 
be loaded into a sample tray (TD -100, Markes International). The tube will be dry -
purged for [ADDRESS_544877] ionisation 
mode, scanning mass ions 20 -250 m/z. An initial solvent delay will minimi ze 
interference from water. Chromatographic data will be analy zed using the Ma ss 
Hunter package (Agilent Technologies) in combination with the NIST mass spectral 
library (2014, Maryland, [LOCATION_003]) for compound identification and semi -quantification.  
 
Urine sampling and analysis : Patients will be asked to provide a clean catch urine 
sample (approximately 10ml) into a sterile sample container. Urine samples will be 
aliquoted and stored at -80oC prior to being transferred on dry ice to Imperial College 
London for analysis.  
 
VOC s within the headspace  gas above  urine sample s sealed in air -tight vials  will be 
analy zed by [CONTACT_27199] -MS. Urine samples (2ml) will be diluted in 6m l deioni zed pure water, 
acidified using  HCl to pH  2.0. Urine osmolality (Osmo PRO ®, Advanced Instruments, 
Norwoor, [LOCATION_006] ) will be analy zed for the purpose of subsequent standardi zation. 
Samples will be placed in air tight headspace vials into which a HiSorb probe (Markes 
International, Llantrisant, [LOCATION_006]) will be inserted. Headspace vials including the  HiSorb 
probe will be heated and agitated at  60oC for 30 minutes. Heads pace VOCs ext racted 
Version 2.0  IRB18 -101 
3/18 /2020   CRP190 15 
Page 7 of 19 
 onto HiSorb probes will be analy zed u sing an Agilent 7890B GC with 5977 MSD (Agilent 
Technologies, Cheshire, [LOCATION_006]) cou pled to a Markes TD -100 device.  
 
Saliva sampling and analysis : Subjects will be asked to fast for a minimum of 1-2 hours 
(Target: 4 hours ) prior to saliva sampling. Where possible saliva sampling will be 
performed on a day when subjects are fasting as part of their routine care (e.g. prior 
to CT -PET or endoscopy). Saliva sample s (1-3ml) will be collected by [CONTACT_430773] a sample pot. Saliva samples w ill be aliquoted and stored at -80oC prior to 
being transferred on dry ice to Imperial College London for analysis.   
 
Bacterial RNA will be extracted from saliva samples and analyzed  by 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing to id entify the species composition.  Bacterial community types 
derived from tissues biopsies will be identified by [CONTACT_430774] 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial interaction networks will be constructed to 
identify any keystone speci es.  
 
Patient demographics and metadata : essential accompanying patient demographics 
and metadata will include: age; sex; comorbidities; height; weight; tumor histology 
and stage; details of (neo)adjuvant therapy; details of surgery; duration of pre -test 
fasting, and; radiological parameters (tumor dimensions, nodal burden and PET -
standardi zed uptake value). Where possible, data will be obtained via the IRB 
approved institutional database (IRB18 -076).  
 
Statistical analysis : Both univariate and multivariat e data analysis techniques will be 
applied to identify breath and urinary VOCs with the best discriminating ability and to 
develop a multivariate discriminant analysis model.  Appropriate univariate  statistical  
techniques will be used to compare intra - and inter - individual variability in exhaled 
VOCs in response to therapeutic intervention. Associations between predominant 
bacterial species and VOCs with be determined through a univariate and multivariate 
data analysis techniques.  
 
Using the data collected , several machine learning algorithms will be adapted, trained 
and evaluated for the purpose of diagnostic inference based on the breath sample 
chemical analysis. We will start with an exploratory analysis of t he VOC concentration 
data, including Principal Component Analysis  (PCA) and Multi -dimensional Scaling 
(MDS), to reduce the feature space and develop intuitions about the data. Next, 
Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) such as Support Vector Machines  (SVM) and k -
Nearest Neighbors  (kNN) will be trained and validated to reliably separate cancer from 
non-cancer cases. An Information Theory based MLA will also be developed. Cross -
validation algorithms such as k -fold training will be used to rigorously assess th e 
reliability of the learning algorithms. Models will then be compared through suitable 
accuracy scores and ROC curves will be produced to aid the selection of appropriate 
clinical diagnostic measure, which balances specificity against sensitivity.  
 
 
Sampl e storage  
Version 2.0  IRB18 -101

 Breath, urine and saliva samples will be stored in a -80oC freezer within the Benaroya 
Research Institute. Samples will be  deidentified and only  labeled using a unique study 
identifier composed of the patient’s study ID and the date the sample was collected.  
  
Data storage  
Virginia Mason Medical Center subject data will be stored in a pseudonymized form 
within Microsoft Excel . Data will be stored on a password protected institutional 
(Virginia Mason Medical) computer. Any p aper records , including patient consent 
forms,  will be stored in locked filing cabinet with in the department of Thoracic Surgery 
Virginia Mason Medical Cent er as well as in the Clinical Research Program offices at 
Benaroya Research Institute . Access to the data will be limited to the principal 
investigator , nominated members of the research team  and any regulatory or 
institutional compliance team member in case of review or audit only. Any data from 
samples shared with Imperial College London ([LOCATION_006]) will be in a linked anonymized form.  
 
Subject  engagement : Subjects who are recruited to this study w ill be asked to 
complete a short survey , ideally  at the first study time point  (but acceptable to be 
collected at any study time point),  designed to assess their understanding and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_430767].  
  
Version 2.0  IRB18 -101 
3/18 /[ADDRESS_544878] involvement and characteristics  
Human subjects will be enrolled into this study. The purpose of recruiting human 
subjects is to determine the influence of EC and neoadjuvant therapy on VOC 
biomarkers and the upper gastrointestinal microbiome. Recru itment of human 
subjects is critical to achieving the intended outcomes of this study.  
 
Patients with newly diagnosed esophageal and/or gastroeso phageal junctional 
adeno carcinoma will be recruited from Vi rginia Mason Medical Center (n=50 ). 
Patients will be  asked to donate an exhaled breath , urine and saliva  sample at four 
study time points. With the exception of a subject engagement questionnaire 
(completed at the time of the first study visit) all  other data that are utili zed as part of 
this study originates from patients’ routine clinical care a nd their electronic medical 
record .  
 
Patients who appear  to meet study eligibility may sign consent for this study during 
the diagnosis and staging phase of esophageal and/or gastroesophageal junctional 
adenocarcinoma. Initial samples will be collected for these subjects after consent is 
obtained . Upon completion of diagnosis and staging, it is possible that the subject may 
not be recommended for curative tri -modality treatment (surgical resection and 
chemor adiation therapy). Although these subjects are not the focal population for this 
study, their samples at the applicable study time  points are valuable for comparison 
purposes. As such, these subjects will continue to have samples captured at the 
protocol d efined study time  points  whenever possible, but any samples not collected 
(generally due to the subject not returning to VM within the appropriate timeframe) 
will not be considered a protocol deviation. These subjects will not count toward the 
goal of [ADDRESS_544879] groups (children, persons with mental 
disability, prisoners) where ability to give voluntary informed consent may  be 
questioned or com promised.

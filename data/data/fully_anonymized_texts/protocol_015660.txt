ABSTRACT  
 Intra-ocular retinoblastoma has been highly curable for many years using treatment modalities such as 
enucleation, external beam radiation therapy, chemotherapy and local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174601], cryotherapy, and laser photocoagulation. P atients with regional disease (orbit, optic nerve 
margin positivity, regional nodal disease) appear to be curable with conventional chemotherapy and 
external beam radiation therapy, but only limited data have been reported. Survivors of disseminated 
metastatic disease have only anecdotally been reported following treatment with conventional 
chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. Recently, however, several groups in Europe and North America have noted that intensification of treatment with high -dose chemotherapy and stem cell 
rescue has been associated with improved survival. This trial seek s to confirm that intensive multi-modality therapy including conventional chemotherapy, 
high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and external beam radiation th erapy is associated with a 
better survival rate for patients with metastatic retinoblastoma as compared to historical experiences with 
conventional chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy, and that conventional chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy are sufficient for patients with regional extra -ocular disease. 
Response to therapy and toxicity of the regimens will also be assessed.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
1.1 To estimate the proportion of 3 groups of patients with extra-ocular retinoblastoma  
 
• Stage 2 and 3: R egional extra -ocular disease 
• Stage 4a: Disseminated metastatic disease not involving the CNS  
• Stage 4b: Patients with CNS disease 
 
who achieve long-term event -free surviv al after aggressive multimodality therapy as prescribed in 
this protocol . 
 1.2 To estimate the response rate to the induction phase of the regimen.  
 1.3 To evaluate the toxicities associated with this regimen.  
  
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Intra-ocular retinoblastoma has been highly curable for many years using treatment modalities such as 
enucleation, external beam radiation therapy, plaque brachytherapy, cryotherapy, and laser 
photocoagulation, and more recently, chemotherapy, but patients with extra -ocular disease have had a 
much poorer prognosis. Recently significant improvements in survival have been reported for patients 
with extra -ocular disease. T his protocol will seek to confirm that the majority of patients with regional 
extra-ocular disease can  be successfully treated with conventional chemotherapy and external beam 
radiation therapy, and that patients with distant metastatic disease will benefit from the addition of high -
dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_203881]. Guillermo Chantada (Buenos Aires, Argentina) to recently develop an international staging system  proposal. Many of the members of that  working gro up are COG 
retinoblastoma committee members (Ira Dunkel, Eric Grabowski, Carlos Rodríguez -Galindo, Anna 
Meadows) or likely international collaborators on this study (Guillermo Chantada, Francois Doz, Celia Antoneli, Richard Grundy, Maja Beck Popovic, Bernhard Kremens) and we have decided to use the new 
staging system  in this study: 
 Stage [ADDRESS_203882] microscopic r esidual disease. Included in 
this stage are patients with involvement of the optic nerve to the transection line and those with microscopic trans- scleral invasion.  
Stage 3 includes patients with overt regional extension (orbital or lymph node involvement). 
Stage 4 includes patients with hematogenous metastases not involving the CNS (Stage 4a) and those with 
CNS disease ( Stage 4b). 
 Additional literature on details regarding the staging scheme is available.

2.3 Regional E xtra-Ocular Retinoblastoma (S tages 2 and 3) can be cured with conventional 
Therapy 
Patients with isolated orbital disease had fared poorly when treated with surgery +/ - radiation therapy .2 
Their prognosis improved considerably when conventional chemotherapy was added to the treatment 
regimen, with 1- year event -free survival of 40% reported following treatment with a variety of 
chemotherapy agents.3,4  
 
Recent publications confirm that patients with regional extra -ocular disease (orbital and/or pre -auricular 
disease, optic nerve margin positivity) may be cured with conventional chemotherapy and external beam 
radiation therapy. Investigators in Argentina treated 15 patients with orbital or pre -auricular nodal 
disease on 2 consecutive protocols. Protocol 87 chemotherapy included vincristine  (0.05 mg/kg) , 
doxorubicin (0.67 mg/kg/day x 3 days), and cyclophosphamide (20- 40 mg/kg). Protocol 94 chemotherapy 
included cycles of vincristine  (0.05 mg/kg) , idarubicin (10 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (65 mg/kg)  
followed by [CONTACT_174628] (18.7 mg/kg/day or 560 mg/m2/day x 2 days) and etoposide 
(3.3 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/m2/day x 3 days). The external beam radiation therapy dose was 4500 cGy, 
administered up to the chiasm for patients with orbital disease and to the involved nodes in patients with pre-auricular adenopathy. The group achieved a 5 -year event -free survival of 84% .
5 The Argentine and 
[LOCATION_001] groups also reported the results of 12 patients with optic nerve margin positivity treated with the chemotherapy regimen s above and orbital radiation therapy (4000 to 4500 cGy). All 12 were event -
free survivors .
6  
 Similarly, investigators in Brazil reported the results of 2 consecutive protocols. From 1987 to 1991, 
chemotherapy included cycles of vincristine  (0.05 mg/kg) , doxorubicin (2 mg/kg) and  cyclophosphamide 
(30 mg/kg) alternating with cycles of cisplatin (90 mg/m
2) and teniposide (100 mg/m2). From 1992 to 
2000, chemotherapy included cycles of ifosfamide (1800 mg/m2/day x 5 days) and etoposide 
(100 mg/m2/day x 5 days) alternating with cycles of  cisplatin (90 mg/m2) and teniposide (100 mg/m2). 
The external beam radiation therapy dose was 40 00 to 5000 cGy to the orbit. Triple intrathecal therapy 
was also administered.  Their therapy was successfu l in 20 of 32 patients (63%) with orbital disease and 
22 of 29 (76%) with optic nerve margin positivity.[ADDRESS_203883] that patients with regional extra-ocular retinoblastoma can be cured with an appropriately intensive treatment that includes systemic chemotherapy and external beam  radiation 
therapy.  
Alternative Induction regimen for patients with significant ototoxicity or expected visual 
impairment : to avoid ototoxicity in patients with pre -existing ototoxicity or expected visual impairment, 
carboplatin will be used instead of cisplatin as the induction therapy. Carboplatin has been the single 
most commonly prescribed chemotherapy medication for retinoblastoma for about the past 15 years and has been successfully used in combination therapy.

2.4 Patients with Metastatic Disease (Stage 4) Have a Poor Prognosis When Treated with 
Conventional Therapy  
 
Older publications from s everal centers reported the results of trials utilizing conventional dose 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy for metastatic extra- ocular disease, most using vincristine, 
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_174602]-term event -
free survival ,10,11 the bulk of the evidence suggested that the prognosis remai ned grim with such an 
approach.12-14  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 10 
Recent publications confirm the dismal prognosis. The Argentine investigators (using the regimens 
discussed above) noted that all 26 patients with distant metastases died.5 Similarly, the Brazilian 
investigators  noted that treatment with their regimens (disc ussed above) led to survival of only 1 of 14 
patients (7%) with distant metastases.7  
 
While trilateral retinoblastoma ( bilateral retinoblastoma plus an intracranial third tumor focus, usually 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_174603] ) does not represent CNS metastatic disease, its prognosis has been comparably poor. 
Kivela’s meta-analysis noted that only 5 of 89 patients (6%) with reasonable follow -up were event -free 
survivors, at 10, 30, 108, 132, and 168 months.15  
 
 
2.5 Rationale for the Use of High -Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue for Patients with 
Metastatic Disease Not Involving the CNS (Stage 4a) 
 
Case reports had suggested that the use of high- dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue 
(ASCR) might be beneficial for patients with metastatic retinoblastoma ,16,17 and subsequently, Institut 
Curie investigators reported the results of 25 patients with high- risk retinoblastoma treated with high -
dose carboplatin, etoposide and cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_174629] .8 Five of eight patients with 
metastases not involving the CNS  were event -free survivors 11 to 70 months after high-dose 
chemotherapy. Three had central nervous system relapses and died of disease 10 to 20 months after high -
dose chemotherapy. Three other  patients had disease that progressed du ring induction with conventional 
induction chemotherapy and never received high -dose chemotherapy. In total, then, 5 of 11 patients 
(45%) with metastatic disease not initially involving the central nervous system  were event -free 
survivors.  
 
Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) investigators reported the results of 4 patients with 
metastatic retinoblastoma not involving the CNS. All had bone marrow metastases +/- bone, liver, and 
orbit disease and were treated with a high -dose carboplatin, thiotepa and  etoposide with ASCR 
regimen.18 All responded to a vincristine, platinum agent, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (plus 
doxorubicin in 1 case) induction regimen similar to that being proposed in this study. All 4 patients were 
event-free survivors from 46 to 80 months following diagnosis of metastatic disease. Updated data from 
[LOCATION_001] presented at SIOP in September 2004 reveal that 7 of 10 patients with metastatic 
retinoblastoma not involving the CNS are event -free survivors at a median of 84  months.19 Two relapsed 
in the CNS at 7 and 10 months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease (prior to high -dose 
chemotherapy). These 2 failures were associated with treatment delays due to fungal infection (n=1) and 
insurance denial (n=1) and the patients later died of progressive tumor. One patient relapsed in the CNS 
[ADDRESS_203884]. Jude investigators reported 4 patients treated with intensive therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, but their regimen s (carboplatin- etoposide, busulfan-
cyclophosphamide- melphalan, cyclophosphamide -etoposide, cyclophosphamide -topotecan) did not 
include thiotepa .
21 Radiation therapy was used for bone metastases. Two of the 4 patients were long- term 
survivors.  
 CHLA investigators included 2 patients with metastatic disease not involving the CNS in their report regarding patient s with extra -ocular disease.
22 One patient with orbit, bone and bone marrow disease 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/[ADDRESS_203885] recently, a Japanese report included 3 patients with bone and/or bone marrow disease treated with intensive therapy, including high- dose melphalan -based chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.
[ADDRESS_203886] that ad dition of high- dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is 
associated with improved survival for patients with metastatic retinoblastoma not involving the CNS. The inclusion of thiotepa in the regimen may be associated with a lower risk of CNS  recurrence (the most 
likely site of failure) due to the excellent CNS penetration of that agent. 
 
2.6 Rationale for the Use of High -Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue for Patients with 
Metastatic Disease Involving the CNS (Stage 4b) or Trilateral Disease 
 
Fewer data are available regarding the prognosis of patients with retinoblastoma involving the central 
nervous system disease treated with high -dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue. The SFOP experience 
included 4 patients with CNS metastases who received high -dose carboplatin, etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide with stem cell rescue. Three died of CNS disease, and one was free of disease at 63 
months.8  
 
The CHLA report included 4 patients with CNS disease and 3 with trilateral disease.22 The only survivor 
(trilateral retinoblastoma) was also the only one that had received high -dose chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide, etoposide and thiotepa) with stem cell rescue. I t is unclear whether any of the others 
had been treated with the intention to include high- dose chemotherapy in the regimen even though none 
ultimately received such therapy.  
 The Japanese report included 2 patients with CNS disease.
23 Both died of disease. 
 Unpublished data from MSKCC reveals that 1 of 2 patients with trilateral retinoblastoma treated with 
high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue is an event -free survivor at 29 months. 
 This paucity of data led us to perform a multi -center retrospective study. We asked large centers to 
contribute patients with retinoblastoma involving the central nervous system whose therapy was intended to include high- dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, regardless of whether it was ultimately 
administered. The following unpublished data were accepted for presentation at the International Retinoblastoma Symposium in Whistler, BC in September 2005.  Fourteen patients with trilateral (n=9) 
or CNS metastatic (n=5) retinoblastoma were treated. Trilateral sites were pi[INVESTIGATOR_25337] (n=7) and suprasellar 
(n=2); 5 had localized disease and 4 had leptomeningeal dissemination . All 5 CNS metastatic 
retinoblastoma patients had leptomeningeal dissemination . Eight patients had CNS retinoblastoma at 
original diagnosis; 6 had later onset (3 to 42 months). Induction chemotherapy generally included vincristine, cisplatin or carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. H igh-dose chemotherapy  
regimens were thiotepa- based (n=4), carboplatin, etoposide & cyclophosphamide (n=3), or melphalan & 
cyclophosphamide (n=2). Two patients died of toxicity (septicemia & multi -organ system failure) during 
induction and 3 had dis ease progression prior to high- dose chemotherapy . Nine patients received high-
dose chemotherapy at a median of 5 months (range 4 to 9) post -diagnosis of CNS disease. Five of 9 
trilateral patients survive event -free at 17, 34, 39, 59, & 67 months without radiation therapy. Two of 5 
CNS metastatic patients survive event -free at 7 & 54 months; 1 received orbital RT. This experience 
indicates that intensive chemotherapy is effective for some patients with CNS retinoblastoma.

Version Date: 02/14/[ADDRESS_203887] be assigned a COG patient ID number. This number is 
obtained via the eRDE system once authorization for the release of protected health information (PHI) 
has been obtained. The COG patient ID number is used to identify the patient in all future interactions with COG. If you have problems with the registration, please refer to the online help.   In order for an institution to maintain COG membership requirements, every newly diagnosed patient needs to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The 
Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) . 
 A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process. Each patient will 
be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID. For additional information about the labeling of specimens please refer to the Pathology and/or Biology Guidelines in this protocol.   
3.1.2 IRB Approval  
Local IRB/REB approval of this study must be obtained by a site prior to enrolling patients. Sites must submit IRB/REB approvals to the NCI’s Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) Regulatory Office and allow [ADDRESS_203888] include a fax coversheet (or optional CTSU 
IRB Transmittal Sheet) and the IRB approval document(s). The CTSU IRB Certification Form may be submitted in lieu of the signed IRB approval letter. All CTSU forms can be located on the CTSU web page (
https://www.ctsu.org ). Any other regulatory documents needed for access to the study enrollment 
screens will be listed for the study on the CTSU Member’s Website under the RSS Tab.  
 IRB/REB approval documents may be faxed ([PHONE_3769]),  emailed ([EMAIL_537]) or mailed to the CTSU Regulatory office.   When a site has a pending patient enrollment within the next 24 hours, this is considered a “Time of Need” registration.

 Stage 2 or 3: Patients with orbital disease (including microscopic trans-scleral invasion seen on 
enucleation pathology), optic nerve margin (+), and/or regional nodal disease, but no other sites of metastases.  
 Stage 4a: Patients with overt distant metastatic disease (such as bone, bone marrow, and/or liver) but no detectable CNS involvement.  
 Stage 4b: Patients with overt CNS involvement (brain parenchyma, leptomeninges and CSF cytology). Patients with trilateral retinoblastoma will be included. Patients with extradural/dural disease, but without parenchymal or leptomeningeal disease should not be included and will be considered to be Stage 4a patients. 
 4.[ADDRESS_203891] of 3 reporting periods; Induction, Consolidation with Stem Cell Rescue and External Beam Radiation Therapy.  
 
Stage 2 and 3 patients will receive Induction chemotherapy and External Beam Radiation Therapy, but will not
 receive Consolidation therapy (High- Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue). 
 Stage 4a and 4b patients will receive Induction chemotherapy, Stem C ell Harvesting, Consolidation with 
Stem Cell Rescue, and depending on response to Induction chemotherapy, possibly External Beam Radiation Therapy.  4.1.1 Induction consists of 4 cycles of chemotherapy; each cycle will be [ADDRESS_203892] Induction or Alternative  Induction (for patients who have significant ototoxicity or pre-
existing hearing and/or visual impairment). Consolidation therapy includes high dose chemotherapy with 
stem cell rescue using peripheral blood stem cel ls harvested during induction; C onsolidation lasts 4 to 6 
weeks. External Beam Radiation Therapy for Stage 2 and Stage 3 patients will begin after Cycle 4 of 
Induction chemotherapy. For Stage 4 patients who will receive External Beam Radiation Therapy, this will be after autologous stem cell infusion.  
 
4.1.2 Concomitant Medications Restrictions  
 Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for 
valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

Strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 are known to alter vincristine metabolism, leading to increased vincristine neurotoxicity.  Strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, including azole antifungals (such as 
fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole) should all be avoided or used with great caution. 
Additional inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 enzymes can be found at  
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis . 
 [IP_ADDRESS] PCP prophylaxis must be prescribed during induction chemotherapy and following consolidation. Co-trimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) should be the first consideration, but if that is not tolerated, pentamidine, dapsone, or other established PCP prophylactic regimens may be used. See the COG 
supportive care Guidelines at: 
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/prot/reference_materials.asp ) 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Due to the si gnificant risk of ototoxicity associated with the cisplatin and high -dose carboplatin used in 
this protocol, aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided if possible, or used with careful monitoring. While individual institutional practices regarding empir ic antibiotic therapy for fever and neutropenia 
may be followed, it may be worth considering that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_174604].  [IP_ADDRESS]

[IP_ADDRESS] No other cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunomodulating agents will be used other than the regimen prescribed by [CONTACT_760]. Corticosteroid therapy may be used for treatment of increased intracranial pressure in patients with CNS tumors. Due to theoretical concerns that dexamethasone may stabilize the blood -brain-barrier and decrease chemotherapy delivery to the central nervous system, 
dexamethasone should only be used with caution as an anti- emetic and the dose adjusted if used with

4.2.3 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting (During Induction).  
Peripheral blood stem cells will be the preferred source of hematopoietic stem cells on this protocol, but 
should the institutional clinicians deem bone marrow harvesting preferable, bone marrow may be used as a 
permissible alternative stem cell source. In  such case, bone marrow harvesting should be performed 
according to institutional guidelines.  
 If the bone marrow was not involved at baseline, the harvest may be performed after any cycle of induction chemotherapy. However, many of the patients on this st udy will have bone marrow metastases at diagnosis 
and so appropriate timing of the stem cell harvest is important. The MSKCC experience suggests that administration of [ADDRESS_203894] is achieved. The following are suggested guidelines only.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Catheter Placement  
Patients will need a double lumen apheresis catheter for the peripheral blood stem cell collection . If the 
patient has a mediport for use during the induction chemotherapy  period, it will likely not be sufficient 
for the harvest and placement of a temporary femoral vein apheresis catheter for the harvest is recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Protocol for Peripheral Stem Cell Mobilization  
When the ANC is > 1000/ µL post nadir, plan harvest approximately [ADDRESS_203895] is complete and an adequate yield is documented . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] .Procedure for Peripheral Stem Cell Collections  
The goal of apheresis will be to collect 2 aliquots of (2.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ) per aliquot. If less than a 
single aliquot of 2.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg can be obtained the patient will not be allowed to proceed to 
consolidation and will be off protocol therapy  (for Stage 4a and 4b patients). It is recommended that at 
least 3 blood volumes be processed per day.

4.3 Radiation Therapy  Guidelines  
Radiation therapy for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved COG RT facilities 
(see Administrative Policy 3.9).   
[IP_ADDRESS] General Guidelines  
The radiation therapy guidelines for this study were developed specifically for patients with newly 
diagnosed extraocular retinoblastoma. The guidelines are meant to cover a broad range of indications and the use of a variety of treatment modalities. Because this study includes patients with metastatic disease who will be treated with curative inte nt, body site specific treatment recommendations have been 
included which parallel guidelines used in other COG solid tumor protocols.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Required Benchmark and Questionnaires  
All therapy units used on this protocol must have their calibrations verified by [CONTACT_174630] (RPC). RT using photons (either 3- D conformal [3- D CRT] or intensity modulated [IMRT]), 
electrons and protons, will be allowed in this study. Centers participating in this protocol using 3- D CRT 
are required to complete the 3 -D benchmark; those using IMRT must complete the IMRT questionnaire 
and benchmark or irradiate the RPC head and neck phantom and those using protons must complete the 
proton benchmark and questionnaire. Benchmark materials and questionnaires may be obtained from the 
Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC, 
www.qarc.org ) and must be submitted before patients on this 
protocol can be evaluated. For inform ation regarding the IMRT phantoms, please contact [CONTACT_174631] 
(http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT  
Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the gui delines developed for the use of IMRT 
in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are available through 
www.qarc.org . These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their require ments and methods 
for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; target and organ motion management; nomenclature, definitions and rationale for targets and organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal tissue dose constraints; effects of heterogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of Proton Beam Therapy  
Investigators using proton beam therapy will be required to comply with the guidelines for the use of protons in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials developed. These guidelines shall be available through 
www.qarc.org .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of Brachytherapy or Intraoperative Radiation Therapy  
Brachytherapy, using either high dose rate or low dose rate radioactive sources may be used on this protocol. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], brachytherapy or intraoperative radiation therapy will be used for conformal RT of residual disease in the operative bed of the primary tumor for select patients.  
 
4.3.1 Indications for Radiation Therapy  
Stage 2 and 3 patients (orbital and/or regional involvement) will receive radiation therapy (RT) to sites 
that were initially involved. Stage 4a and 4b patients will receive RT to sites initially involved based on 
response. Stage 4a patients (hematogenous metastases not involving the CNS)  who achieve a complete 
response to induction chemotherapy or with less than 5 mm of residual tumor at the time of planned 
irradiation, will not receive RT. RT will be omitted for stage 4b patients (CNS involvement) who achieve 
a complete response to induction chemotherapy.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 33 
4.3.2 Timing 
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients should be seen in consultation by a radiation oncologist at the time of study 
enrollment. The purpose of the consultation is to participate in staging and to review the adequacy of the 
initial diagnostic imaging studies that will be u sed for subsequent RT planning. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] For Stage 2 and 3 patients, RT should begin within 42 days after the start of cycle 4 of induction 
chemotherapy. For Stage 4a and 4b patients who will receive radiation therapy, treatment  should start on 
approximately day +[ADDRESS_203896]-autologous stem cell infusion
. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Multiple metastatic sites  
Some patients will have multiple metastatic sites that require irradiation. When the number of lesions exceeds 3, the radiation oncologist must prioritize metastatic sites for treatment and may consider obviating or delaying treatment of certain sites. Factors to consider when choosing metastatic sites for irradiation when all cannot feasibly or safely be treated include: (1) sub -optimal response to 
chemotherapy, (2) sites which will be problematic in the event of disease progression, and (3) sites that can be imaged with sufficient accuracy for treatment.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_203897] compression, loss 
of vision or other function- threatening conditions. The decision to irradiate emergently should be made 
by [CONTACT_172276].  The entire course of treatment does not need to be administered from the 
outset. Often symptoms may be alleviated after a few treatments. The treatment may then be discontinued and the doses and volumes appropriately incorporated into the definitive treatment.

** For tumors adjacent or included in lung tissue, photon beam energy should be <  10 MV. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment planning  
CT (volumetric) based planning is required to optimize dose to the PTV while protecting normal tissues. Organs within the irradiated volume  should be contoured including those required by [CONTACT_174632] 
(Section 4.3.9). A DVH is necessary to determine target coverage and evaluate dose to normal tissues. In the event that a patient must start emergently with a non -volumetric treatment plan, a volumetric plan 
will be accomplished as soon as is reasonably possible and the previously utilized beams must be incorporated into the composite plan. CT section thickness should be <
 5mm although 2- 3mm is 
preferred.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In-room verification of spatial positioning

Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 34 
Orthogonal paired (AP and lateral) por tal images (MV or kV) are required for IMRT and [ADDRESS_203899] alignment relative to the patient position.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_203900] alignment in relationship to the patients’ position. For CT tomography where isocenters are not 
used, a printout of the isodoses overlaid on the fused CT images can be printed to demonstrate in room verification.  
 
4.3.5 Target Volumes  
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard tumor and target volume definitions  
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62 and 78 (
www.icru.org ) define prescription methods and nomenclature that will be utilized for this study. 
Treatment planning will be based on the following definitions and applies only to the primary tumor site:  
Photons 
• Gross tumor volume (GTV)  is the volume occupi[INVESTIGATOR_174608].  
 
• Clinical target volume (CTV)  includes the GTV and sites with potential occult tumor 
involvement including lymph nodes adjacent to the GTV that may be clinically involved.  
 
• Planning target volume (PTV ) is the CTV surrounded by a geometric margin to account for 
variability in set-up, breathing or motion during treatment. 
 Protons 
• GTV is the same for protons and photons. 
 
• CTV is the same for protons and photons. 
 
• PTV is not the same as photons due to differences in beam penetration with movement and set up 
uncertainty. PTV varies with each individual field and coverage and will require additional 
adjustment to (1) the lat eral margins, (2) smearing of compensator, (3) range of beam (depth of 
penetration) and, (4) modulation (number of required Bragg peaks). Adjustments to any of the aforementioned parameters (usually 2 -7 mm) will be based on the set up error determined for the 
particular body site at the individual proton institution. Motion of the target volume in three dimensions (cranial, caudal, anterior to posterior, and lateral) may be determined by 4-dimensional CT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_174609], or other accepted techniques. 
 
Brachytherapy  
• GTV is the same as for photons.  
 
• CTV is the same as for photons. 
 
• PTV is equal to  CTV. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol tumor and target volume definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  GTV GTV is defined as the visible and/or palpable disease defined by [CONTACT_5292], computed 
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET scan) prior to any surgical debulking or chemotherapy. It also includes enlarged but unresected, regional lymph

Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 35 
nodes. For patients who undergo initial surgery, operative notes and pathology reports may be helpful. 
For patients with initial tumors that extend into body cavities (i.e., thorax, abdomen) the GTV may require modification. If the tumor has been resected or responded to chemotherapy and the normal tissues have returned to their normal positions, the GTV excludes the volume which extends into the cavity. Examples include tumors which compress but not invade the brain, lung, intestine or bladder that radiographically return to normal anatomic  position following surgery or chemotherapy. The GTV must 
include all infiltrative disease detected at initial presentation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  CTV 
If there are no sites that warrant irradiation for potential occult tumor, then the CTV is defined as the 
GTV plus 0.5cm (but not extending outside of the patient). It also includes regional lymph node chains for clinically or pathologically involved nodes. For tumors with no evidence of nodal involvement (N
0), 
the draining regional lymph nodes are not irradiated. For some sites, the definition of CTV is modified to account for specific anatomic barriers to tumor spread (see Section 4. 3.5.4). When lymph nodes are 
clinically or pathologically involved with tumor, the entire lymph node drainage chain should be included in the CTV.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_203901] to be uniform in all dimensions. For proton planning, beam specific PTV expansions will be required. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Site-specific modifications  
Extremity Sites The CTV should be modified at the discretion of the radiation oncologist to avoid circumferential irradiation of extremity lymphatics and treatment across a joint.  
 Head and Neck Sites Many of these tumors may be considered unresectable due to close proximity to critical structures and surgical risks contribu ting to functional or cosmetic deficits. Every attempt should be made to minimize 
dose to the brain, cochlea, optic chiasm and orbit including eye, lid, lacrimal gland, and optic nerve.  Orbital Sites  
For orbit primaries, the CTV will not extend outside of  the bony orbit, providing there is no bone erosion 
of the orbit.  Chest Wall/Intrathoracic Sites  
Tumors which have displaced a significant amount of lung parenchyma then returned to normal anatomic position following surgery or chemotherapy will have the GTV defined as the preoperative 
(prechemotherapy) tumor volume excluding the component of intrathoracic tumor which was removed by [CONTACT_174633]. All areas of pleural involvement will be included in the GTV regardless of whet her the radiation is delivered pre or postoperatively. 
 Intra-abdominal/Retroperitoneal/Pelvic Sites 
Tumors which have displaced a significant amount of bowel then returned to normal anatomic position following surgery or chemotherapy will have the GTV def ined as the preoperative (prechemotherapy) 
tumor volume excluding the component of intra -abdominal or intra- pelvic tumor which was removed by 
[CONTACT_174633]. All areas of peritoneal or mesenteric involvement will be 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/[ADDRESS_203902]-operatively. In the event 
that whole abdomen radiotherapy is required ( i.e., for malignant ascites or diffuse peritoneal 
involvement), the dose will be 2400cGy at 150cGy per fraction with appropriate blocking of the kidneys 
and liver to keep them within normal tissue recommendations (see Section 4. 3.8). 
 
Lymph Nodes  
For tumors with no evidence of nodal involvement (N 0), the draining regional lymph nodes should not be 
irradiated. When ly mph nodes are clinically or pathologically involved with tumor, the entire lymph node 
drainage chain should be included in the CTV. 
 
Pulmonary Metastases Patients with single or multiple pulmonary metastases will receive bilateral whole lung irradiation to  
1500cGy in 150cGy fractions. Patients 6 years of age and younger will receive 1200cGy at 150cGy per fraction. Gross disease may be boosted with a small targeted field to 4500cGy if the normal tissue recommendations can be followed.  For patients with a single malignant pleural effusion, only the involved hemithorax will be irradiated to 1500cGy (1200cGy in patients 6 years and younger). Dose to the thoracic metastases when given concurrently with whole lung irradiation will be given at 150cGy per fraction. After the whole lung portion is completed, the primary tumor site cumulative dose should be 
brought to the intended dose using 180cGy per day fractionation.  Metastatic Sites - General  
Radiation is recommended to all metastatic sites when feasible. Feasib ility diminishes as the number of 
metastatic sites increases and will be determined by [CONTACT_174634]. Radiation is recommended to those metastatic sites not irradiated when directed if there remains a concern about disease control at th at site and the patient can tolerate further radiotherapy without undue morbidity. Re -
evaluation imaging will help the radiation oncologist determine if the various remaining sites are in need of further treatment and will consider the following: (1) sub-optimal response to chemotherapy by [CONTACT_174635], (2) sites which will be problematic in the event of disease progression ( i.e., 
tumor in a weight bearing bone), and (3) sites that can be imaged with sufficient accuracy for treatment, and (4) expected tolerance and morbidity (i.e., bone marrow tolerance). The GTV for metastatic sites is the area of residual tumor defined on CT, PET, and/or MRI (postchemotherapy/surgery). In cases where there is a discrepancy in volume between the scans, the larger volume will be irradiated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Targeting of metastases  
The GTV for metastatic sites is the area of residual tumor defined on CT or MRI (post-chemotherapy/surgery). In cases where there is a discrepancy in volume between the scans, the larger volume will be irradiated. A CTV is not required for the treatment of metastatic lesions. The appropriate 
PTV should be the GTV with a geometric margin of 1cm.   
4.3.[ADDRESS_203903] radiotherapy plans are not permitted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Definition   
Photon dose is to be specified in centigray (cGy) -to-muscle. For proton beam, the absorbed dose is specified 
in CGE, which is the same as ICRU [ADDRESS_203904] to water .

volume; CSI = craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_174610]; Age = age in months at the start of radiation therapy ; CTV1 and PTV1 are the 
clinical and planning target volumes for craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25360]; x = denotes more than one CNS site that 
requires irradiation and the nomenclature of GTV2a, CTV2a, PTV2a, GTV2b, CTV2b, PTV2 is preferred with appropriate documentation for each target volume. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose uniformity  
At least 95% of the protocol -specified dose should encompass 100% of the PTV1/PTV2 and no more 
than 10% of PTV1 (PTV2 for patients with a volume reduction) should receive greater than 110% of the 
protocol dose as evaluated by [CONTACT_25400]. The 100% isodose should be equal to the prescribed dose. Wedges, compensators and other methods of generating more uniform dose distributions are encouraged.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tissue heterogeneity  
Calculations must take into account tissue heterogeneity and should be performed with CT -based 
treatment planning to generate dose distributions and treatment calculations from CT densities. When 
IMRT is used in lung, the heterogeneity correction algorithm must be approved by [CONTACT_174636]. For questions 
about heterogeneity corrections or approved algorithms, please contact [CONTACT_174636] ( www.QARC.org ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Environment of care - Interruptions, delays and dose modifications  
There will be no planned rests or breaks from treatment, and once radiation therapy has been initiated, treatment will not be interrupted except for any life -threatening infection or severe hematologic toxicity 
defined as ANC <  300/µL or plat elets < 40 000/µL during the course of treatment. Under these 
circumstances, radiation therapy shall be delayed until the counts have recovered. Blood product support should be instituted according to institutional/protocol guidelines. There is no minimum hemoglobin 
level during radiation therapy. The reason for any interruptions greater than 5 treatment days should be recorded in the patient’s treatment chart and submitted with the QA documentation. There should be no modifications in dose fractionation due to age or field size. If any area has been previously treated (emergently), care should be taken not to exceed normal tissue tolerance levels.   
4.3.7 Treatment Technique  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Beam Configuration  
Every attempt should be made to minimize dose to organs  at risk without compromising coverage of the 
target volume. Three -dimensional conformal therapy (coplanar or non- coplanar) or IMRT are required to 
minimize dose to normal tissues.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Selection of proton beam arrangements  
There are uncertainties (1 -3 mm) in the distal range of the proton beam in which the RBE may be greater 
than 1.1; therefore, single proton beam plans which stop in a critical organ will not be allowed. Individual proton beams which are a component of a multi -field proton beam, which stop within such an 
organ, will be allowed.

[IP_ADDRESS]   Simulation including patient positioning and immobilization  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_203905] position approaches. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_203906] immobilization devices for the torso, ext remities or head and neck are to be used.  
For IMRT delivery approaches, the methods used for localization and immobilization of both patient and tumor are critical. The imaging studies should provide a clear assessment of the target volume with the patient in the treatment position.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Special considerations   
Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Motion Management and Margins to Account for Target Volume and Organ Motion  
Considering motion of normal tissues and target volumes is important. The internal target volume (ITV) 
is defined as the CTV surrounded by [CONTACT_174637] (IM) component of the PTV and is meant to account for potential motion of the CTV. The planning org an at risk volume (PRV) includes the organs at 
risk (OAR) surrounded by a margin to compensate for physiologic change in the target volume. If adequate clinical data do not exist to define the IM component of the PTV or the PRV margin, the following suggestions are provided: 
• A margin of at least 0.5cm should be added to any OAR to form the PRV. 
• For a CTV susceptible to physiologic motion, a margin of at least 0.5cm should be added to the CTV prior to PTV margin expansion or a PTV margin of 1.0cm should be chosen. 
• For tumors of the thorax or abdomen, an assessment should be made to determine the extent of motion present. PTV margins should include this motion as a component.  
• IMRT may be used for tumors of the thorax only if the degree of tumor motion is assessed and can 
be limited to 0.5cm in any direction. If required to achieve this goal, techniques for managing or suppressing tumor motion shall be applied. 
• A description of the method used and evidence (i.e., observed motion during fluoroscopy, motion of surrogate markers using camera systems, or analysis of [ADDRESS_203907]) of the remaining tumor 
motion should be submitted on the Motion Management Reporting Form with the Quality Assurance Documentation materials as noted in Section  4.3.10. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Brachytherapy  
Sources used shall have assay directly traceable to NIST.  
 
CT or MRI planning shall be used for postimplant dosimetry. The GTV and CTV shall be outlined on the CT or MRI. The PTV is identical to the CTV for purposes of brachytherapy planning. DVHs for the GTV, CTV, and PTV shall be calculated and submitted for review. 
 
The following guidelines may be considered in planning the implant: 
 
A single plane implant is generally used for patients with microscopic residual disease. The target volume should include all  sites of potential microscopic disease with at least 1.0cm margin on all sides. If 
the area to be implanted is larger than 50cm
2, external beam radiation therapy should be considered. 
Catheters should be parallel and positioned 1cm apart. To ensure suffic ient coverage the catheters should 
be placed with the distal end of the catheter projecting 1 -2cm beyond the target volume.

7.3 Specimens Requested for Biologic Studies 
 
Submission of primary intra -ocular tumor and/or metastatic tumor is not required for participation on this 
protocol, but is strongly encouraged to allow future biological  studies regarding genetic alterations 
associated with the metastatic phenotype.  
 
Tissue: Please submit any available tissue not required for diagnostic purpo ses at originating institution.  
If a tissue pi[INVESTIGATOR_174616] 0.5 cm in diameter is available, then tissue should be equally divided between 
formalin-fixation and cryopreservation at -70oC. If less is available, please send frozen tissue as the 
priority. 
 
1) Frozen Tissue: Submit representative primary and metastatic tumor tissue at diagnosis. [ADDRESS_203918] in the plastic zip- lock 
bag provided in the Specimen Procurement Kit. Store at -70oC until shipped to BPC.  
2) Formalin Fixed Tissue: Submit a minimum of 1 representative formalin -fixed paraffin -
embedded tissue block from primary and metastatic tumor. If a block is not available, submit 
primary and metastatic t issue in 10% buffered formalin. Store and ship at room temperature.  
3) Slides: 20 tissue sections from formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded block. Sections should be 
3-5µm in thickness and placed on coated slides for immunocytochemical studies. Store and 
ship at room temperature. 
 
Blood: Collect 5 mL of blood in an EDTA (purple top) tube. Centrifuge sample and draw off plasma. 
Distribute plasma evenly among the 5 vials from the Specimen Procurement Kit. Store plasma at –70oC 
to –80oC until shipped. Plasma will be collected from all patients at diagnosis.  
 Additionally, on the days when bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_174617], 2.5 m L of peripheral blood in 
PAXgene tube (Qiagen) should be obtained and submitted at room temperature.  Bone marrow:  An additional aliquot of bone marrow (5 to 10 m L with 100 Units of heparin/m L of marrow) 
should be obtained when each bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_174618].  Label specimens for biologic studies with the BPC Number, collection date and specimen type.  
 
7.4 Specimen Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_174619], the Biopathology Center (BPC) will provide a Specimen 
Procurement Kit. The specimen procurement kit is constructed to allow shipment of frozen (on dry ice) 
and ambient temperature tissues in the same container.  The kit provides specimen collection containers, 
instructions, a pre -printed Federal Express air bill and required biohazard and dry -ice labels. For further 
information, or to obtain kit, please contact [CONTACT_174641] ([PHONE_3772].  Dry ice may be placed in  either compartment of the kit, but should not be put in both. Place the frozen 
tissue and plasma in one compartment of the kit along with [ADDRESS_203919] envelope into the Tyvek Diagnostic 
Envelope and seal securely. Always include a specimen transmittal form with each shipment.

8.2.4 
Platelet transfusions should be given as local institutional guidelines . It generally is recommended that 
platelet counts be kept >  20 000/µL . Patients with CNS lesions or manifestations of bleeding despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 
platelet count >  20 000/µL should be managed more conservatively maintaining a platelet count 
> 50 000/µL.  
 
 8.3 Infectious complications  may be managed as per local Institutional protocols , using the following 
suggested guidelines as considerations.  
 8.3.1 Fever and neutropenia: Patients that develop fever need to be promptly evaluated, appropriate cultures 
taken and intravenous antibiotic coverage started. Broad spectrum coverage (2 -drug) is recommended 
and should be continued until neutrophil engraftment. For persistent fever of undetermined cause of  
greater than 5 days duration empi[INVESTIGATOR_174620]  8.3.2 Nephrotoxicity: N ote that these patients have previously received nephro toxic chemotherapeutic agents 
and caution must be taken when using aminoglycosides, Vancomycin or Amphotericin B deoxycholate. 
Careful monitoring of antibiotic levels and renal function (serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes) should be undertaken when using such agents. Abnormal renal function will also require modification of antibiotic doses and dose intervals, which can be most rationally determined by [CONTACT_174642].  8.3.3 Anti-fungal prophylaxis: F luconazole 6 mg/kg/day IV/ PO daily is recommended , particularly during 
periods of neutropenia and during consolidation . 
 8.3.4 PCP prophylaxis: During induction therapy, PCP prophylaxis should be administered as per institutional guidelines, preferably with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole unless the patient has a sulfa allergy.  
 
The Following Apply to the Consolidation Phase of Treatment Only: 
 
8.3.5 Protective isolation should be as per local institutional guidelines.  
 8.3.6 HSV prophylaxis: F or patients with a history or serologic evidence of previous oral HSC infection 
acyclovir (750 mg/m
2/24 hrs based on ideal body weight, divided q8h) from day –8 to day +30 
 8.3.7 PCP prophylaxis: During consolidation therapy, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (5 mg/ kg/day in 2 
divided doses orally) is recommended until Day -2 before the stem cell infusion, with re- initiation of 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on Day + 30 provided the ANC is > 750/µL on [ADDRESS_203920] transplant. In patients who are allergic to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg given upon admission for transplant, 
then every 4 weeks thereafter for 6 months is a reasonable substitute.

8.3.8 
Intravenous immunoglobulin: IgG should be measured weekly and intravenous IgG should be given at a 
dose of 0.6 g/kg for levels < 5.0 g/L. 
 
 8.3.9 Skin care: Skin reactions following thiotepa administration are common. Frequent bathing/washing (at 
least 4 times daily) is recommended during and for at least 24 hours following administration. Sheet 
changes should be frequent.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Statistical Design  
The study involves a non- randomized assignment of CNS negative (stratum Stage 4a) and CNS positive 
(stratum Stage 4b) distant metastatic patients to receive a treatment regimen involving induction 
chemotherapy, stem cell harvesting, external beam radiation therapy, and consolidation therapy (high- dose 
chemotherapy with stem cell rescue). Patients with orbital, regional nodal disease and/or optic nerve margin 
positivity, but no other sites of metastases (stratum Stage 2 & 3 ), will be non- randomly assigned to receive 
the same treatment regimen without consolidation therapy. Observed event -free survival distributions will 
be compared to f ixed, historical distributions separately for each stratum. An event is defined as relapse, 
second malignancy, or death from any cause.  
 
10.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial  
The primary aim of the study is to compare the event -free survival rate between the current strata- specific 
strategies and historical experiences. The historical event- free survival rate at 1 year for patients with orbital 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 51 
disease is 40% with very few failures after [ADDRESS_203922] 20% for CNS negative patients and 
approximately 5% for CNS positive patients.[ADDRESS_203923] reported a near 0% event -free 
survival rate5,12-14, though anecdotal evidence has reported some event -free survivors. It is thought that the 
proposed treatment strategies will improve the 1-year event -free survival rates (EFS)  to 70%, 70%, and 20% 
for orbital, distant metastatic CNS negative and distant meta static CNS positive patients respectively.  
 The observed EFS distribution will be compared to historical experience separately for each group of 
patients because orbit patients will not receive the high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, and the prognoses of CNS negative and CNS positive patients will likely be quite different (due to blood- brain 
barrier considerations). Although we hypothesize that both the CNS negative and CNS positive patients will 
experience a reduction in risk of failure under the proposed therapy, a 78% reduction and a 46% reduction, respectively based on an exponential survival model, the reduction in risk is expected to be lower in the CNS positive subgroup. So, estimation of a combined relative risk would result in a slight underestimate for the CNS negative patients and a slight overestimate for the CNS positive patients. Furthermore, the CNS 
negative and CNS positive patients have historically been summarized as separate cohorts in the literature, and therefore, there is interest in estimation of stratum -specific EFS. Clinically and scientifically, it is most 
logical to describe the event -free survival distribution separately for each of the patient strata.  
 
Sample Size  
 
The estimated number of retinoblastoma cases per year in the [LOCATION_003] is 300 -350. About 5% of cases develop 
extraocular disease; therefore about [ADDRESS_203924]. Ba rry Anderson (CTEP).  The proposed annual accrual of [ADDRESS_203925] two years of study activation , accrual was very slow with a total of 11 patients enrolled. 
However, the rate of enrollment has steadily increased to an estimated steady state of 12 patients per year. 
Based on these observations, it is anticipated that there will be a total of 60 patients enrolled at 6 years from 
the start of the study. Also, enrolled patients are split about equally in the three risk groups.  Stage 2 and 3 patients (regional disease patients): With 20 patients and assuming that the EFS rate from 
historical experience is 40% at [ADDRESS_203926] a true increase in 
the event-free survival rate of 30% (70%- 40%) is 89%. A 1-sided alpha level was chosen as primary 
interest is in detecting an improvement in event -free survival rate under the more intensive therapy. The 
target sample size will result in a standard error of approximately 0.10 for the 12- month event -free 
survival rate, assuming a 12 -month event-free survival rate of 0.7 under the proposed therapy. 
 Stage 4a patients (distant metastatic CNS negative patients): Twenty CNS negative distant metastatic 
patients will be accrued over the 6 -year period required to address the orbital patient aim. Assuming that the 
event-free survival rate for the current therapy is 20% at [ADDRESS_203927] greater than 95% power to 
detect a true increase i n the EFS of 50% (70% - 20%). The target sample size will result in a standard error 
of approximately 0.10 for the 12-month EFS rate, assuming a 12 -month EFS rate of 0.7 under the 
proposed therapy.

Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 52 
Stage 4b patients (distant metastatic CNS positive patien ts): Twenty CNS positive distant metastatic 
patients will be accrued over the 6 -year period required for the orbital patient study. Assuming that the EFS 
rate for the current therapy is 5% at [ADDRESS_203928] 80% power to detect a true increase in the EFS of 
15% (20% - 5%) assuming a 1-sided alpha level of 0.05, an annual accrual of [ADDRESS_203929] not been m et. 
It is estimated that patients will be accrued over a 6 -year period, with an additional 1 year of follow -up on 
all patients, resulting in a to tal study duration of 7 years.
 These calculations do not include patients from 
international institutions mentioned above.  
 
10.3 Statistical Analysis Methods 
 Primary Endpoint  
 
We will assume that the failure- free survival  (FFS) experience of each group of patients (distant metastatic 
CNS positive, distant metastatic CNS negative, and orbit patients) can be adequately modeled using the exponential cure model.
[ADDRESS_203930] group 
sequential boundaries. Based on data reported by [CONTACT_174643].,4 we will assume a fixed null hypothesis 
model for the FFS probabi lity over time of the historical patients as follows: 
[ ] ) 8 . 1 exp( 63 . 0 37 . 0 ) (t tFFS − + = . 
Outcome data for the regional disease (stratum stage 2 and 3) patients will be formally reviewed for increased harm relative to the historical experience, using the Lan -DeMets implementation of the 
O’Brien and Fleming group sequential boundaries, after 50% and 100% of the expected information is 
observed (after approximately every 6 failures under the null hypothesis). An alpha spending function of (alpha * t) will be used to specify the monitoring boundaries, as it is of interest to detect early indications of increased harm relative to historical experience.
29 The critical values will be 1. 64 and 1.44.  Under this 
design, the study will be stopped for review with probability of 0.10 under the null long -term failure rate 
of 63% and with probability of 0.65 under a true long- term failure rate of 90%. 
 For the pat ients with distant metastatic CNS positive disease or distant metastatic CNS negative disease, 
the toxic death rate will be monitored as described below. No additional outcome monitoring will be performed, unless the toxic death rate appears to be higher t han is acceptable based on historical 
experience, at which point we would like to know if there is lack of evidence of superiority given the increased risk of toxic death. In this case, the data will be monitored for lack of evidence of superiority 
under the proposed therapy relative to historical experience (futility). Otherwise, if there are no 
indications of increased risk of toxic death, we will not monitor for futility or increased harm because the historical outcome for these patients is so poor, we w ant to avoid acting on early failures when there

might be a delayed benefit, and we would like to continue to the target accrual in order to preserve 
estimation precision.  
 The study proposes to enroll a small number of subjects in each stratum and therefore, will not be monitored for early evidence of superior outcome in any stratum because halting the study accrual early would reduce the already limited precision of estimation.  The toxicity -associated death rate and the percentage of patients for whom an adequate yield of stem cells 
cannot be harvested will be monitored across all treatment groups collectively. Specifically, a 5% toxicity -
associated death rate is acceptable, while a 10%-15% rate would be cause for concern. A continuous 
monitoring rule wil l be used where the study is stopped for review by [CONTACT_174644] 0.005 under the null hypothesis of a 5% event rate. Specifically, the 
following algorithm will be followed: 
 
 Stop the Study for Review if   
Number of Events Observed  Number of Patients On Study  
[ADDRESS_203931] 25 patients enrolled, the study will be 
stopped for review. Under the specified monitoring rule, the study will be stopped with probability of 0.84 under an event rate of 15%, with probability  of 0.65 under an event rate of 12%, with probability of 0.48 
under an event rate of 10%, and with probability of 0.09 under the null rate of 5%.  
 Also, it is expected that over 98% of the patients receiving autologous stem cell rescue ( ASCR) will yield a n 
adequate amount of stem cells, whereas if only 90% of the patients yield an adequate amount, this would be cause for concern. A continuous monitoring rule will be used where the study is stopped for review by [CONTACT_174645] 0.01 under the null hypothesis of a 2% event rate. Specifically, the following algorithm will be followed:  
 Stop the Study for Review if

patients enrolled, the study will be stopped for review. Under the specified monitoring rule, the study will be  
stopped with probability of 0.91 under the alternative event rate of 10% and will be stopped with probability of 0.09 under the null rate of 2%.  The accrual rate will also be closely monitored. If fewer than 10 patients from all participating  institutions 
are accrued per year on average across the 3 treatment strata, and more than a 9  year accrual period would 
be required to assess the event -free survival  endpoints, and would therefore be caus e for early termination 
review. 
 
Secondary Endpoints  
 
The response rate to the induction phase of the regimen will be estimated and a corresponding 95% confidence interval calculated for all strata combined. Toxicities will be descriptively summarized.

11.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
11.1 Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize the CTC AE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and performance 
reporting. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_203933] 
access to a copy of  the CTCAE version 4.0, which can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  
 11.2 Response Criteria  
 
This study will use a modified version of the international criteria for neuroblastoma response.   
 Please note: for some patients with trilateral retinoblastoma, it may be difficult to distinguish between tumor necrosis and refractory tumor. Please consider second look surgery prior to consolidation therapy should uncertainty arise as to whether an adequate response has been achieved.  
 
11.2.1 Complete Response (CR)   
Resolution of the metastatic disease as defined by [CONTACT_174646] (those that revealed an abnormality prior to enrollment on this study).  
11.2.2 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
> 90% decrease in the sum of the 2- dimensional measurements of the tumor (s) on relevant (CT and/or 
MRI) imaging studies. No new lesions. Bone marrow free of tumor. Improved bone scan. 
 
11.2.3 Partial Response (PR)  
50-90% decrease in the sum of the 2 -dimensional measurements of the tumor(s) on relevant (CT and/or 
MRI) imaging studies. N o new lesions. Bone marrow free of tumor. 
 
11.2.4 Stable Disease (SD)  
< 50% decrease and < 25% increase in the sum of the 2 -dimensional measurements of the tumor(s) on 
relevant (CT and/or MRI) imaging studies. No new lesions. 
 
11.2.5 Progressive Disease (PD)   
At least a 25% increase in the sum of the 2- dimensional measurements of the tumor(s) on relevant (CT 
and/or MRI) imaging studies, and/or a new lesion that unequivocally represents retinoblastoma.  
 
11.2.6 Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statuses described above.  
  
12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
12.1 Purpose 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to 
ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/14  Page 56 
12.2 Determination of reporting requirements 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an 
investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade 
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of 
the adverse event .  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. In some cases an agent obtained commercially  may be used for indications not included in the 
package label. In addition, NCI may on some occasions distribute commercial supplies for a trial. Even in 
these cases, the agent is still considered to be a commercial agent and the procedures described belo w 
should be followed. 
 
Determine the prior experience  Expected events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting fro m administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected,  for reporting 
purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:  
 
• the current known toxicities for each commercial agent as provided in the Drug 
Information for Commercial Agents Used by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group posted on the COG website; or 
• the drug package insert.  
 
Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (eg, treatment with 
investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not 
considered a secondary malignancy.  
 All secondary malignancies that o ccur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three 
options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy   
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
 
12.3 Reporting of Adverse Events for Commercial  Agents – via CTEP -AERS 
Expedited AE reporting must use CTEP -AERS (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System), 
accessed via https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers 
 Commercial reporting requirements are provided in Table B.  The commercial agent(s) used in this study 
are listed in the front of this protocol immediately following the Study Committee roster.   
 
• COG requires the CTEP -AERS report to be submitted within 7 calendar days of learning 
of the event.   
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . All appropriate treatment 
areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET0321 
Version Date: 02/14/[ADDRESS_203934] dose of treatment with a commercial agent that 
can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not 
due to cancer recurrence must be reported via CTEP-AERS. 
 
 
12.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Note: The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on the COG case 
report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP -AERS reporting. 
 The NCI defines both routine and expedited AE reporting.  Routine reporting is accomplished via the 
Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database.   For this study, routine 
reporting will include all toxicities reported via CTEP -AERS and all Grade 3 and higher Non-
hematologic Adverse Events.

APPENDIX I:  YOUTH INFORMATION SHEET  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ARET0321  
(for children 7 - 12 years of age) 
 
 
A Trial of Intensive Multi -Modality Therapy for Extra -Ocular Retinoblastoma.  
(A Treatment Study of Retinoblastoma that has Spread Outside of the Eye) 
Distant Metastatic Disease-Stage 4a and 4b 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer, called metastatic retinoblastoma. Metastatic 
means that  the cancer has spread outside of the eye.  
2. Now we would like to ask you to take part in a research study about treatment for metastatic retinoblastoma. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat children with metastatic retinoblastoma.  
3. We have been talking with your parent(s) about this study. We want to include you as we talk more about it. Being in this study may involve special risks, which the doctor will discuss with you. 
4. In this study, doctors will use a new treatment for retinoblastoma that uses big doses of cancer 
fighting drugs (chemotherapy). T he doctors also want to do something called a “stem cell 
rescue.” This is when special blood cells (called stem cells) are taken out of your blood and saved. Stem cells are like “parent cells” for all the cells in your blood. Later, the stem cells are put back into your blood. This is often done when patients get big quantities of chemotherapy which lower the number of your blood cells. It is done to help your body get better by [CONTACT_174647]. Some children may also get high energy x -ray treatment (called external beam radiation therapy) whi ch also helps to kill 
cancer cells. 
5. This study is being done to see if this new treatment is better at getting rid of metastatic retinoblastoma for as long as possible; than the treatments used in the past. We do not know if the bigger amounts of chemother apy and the stem cell rescue will help get rid of the cancer better 
than older treatments. We do not know which treatment is better. That is why we are doing this study. 
6. If you take part in this study, you will get chemotherapy into something called a cent ral line, 
which is often used for children getting this kind of chemotherapy. A central line is a special type of tubing that is put into a large vein in your chest. If you have a central line, you will not get to be pricked too many times to get chemotherapy or have blood samples taken. 
7. While getting the first part of chemotherapy (called induction), your stem cells will be collected and saved. Chemotherapy given during induction may be with 4 drugs (called Standard Induction) or with 3- drugs (called Alternative Induction). If you have serious hearing and/or 
vision problems, you may get alternative induction to try to minimize the risk of more visual and/or hearing loss. You will get more chemotherapy after induction. This is called consolidation 
therapy. During consolidation, you will have your stem cells that were saved during induction, put back into your blood. Following the end of consolidation chemotherapy, some children may

Version Date: 02/14/[ADDRESS_203936] regular check- ups to see how well the drugs are 
working. 
9. Please talk this over with your parent(s). Together you can decide if you want to take part in this 
study. Please ask any questions that you can think of. If you have a question later, you can ask the next time you see me.  
10. If you and your parent(s) decide not to be in this study, no one will be mad or upset with you. You will be able to receive treatment used in the past, or other experimental treatments if it is available.

Abstract The benefits of physical activity on managing chronic illnesses and multiple symptoms are well established. However, increasing the physical activity of persons living with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC), especially low –income cancer survivors with MCC, is challenging. Home-based exercise improves physical activity and symptoms among persons with the single chronic disease. One major challenge of the home-based exercise is the motivation and adherence. The mobile technologies (e.g., wearable device and smartphone application) have been used to improve motivation and monitor a person physical activity. Guided by [CONTACT_593438], we developed a technology-enhanced home-based exercise program using a combination of the integrated mobile technologies (wearable device and phone application) and tailored home-based exercise. Participants will choose one of the four home-based exercise options (National Institute of Aging [NIA] Go4Life, Iyengar-style yoga, walking, and modified Otago exercise) based on their preference and goals. The integrated mobile technologies system will allow us to extract heart rate data directly from the wearable device to the research server. This data will be used to provide appropriate and personalized feedback on physical performance and trigger algorithms to send the survey and notification to the participants in real time. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_593418]-enhanced home exercise tailored to participants’ goals and preferences.  The intervention will leverage the cancer survivorship phase (post-treatment) to motivate self-care by [CONTACT_593439]-based physical activity programs and mobile technology for participants to engage in the resilience-enhancing physical activity. Identification of BDNF’s role as one of the exercise outcomes provide a novel target for an intervention and increase our understanding of the underlying mechanism of symptoms and resilience.  2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives) This study consists of 2 phases. Phase 1:  Aim 1:  Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the iBHE program among low-income cancer survivors living with co-morbid conditions.  Eight participants who have completed treatment for a solid tumor cancer with at least one comorbidity (e.g., diabetes and/or hypertension) will be assigned to an open-label trial of the idea.  We will gather feedback on goal setting, problem-solving strategies, exercise choices, and tracking mechanisms, program feasibility, and acceptability and modify the intervention as needed prior to Phase 2.   Phase 2: Aim 2: pi[INVESTIGATOR_593419], pain, affective well-being, resilience and BDNF level among low-income cancer survivors living with co-morbid

After adjustment in the protocol based on Aim 1, 50 participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to a 12-week experimental (preferred physical activities) group or a usual care usual care (waiting list) group. Variables will be measured at baseline, completion (12 weeks) and 6 months. Hypothesis 2: After controlling for the age, gender, race, and BMI, participants in the experimental group will have a great decline in fatigue, pain, and a greater increase in AWB, resilience and BDNF level from baseline to program completion and 3 months compared to the usual care group. Aim 3: Examine the association between the changes in the biomarker (BDNF) in serum and sweat after the 12-weeks from baseline and at [ADDRESS_782991] program completion from baseline iBHE program.  Hypothesis 3: the change in the serum BDNF level is positively associated with a change in the sweat BDNF level at the after the 12-weeks from baseline and at 6 months from baseline iBHE program. The purpose of this phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_593420], acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a promising home-based, tailored, technology-enhanced exercise program (iHBE).  The intervention is guided by [CONTACT_593440]’s preferences, resources, and readiness and it harnesses technology to provide a reminder and immediate feedback on physical performance.(Blaney, Lowe-Strong, Rankin-Watt, Campbell, & Gracey, 2013; Studenski et al., 2010)  After pi[INVESTIGATOR_593421], we will conduct an RCT to examine the preliminary efficacy of the item on health outcomes (fatigue, pain, AWB, resilience, and BDNF) among low-income cancer survivors living with MCC.  We will obtain measures at baseline and 4-week follow-up using a combination of self-report and objective measures. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein in oxidative stress pathway(Markham et al., 2012) that is related to fatigue(Saligan, Lukkahatai, Holder, Walitt, & Machado-Vieira, 2015) and resilience.(Holmes, 2014) A consistent, light-intensity aerobic exercise can significantly increase 25% of serum BDNF level from baseline.(Zimmer et al., 2017)  We propose to examine this biomarker as one of the outcomes to identify the potential biological mechanism of pain, fatigue, and resilience. BDNF testing does not account for circadian rhythm nor temporality to exercise and requires venipuncture. Therefore, a secondary goal of this study is to examine the level of sweat BDNF, non-invasively collected over [ADDRESS_782992] one comorbidity (e.g., diabetes and/or hypertension) will be assigned to an open-label trial of the iBHE.  The feasibility of this first study phase is defined as the acceptability, compliance, and delivery of the intervention. The feasibility of the intervention program will be determined from the achievement of individual physical activity goal. At the end of [ADDRESS_782993] 75% of the individual’s exercise goal (for example, if the goal is to exercise at the fat burn level (50-60% maximum heart rate measured by [CONTACT_593441]) for 30 min/day [ADDRESS_782994] 2 days or FitBit data showed more than 60 active min). For this first phase, at least 50% of participants will need to meet 75% of personal goal in at least 2 weeks for the trial to continue onto phase II. For participants who do not achieve 75% of their individual exercise goal, the barriers will be identified that the weekly goals will be revised until the 75% of weekly personal exercise goals is met. If the feasibility threshold (less than 50% of participants achieve 75% of their weekly goals for 2 weeks) does not reach, we will adjust the goal setting process and recruit more participants. We will conduct a qualitative semi-structured interviews interview to gather feedback on goal setting, problem-solving strategies, exercise choices, and tracking mechanisms, program feasibility, and acceptability and modify the intervention as needed.

Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research) Nearly 16 million Americans were cancer survivors in 2016, with an additional 1.7 million new cases expected in 2017.(American Cancer Society, 2017) With the advancement of cancer diagnosis and treatment, 60% of cancer patients will survive at least 5-years.(National Cancer Institute, 2014)  More than 80% of these cancer survivors have one or more comorbid chronic conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis)(Rothrock et al., 2010) with hypertension as a most frequent comorbid condition (prevalence rate of 20-65%).(Braithwaite et al., 2009; Izano et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2008) This prevalence of these MCCs is double (60-75%) among older adults and even higher among low income older adults.(Kramarow, 2017) This growing MCCs prevalence affects health status, disability and AWB.(Koolhaas et al., 2013) Studies show that the number of MCCs is associated with the prevalence and severity of symptoms such as pain and fatigue.(Annunziata, Muzzatti, Mella, & Bidoli, 2013; Arrieta et al., 2013; Manning & Bettencourt, 2011; Servaes, Gielissen, Verhagen, & Bleijenberg, 2007) These multiple symptoms impact persons’ AWB and adherence to the treatment.(Beck, Towsley, Caserta, Lindau, & Dudley, 2009; Shelby [CONTACT_2297]., 2011) Persons living with MCCs with multiple symptoms have a greater risk of premature death than those without symptoms.(Cheville et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2012) Cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions experience significantly higher symptoms such as pain, and fatigue prevalence and severity than those without comorbidity.(Annunziata et al., 2013; Arrieta et al., 2013; Huang, Hudson, Robison, & Krull, 2017; Manning & Bettencourt, 2011; Servaes et al., 2007) Managing these multiple chronic conditions and multiple symptoms requires active participation from the persons and family members. Socioeconomic status (SES) complicates the management of these multiple conditions, as people with low income can have limited access to health care and resources, limited leisure-time, and other non-medical challenges.(Beenackers et al., 2012)  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends increasing physical activity (PA) as one of the most effective interventions for managing chronic conditions and symptoms.(National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2017) Exercise is a type of PA that required structure, repetition of an intentional movement. Studies show a continuous aerobic moderate-intensity exercise program not only improves fatigue, pain,(Dodd et al., 2010; Meneses-Echavez, Gonzalez-Jimenez, & Ramirez-Velez, 2015a, 2015b; Tian, Lu, Lin, & Hu, 2015; van Waart et al., 2015) and AWB,(Cheville et al., 2010) but also delays the onset and progression of other chronic conditions. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_593422], evidence shows that less than 10% of cancer survivors are active during treatment and only 20% of cancer survivors are active after treatment.(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946] & Ciccolo, 2011) The number is even lower in low-income cancer survivors with comorbidities. To overcome barriers to exercise, home-based exercise programs have been developed and report promising effectiveness on pain, fatigue, and AWB among persons with several chronic conditions.(Dodd et al., 2010; Hoffman et al., 2013; Spector, Deal, Amos, Yang, & Battaglini, 2014) However, these studies examined the effectiveness of these program on an individual chronic condition. They reported that most home-based exercise programs are challenged by a lack of motivation and low engagement rate with the exercise regimen.(Junghaenel, Cohen, Schneider, Neerukonda, & Broderick, 2015; Kober et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2015a, 2015b) Recent evidence shows that the use of technology to provide immediate feedback on physical performance and reminder messaging can increase motivation and adherence to PA.(Blaney et al., 2013; Studenski et al., 2010) This is part of the scientific premise for this study. Resilience is defined as a positive adaptation and maintenance function during stressful events.(Eicher, Matzka, Dubey, & White, 2015) It influences the perception of symptoms including pain and fatigue.(Kennedy et al., 2017; Lim, Shon, Paek, & Daly, 2014; Sharpley et al., 2017; Sharpley, Bitsika,

During stressful events, BDNF is activated to enhance neuroprotective mechanisms.(Scuri, Samsell, & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_60621], 2010) BDNF has been proposed to influence resilience.(Holmes, 2014; Rothman & Mattson, 2013; Tyagi, Zhuang, Agrawal, Ying, & Gomez-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_21102], 2015) Exercise can affect the BDNF level. A study in cancer survivors reported that 8 months of a personalized light-intensity aerobic exercise (15-25 MET h/week) can significantly increase 25% of serum BDNF level from baseline. (Zimmer et al., 2017) Based on the meta-analysis the [ADDRESS_782995] studies used to see the change in BDNF level.(Dinoff et al., 2016)  Framework: The iBHE program is based on the Society to Cells Resilience framework and promising findings from two previous studies. The intervention targets two domains; individual and physiological factors (neurochemical activities). The intervention aims to promote individual’s ability in reflection, affirmation, goal setting, dealing with ambivalence and change in stress-induced neurochemical activity through tailoring and physical performance feedback through mobile technologies,  which will improve resilience, pain, fatigue, AWB and BDNF level. Preliminary works: The scientific premise of the proposed study is based on the findings from two preliminary studies. Study 1: We tested the feasibility of a home-based exercise program that integrated a PA tracking device and an ecological momentary assessment mobile phone application (mEMA) to enhance and track home-based exercise in one week among [ADDRESS_782996] 60% of maximum possible HR for [ADDRESS_782997] additional challenges in engaging in the recommended amount of exercise.  In addition, our previous work did not tailor the exercise to the context or preference of participants which can be improved by [CONTACT_593444]’ readiness and intention, and tailoring the program to individual needs.(Husebo, Dyrstad, Soreide, & Bru, 2013; Puts et al., 2014)  Study 2: Our recent publication reported the association between BDNF and fatigue. We found that cancer survivors with worsening fatigue during radiotherapy had significant lower BDNF level than the non-fatigue survivors.(Saligan et al., 2015)  This study, we will examine an integration of tailored home exercise and mobile technologies to improve resilience, pain, fatigue, and AWB among low-income cancer survivors with MCC. To address the limitations of engagement to exercise intervention, we will combine our previous smartphone application and wearable technology with goal setting and problem-solving intervention to tailor PA to individual daily

Primary objectives of this phase are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the iBHE program. Eight participants who have completed treatment for a solid tumor cancer with at least one comorbidity (e.g., diabetes and/or hypertension) will be assigned to an open-label trial of the iBHE.  At the completion of the program (4 weeks), the primary investigator will conduct a semi-structured interview to gather feedback on the program feasibility, goal setting, problem-solving strategies, exercise choices and tracking mechanisms, program feasibility, and acceptability. The interview will be recorded and transcribed verbatim.   The feasibility of the program The feasibility of the intervention program will be determined from the achievement of individual physical activity goal. At the end of [ADDRESS_783007] 75% of the individual’s exercise goal (for example, if the goal is to exercise at the fat burn level (50-60% maximum heart rate measured by [CONTACT_593441]) for 30 min/day [ADDRESS_783008] 2 days or FitBit data showed more than 60 active min). For this first phase, at least 50% of participants will need to meet 75% of personal goal in at least 2 weeks for the trial to continue onto phase II. For participants who do not achieve 75% of their individual exercise goal, the barriers will be identified that the weekly goals will be revised until the 75% of weekly personal exercise goals is met. If the feasibility threshold (less than 50% of participants achieve 75% of their weekly goals for 2 weeks) does not reach, we will adjust the goal setting process and recruit more participants. The feasibility of the recruitment will be determined by [CONTACT_593449], eligible participants and participants who refuse to be in the study and rational will be examined and recorded as indicator of feasibility. The feasibility of delivering the program will be evaluated by [CONTACT_593450]. The intervention checklist will be filled by [CONTACT_593451].  The acceptability of the program  The acceptability of the program will be assessed using the semi-structure interview. The common feedback and suggestion for intervention during the semi-structure interview will be noted.

JHMIRB eFormA  01 Version 3 Dated:   06/2007  Page 10 of 19  The compliance of the program The compliance of this program will be monitored using active min and daily heart rate zone data from the wearable device (FitBit Charge 2). The weekly goals on number of day for physical activity and duration of the physical activity will be set. The number active min and duration of the heart rate in at least “Fat Burn” zone per day will be recorded for the duration of physical activity/day. The number of days the participant achieve the goals (duration and days) for physical activity will be used to measure the compliance of the program. The descriptive information from the phase I to help inform alternative approaches to the anticipated analysis, sample size estimates for phase II, and additional key variables to be measured in phase II (intervention dose, fidelity, and .additional process variables). The program modification Prior to phase 2, the primary investigator will discuss participants’ feedback with the research teams.  The modification of exercise plan, wearable device, and phone application feature will be discussed until consensus program for each option is made.   8. Risks Potential Risks:  The risks of participating in this study are minimal. Potential risks include 1. complications during the blood drawing for examples pain and bleeding at the drawing site. 2. complications during the sweat collection for examples rash, itching, redness and swollen. 3. minimum discomfort might occur during the wearable device (worn like a bracelet). 4. complications (e.g., fainting, injury) during the exercise program. During the proposed study, if there is a serious adverse event, anticipated to be an uncommon occurrence, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_593425]. The administration of the intervention may be discontinued at the participant’s request or by [CONTACT_093], based on clinical judgment. Participants will be instructed to report any adverse event experienced after treatment without delay.  Adequacy of Protection against Risks: The safety of the study participants is essential. The primary investigator and research team will take all precautions to protect the participants against risks.  Protection against Risks: The principal investigator (PI) and research team plan to prevent the following risks: 1. Complications of the blood drawn. Participants may experience pain and discomfort during the blood drawn. They may also be at risk of bleeding. All of the blood drawn will be performed by [CONTACT_593452]. After blood drawn, participants’ conditions will be monitored by a registered nurse.  2. Complications of the sweat collection. Participants may experience allergic reactions and discomfort during the sweat collection. The sweat pad will be placed by [CONTACT_593453]. Participants will be informed of the sign and symptoms of a potential allergic reaction. The pad can be easily removed if participants experience discomfort. 3. Minimum discomfort might occur while wearing the wearable device (worn like a bracelet). Participants will be asked to wear a physical tracking wearable device to measure their activity and sleep duration. This equipment may cause the discomfort. As with any type of jewelry, some people may experience allergies. Some people may experience a rash wearing the device. The device can be easily removed if discomfort is experienced.  4. Complications (e.g., fainting, injury, fall) during the exercise program.

All participants will be asked to wear appropriate shoes and comfortable cloth during the exercise.   9. Benefits There is no direct benefit to the participant from being in this study. However, the home-based, tailored, technology-enhanced exercise program (iHBE) proposed in this study could be used as alternative choices for cancer survivors to manage their fatigue and improve patients’ quality of life. The mEMA application and wearable device can serve as useful tools for health care providers to monitor intervention outcomes and compliance while the patients are at home.   10.

Study Procedures  Design: Randomized waiting list controlled trial design Phase 2 Specific Aims Aim 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_593419], pain, affective well-being, resilience and BDNF level among low-income cancer survivors living with co-morbid conditions at completion (12 weeks) and [ADDRESS_783010] group.  After adjustment in the protocol based on Aim 1, 50 participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to a 12-week experimental (preferred physical activities) group or a usual care usual care (waiting list) group. Variables will be measured at baseline, completion (12 weeks) and 6 months. Hypothesis 2: After controlling for the age, gender, race, and BMI, participants in the experimental group will have a greater decline in fatigue, pain, and a greater increase in AWB, resilience and BDNF level from baseline to program completion and 3 months compared to the usual care group.  Aim 3: Examine the association between the changes in the biomarker (BDNF) in serum and sweat after the 12-weeks from baseline and at [ADDRESS_783011] program completion from baseline iBHE program.  Hypothesis 3: the change in the serum BDNF level is positively associated with a change in the sweat BDNF level at the after the 12-weeks from baseline and at 6 months from baseline iBHE program.  Sample and Setting: The study participants will be recruited from the home health care agencies in Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center and Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Inclusion criteria are (1) participants diagnosed with solid tumor cancer who have completed cancer treatment at least 6 months; (2) diagnosed with diabetes and/or hypertension for at least a year; (3) aged 21 years or older, (4) have an annual household incomes of below $30,000 for families of three, (5) the average fatigue level within the past 7 days at the level of 3 or more on the 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worse fatigue) Likert scale and (6) give informed consent.  Exclusion criteria are those (1) currently undergoing treatment for cancer; (2) have an active infection (e.g., fever, localized redness, swelling, sinus congestion); and/or (3) diagnosed with a psychological disorder (e.g., suicidal or homicidal tendencies, extreme anxiety or depression).  Sample size justification  Phase 2: With an alpha level of .05, the statistical power of 0.80, and [ADDRESS_783012] sizes of 0.65 when comparing change across baseline, 3-months, and 6-months between the two groups.  With an attrition rate of 12% (22 participants per group), the detectable effect size increases to 0.69.  Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_593431], we will pay close attention to the effect size, rather than statistical significance.  These effect size estimates will be used to inform future research trials.

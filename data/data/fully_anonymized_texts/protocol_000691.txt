from the study , the Investigator must conduct Exit procedures according to Table 1 -
1:
Schedule of Study  Procedures and Assessments , as possible.
5.3 Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study  after signing 
the informed consent, including screen failures. Subjects may discontinue from the study  at 
any time for any  reason. Subjects may  also be discontinued from the study at any  time if, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] ,their continued participation poses a risk to their health. 
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced (ie, their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used).
Should a subject exhibit any  clinically  relevant signs, s ymptoms, or other clinical 
observa tions that possibly could be associated with suspected sensitivity  or intolerance to one 
of the study  treatments, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form.
Any subject who exits early  from the study  (excluding screen failures) must undergo all 
procedures outlined at Visit 3, as applicable .
The Investigator must document the reason for study  or treatment discontinuation in the 
subject ’s case history  source documents.
To ensure the safet y of all subjects who discontinue earl y, Investigators must assess each 
subject and, if necessary , advise them of an y therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical procedures that may be 
needed to maintain their health.
5.4 Clinical Study Termination
The Study  Sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study  in 
its entirety  at any  time, for reasonable cause.

associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency . The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y patient 
harm separately . Examples of device deficiencies include the fo llowing: 
Failure to meet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens/solution cloud y
Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling/in pack
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/ container)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance
7.[ADDRESS_12889] questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Additionally , changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated 
during the study  are to be reviewed b y the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnair e response that is 
clinically  relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator , is to be reported as an AE. Thes e 
clinically  relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality .
7.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent .Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the sta rt of the stud y (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .

In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.
ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
eCRF within 24 hours of the I nvestigator ’s or site ’s awareness . 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours of 
the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . 
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or 
Device Deficiency eCRF must b e included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report,
Certificate of Death ,etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse Event
and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -
operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study Sponsor at [EMAIL_225]
according to the timelines outlined above; however , the reported information must be entered 
into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contact[CONTACT_13301].
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copi [INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all 
AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.

TDOC-[ADDRESS_12890] assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate
An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_13302], as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  [CONTACT_13303] y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, th ere are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that

7.5Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the S tudy Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional inform ation received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock).
Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_12892] be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous and should be 
communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.
The Investigator should alsoreport complain ts on non- Alcon products (ie, the control lenses)
directly  to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  
requirements .
7.6 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study  entry  are 
not exc luded from participation. Pregnancy  should be included in the Medical History  section 
of the eCRF when a pregnant woman enters the study  or if a woman becomes pregnant 
during the stud y. Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; however , complications may  be 
reportable and will be decided on a case–by -case basis.
8CONFIDENTIALITY , BIAS, AND MASKING
8.[ADDRESS_12893] ’s anony mity is maintained throughout the
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of
each stud y participant. At the end of the clinical study , the Sponsor will collect a cop y of the
enrollment log without any  identify ing subject information. All documents submitted to the
Sponsor will identify  the subjects exclusively  by [CONTACT_13305]. No
other personall y identifying information should be transmitted to the Sponsor .

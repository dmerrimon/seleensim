1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background 
Updated background information is provided in the AR101 investigator brochure.   
Peanut allergy is a common and serious condition that disproportionately affects children and 
is associated with severe reactions, including life- threatening anaphylaxis .  The prevalence of 
peanut allergy, like other food allergies, has been rising, and is now at high level s, affecting 
up to 1.5% of the population ( Branum and Lukacs, 2008;  Sicherer and Sampson, 2014) .  The 
current standard of care i n management of peanut allergy is a peanut-avoidant diet, along 
with education of the subject and family in the acute management of an allergic reaction, including ready access to self -injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  The burden of avoidance and the 
constant fear of accidental exposure negatively affect the health -related quality of life (QoL) 
for subjects and their families ( Primeau  et al, 2000;  Avery  et al, 2003;  Buchanan et al, 2007;  
Sicherer et al, 2010;  Hofmann et  al, 2009;  Anagnostou et al, 2014).  
In addition, peanut -avoidant diets are complicated by [CONTACT_266794] -prepared foods ( Joshi et 
al, 2002;  Altschul et al, 2001;  Vierk et al, 2002 ).  Accidental exposures are common, with up 
to 50 percent of food- allergic subjects having ≥  1 allergic reaction over a 2 -year period 
(Sicherer et al, 1998).  
In early clinical studies, oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy has demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in creating a change in clinical reactivity that would protect recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266742] ( Jones et al, 2009;  Hofmann et  al, 2009;  
Blumchen  et al, 2010;  Yu et al, 2012 ; Varshney et al, 2011 ; Anagnostou et al, 2014).  These 
studies involved a period of up-dosing with increasing amounts of peanut protein, a period of maintenance therapy, and then an oral food challenge to assess desensitization .  Dosing 
symptoms observed in these studies have included rash, wheezing, rhinorrhea, sneezing, 
itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Most symptoms have been mild, 
consistent  with a transient, low -grade allergic reaction, and tended to diminish in frequency 
with increasing duration of treatment.   
There is evidence that OIT induces a clinically meaningful level of desensitization in most 
subjects and may also induce favorable immunologic changes over time .  Though these early 
studies used different doses and regimens, collectively they provided supportive evidence for the efficacy and safety of peanut OIT and served as the basis for the initiation of clinical development of AR101, a standardized OIT product manufactured to pharmaceutical-grade standards and previously tested in Aimmune’s phase [ADDRESS_324682] a peanut- allergic individual from the adverse effects of an accidental 
exposure to peanuts or peanut-containing foods.

1.2 Clinical Studies of AR101  
Updated background information is provided in the AR101 i nvestigator brochure.   
1.2.1 ARC001 and ARC002 
ARC001 is a completed phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study of the efficacy and safety of OIT with AR101 in peanut -allergic children and adults 
4 to 26 years of age conducted in the US .  ARC001 consisted of a  Screening Period with a 
Screening double -blind , placebo -controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), an I nitial Escalation 
Period, an Up- dosing Period to a target dose of 300 mg o nce daily (QD) maintained for 
2 weeks, a Maintenance Period (approximately 24 weeks), and an Exit DBPCFC .  Subjects 
were randomized to either AR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  The primary endpoint of 
ARC001 was the percentage of desensitization responders, defined as subjects tolerating 300 mg peanut protein ( 443 mg peanut protein cumulative) at the Exit DBPCFC .  The 
intent- to-treat population comprised 55 subjects: 29 in the AR101 group and 26 in the  
placebo group.   
ARC002 is an ongoing phase 2, multicenter, open- label, follow -on study for subjects who 
comple ted ARC001 .  The study consists of 2 parts .  Part  1 is complete and allowed subjects 
who received placebo to complete up- dosing to 300 mg QD and subjects who received 
AR101 to continue treatment with 300 mg QD .  All subjects maintained the 300 mg daily 
dose for 12 weeks and then underwent a DBPCFC.  The subjects who completed this 
DBPCFC were then given the choice to continue on 300 mg/day or enter a high- dose 
up-dosing period to a target maximum of 2000 mg/day (P art 2).  Once the individual 
maximum tolerated dose was reached, subjects are maintained on this dose.  A total of 
47 subjects enrolled in ARC002, and 40 of these subjects entered Part  2. 
1.2.2 ARC003 (PALISADE) and ARC004 (PALISADE Follow -On Study)  
ARC003 (PALI SADE) is an ongoing phase  3, international, randomized, doubl e-blind, 
placebo  controlled study of the efficacy and safety of AR101 characterized oral 
desensitization immunotherapy (CODIT ™) in peanut -allergic children and adults 4 to 
55 years of age.  Subje cts were randomized to either AR101 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.  The 
study consists of a Screening Period with a Screening DBPCFC, an Initial Escalation Period, an Up -dosing Period to a target dose of 300 mg QD maintained for 2 weeks, a Maintenance 
Period ( approximately 24 weeks), and an Exit DBPCFC .  A total of [ADDRESS_324683] of extending the dosing interval from 
daily to every other day, twice weekly, once weekly, and finally every other week.  Subjects 
who received AR101 during AR C003 will participate in 1 of 5 dosing regimens for a period 
of 28 to 84 weeks, including an Extended Maintenance Period of 24 weeks .  Subjects who 
received placebo in ARC003 will undergo initial escalation and up- dosing to a target dose 
level of 300 mg QD, on which the y will be maintained for the 24  week Init ial Maintenance 
Period before undergoing a DBPCFC .  Subjects who tolerate ≥  443 mg of peanut protein at 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 1 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.0  
20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 15 of 73 
this DBPCFC will continue into the Extended Maintenance Period.  At the end of the 
Extended Maintenance Period, all subjects will undergo an Exit DBPCFC .  Subjects who do 
not tolerate the nondaily dosing regimens will also be offered the opportunity to enroll in ARC008.  
1.2.3 ARC007 (RAMSES) and ARC008  
ARC007 is an ongoing phase  3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study of the safety of AR101 CODIT in peanut -allergic children ages 4  to 17  years of age 
conducted in the US and Canada .  Approximately 500 subjects will be randomized to either 
AR101 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  No DBPCFC will be conducted during the study.  Subjects who are r andomized to AR101 will complete the Initial Escalation and Up- dosing Periods 
with a target dose of 300 mg QD .  After tolerating the 300 mg QD dosing and maintaining 
this dosing regimen for 2 weeks, subjects having received AR101 will be eligible to rollov er 
into study ARC011 described below  followed by [CONTACT_266795]008.  Subjects who received placebo 
in ARC007 will be eligible to rollover into ARC008 directly and undergo initial escalation 
and up- dosing to a target dose level of 300 mg QD .   
ARC008 is a phase  3, int ernational, multicenter, open -label, long- term safety study of AR101 
in a CODIT regimen in peanut -allergic children and adults .  Subjects who received placebo 
during ARC007 may enroll in ARC008.  Additional subjects will originate from one of the following Aimmune AR101 clinical studies: ARC002, ARC004, ARC010, ARC011, or any future clinical study that identi fies ARC008 as a potential post study option in the study 
protocol (the parent study).   
1.2.4 ARC010 (ARTEMIS)  
ARC010 is an ongoing phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of AR101 CODIT to be conduct ed in Europe .  Approximately 
160 peanut -allergic children ages 4  to 17 years of age will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_324684] successfully reached maintenance dosing with AR101 (in ARC007) .  This study is intended to assess the safety of AR101 in subjects whose behavior 
may be affected by [CONTACT_266796] .  Upon completion of this study,

receiving treatment with AR101. 
1.4 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Subjects  
The current edi tion of the AR101 investigator brochure provides further information  on the 
risks and benefits of AR101. 1.4.1 Risks  
The risks of this study include adverse events (AEs) associated with AR101 treatment and 
risks of decreased vigilance in avoidance of peanut -containing foods. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Associated With AR101 Treatment  
The most frequently reported AEs associated with AR101 treatment are mild to moderate symptoms of allergic reactions, especially those associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  More specifically, AR101 CODIT has caused allergic symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, eczema flare-ups, ocular, nasal, and oral throat 
pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath, in addition to anaphylaxis, as defined by [CONTACT_266797]- Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network workgroup ( Sampson et al, 2006).  
In studies ARC001 and ARC002, the incidence of mild and moderate anaphylaxis with AR101 was 3% and 4% respectively .  While these events were not graded as severe, the 
possibility of severe or life- threatening anaphylaxis is a potential risk of AR101 treatment.  
In addition to anaphylaxis, the occurrence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is also an AE of interes t.  To date, there have been [ADDRESS_324685] subjects with chronic GI symptoms do not undergo endoscopy and biopsy.  For example, in ARC001 and ARC002, 18% of subjects (n=6 of 55) discontinued treatment due to GI AEs, but only one of 
these [ADDRESS_324686] EoE.  In all 6 cases, symptoms 
resolved within days to weeks after discontinuing therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Decreased Vigilance  
There may be a risk that subjects may decrease their vigilance against accidental peanut 
ingestion during participation in the study because they believe they are protected from it.  This phenomenon has been reported in previous studies, and subj ects in the study and their 
participating family will be warned that they should continue to practice their usual vigilance against accidental ingestion of peanuts or peanut-containing foods.

20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 17 of 73 
1.4.2 Benefits  
There is no guarantee that subjects who participate i n this study will benefit  from AR101 
treatment.  Information from this study may help researchers to better understand peanut 
allergy or to develop future tests or treatments to help patients with this condition. 
1.4.3 AR101 Benefits and Risks Assessment  
Overall, A R101 produced a high rate of desensitization to a clinically meaningful level of 
peanut protein in phase 2 studies, indicating that AR101 has the potential to provide treated 
individuals the benefit of reducing the risk of severe and life- threate ning or fatal allergic 
reactions, which continues to justify the acceptable associated risk .   
Based on the sponsor’s review of all available data for AR101 OIT for peanut allergy to date, the benefit-risk profile of the product in this indication is positive.   
The AR101 investigator brochure has additional information regarding the safety profile, 
benefits, and risks of AR101.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase  3, multicenter, North American, open- label,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_266743]101 therapy in and completed the ARC007 study.  The Exit 
Visit of ARC007 study will serve as the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit  1) for this study 
(ARC011) , unless specified otherwise.  Eligibility will be determined for ARC011 after the 
written informed consent/ assent  is obtained  from the subject or parent/guardian .   
Upon successful completion of the Screening/Baseline visit, subjects will be asked to return to the clinic every 4  weeks for a total of 6 additional visits (Visits  2-7) over an approximately 
6 month timeframe .  Subjects will continue to dose with AR101 300 mg QD for the duration 
of the 6 month maintenance period unless they require  a per protocol dose reduction for 
intolerance or missed doses.  At the end of the maintenance period, subjects will undergo an Exit Visit (Visit 7) for this study.  Procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Schedule of Events Table in Appendix 1.  Eligible subjects who would like to continue treatment with AR101 following completion of the current study will be offered the opportunity to participate in the open-label safety study ARC008. 
Adverse events of interest (AEI) as described in Section 8.1.4 will be monitored and reported 
similarly to how they were monitored and reported in ARC007 (RAMSES)  study. 
3.1 Study Visits  
The visits shown in Figure 1 are briefly described in the sections that follow, and the details 
of procedures to be performed at each visit are provided in Section  7 and the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendix 1) .

3.1.1 Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1)  
The Exit Visit procedures of ARC007 will also serve as part of procedures for the 
Screening/Baseline Visit for ARC011 .  Potential eligible subjects and/or parents/guardians of 
potential eligible subjects must have signed the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics 
committee (EC) approved informed consent forms (ICF) and, when required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, 
the IRB/EC approved age-appropriate subject assent prior to undergoing any ARC011 specific study procedures.   
The Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) and Section  7.1 outline all procedures that will be 
conducted at the ARC007 Exit Visit and ARC011 Screening/Baseline visit and additionally 
delineates the procedures that will be conducted as part of the Exit Visit for ARC007 versus those that will be conducted solely as a part of the ARC011 Screening/Baseline Visit . 
3.1.2 Maintenance Period (Visits 2 -7) 
Upon successful completion of the Screening/B aseline visit, subjects will be asked to return 
to the clinic every 4  weeks (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24; Visits 2-7) for completion of the 
study procedures.  Visit  7 will mark the end of the maintenance period and is the study Exit 
Visit (see S ection  3.1.4 ).  Subjects will receive an in -clinic dose of AR101 at each clinic visit 
and will continue to dose with AR101 300 mg QD for the duration of the maintenance period unless dosage adjustment is required due to intolerance or missed doses.  The duration of the Maintenance Period is approximately 24 weeks.  For subjects that require a dose adjustment (see Section 3.1.1), the Maintenance Period may be extended to [ADDRESS_324688]

Approximately [ADDRESS_324689] will complete the 
maintenance period , and will undergo an Exit Visit (Week  24; Visit 7) at which time the final 
in-clinic dose of AR101 will be given.  Procedures to be performed at the Exit Visit are listed 
in Section  7 and in the Schedule of Events Table in Appendix  1.  Subjects who discontinue 
early due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs will have additional follow -up as per Section  [IP_ADDRESS].   
3.2 Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Aimmune internal Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will monitor the study for 
safety .  The SMC will meet at least quarterly to review the safety data generated in this 
clinical study in accordance with the SMC charter.  
3.3 Study Design Rationale  
3.3.1 AR101 Dose Regimen and Study Periods  
The dose regimen in this study is predicated on the dosing regimen successfully used in the AR101 clinical development program.  A 300 mg dose administered on a daily basis during the Maintenance Period has been incorporated into studies ARC002, ARC003, ARC004, ARC008, and ARC010 .  This dosing regimen was well tolerated in previous studies  (Vickery  
et al, 2016 ; Jones et al, 2009). 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324690] for diagnosing peanut allergy and 
assessing desensitization following OIT, this procedure is time -intensive and not without 
risk.  This study will continue to investigate the potential surrogate tests incorporated into 
study ARC007 (eg , peanut-specific and peanut component- specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), 
and peanut-specific or peanut component- specific immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG 4) as 
potential surrogate markers of response to OIT) .   
3.3.[ADDRESS_324691] ( SPT), safety , and immunologic assessments conducted in this study are 
standard procedures for desensitization studies and are those used in the Aimmune AR101 program to date.  Q uestionnaires are used for assessment of  QoL ( Section  6.5), treatment 
satisfaction ( Section  6.5), asthma control ( Section  6.4) and allergic rhinitis (Section  6.4). 
3.4 Number of Sites and Subjects  
This study is an extension of the AR101 study ARC007 (RAMSES) for subjects who received the AR101 CODIT regimen.  Investigational sites that enrolled subjects in ARC007  
will have the option to participate in this study. 
Based on the ARC007 study population, the number of subjects who are potentially eligible 
to enroll is approximately  330.  This is based on a target enrollment of 500 subj ects in 
ARC007 and a 2:1 AR101: Placebo randomization. 
3.[ADDRESS_324692] will continue in the study until 1 or more of the following events occurs:   
• The subject completes approximately 6 months of dosing according to protocol.   
• The risk/benefit profile, for the subject to continue in the study, is no longer favorable 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• The subject meets an early discontinuation criterion . 
• The investigator withdraws the subject from the study. 
• The subject withdra ws consent. 
• The sponsor discontinues development of AR101. 
• The sponsor discontinues development of AR101 in the relevant participating country. 
After on e of these events occurs, the subject will return to the clinic for the Exit Visit 
(Visit 7) or Early Discontinuation Visit.  The end of the study is defined as the last visit by [CONTACT_266790] .

5.1 Formulation, Packa ging, and Labeling 
AR101 is characterized peanut allergen in the form of peanut flour, formulated with a 
bulking agent (maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, and other excipi[INVESTIGATOR_266745]) and a flow agent and packaged in a sachet containing  [ADDRESS_324703] identification number using a 
web-based interactive response system (IXRS), di rectly at the investigational site or the 
investigational site’s pharmacy, according to site- specific institutional policies .  AR101 will 
then be distributed to each subject or parent/guardian by [CONTACT_26271].   
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 1 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.0  
20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 25 of 73 
AR101 will be stored in a secure loc ation at each study site and kept refrigerated between 
2°C and 8°C .  Study site personnel will maintain temperature logs for all refrigerators storing 
study drug for the duration of the study. 
5.[ADDRESS_324704] or held at the site for documented destruction or return to the sponsor’s designee (as instructed); dosing kits once opened cannot be used for any other dosing interval or any other subject .   
At clinic Visits [ADDRESS_324705] or parent/guardian will receive a kit of sachets to be taken at 
home .  The subject or parent/guardian will be instructed to record the sachets taken at home 
in a diary log and to bring all unused sachets back to the clinic at the ne xt visit.  The subject 
or parent/guardian will be instructed to store the dosing kit in the refrigerator at all times other than when it is removed to obtain the daily dose. 
In exceptional circumstances when a subject is unable to return to the clinic for the next 
scheduled visit (eg,  travel, holidays) and continued dosing is necessary, an additional dosing 
kit may be dispensed on a case -by-case basis after submission of a documented request and 
medical monitor approval.  One additional dosing kit may be di spensed to continue the 
current dose level if there are no safety concerns in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15971] (eg,  the dose level is tolerated, no intercurrent illnesses) and the subject will 
have access to appropriate emergency medical  services as needed.  Up -dosing is not allowed 
until the next clinic visit.   
Subjects who require down dosing will be supplied with a kit of capsules (wallet) to be taken 
at home according to their specific dose level .  Subjects will be instructed to document 
capsules taken at home using diary logs and to bring all unused capsules (wallet) back to the 
clinic at the next visit.  Instructing a subject to take a partial sachet dose is not an acceptable 
form of dose adjustment in ARC011.   
Procedures for prepa ration and administration of doses given in clinic or at home are the 
same.  Dose preparation will be completed by [CONTACT_266801] a supervising adult .  For 
in-clinic dosing, dose preparation may be performed by [CONTACT_266802]/guardian under the direct supervision of clinic staff for teaching and reinforcing 
training .  The contents of the capsules or sachets will be mixed with a vehicle food, such as 
apple sauce, yogurt, pudding, or other palatable, age -appropriate food. 
Care must be taken not to inhale the powder as this could provoke worsening of asthma or induce an allergic reaction .  AR101 may not be added to food heated above room 
temperature before consumption.  The vehicle food must be one to which the subject is not 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 1 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.0  
20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 26 of 73 
allergic .  The volume of the vehicle food should be such that the entire AR101 dose can be 
consumed in a few spoonfuls.  The AR101 dose should be consumed as promptly after 
mixing as practicable.  If not consumed within 4 hours of mixing into a vehicle, the AR101 -vehicle food mixture should be discarded and a new dose mixed prior to 
consumption.  If preparing a new dose is not feasible (eg, due to limited supply), the AR101 -vehicle food mixture may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_324706] be discarded and the process restarted with a new AR101 dose.  It is recommended that each dose of AR101 be taken at a consistent time (within a 4 -hour period) each day that the dose is to be taken.  An 
interval of ≥  [ADDRESS_324707] be followed: 
• Except for on days with in-clinic dosing, the daily home dose will be taken as part of 
a meal or heavy snack .  The subject must have other food (besides the matrix vehicle) 
in the stomach before taking the dose.   
• Dosing at the evening meal is recommended for children so the subject can be observed and supervised in the home setting by [CONTACT_29382](s)/guardian(s) for several hours after dosing.   
• Subjects are to avoid activities likely to increase allergic reactivity (eg , exercising or 
taking hot showers or baths within 3 hours after dosing).   
• Dosing should also not occur within 2 hours of bedtime.   
• If a subject has engaged in strenuous exercise before the planned dosing time, dosing must be delayed until any signs of a hypermetabolic state (eg , flushing, sweating, 
rapid breathing, and/or rapid heart rate) have abated.   
Except as may be necessary during treating an AE, it is crucial that the subject takes the doses according to their assigned schedule.  No attempt should be made to make up for a missed dose if greater than [ADDRESS_324708] is dependent on the severity of any 
symptoms that occur during in-clinic dosing ( Section 8 ).   
The occurrence of any severe symptoms that include hypoxia, hypotension, change in mental status, grade 3 severe anaphylaxis (as defined in Appendix 3), or who receives intensive 
therapy (to be determined by [CONTACT_093], but may include such interventions as IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intubation, or admission to an intensive care unit) for an allergic reaction 
anytime must be discussed with the medical monitor, and the subject may need to discontinue dosing in the study ( Section 4.4.1).  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324709] 30 minutes after dosing with vital sign measurements 
and assessment for signs and symp toms of allergic reaction .  Postdose vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse rate ) will be measured and signs and symptoms of allergic reaction  assessed 
15 to 30 minutes postdose, and at 15 to 30 minute i ntervals thereafter if the postdose 
observation period is prolonged beyond the requisite 30 minutes. 
5.4 Dosing After Missed or Withheld Doses  
A dose can be taken up to 6 hours after the usual time of dosing.  If more than 6 hours has 
elapsed, the dose should not be taken and will be considered as missed .   
Except as may be necessary while treating an AE, it is crucial that subjects take their doses according to their assigned schedule.   
During the Maintenance Period, dosing after missed or withheld doses will occur as follows: 
• Missed 1  or 2  consecutive doses – The next dose taken will be taken at home. 
• Miss 3  or 4 doses in a row  – The next dose would be the current dose and would be 
given under supervision in the clinic.  
• Miss 5 -7 doses in a row  – The guidelines for Dose Adjustments during the 
Maintenance Period are provided in Section  3.1.3.  When 5- [ADDRESS_324710] has returned to the 300  mg dose, 
as per Table  2.  If symptoms occur, see Section  6.9.2. 
• Missed >  7 consecutive  doses or 3  consecutive days of dosing on 3 occasions in 
the period for any reason other than treatment of an AE or a dispensing error (ie, simple nonadherence)  – Dosing will be discontinued and the subject will return 
for study early discontinuation. 
• Missed >  7 but <  15 consecutive doses due to an intercurrent AE  - Refer to 
Section  3.1.3 for options for Dose Adjustments during the Maintenance Period.  All 
such cases should be discussed with the medical mon itor prior to resumption of 
dosing.   
• Missed [ADDRESS_324711] will return all unused 
sachets/capsules of AR101, and be dispensed capsules at the adjusted dose level.  Instructing a subject to take a partial sachet dose is not an acceptable form of dose adjustment in ARC011 .  Specific dose adjustment procedures are discussed further in Section s 3.1.3, 6.9.3, 
6.10, and 6.11.

5.6 Drug Accountability  
According to Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.62) and 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline, the 
investigator is required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of IP, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject-by- subject 
accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. 
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A 
drug-dispensing log wil l be kept current for each subject .  This log will contain the 
identification of each subject and the date and quantity of IP dispensed and returned. 
All records regarding the disposition of the IP will be available for review by [CONTACT_266803].  Destruction of used or unused IP can occur only after the study monitor has completed drug accountability and has given approval for destruction. 
5.[ADDRESS_324712]’s parent/guardian will record daily dosing and any reaction to 
at-home dosing and AEs occurring between clinic visits in the diary log.  AR101 doses lost 
or destroyed at home will also be recorded in the diary log.  All used and unused AR101 
sachet containers and capsule wallets should be returned to the clinic at each visit for 
reconciliation with the study diary.   
The study site personnel will provide 24-hour emergency contact [CONTACT_266804]. 
5.8 Treatment of Overdose 
Any dose of AR101 greater than the prescribed dose within a 24-hour time period will be 
considered an overdose. 
The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  The treatment should 
be based on any observed signs and symptoms. 
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should perform the following activities: 
• Contact a medical monitor as soon as possible. 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE and report as appropriate (see 
Section  8.2). 
• Record the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the source document. 
• Report the protocol deviation (see Section  13).

5.9.1 Prophylactic Medications 
Although symptomatic treatment for chronic /recurrent AEs are permitted (eg , H1 or 
H2 histamine blockers, proton pump inhibitors, or beta- adrenergic agonists), such 
medications should, in general, not be routinely started in advance of symptoms; however, exceptions can be granted on a case -by-case basis following a mandatory discussion  between 
the investigator and the medical monitor.  If started, the use of these medications should be 
minimized and then discontinued at the earliest medically appropriate opportunity.

oxygen, or steroids, as indicat ed.  Specific guidance about pharmacological and supportive 
treatments related to dosing reactions is provided in Section 6.11.   
Subjects and paren ts/guardians are likely to already have an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injector device, 
but for those who do not, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injector device will be prescribed .  The 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_266747]-injectors should be tracked by [CONTACT_266805]/guardian and resupplied as necessary .  Study staff must record in each 
subject’s medical record that the subject or parent/guardian has an unexpi[INVESTIGATOR_266748]-injection device and has been trained in its proper usage, including i njection technique .   
5.9.3 Symptomatic Treatment for Chronic and/or Recurrent Adverse Events  
Symptomatic treatment for chronic/recurrent AEs is permitted (ex cept for prohibited 
medications [ Section  5.9.5]) but should be used to supplement dose reduction, not substitute 
for it.  It is advised that an attempt to withdraw symptomatic t herapy be made prior to dose 
re-escalation .  If unsuccessful,  symptomatic therapy may be resumed and dose escalation 
may proceed with the symptomatic therapy in place.
 
5.9.4 Contraception 
Subjects undergoing OIT are at increased risk for allergic reactions and may be at increased risk for anaphylaxis.  Anaphylaxis can cau se a dangerous drop in blood pressure and uterine 
contractions ; if this were to occur during pregnancy, it could result in compromised placental 
perfusion and significant risk to the fetus.

Pregnancy is a time when the mother’s immune system undergoes complex and incompletely 
understood changes that are believed to reduce the risk of a maternal immune reaction directed against the fetus .  It is also a time when the fetus’s immune system is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  
Oral immunotherapy, at its core, entails repeated stimu lation of the immune system to affect 
changes in its makeup and function.  The effects OIT -induced changes in the immune system 
might have on the course of pregnancy or fetal development are currently unknown.  Accordingly, sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential are required to practice effective birth control for the duration of the current study.   
Investigators must ensure that all female subjects who are post menarchal are provided with 
age-appropriate counselling and information about  contraception, including adequate 
information about the use, effectiveness, and side -effects of contraceptive methods, using 
sensitivity and a  patient -centered approach, and in a private setting where possible .   
Sexually active women of childbearing potential will be required to use one of the following 
types of contraception:  
• A highly effective method of birth control, defined as one that r esults in a low failure 
rate (ie , less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as 
implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices, or a vasectomized partner . 
• An effective, double bar rier method of contraception (eg, male condom with female 
condom, cervical  cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge) .   
5.9.5 Prohibited Medications  
Use of the following medications is prohibited during the study:  
• Use of any therapeutic a ntibody or any other immunomodulatory therapy 
• Systemic corticosteroids used for longer than 3 conse cutive weeks throughout the 
study (if used, subjects must not be up- dosed during the [ADDRESS_324715] dose of 
oral steroids) 
• Oral beta- blockers  
• Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors  
• Angiotensin -receptor blockers  
• Calcium channel blockers 
• Tricyclic antidepressants.  
During the study, subjects may be at increased risk for anaphylaxis, which in severe form can result in a drop in blood pressure .  Additionally, the administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266749] a sudden rise in  blood pr essure.  For these reasons, the risks 
accompanying the use of any medication with known cardiovascular side effects must be weighed against the potential benefits of peanut OIT .  This assessment must be performed for 
any medications being taken at study entry or added during the study.  The use of medication with known cardiovascular side effects during the study is discouraged; however, if an

cardiovascular drugs included in the exclusion criteria, other classes of drugs with a high 
potential for cardiovascular side effects include antipsychotics, cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors  
(chronic use), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (chronic use), antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, and antineoplastics.  Before a drug with cardiovascular side effects is used in conjunction with OIT, the investigator should discuss its use with a medical monitor.  
It is beyond the scope of this protocol to list all immunomodulatory drugs; broadly, these include drugs to treat or prevent transplant rejection, autoimmune disease, and certain neoplasias (eg,  cyclosporine, tacrolimus, anti tumor necrosis al pha drugs, and other 
anticytokine drugs).  If an investigator contemplates the use of a potentially immunomodulatory drug during the study, the investigator should discuss this with a medical monitor.

Desensitization assessment procedures will be conducted at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1)  and recorded in the source document . 
Detailed instructions for conducting these procedures are provided in the Study Procedures Manual . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_324723]  
SPTs will be conducted at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) 
and wheal measurements recorded in the source docu ment .  SPTs will be performed using 
procedures for food allergens approved by [CONTACT_266806].  At the time that the SPT is performed, the subject must not have taken antihistamines or other medications that could interfere wi th the assessment of the SPT for an appropriate length of 
time (eg , 5 half- lives of the antihistamine that is being used or other medications in question).  
A SPT probe containing a commercial peanut allergen extract is pressed into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Positive  (histamine) and negative (saline -glycerin) controls are also utilized to establish that 
the response is not blocked and to determine if there is dermatographism, respectively.

6.4.1 Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_266752] ≥  6 years of age , obtain PEFR at approximately the same time of day for each 
assessment visit (eg, morning, afternoon) ; record the best result of 3  attempts at the time 
points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) .  If PEFR shows a clinically relevant 
reduction or clinical deterioration (eg, active wheeze on physical examination) or as 
clinically indicated on unscheduled visits, obtain spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (FEV 1); record the best result of 
3 attempts (if unable to successfully obtain, record attempts and investigator assessment).  
6.4.[ADDRESS_324724] Questionnaire (for Subjects With Known Asthma Only)  
The Asthma Control Test (ACT) or Childh ood Asthma Control Test  (C-ACT) will be 
administered only to subjects with known asthma during each visit and prior to the measurement of lung function ( Appendix 1).  Results will be recorded in the source 
document. 
The ACT ( Schatz et al, 2006) is a self -administered [ADDRESS_324725] ( Liu et al, 2007) is a [ADDRESS_324726] part, 
which has 4 questions and with a choice of 4 responses to each question.  The child should 
read and respond to each question.  If the child needs assistance with reading or 
understanding the question, the parent/guardian may help; however, only the child should 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] a response to the question .  The parent/guardian com pletes the second part, which has 
3 questions with a choice of 6 responses ranging from 0  (worse asthma) to 5  (controlled 
asthma) for each question .  The sum of all the responses to the questions provides a score that 
ranges f rom 0  (very poor control) to 27 (well-controll ed asthma) with a score of more 
than 19 indicating asthma that is well controlled.  
6.4.3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (for Subjects With Known Allergic Rhinitis Only)  
The TNSS will be administered only to subjects with known allergic rhinitis at the time 
points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  
It consists of 5  questions that address nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, sneezing, and 
difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Each question has a choice of 4  responses that range from 0 (no 
symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) .  The subject is asked to recall sympt oms over the prior

12 hours to allow calculation of the instantaneous symptom score and then to complete the 
same questions to address symptoms over the prior 2 weeks for generation of the reflective score.   
6.5 Quality of Life Assessments  
The questionnaires will be administered to subjects at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  The questionnaires should be completed at the end of the 
visit after all other visit activities are complete.  
6.5.1 Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire s and Food Allergy Independent 
Measure Questionnaires 
The Food Allergy Quality of Life (FAQLQ) questionnaires measure health -related QoL in 
patients with food allergy .  The following versions of the FAQLQ forms have been 
developed.   
• Children 8 to 12 years of age (FAQLQ -CF) ( Flokstra -de Blok et al, 2009) 
• Adolescents 13 to 17 years of age (FAQLQ -TF) ( Flokstra-de Blok et al, 2008) 
• Adults 18 years of age and older (FAQLQ- AF) ( van der Velde, 2009) 
Each subject or parent/guardian should complete the same version of the form completed in 
the ARC007 study, regardless of current age.   
The questionnaires include 4 domains common to each (allergy avoidance, dietary 
restrictions, emotional impact,  and risk of accidental exposure), and the adult form also 
includes a food a llergy related health domain .  The number of items ranges from 23 to  29.  
Each item is scored on a 7 -point scale from 0 (no impact) to 6  (extreme impact) .   
The Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) questionnaires were developed to measure construct validity of the FAQLQ.  The FAIM questionnaires consist of [ADDRESS_324727]’s perception of disease severity and their expectation of allergen exposure outcome.  The FAIM may be used within a study to check the construct validity of 
the FAQLQ and explore changes in subject and parent/guardian expectation of outcome ( van 
der Velde, 2010).  Each question is scored on a 7- point scale from  0 (low likelihood of a bad 
outcome) to 6 (extremely likely to have a bad outcome). 
6.6 Immunologic Assessments

6.7 Blood Volume  
The blood volume collected in children will not exceed the total volume allowed by [CONTACT_266808], or 5  mL/kg or a total of [ADDRESS_324728]’s participation in ARC011.  The parent s/guardian and subject, 
as appropriate, will be asked to provide informed consent and assent to participate in the se 
substudies .   
6.8.1 Blood Storage Sub study  
The additional tubes of peripheral blood are to be collected at the same time points as the routine la boratory work in ARC011 and do not require additional visits or phlebotomy.  T he 
purpose of this optional substudy is to store blood samples for possible future studies to look at markers in blood that show how the immune system responds to a food allergy  
6.8.2 Saliva Subs tudy  Design  
The primary objective is to characterize RNA expression patterns in salivary specimens 
collected from peanut -allergic subjects who participated in a study of peanut OIT and 
developed intolerable GI AEs that interfered with treatment (ie , resulted in reducing, holding, 
or discontinuing OIT dose levels).  
This is an optional substudy which is part of an ongoing collaboration with researchers at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266754] .  Samples will be obtained from ARC011 participants who 
develop chronic GI symptoms or discontinue the study due to GI symptoms .  Only subjects 
who have provi ded consent/assent for this substudy are eligible to provide saliva samples.   
Saliva samples will be obtained at the time of development of chronic GI symptoms or at the time of withdrawal and at the 6 -month time point for those subjects who withdraw from the 
study.  
This substudy will principally involve collection, shipment, and banking of saliva samples at specified time points; gene expression an alysis of selected salivary bio specimens; and 
correlation with basic biometric data (eg , peripheral blood eosinophils, clinical symptom 
reports/PEESS v2.0 scores) obtained as necessary, and clinical outcome per the ARC007 protocol .  Biochemical detection of eosinophil activation products or metabolites may also be 
possible from collected samples

6.8.3 Saliva Sample Collection and Handling  
Saliva is the principal bio specimen to be collected in this study with the aid of a 
commercially available kit designed expressly for salivary RNA research purposes.  Specific 
details for saliva collection will be provided to sites in a manual of procedures.   
Blood samples for complete blood count ( CBC), already collected in ARC011, will also be 
included in analyses relating to the s econdary objectives of this substudy. 
Biospecimens may be temporarily stored at investigational sites to facilitate batch shippi[INVESTIGATOR_266755].  All bio specimens will be packaged and transported to the investigative 
laboratory in a manner compliant with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations, as per 
standard operating procedures of the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_266756]. 
6.8.4 Saliva Sample and Data Analyses 
The planned analyses include:  
• Transcriptome analysis 
• EoE diagnostic panel comprising a 96- gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(qPCR) array  
• Profiling of local cytokine expression  
• Targeted analysis of expression of previously identified specific candidate genes 
• Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in previously identified specific 
candidate genes 
• Inflammatory pathway analysis (Ingenuity, Toppfun, or David) 
• qPCR analysis 
• Immunohistochemistry or other protein detection methods (eg , ELISA, Western blot).  
• Mass spectrometry  
• Flow cytometry  
• Quality control of the genome-wide RNA sequencing data 
• Expression filter and statistical filter  
• Clustering analysis with known clinical outcomes 
• Develop an algorithm (similar to Wen  et al, 2013 ) to quantify the oral sample 
signature [CONTACT_266825]  v2.0 
• Use a portion of the samples as a training set for machine learning, then carry out the support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the rest of the samples.  The SVM is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns. 
• Principle Component Analysis will be employed to categorize the samples globally, reduce the dimensionality for signature [CONTACT_266826], and aid the graphical presentation of the data

Additional exploratory endpoints may include qualitative and/or quantitative comparisons to 
the patterns of biomolecular and biochemical expression seen in subjects with spontaneously occurring EoE or other esophageal pathologies (historical controls).  These control  specimens 
will be obtained under separate protocols at the investigative laboratory .   
6.[ADDRESS_324729] observation whenever acute allergic symptoms associated with dosing are reported .   
The initial step in evaluating the safety and tolerability of a dose or dose level is to determine how the dose was administered and under w hat clinical circumstances (eg , intercurrent AE, 
presence of a co -factor) .  The investigator must determine the severity of the reported or 
observed dosing symptoms using his or her judgment, with the CoFAR grading system for hypersensitivity AEs as a guide ( Appendix 4) .  Once determined, the s everity of allergic 
symptoms elicited at a particular AR101 dose will define the tolerability of that AR101 dose.  In turn, the determination of tolerability will decide the course of action to be taken in response to dose -related reactions .  The location of the dose administration is also important 
in determining the next course of action, as summarized in text sections to follow and elsewhere in the protocol.  
6.9.[ADDRESS_324730] need for clinical judgment in determining the tolerability of a dose occurs when the dose elicits one or more mild allergic symptoms .  The emergence of moderate 
and/or severe symptoms indicates that the dose was not tolerated .

[1] Mild, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms lasting several days ma y be not tolerated 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
In general, the severity of an allergic reaction will correspond to the maximum severity of 
any of its symptoms as follows:  
• No symptoms : If a dose elicits no symptoms, the dose will be assessed as tolerated.  
• Mild symptoms : When dosing with AR101 elicits an acute reaction characterized by 
[CONTACT_266809] a mild symptom(s), the investigator will be req uired to assess 
whether the dose was or was not tolerated .  The determination of tolerability must be 
made based on clinical judgment .  The following are presented as guidelines for 
determining whether a dose associated with the emergence of a mild symptom  or 
symptoms was tolerated .  A dose eliciting only mild symptoms may be considered to 
be tolerated if the symptoms:  
– Are isolated to a single organ system  
– Resolve with no pharmaceutical intervention or with a single oral administration of an H1 antihistamine  
– Do not require administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
– Are not worsening in intensity or distribution over time  
– Resolve, or shows definite signs of resolving, in under 1 hour 
– Do not include objective wheezing 
Based on experience from phase [ADDRESS_324731] common potentially allergic symptoms 
to occur on a subacute, chronic, and/or recurrent basis during the phase 2 AR101 program.  If an allergic response to dosing is characterized by [CONTACT_266810] (eg , has mild symptoms occurring in 2 or more 
organ systems, requires treatment with 2  doses of antihistamine or 1 dose 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], shows progression in severity or distribution over time, is protracted in duration, or includes objective wheezing), then even though the allergic symptoms may be mild, the dose should be assessed as not tolerated .  If a dose administered at 
home is suspected to have been not tolerated, even based on mild symptoms, the subject should also return to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) for dosing under 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324732] be recorded in the source documents. 
The recurrence of a mild symptom(s) over the course of several days of home-dosing 
should suggest that the dose level is not tolerated, even if each individual occurrence of symptoms could be assessed as tolerated, on the basis of the criteria listed above.  Further explanation follows; chronic/recurrent GI symptoms a re given special 
consideration:  
– If the investigational site is notified of mild dose-related symptoms on 4 or more occasions during a single week, in the absence of an intercurrent AE (See Section  6.9.3 for dose adjustment for intercurrent AEs), the subject should be 
brought to the CRC for dosing under direct observation for assessment of the tolerability of the dose level.   
– If mild dose- related symptoms, in the absence of an intercurrent illness (See 
Section  6.9.3 for dose adjustment for intercurrent AEs), are noted on 7 or more 
occasions during a 2-week dosing interval at a given dose level that dose level should be considered not tolerated and appropriate action taken ( Section 6.10).   
– For any subject having chronic/recurrent GI symptoms, especially upper GI symptoms, investigators are advised to have a low threshold for instituting a dose reduction and/or for considering early discontinuation of affected subjects from the study even if mild, owing to the potential for EoE.  Further specific instructions for this Adverse Event of Interest can be found in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Moderate symptoms : In general, if a dose elicits moderate symptoms, the dose will 
be assessed as not tolerated .  However, there may be rare occasions when a dose 
eliciting moderate symptoms could be assessed as tolerated .  This would only be the 
case for a transient, self -limited (requiring no intervention and resolving completely) 
symptom occurring in a single organ system.  In addition, the symptom would be typi[INVESTIGATOR_266757].  Any dose associated with moderate symptoms and assessed as tolerated must  be accompanied by a brief explanation in the source documents as 
to why the dose was considered tolerated .   
• Severe symptoms: If a dose elicits severe symptoms, the dose will be assessed as not tolerated .  Whenever a dose elicits an allergic response characterized by [ADDRESS_324733] AR101 doses are 
administered at home, s ites are advised to educate subjects and families about these 
co-factors (some of which are AEs), as they may first become aware of an intercurrent AE 
that could create safety concerns.  Subjects and/or caregivers should be encouraged to hold 
the dose and call the study center for guidance if an intercurrent AE develops during the study.  Occasionally the AE may only become clinically evident after the dose has already been given.  In both cases, dose adjustments may be necessary and are discussed further 
below.   
At the investigating physician’s discretion, temporary dose reductions, ran ging from a 1- step 
decrement (ie, to the previous dose) to approximately half of the current dose level (to the 
nearest feasible available whole dose), can be instituted as part of the treatment regimen for 
an intercurrent AE .  Also, if a pattern of decreased tolerability of study product during 
menses is discerned, then a temporary dose reduction can be instituted during this time.   
As an alternative to dose reduction, AR101 may also be temporarily withheld at the 
investigator’s discretion, in response to an intercurrent AE .  In some cases (eg , when the 
intercurrent AE is clinically significant) this may be the most appropriate course of action .   
A schematic showing procedures for temporary dose reductions due to intercurrent AEs during the Maintenance Period is provided in Figure 2 ; explanator y text follows the figure.

Temporary Dose Reductions During the Maintenance Period  
• For dose reductions of ≤  4 consecutive days, whether dose re- escalation is to occur at 
home or in the CRC is at the investigator’s discretion .  If the reduction in dose is

resumed and the every 4- week visit s chedule maintained. 
• If a reduction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_324734] is to 
return to the CRC to undergo dosing under medical supervision.  At the investigator’s 
discretion, the [ADDRESS_324735]’s dose will be 
increased per Section 3.1.3 visit schedule until reaching the 300 mg target dose. 
• If a reduction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_324736]’s dose will be increased per Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_324737] is at a Dose <  300 mg  
• For dose reductions of ≤  4 consecutive days, whether dose re- escalation is to occur at 
home or in the CRC is at the investigator’s discretion .  If the reduction in dose is 
maintained for ≤  4 consecutive days, then the pre-reduction dose level may be 
resumed, with the biweekly escalation schedule kept unaltered .   
• If a reduction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_324738] is to 
return to  the CRC to undergo dosing under medical supervision.  At the investigator’s 
discretion, the pre -reduction dose level may be resumed or dosing may continue at the 
reduced dose level.  The biweekly escalation should be reset so that the subject receives ≥ 2 consecutive weeks of treatment at the dose level assigned (either the 
reduced or the pre- reduction dose level).  
• If a reduction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_324739] should continue home dosing for a minimum of 2 weeks, with his or her biweekly escalation 
schedule reset as necessary .   
Doses withheld as part of the treat ment for an AE constitute a special category of missed

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324741] is dosed in the clinic without symptoms, the action should be to continue, per 
protocol, with daily home dosing at the tolerated dose level and return to the clinic for the next scheduled visit.  However, if symptoms arise in the clinic after observed dosing, the investigator will determine whether or not the dose was tolerated (Section 6.9.2) .  The 
process algorithm for continued dosing after dose- related symptoms occur in the clinic 
depends on the study period and is described above for the Maintenance Period and is shown in Figure 2.  Dose adjustment after administration of antihistamines and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_107559]- related allergy symptoms is described in Section  6.11.   
6.11 Treatment for Dosing Reactions: Pharma cologic and Supportive Therapy  
The treatment(s) for types of reactions during the study are summarized by [CONTACT_266811]  4.  The severity of the symptoms in general governs the therapeutic 
response in accordance with standard -of-care practice.

Many mild acute allergic reactions can be transient and self -limiting, requiring no 
therapeutic intervention .  Others, however, may require treatment .  Generally, for 
mild symptoms requiring treatment, the subject should receive antihistamines .   
• Acute allergic reactions manifesting with moderate symptoms will generally require therapeutic intervention, although some, even moderate, symptoms may on rare occasion be transient and require no specific treatment .  Generally, for moderate 
symptoms requiring treatment, the subjects should receive antihistamines and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], as indicated .  If there is uncertainty as to the severity of the reaction,

7.1 Screening/Baseline Visit  
Before any unique ARC011- related procedures are performed , the investigator, or designee, 
must obtain written informed consent/assent for this study from the subject and/or  
parent/guardian (as applicable), as described in  Section 11.2.  The Screening/Baseline Visit 
may occur on the same day (or up to 3 days later) as the exit visit of ARC007 and must be 
completed within 28 days after the signing of the informed consent/assent form.  In practice,  
this means subjects and/or parents/guardian need to be provided with the informed consent /assent forms prior to their completion of the ARC007 study .  Initiation of AR101 
treatment in this study must be within 3 days after the ARC007 Exit Visit.   
The following procedures will be conducted at the Screening/Baseline Visit (ARC011) if not 
completed at the Exit Visit of ARC007 (or other visit if specified).  The Schedule of Events (Appendix 1 ) identifies the required procedures and delineates which are completed as part 
of the ARC007 Exit Visit versus those that are conducted solely for ARC011.  Certain Screening/Baseline procedures must be repeated if last completed outside the windows specified in  Appendix 1.

subjects will continue to be followed with monthly clinic visits (telephone follow-up with an investigator may substitute for in -clinic visit, at the investigator’s discretion) until the 
symptoms have resolved or are assessed to have stabilized with optimal medical management or the investigator deems them to be irreversible.  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324746]’s parent/guardian declares his or her intention  to discontinue AR101 
dosing, whether at a scheduled visit or an unscheduled visit, a blood sample should be 
collected for CBC and immunologic assessments assays.   
If a blood sample is collected at this time, the corresponding blood sample is not required at 
the Exit Visit.  
[ADDRESS_324747] during treatment with an IP  will be 
collected as an AE .  The pregnancy will be reported to the Safety Reporting Center within 
24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. 8.1.2 Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE .  A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the IP caused the 
event. 
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by [CONTACT_33249] .   
8.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 1 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.0  
20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 50 of 73 
 Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the study subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.)  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266765], but may 
jeopardize the health of th e study subject or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event .   
It is anticipated that the most likely cause of SAEs in this study will be anaphylaxis; however, not all occurrenc es of anaphylaxis are necessarily SAEs.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_324748]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylactic AEs will be considered AEI .  Anaphylaxis is defined by a number of signs and 
symptoms, alone or in combination, which occur within minutes, or up to a few hours, af ter 
exposure to a provoking agent .  It can be mild, moderate, or severe.  Most cases are mild but 
any event of anaphylaxis has the potential to become life -threatening .  The clinical criteria 
for defining anaphylaxis have been adopted for this study from the second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network ( Sampson et al, 2006 ), and are consistent 
with the rece ntly published international consensus on anaphylaxis ( Simons et al, 2011).   
The clinical criteria for suspected anaphylaxis are defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_324749] to the inclusion of being potentially life -threatening in the definition of 
anaphylaxis and how that relates to the assessment of anaphylaxis as an SAE, reference is 
made to the Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting in the ICH- E2A Tripartite 
Guideline , which states the following:  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life- threatening if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death .  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
Thus, for the reporting of anaphylaxis as an SAE, the severity of the reaction, assessed according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) system for grading the severity of anaphylactic reactions ( Muraro  et al, 2007), is also to be taken into 
account ( Section  8.2.4 and  Appendix 3).

20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 51 of 73 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal AEs Resulting in Prolonged Disruption of Dosing  
GI AEs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650]/recurrent GI AEs, that result in a prolonged disruption of dosing 
will also be considered AEIs and will be assessed longitudinally according to the procedures 
described below.  EoE presents with varied symptoms of esophageal dysfunction that differ between children and adults ( Dellon, 2011; Dellon et al, 2013 ).  In children, the symptoms 
are often nonspecific and may include feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, abdominal pain, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting.  In adults, the most frequent symptoms are dysphagia and food impaction; less frequent symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  Special attention should be paid to these symptoms, which may suggest esophageal dysfunction, particularly when the symptoms are new in onset during the study, chronic or recurrent, or experienced as a complex of multiple symptoms.   
To delineate these AEIs, prolonged disruption of dosing is defined as withholding AR101 for 
> 7 days.  This will include 2  categories of subjects:  
• Any subject whose dose is withheld for > 7 days due to GI AEs and resumes dosing 
at a reduced dose level  
• Any subject who permanently discontinues dosing who had experienced GI AEs  
Subjects who fall into any of these 2 categories will be asked to fill out the PEESS v2.0 questionnaire ( Franciosi et al, 2011 ), with the assistance of a parent/guardian, as approp riate, 
at the point of treatment discontinuation and then every month for [ADDRESS_324750] the clinician in the monitoring of GI symptoms.   
Subjects who discontinue dosing prematurely due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs will be 
requested to return to the clinic for evaluation monthly for at least 6  months (if the subject is 
asymptomatic, telephone follow-up with a physician investigator may substitute for in- clinic 
visit, at the  investigator’s discretion) .  If chronic/recurrent GI AEs persist beyond [ADDRESS_324751] with chronic/recurrent GI AEs has not experienced complete resolution of 
symptoms within [ADDRESS_324752] should be referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist.  
If a subject who discontinued dosing with the IP prematurely due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs is unable to discontinue the use of symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_266766] (eg , H1 or H2  histamine blockers or proton pump inhibitors) by [ADDRESS_324753] should be referred to a (pediatric) 
gastroenterologist.  
As is the case for any AE occurring during the study, for chronic/recurrent GI AEs the investigator may  use discretion  anytime to  request consultation from an outside physician or 
additional testing to assist in the diagnosis or management of the AE. 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324754]’s medical 
notes.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Accidental and Nonaccidental Food Allergen Exposures 
An accidental food allergen exposure is any known or suspected exposure to a food to which 
the subject i s allergic, including peanut, whether or not it results in an AE.  A nonaccidental 
food allergen exposure is an intentional exposure to a food to which the subject is allergic, including peanut, whether or not it results in an AE.   
Subjects will record accidental or nonaccidental food allergen exposures in the daily dosing 
diary .   
Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_266816], even if it does not cause symptoms.  The subject 
may be asked to return to the site for further evaluation.  These events will be reported as follows: 
• The nonserious AEI form will be completed for each of these events, in addition to events where consumption of peanut without a reaction occurs, unless :  
• The accidental /nonaccidental food ingestion safety event meets the definition of an 
SAE, as defined in Section  8.1.3, in which case the SAE form will be completed.  
If an accidental /nonaccidental food allergen exposure does not result in an AE, no assessment 
of severity, seriousness, or relatedness is required.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Featuring a Severe Symptom  
Any AE meeting the criteria for severe as defined in Section  8.2.4 will be reported as an AEI.  
The severity of symptoms will be determined on the basis of the investigator’s judgment.  Seve rity definitions for allergic reactions to IP were developed to be consistent with the 
CoFAR grading system and are provided in Appendix 4.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Associated With Use of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_266767].  Upon awareness of such an event, site staff will report it within 24  hours using the AEI form, independent of severity or relatedness, or 
whether it was administered in the CRC or at home .  If the epi[INVESTIGATOR_266768], an accidental /nonaccidental food allergen 
exposure, an AE featuring a severe symptom, or an SAE, the use need not be reported separately .  The intent of this AEI is to capture events that may be occurring that do not fall 
into one of these other categories. 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 [ADDRESS_324755] result usually warrants reporting as an AE in the following situations: 
• The test result is associated with clinical symptoms or signs and/or;  
• The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
and/or; 
• The test result leads to a change in dosing or discontinuation of study treatment. 
8.2 Adverse Event Monitoring and Recording  
8.2.1 Monitoring Procedures  
All AEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the ICF through the Exit or Early Discontinuation Visit or until resolution or stabilization of all AEs ongoing at the time dosing is stopped, whichever is later .   
The investigator will treat subjects experiencing AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes.  
Any new event or experience that was not present at Screening/Baseline or worsening of an event present at Screening/Baseline will be reported as an AE .  Unchanged, chronic 
conditions are not AEs and should not be recorded on the AE form of the eCRF .   
Each subject will be provided a diary log to record any AEs between study visits.  Additionally, AEs may be discovered through any of the following methods: 
• Observing the subject 
• Questioning the subject, which should be done in an objective manner 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject 
• Review of medical records/medical notes  
SPT reactions are not considered an AE unless the reaction, or a complication from the procedure, is considered an SAE , as defined in Section  8.1.3.  
8.2.2 Recording Procedures  
All AEs will be recorded in the source documents from the time of signing of the ICF through the Exit Visit or Early Discontinuation Visit.  Recording of these AEs into the eCRF 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  AR10 1 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.0  
20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 54 of 73 
is described in the eCRF completion guidelines.  In addition, SAE and AEI will be entered in 
a respective AE Pharmacovigilance Form as detailed in the AE Form completion guidelines.  
Completion of the appropriate AE Form i s summarized in  Table  6 below. 
Any event that meets the definition of an SAE ( Section 8.1.3) will also be reported to the 
Study Safety Reporting Center using an SAE report form as described in Section 8.3 in 
addition to completing the AE form.  SAE follow -up reports should include, as applicable, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266769], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], clinical notes, resolution date, 
treatment, and any other pertinent information regarding the event .  Reporting should not be 
delayed in order to provide these documents.  In the event of a death, other supporting data (eg, death certificate, medical notes) should be included .  Source documents , with subject 
identifiers redacted, can be scanned and attached to the AE form as well .

8.2.4 Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will assign severity grades to AEs.  Depending on the type of AE, the 
following severity grading systems will be used in this study:  
• The severity of anaphylactic reactions will be graded according to the EAACI system for grading the severity of anaphylactic reactions ( Appendix 3 ).   
• The severity of allergic reactions will be graded according to the definitions developed by [CONTACT_266817] ( Appendix 4).   
• The severity of all other AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI- CTCAE) system .  
The purpose of using the NCI-CTCAE system is to provide standard language to describe AEs (“toxicities”) and to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data and for assessment of the clinical significance of treatm ent-related toxicities .  The 
NCI-CTCAE provides a term and a grade that closely describes the AE .  Each

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causalit y (Relatedness)  
The investigator will use the following criteria when assessing causality of an AE to IP:  
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event.  
Not Related  There is NOT a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event .  Adverse 
events assessed as not related will require an assessment of alternative causality.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_324757] treated by [CONTACT_266818] a suspected causal relationship to the I P that occurs after the end 
of the study, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report it to the sponsor.  
SAEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF .  The site will also report an SAE to the Safety 
Reporting Center within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event using an SAE report form .  The following attributes will be included in an SAE report:  
• Description  
• Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported)  
• Severity  
• Assessment of relatedness to test article  
• Action taken  
The investigator will apply clinical judgment to determine whether an AE is of sufficient severity to require that the subject be removed from treatment .  If necessary, an investigator 
will suspend any study procedures and institute the necessary medical therapy to protect a subject from any immediate danger.  
Subsequent review by [CONTACT_12721] , the SMC, IRBs/ECs, or the sponsor may 
suspend further trial treatment or procedures at a site .  The study sponsor and the regulatory 
authorities retain the authority to suspend a dditional enrollment and treatments for the entire 
study as applicable.  
8.[ADDRESS_324758] be 
reported to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis.  The final decision for disposition 
regarding expedited reporting to the regulato ry authorities rests with a medical monitor.  The 
sponsor will provide the Safety Reporting Center with copi[INVESTIGATOR_266774] . 
The sponsor will expedite the reporting to all concerned investigator(s), IRBs/ ECs, where 
required, and to the national regulatory authorities of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) in accordance with ICH E6 5.16.2 and 5.17.1.  In addition, such 
expedited reports will comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and with the 
ICH E2A Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6 5.17.2. 
The Safety Reporting Center will provide these expedited reports to each investigator.  SAEs 
that are deemed  related to IP and are unexpected will be reported to regulatory authorities 
within 15 days or for deaths and life-threatening events within 7 days (in accordance with applicable regulatory reporting requirements).  
The sponsor will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic reports, 
as required by [CONTACT_266819] E6 5.17.3 and ICH E2F.    
8.4.3 Notifying the Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Safety Reporting Center will pr ovide the SMC ( Section 8.2.3) with listings of all SAEs 
on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, the SMC will be informed of expedited SAE reports.  The SMC will send periodic reports on the overall safety of the ongoing study and recommendations regarding continuation, and investigators will forward to the IRBs/ECs if required. 
Sites will report epi[INVESTIGATOR_266775] 24 hours of the sites being notified of the 
event to the Safety Reporting Center for forwarding to the SMC if the event is associated 
with any of the following: 
• An ER visit  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Three or more doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776] 
• Assessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in  Appendix 3.  An initial

parent/guardian to allow for an informed decision about par ticipation in the study.  An 
age-appropriate assent form will also be provided to each prospective pediatric subject for 
review .   
The subject and/or parent/guardian will be allowed as  much time as needed to review the 
document(s) and consider participation in the study.  The investigator , or designee, will 
review the consent/assent, answer any questions, and emphasize the need to avoid allergen exposure other than IP and the necessity to continue IP dosing to maintain desensitization.  The prospective subject and/or pediatric subject’s parent/guardian will be told that being in the study is voluntary and that the subject may withdraw from the study any time and for any reason .  Adult su bjects and parents/guardians of pediatric subjects will each sign the ICF, and 
pediatric subjects will each sign the assent form, as required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC .  Where required, 
both parents will sign the consent form before a child can be enrolled in the study.  The subject or subject’s parent/guardian must be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and assent form, if used .  Written informed consent and assent must be obtained before any 
study- related procedure is performed.

20 Aug 2018  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  Page 61 of 73 
Informed consent/assent materials will be translated into appropriate languages for subjects 
and parents/guardians who do not speak or read English.  The informed consent/assent form 
will be evaluated for revision whenever the protocol is amended or new safety information becomes available.  
11.[ADDRESS_324764]’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each subject will be assigned a sequential identification number, and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report subject information.   
11.4 Study Monitoring  
Before the start of the study, the sponsor’s monitor will meet with the investigator and appropriate investigational site staff for training on the protocol requirements and procedures.  
Throughout the course of the study, the sponsor’s monitor will conduct site visits to verify that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected; the reported study data are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from medical notes; and that the conduct of the study i s in 
compliance with the currently approved protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory and legal requirements.  
11.[ADDRESS_324765], although every effort should be made to discuss this with the s ponsor’s m edical m onitor beforehand.  
Protocol deviations must be clearly documented including the reasons  for the deviations .  
The principal i nvestigator is responsible for reporting protocol deviations in accordance with 
their local IRBs/ECs requirements .  Where protocol deviations lead to the protocol being 
amended, the amended protocol will be submitted to the relevant IRB/EC and regulatory authorities for review, as appropriate. 
13.1 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations  
The study site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_266780], document, and report 
protocol deviations and appropriate corrective and preventive action plans; however, protocol 
deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study conduct review .   
All protocol deviations will be reported in accordance with the protocol deviation plan.

Appendix  2: Criteria for Suspected Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis  
Criteria for Suspected Diagnosis (adapted from Sampson et al, 2006) 
Anaphylaxis is likely when any 1 of the 3 following sets of criteria is fulfilled: 
  Acute onset of an  illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of:  
• Skin/mucosal tissue ( eg, generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
AND  
• Airway compromise ( eg, dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced

• Reduced BP or associated  symptoms ( eg, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
 Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80909] (minutes to 
hours): 
• Skin/mucosal tissue ( eg, generalized  hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) 
• Airway compromise ( eg, dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEFR)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg , hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
• Persistent  GI symptoms ( eg, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain) 
 Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours): 
• Infants and children: low systolic BP (age -specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP* 
• Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline 
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than (70 mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years; and < 90 mmHg from age 11 to 17 years.  
Note: Isolated skin or mucosal lesions following the ingestion of a food constitute a food- induced allergic reaction.

Appendix  3: Criteria for Anaphylaxis Seve rity Grading  
Criteria for Anaphylaxis Severity Grading ( Muraro et al, 2007) 
Staging System of Severity of Anaphylaxis  
Stage  Defined by  
1.  Mild (skin and subcutaneous tissues, 
GI, and/or mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_696])  Flushing, urticaria, periorbital, or facial angioedema; mild 
dyspnea, wheeze, or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; mild 
abdominal pain and/or emesis  
2.  Moderate  (mild symptoms + features 
suggesting moderate respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular or GI symptoms)  Marked dysphagia, hoarseness, and/or stridor; shortne ss of 
breath, wheezing and retractions; crampy abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting, and/or diarrhea; and/or mild dizziness  
3.  Severe  (hypoxia, hypotension, or 
neurological compromise)  Cyanosis or SpO 2 ≤ 92% at any stage; hypotension; 
confusion; collapse; loss of consciousness; or incontinence  
 
For an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266781], the sponsor advises that the event 
satisfies one of the outcome-based definitions of SAE specified in Section 8.1.3 of the protocol, with the stipulations (denoted in italics ) indicated .  These stipulations follow from, 
and are consistent with, the criteria for reporting to the internal SMC (Section 8.3):  
 Death – No further stipulation. 
 Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the stud y subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.): For anaphylaxis to be considered life- threatening, it should be assessed to have been 
severe, and of a Grade 4 allergic reaction, as defined  in 
Appendix 4.  Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266782], as, for example, might be implemented to watch for a delayed or biphasic reaction. 
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions: No furthe r stipulation . 
 Congenital abnormality or birth defect: No further stipulation . 
 Important medical event that may not result in [ADDRESS_324774] or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in the above definition an SAE: 
• In general, for an anaphylactic epi[INVESTIGATOR_266783], it should have resulted in an ER visit, and the ER visit should have been associa ted with intensive therapy.  What constitutes intensive 
therapy is to be determined by [CONTACT_093], but may include such interventions as IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intubation, or admission to an intensive care unit. 
• One or 2 intramuscular injections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266784]. 
• If an investigator assesses an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266785], Inc.  AR101 ARC011 Protocol Amend 2.[ADDRESS_324775] be explained in detail in the narrative of 
the event.

Appendix  4: Allergic Reaction Severity Grading  
The CoFAR grading system ( Burks et al, 2012 ) for allergic reactions  is displayed in the table.   
Grade 1  
Mild  Grade 2  
Moderate  Grade 3  
Severe  Grade 4  
Life-Threatening  Grade 5 
Death  
Tran sient or mild 
discomforts 
(< 48 hours), no or 
minimal  medical 
intervention/ therapy required .  These 
symptoms may include pruritus, swelling or rash, 
abdominal 
discomfort, or other 
transient symptoms.  Symptoms that 
produce mild to 
moderate limitation in activity, some 
assistance may be 
needed; no or 
minimal 
intervention/therapy is required .  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594] .  These 
symptoms may 
include persistent 
hives, wheezing without dyspnea, 
abdominal 
discomfort/ increased vomiting, or other symptoms  Marked limitation in 
activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy 
required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107550] .  Symptoms 
may include 
bronchospasm with 
dyspne a, severe 
abdominal pain, 
throat tightness with 
hoarseness, transient hypotension among 
others .  Parenteral 
medication(s) are 
usually indicated.  Extreme limitation 
in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant 
medical/ therapy .  
Intervention is  
required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266786] .  
Symptoms may 
include persistent 
hypotension and/or 
hypoxia with resultant decreased 
level of 
consciousness associated with 
collapse and/or 
incontinence or other life -threatening 
symptoms.  Death  
 
Specific symptoms that are generally consistent with this severity grading scheme are 
provided below as illustrative examples: 
• Mild symptoms: 
– Skin – limited (few) or localized hives, swelling (eg , mild lip edema), skin 
flushing ( eg, few areas of faint erythem a), or pruritus (eg, causing mild occasional 
scratching)  
– Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – rhinorrhea ( eg, occasional sniffling or sneezing), nasal congestion, 
occasional cough, throat discomfort  
– GI – mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nausea), minor vomiting 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), and/or a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] 
• Moderate symptoms:  
– Skin – systemic hives ( eg, numerous or widespread hives), swelling 
(eg, significant lip or face edema), pruritus causing protracted scratching, more than a few areas of er ythema, or pronounced erythema  
– Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing 
without dyspnea

– GI – persistent moderate abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/nausea, more than a single 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_266787]/or diarrhea 
• Severe symptoms:  
– Skin – severe generalized urticaria/angioedema/erythema  
– Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – laryngeal edema, throat tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with 
dyspnea, stridor  
– GI – severe abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/repetitive vomiting and/or diarrhea  
– Neurological – change in menta l status  
– Circulatory – clinically significant hypotension ( Appendix 2) .

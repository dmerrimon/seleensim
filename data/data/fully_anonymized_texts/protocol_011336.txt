Title:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_613] a Novel Optical Surface Image Guidance System for 
Beam -Gated Online  Adaptive SBRT Delivery in Mobile Lower 
Lung and Upper Abdominal Malignancies  
Study Description:  Motion during radiation therapy can be categorized as inter -fraction 
(changes in anatomy that occur between treatment days) and intra -
fraction (changes that o ccur during the “beam on” window of 
treatment delivery).  Inter- fraction motion is managed by [CONTACT_640036] (ART ), the process of making changes in the treatment 
plan while the patient remains on the treatment table. This is now a 
standard -of-care therapy within our clinic . Intra -fraction motion is 
managed by [CONTACT_640037]- gated delivery techniques.  Varian 
Medical Systems has integrated the necessary components into a CT -
guided radiotherapy device (ETHOS).  In the ETHOS, Varian has built a device t hat integrates on -
board cone beam CT imaging 
capable of delineating target and organ- at-risk positions and a 
dedicated artificial intelligence -driven treatment planning system for 
inter- fraction motion management as well as a paired optical surface 
image g uidance system for intra -fraction motion management.  
Although online ART is a standard -of-care practice in our clinic and 
has previously been shown to be feasible, use of surface-guidance for intra -fraction gating of abdominal and thoracic SBRT  on ETHOS 
is novel. 
 
Therefore, in this study, we propose to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using a novel surface guidance beam -
gating system, 
incorporated with a CBCT -guided adaptive radiotherapy platform, to 
manage respi[INVESTIGATOR_640001] -guided stereotactic 
radiotherapy .  To best assess the utility of this technology to manage 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947], we will focus on disease sites that are highly 
affected by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_64947]: upper abdominal or lower thoracic 
malignancies.  
Objectives:  Primary  Objective : 
To demonstrate that surface guided, breath -hold respi[INVESTIGATOR_640002] -guided stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (CT -
STAR) is feasible in the abdomen and lower thorax by [CONTACT_640038] 75% 
of scheduled treatment fractions using a novel surface guidance 
system.  
 
Exploratory Objectives: 
1. Determine geometric agreement between breath -hold 
positioning as determined by a novel surface guidance system 
vs. concomitant breath -hold CBCT image sets.

6. Identify patient and or treatment factors that maximize the 
potential efficacy of surface guided breath -hold respi[INVESTIGATOR_640003].  
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint : 
Percentage of scheduled treatment fractions delivered successfully 
using the surface guidance system.  Success will be defined as 
delivery of a given treatment fractio n in one on -table attempt, 
without requiring use of a secondary (backup) motion management system, or alternative treatment machine. Unsuccessful delivery of a 
fraction will be defined as multiple attempts for gating without 
reproducible positioning, breat h-hold, and/or surface guidance 
feedback, such that the fraction is abandoned. 
 
Exploratory  Endpoints: 
1. Geometric agreement between breath -hold positioning as 
determined by a novel surface gu idance system compared 
with standard of care concomitant breath -hold CBCT image 
sets, as evaluated by [CONTACT_640039] 
(ASSD), modified Hausdorff distance (MHD), and Dice 
similarity coefficient measurements.  
2. Qualitative evaluation of  the compatibility of a standard -of-
care respi[INVESTIGATOR_640004] -
guidance system for concomitant use.  
3. Quantitative and qualitative  measurement of minimum 
planning target volume (PTV) margins and planning organ-at-risk volumes to be subsequently utilized with th
e novel 
surface guidance system as determined through measurement evaluations in exploratory endpoint 1. 
4. Local, in -field control rate  at three months post -treatment 
will be determined as part of standard-of- care clinical 
evaluation by [CONTACT_172276], using RECIST criteria.

Description of Sites / 
Facilities Enrolling:  This study will be open at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington 
University School of Medicine.  
Description of Stud y 
Intervention:  The Varian ETHOS is a ring -gantry CT -guided radiotherapy unit.  It 
pairs a linear accelerator within a ring -gantry imaging unit.  It has  an 
on-board cone beam CT imaging unit capable of delineating target 
and organ -at-risk position and a dedicated AI -driven treatment 
planning system to enable online adaptive radiotherapy. Recently,  it 
has also been  paired with an optical surface image guidance system 
(the Identify OSIG) which relies upon a time -of-flight, ceiling 
mounted, stereo camera syst em a nd a random pattern projector. A 
random light pattern is projected onto the patient’s surface, the 
reflection of which is captured by [CONTACT_640040] a 3D point cloud based on corresponding points identified acro ss the camera set.  A surface region of interest 
is selected and then monitored for motion or deformation. This has 
been utilized previously for surface -based radiation delivery, such as 
for breast cancer, but has not previously been utilized to guided 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for internal thoracic or 
abdominal targets as part of the Varian ETHOS treatment platform. 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/Phase I study, the feasibility and safety of using the 
Identify OSIG system to guide delivery of thoracic and abdomi nal 
SBRT will be evaluated.  
 
Consenting and eligible patients will be treated using SBRT in five fractions over one to two weeks.  For patients undergoing optional plan adaptation, adaptation will be based on daily anatomic changes as per standard of care.   For both adaptive and non -adaptive patients, 
the prescription dose will be determined based on normal tissue 
constraints a nd capped at [ADDRESS_856457] 
institutional practice.  
Study Duration:  12 months (enrollment) + 2 weeks (treatment) + 3 months (follow -
up) + 12 months (analysis)  = 28 months  
Participant Duration:  4 months

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 SBRT for tumor ablation 
 
Within the realm of radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a means to focally  target  and ablate both primary and metastatic cancers 
1. This technique  
involves delivery of numerous , individually weak radiation beam s to converge on a focal 
target for delivery of a highly precise, conformal, and ablative dose in five or fewer treatment fractions. The dose per fraction is substantially higher than that used in conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, where treatment fields tend  to be larger , may 
overlap with normal tissues,  and are treated in small amounts of radiation per day over 
multiple (usually 5 or more) weeks of therapy. The high dose per day used for SBRT --
unthinkable in the prior era —is enabled by [CONTACT_640041] -guidance technology that allows safe, accurate, and precise treatment delivery. 
Compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, SBRT has been shown to improve overall survival outcomes in early stage non- small cell l ung cancer
[ADDRESS_856458] systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_640005], focal disease ablation with SBRT also improves overall survival in oligometastatic cancer s of multiple 
histologies  
5-7.  
 The e fficacy of SBRT in producing durable disease control and survival benefit is 
predicated on delivery of sufficiently ablative dose . Dose escalation, particularly to dose 
threshold s achieving a biologically effective dose (BED) of 100Gy or more, has been 
demonstrated to improve local control and survival outcomes across histologies 
8-10. 
Delivery of such high dose treatment depends on focal target delineation and rapid radiation dose fall off to avoid excess dose to surrounding norma l tissues. Excess dose to 
adjacent critical structures erodes the therapeutic gain of SBRT over conventional fractionation and can result in high grade toxicity and even mortality risk 
11. Thus, precise 
SBRT delivery and minimized dose to surrounding organs -at-risk (OARs) is critical. This 
balance of the therapeutic index is particularly challenging in treatment sites subject to motion, especially when critical structures are proximal to the tumor. Indeeed, in such cases, adequate treatment of the tumor with necessary margins to account for its possible locations in a four-dimensional (4D) space can then compete with the space occupi[INVESTIGATOR_640006].  
 
1.2 SBRT Considerations for Mobile Tumors  
 
Motion during radiation therapy can be broadly categorized as being inter-fraction or  intra-
fraction . Inter -fraction motion comprises less -predictable  changes in anatomy that occur in 
between treatment days, such as normal  organ motion from peristalsis (e.g., bowel 
peristalsis) or organ filling (bladder, stomach, rectum) , or changes like tumor shrinking 
response to treatment. Intra -fraction motion refers to the motion occurring during the  
“beam on” window of treatment delivery. Predictable motion from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_640007] a dominant contributor to intra -fraction motion during SBRT to thoracic and abdominal 
Protocol Version:  10/14/[ADDRESS_856459], a  plan library approach attempts to address more dynamic (but still 
predictable) motion like organ filling. It involves creation of  several  plan choices for a 
single patient, so that depending on the “anatomy of the day”, the best -matching plan is 
crudely selected  for delivery. This is best described in pelvic radiotherapy to mitigate  the 
impact of bladder filling changes  on target coverage and OAR sparing 13,14. However, 
neither offline nor plan library adaptive approaches permit flexible real- time adjustment of 
treatment plans and neither accounts for unpredictable m otions, like peristalsis.  
 Online ART is well -suited to account for both unpredictable and predictable types of inter -
fraction motion. Online ART defined as the process of making daily changes in the 
radiation therapy treatment plan in response to observed changes in daily anatomy, while 
the patient remains on the treatment table. Our institution was the first in the world to 
clinically implement this technique for SBRT in 2014, using advanced image -guidance 
with magnetic resonance imaging 
15,16. In the setting of SBRT, this  allows the treating 
physician to account for  and respond to inter-fraction organ motion and tumor changes  to 
maximize tumor dose while minimizing dose to normal tissue . This imp roves the precision 
and accuracy of SBRT delivery and widens the therapeutic index. Specifically, o ur 
institution and others have shown improvement in the dosimetric therapeutic index of SBRT using online ART for upper abdominal 
16, thoracic  17, and pelvic disease sites 18. 
This has translated into prospectively and retrospectively validated reduction in treatment -
related toxicities and is associated with improvement in local control and survival outcomes 
4,18,19.  
 Efficient delivery of online ART requires three key components: 1. on- table imaging 
sufficient to delineate the target and organs -at-risk, 2. a dedicated treatment planning 
system (TPS) for rapid on -table treatment plan generation and comparison, and 3. re al-time 
quality assurance of adaptive plans prior to treatment delivery 
20. While online ART can 
be achieved by [CONTACT_640042] -resonance image- guided systems [ADDRESS_856460] -
guided radiotherapy device (ETHOS, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) on a widely 
Protocol Version:  10/14/[ADDRESS_856461] from organs -at-risk, the full positional range of the tumor (the “internal target 
volume”, or ITV) can be determined using 4- dimensional CT planning images. In 
this common approach for  upper and middle  lung lesions, 4DCT at time of 
simulation simultaneously acquires spatial and temporal information on mobility 
and shape of a tumor. From this, reconstructed imaging data can be binned according to respir atory phase and used to generate the ITV according to imaging 
reconstructions like the maximum intensity projection (MIP) or average intensity 
projection (AIP), with further editing to ensure the tumor is fully encompassed by 
[CONTACT_640043] 
23,24. Physical interventio ns like use of abdominal 
compression plates can be complementarily used to limit ITV size by [CONTACT_640044][INVESTIGATOR_640008] 50% 25. Nevertheless, in such sites, one  still accepts that the ITV 
motion envelope expands the ablation target into low -risk normal tissues, like 
normal surrounding lung parenchyma, in order to capture the full extent of tumor location during delivery. 
 
1.4.2 Gated Delivery Techniques 
 
In sites where respi[INVESTIGATOR_640009] , such as in the lower lobes of 
the lung or the upper abdomen, gated treatment delivery may be utilized in stead in  
order to avoid excessive intentional treatment of normal tissues. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_640010] -
gating comprises turning the treatment beam on and off as the tumor moves in and out of the radiation beam path with respi[INVESTIGATOR_640011]. This may 
be phase (e.g. end-exha le breath -hold) or amplitude based or be triggered based on 
implanted internal fiducial marker tracking. In lung patients, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_640012] a measured tumor 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_640013] >1cm despi[INVESTIGATOR_640014]  (PACIFIC- 4 protocol)  TG 101. In the 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 12 of 39 abdomen, where surrounding tissues are  at higher injury risk , e.g., the duodenum 
relative to the pancreas 26, and/or the 4D motion envelope of a tumor may have ill-
defined margins, gated delivery of SBRT is a common approach 27-29. 
  
Gated delivery of SBRT requires real -time monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_640015], most 
often using surrogates for the tumor motion. This can be accomplished using 
several technologies. One standard technique is real -time position management 
(RPM), with an infrared camera system mounted in the treatment room that monitors the movement of a reflective surrogate external marker block placed on 
the patient’ s abdomen or chest  
30. A respi[INVESTIGATOR_640016]. However, use of a single external marker 
box alone to capture motion in a single plane may not robustly account for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_640017] ~5mm in the SI plane31. RPM  can be used in combina tion with periodic triggered 
intra-fraction  imaging visualization of the tumor or internally placed fiducial 
markers to verify consistent correlation between the tumor and surrogate motion 
and improve accuracy , although an additional 2- 3mm of uncertainty m ay remain 
31,32. While more robust, fiducial placement and monitoring or even fiducial 
tracking -based deliveries are expensive, require an invasive procedure for fiducial 
implantation, lead to delays in initiation of treatment for marker placement and settling before simulation 
28, and expose the patient to protracted treatment times [ADDRESS_856462] a pattern of light onto the patient ’s sur face and 2-3 optical 
cameras to generate and then track the motion of a 3- dimensional map of patient 
topography. Compared with techniques like RPM, monitoring of multiple surface 
points instead of a single surrogate marker improves accuracy of motion monit oring 
35. Surface guidance motion monitoring has been shown to be accurate to 1mm 
motion/1degree of rotation in the delivery of intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery  
36. It is al so used t o enable deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_114555] (DIBH) gating in focal 
radiotherapy treatments like accelerate partial breast radiotherapy (APBI)  to within 
2mm of setup accuracy 37. Recently, it has been implemented for monitoring of 
internal target motion for lung and upper abdomen SBRT, and shown to accurately reflect  internal anatomic shifts of 2mm or more co mpared to repeat cone beam CT 
alignment 
[ADDRESS_856463] -guided radiothera py device. Varian Medical 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 13 of 39 Systems (Palo Alto, CA) has produced a unique ring- gantry CT -guided radiotherapy unit, 
pairing a linear accelerator within a ring -gantry imaging unit. In addition to housing an on-
board cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging unit capable of delineating target and OAR positions  
39 and dedicated artificial- intelligence (AI) -driven TPS  to enable online adaptive 
radiotherap y, this system also has a paired optical surface image guidance system for intra-
fraction motion management. Our institution is among the first in the world to use this 
device for standard of care patient treatment, having completed commissioning and testing 
of treatment plann ing software, dose delivery, and imaging technology. Its online adaptive 
radiotherapy capabilities (for inter -fraction motion management) have already been 
established in non- mobile sites. Similarly, the paired Identify OSIG system has been 
evaluated for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy treatment. However, the OSIG 
system has yet to be prospectively evaluated for beam -gating specifically during SBRT. 
 
1.6 Identify  Surface Guidance  system  
 The Identify system relies upon a time -of-flight, ceiling mounted, stereo camera system 
and a random pattern projector. A random light pattern is projected onto the patient’s surface (e.g., abdominal or thoracic wall), the reflection of which is then captured by [CONTACT_640045] a 3D point cloud based on corresponding points identified across the camera set. A surface region of interest (ROI) is selected and then monitored for motion or deformation. Motion of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_640018] a phase- based respi[INVESTIGATOR_640019]- off 
gating of the radiation beam at particular respi[INVESTIGATOR_399006], such as DI BH and e nd-exhale. 
 A recorded surface can be calculated at time of patient planning simulation and used for 
initial patient alignment on days of treatment, with subsequent updating of both the 
reference surface and patient alignment based on the initial daily setup verification CBCT acquired in room. This new daily surface ROI can then be monitored for intra -fraction 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_640020] t through beam -gating, with SGRT software calculation of 
differences in the patients’ actual surface vs. the daily reference surface. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_640021],  with available use of 
visual feedback  of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_640022] (through an institutional in -room 
display monitor or patient goggles) for respi[INVESTIGATOR_640023]. The patient can then be treated in a series of end -exhale or DIBH breath -holds, with optional CBCT verification of pati ent 
position at pre -set intervals during treatment.

5.1.2 Simulation Procedures/Patient Positioning  
 
All patients will undergo both CT and  CBCT  simulation  in positioning appropriate 
for the specific treatment site. When medically feasible and applicable, patients will 
be simulated with IV and small bowel contrast (for non- thorax cases).  
  
5.1.3 Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and Planning Target Volume (PTV) Definitions  
 
The treatment t arget will be defined based on the  gros s tumor volume ( GTV ) only. 
No CTV expansion will be utilized, as per standard -of-care procedures in the setting 
of SBRT. Additionally, no ITV  expansion will be utilized , as gated delivery is 
planned. The PTV will be generated at the discretion of the treating physician but should range between [ADDRESS_856475] 
constraints based on the treatment site. Dose volume histogram (DVH) information 
for the target volumes and surrounding critical structures is mandatory. This is to 
assist in interpreting outcome, including morbidity. Coverage goal will be for 95% of the volume to be covered by 95% of the dose , although in situation s where a 
critical structure is violated, reduction of dose will be allowed in areas of overlap.  
   
5.1.[ADDRESS_856476] institutional 5 -fraction organ- at-risk dose constraints will be used, at the 
discretion of the treating physician, and in concordance with the treated (abdomen 
vs. thorax) site. For those patients undergoing optional plan adaptation, on treatment days where all constraints are met, the prescription dose for that day’s treatment may be escalated up to a maxim um dose of [ADDRESS_856477] dose (to  0.5cc) will be 5 Gy 
(extrapolate to maximum dose 25 Gy over 5 fractions).

for dose adaptation if it is  determined that the patient’s anatomy allows for dose 
adaptation with acceptable sparing of normal structures (i.e., not violating the 
predetermined hard constraints  based on safety constraints that are already

established based on the daily anatomy. The reference surface will be monitored 
using the Identify system and a respi[INVESTIGATOR_640024] -hold respi[INVESTIGATOR_640025]. A visual 
feedback  system will be displayed to the patient to aid in respi[INVESTIGATOR_640026] -hold. After treatment alignment and optional adaptation, a repeat breath -
hold CBCT will be obtained to evaluate for any patient motion. Shifts can be applied as needed prior  to initiation of delivery. CBCT can be  repeated in the 
breath -hold position at set time points, e.g., after each arc in VMAT plans, and at 
the end of treatment delivery. A recommended maximum of [ADDRESS_856480]. 
 
5.2 Evaluability Guidelines  
 
All patients who receive any radiation therapy are evaluable for the primary objective 
(feasibility of delivering CT-guided S BRT  with surface- guidance for gated delivery ). 
 Patients who receive at least one fraction of radiation therapy are evaluable for the 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 19 of 39 exploratory objectives relating to tumor response/ control rate and toxicity. 
 
Success will be defined as delivery of a given treatment fraction in one on -table attempt, 
without requiring  use of a secondary (backup) motion management system, or alternative 
treatment machine.  Unsuccessful  delivery of a fraction will be  defined as multiple attempts 
for gating without reproducible positioning, breath- hold, and/or surface guidance feedback, 
such that the fraction is abandoned.  Should respi[INVESTIGATOR_640027], the treatment fraction will be delivered using an 
alternative, backup motion management device and/or an alternative linear accelerator as per standard -of-care therapy.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_856481] -completion of SBRT.  (It is 
preferred that patients do not receive systemic therapy within [ADDRESS_856482] arting and 
ending SBRT, but that is left to the discretion of the treating physician.)  
5.4 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_856483] be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  up to 
[ADDRESS_856484] ions (5 days of SBRT) or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 20 of 39 permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the pati ent’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious noncompliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from st udy 
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_856485] be taken if the participant fails  to return to clinic for a required 
study visit: 
o The study team will attempt to contact [CONTACT_640049]/or should continue in the study. 
o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 tele phone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address).  These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
o Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she  will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow- up.

Participant death due to disease progression should be reported on the Toxicity Form as grade 5 disease progression.  If death is due to an AE (e.g. cardiac disorders: cardiac arrest), report as  a grade [ADDRESS_856488] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response at [ADDRESS_856489]-completion of SBRT.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the large st diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  RECIST evaluations will be performed by [CONTACT_67926], not IRAC. 
 
9.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurab le disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_856490] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_856491] scan, or >[ADDRESS_856492] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not 
be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the  
conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_856493] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 24 of 39 they are, by [CONTACT_640051], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as n on-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
9.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_640052](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
Protocol Version:  10/14/[ADDRESS_856494] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an  MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of  a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contras t), then 
the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety  for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 
96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_856495] -line trials in 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 26 of 39 ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression oc curring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
• FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
9.4 Response Criteria  
 
9.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 27 of 39 target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
9.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesi on(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_856496] response recorded from the start of the treatment until dise ase progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

may be accepted as disea se progression. 
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
  
9.4.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR ( whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 29 of 39 (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progr ession are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_442600], >[ADDRESS_856497] 5 patients  experience symptoms of G3 
or greater toxicity that is probably or definitely attributable to and did not pre -date SBRT, 
the trial wil l be suspended. Symptoms that pre -dated SBRT will not be count towards 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (example: central thorax patients requiring oxygen prior to and after 
SBRT will not be scored as G3 toxicity, however a new O2 requirement after RT would count towards  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]). If at any time a grade 5 toxicity (death) is observed  that 
is probably or definitely attributable to treatment, accrual will be suspended and the event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458].   Since some patients accruing to th e trial 
may have metastatic disease, it is anticipated that deaths unrelated to the trial may be 
observed. Death that is felt either due to disease progression or patient comorbidity will not result in trial suspension.

malignancies by [CONTACT_640053] 
75% of scheduled treatment fractions using a novel surface guidance system.  A total of 10 
evaluable patients (as defined in Section 5.2) will be included , with five treatment fractions 
each, for a total of n = [ADDRESS_856499] based on the binomial distribution. The study will be powered based on an expected success rate of 95% and a minimum accepted rate of 75%. With 10 patients 
and 5 fractions per patient, 50 total fractions (n=50) would be assessed. In -patient 
correlation is anticipated, as surface- guided delivery is in part patient -surface dependent, 
with an anticipated value of 0.2. With a one -sided alpha of 0.25 and n=[ADDRESS_856500] a minimum of 92% power to de tect feasibility  of

adaptive radiotherapy (CT -STAR) is feasible in the abdomen and lower thorax by 
[CONTACT_640053] 75% of scheduled treatment fractions using a novel surface guidance system.  Success will be 
defined as delivery of a given treatment fraction in one on- table attempt, without requiring 
use of a secondary (backup) motion management system, or alternative treatment machine. Unsuccessful delivery of a fraction will be defined as multiple attempts f or gating without 
reproducible positioning, breath -hold, and/or surface guidance feedback, such that the 
fraction is abandoned.

11.4 Exploratory Objectives  
 
• Determine geometric agreement between breath -hold positions as determined by a 
novel surface guidance system vs. concomitant breath -hold CBCT image sets.   
Geometric agreement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_640039] 
(ASSD), modified Hausdorff distance (MHD), and Dice similarity coefficient measurements.  
• Evaluate the compatibility of a standar d-of- care respi[INVESTIGATOR_640029]- guidance system for concomitant use.   This will be evaluated qualitatively.  
• Determine the minimum safe planning target volume (PTV) and planning organ- at-risk 
volumes (PRV) to be subsequently utiliz ed with the novel surface guidance system.   
This will be determined through measurement evaluations in the first exploratory endpoint.  
• Determine the local, in -field control rate at three months post -treatment.   This will be 
determined by [CONTACT_640054].  
• Determine acute toxicity rates at three months post -treatment.   This will be assessed by 
a qualitative description of grade [ADDRESS_856502]- treatment.  
• Identify patient and or treatment factors that maximize the potential efficacy of surface 
guided breath- hold respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344].  These include factors such as surface topography 
features as well as skin tone.  This will be evaluated qualitatively.

Protocol Version:  10/14/2022  Page 36 of 39 APPENDIX B: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if,  in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
Protocol Version:  10/14/[ADDRESS_856516] 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions 
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

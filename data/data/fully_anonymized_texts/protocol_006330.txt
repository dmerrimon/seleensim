1. Abstract  
Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
There are only a few therapi[INVESTIGATOR_487625] -occlusive crisis (VOC) in people with sickle cell  
disease; stem cell transplant, chronic transfusion therapy and hydroxyurea.  Most recently L -glutamine 
has been FDA approved but it is reserved for only a small subset of people with the disease. Transplant is 
the only known cure for this disease . Its saf ety and efficacy, especially in adults, remains a concern and is 
only available to adults as a research protocol. Chronic transfusion therapy is an effective way of 
decreasing the risk of several complications of SCD including stroke and VOC events . Hydrox yurea is an 
effective disease -modifying therapy that decreases the risk of VOC by 50%. However, neither chronic 
transfusions nor hydroxyurea have been shown to decrease the intensity of chronic pain. There is a 
subset of patients who are on effective disea se modifying therapy, yet continue to have frequent acute 
visits for parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_487626].  
Buprenorphine is a partial mu -agonist an d kappa antagonist and has a very high affinity for the mu 
recepto rs, with an elimination half -life of [ADDRESS_626550] conversion to buprenorphine.  
 
 
2. Objectives  
The p urpose of this study  is to assess the safety and benefit of convert ing adults with sickle cell disease on 
high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_487627]. The primary outcome will 
be to assess the safety of the protocol. Secondary outcomes will include measures of acute care utilization 
and health related quality of life after conversion.   
Primary Endpoint : This will be a descriptive study assessing the  safety and benefit of converting subjects 
from full agonist opi[INVESTIGATOR_395761]. Data will be collected on need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 72 hours 
of conversion due to withdrawal induced VOC, as well as average COWS scores.  
Secondary Endpoint : Meas urement of quality of life , decrease  in pain measured  by [CONTACT_55817] [INVESTIGATOR_487628].   In addition we will collect data from the [ADDRESS_626551]

conversion.  
 
3. Background  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the hemoglobin that leads to severe morbidity and early 
mortality. It is the most common disease detected by [CONTACT_487650] e [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) 
[1]. Between 80,000 and 100,000 individuals in the U.S. are affected by [CONTACT_487651] [2]. African -
Americans (AA) are most affected in the U.S., as 1 per every 400 AA newborns is born with the disease. There 
are several genotypes that lead to similar phenotypes in SCD. Those who are homozygote for the sickle 
mutation (SS) have the most severe form of the disease and typi[INVESTIGATOR_487629] 60 -70% of those with sickle 
cell disease. People with SC disease are compound heterozygotes and are  considered to have a milder  
phenotype but there is a wide spectrum and chronic pain is quite prevalent in people with SC disease often 
due to avascular necrosis of the hips and shoulders. The damage SCD inflicts on sufferers is dramatic. The 
disease reduc es life expectancy by [CONTACT_3450] 30 years compared to the general population [3]. 
Furthermore, the disease limits quality of life - as severely as does end -stage renal disease requiring 
hemodialysis [4].  
The best -known complication of SCD is the vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). These acute, excruciatingly painful 
events are the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487630] [5], and can be associated 
with such lethal and disabling complications as acute chest syndrome and stroke. Triggers fo r the 
development of VOC include intravascular volume depletion, stress and infection. In addition to these acute 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_162803], the prevalence of chronic pain is very high [6], [7]. Acute and chronic pain and disease 
severity contribute to extraordinar ily high levels of unemployment, and decreased productivity in this patient 
population. Therefore, the persistent balance of pain control and quality of life remains a challenge.  
The mechanisms of chronic pain in SCD are poorly understood. A number of fac tors ranging from genetic to 
behavioral likely regulate the pain response in people with SCD and include interactions between the 
nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [8]. The role of the immune system is of particular interest in 
understanding pain due to SCD; the role of inflammation in acute painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_487631]. That ongoing inflammation may play a role in 
chronic pain is suggested by [CONTACT_487652] P, 
the neuropeptide modulator of inflammation and nociception, in SCD [9]. Additionally, chronic pain resulting 
from SCD is now hypothesized to be partly a disorder of central sensitization and peripheral neur al 
sensitization. Central sensitization is a complex phenomenon, with contributions from plasticity induced by 
[CONTACT_487653] [10] and neural changes induced by [CONTACT_487654]. To  make things more complicated, our group and others have shown 
that opi[INVESTIGATOR_487632] [11]. A fascinating 
outcome of successful, curative stem cell transplant is that almost every adult pat ient reported in the 
literature who was on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_487633] -
transplant. This phenomenon, which we have seen in our own transplant population, suggests that bone 
damage is likely a small com ponent of the chronic pain and raises even more concern that hyperalgesia 
induced by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_487634] a role in the patient experience of chronic pain.  
The current standard of care for the treatment of chronic pain in people with sickle ce ll disease is the use of 
both long and short acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. Full agonists are opi[INVESTIGATOR_487635], and cause them to produce endorphins which relieve pain [12]. The best approach to the 
treatment of chroni c pain in people with sickle cell disease is unclear and there is little literature on the 
effectiveness of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_487636]. In a recently published paper we compared 
pain symptoms in [ADDRESS_626553] a 
very high symptom burden.

Page 4 of 8 As with any persistent use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_487637], there is an increase probability of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_487638], an increased probability of aberrant opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_487639], central sensitization and refractory pain are potential long -term outcomes for many SCD 
patients on long term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], potentially leading to higher doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_487640] [11]. Therefore, there 
may be great value in reducing the use of full ag onist opi[INVESTIGATOR_487641].  
There are only three therapi[INVESTIGATOR_487625] -occlusive crisis (VOC); stem cell transplant, chronic 
transfusion therapy and hydroxyurea. Transplant is the only known cure for this disease; i ts safety and 
efficacy, especially in adults, remains a concern and is only available to adults as a research protocol. Chronic 
transfusion therapy is an effective way of decreasing the risk of several complications of SCD including stroke 
and VOC events [ 13]. Hydroxyurea is an effective disease -modifying therapy that decreases the risk of VOC by 
50%. However, neither chronic transfusions nor hydroxyurea have been shown to decrease the prevalence of 
chronic pain. There is a subset of patients who are on eff ective disease modifying therapy, yet continue to 
have frequent acute visits for parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_487626].  
Buprenorphine is classified as a partial mu -agonist and kappa antagonist and has a very high a ffinity towards 
the mu receptors, with an elimination half -life of 28 -37 hours for the sublingual administration [14]. The 
lower risk for misuse, diminished withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opi[INVESTIGATOR_487642] a subset of patients with sickle cell 
disease who are unable to wean off of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Most relevant to SCD patients on high doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], there has been recent data on successful conversion 
for patie nts with chronic pain who are on high -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], from 100mg to 400mg morphine equivalents, to 
SL buprenorphine. This study reported a decrease in pain scores after the initiation of SL buprenorphine 
therapy for more than two months [14]. Reports of seve re withdrawal requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487643]. As we have started converting patients as our standard of 
care we will collect data on patient important outcomes to document improved outcomes post conve rsion.

3 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:   Evaluation of the bioavailability of metronidazole  dermal 
products  
Population:  Healthy  adults age 18 - 45 years  
Number of Sites:  Single site: University of Maryland School of Medicine  
Study Duration:  Approximately up to [ADDRESS_384601] Participation 
Duration:  Approximately [ADDRESS_384602] : Metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], 0.75% , Prasco Laboratories ; 
Metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], 0.75% , Impax Laboratories ; 
Metronidazole topi[INVESTIGATOR_68549] , 0.75% , Fougera  Laboratories.  
 
Objective : 
  
The present study aims to study the systemic bioavailability of 
metronidazole in healthy volunteers  following the application of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_312162] : metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600] , 
0.75% (RLD) , metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600] , 0.75% (generic) and 
metronid azole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_68549] , 0.75% (generic) . The 
metronidazole gel, 0.75% products are therapeutic ally 
equivalent. The metronidazole cream, 0.75% will be used as a n 
inequivalent control for the study.  
The pharmacokinetic data obtained in this study will be used in 
combination with in vitro data collected elsewhere to develop an 
in vitro in vivo correlation that could be leveraged to evaluate 
bioequivalence of generic metronidazole topi[INVESTIGATOR_312163].  
Description of Study 
Design:  The study will be an open -label, crossover study  over 10 weeks 
(n=12 healthy  subjects) with one week washout period between 
studies.  
The study contain six procedure days : 
• Procedure Day 1:   RLD topi[INVESTIGATOR_312164] 0.75% 
metronidazole  to be applied for 25 h.  Blood samples 
obtained on Procedure Day 1  and 2. 
• Procedure Day 3: Generic  topi[INVESTIGATOR_312165] 0.75% 
metronidazole  to be applied  for 25 h.  Blood samples

• Procedure Day 5:  Generic topi[INVESTIGATOR_312166] 0.75% 
metronidazole to be applied for 25 h.  Blood samples 
obtained on Procedure Day 5 and 6 . 
A)  Pharmacokinetics  
Each subject will be his/her own control and each subject will 
sign an institutional review board –approved consent form 
explaining the purpose, nature, risks, benefits, and duration of 
the study. The study will be conducted in accordance with good 
clinical practice guidelines and with the ethical principles 
originating in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The subject’s skin in the area of application ( upper arm ) will be 
relatively free of hair before gel or cream application.  Blood 
samples (approximately 5 mL  (1 tsp)  each) will be drawn in BD 
vacutainer  tubes .  On Procedure Day 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5  and 6, blood 
samples will be obtained as follows:  
• Within 60 min pre -gel/cream  application and then during 
wear , up to 25 h.

13 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
Generic drugs are approved based upon bioequivalence (BE) testing, and w ith respect 
to oral drug delivery, the accepted BE approach is relative ly straightforward and is 
principally based on matching blood level p rofiles. In some cases, in vitro dissolution 
tests can be done to help determine the bioequivalence of an oral dosage form.  For 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_312167], with the exception of corticosteroids  and a 
few other products , a comparative clinical endpoint study is often necessary for approval 
of a generic product or for replacement of an approved dermatological drug product with 
one that has major  changes. Comparative clinical trials are relatively insensitive, time -
consuming and costly .  It is  especially difficult  to gain the adequate statistical power 
needed to evaluate bioequivalence for some dermatological conditions, and can require 
a large number (i.e., hundreds1,2) of subjects.  
This study supports FDA’s continuing effort to identify the most accurate, sensitive, 
reproducible and efficient methods to evaluate topi[INVESTIGATOR_312168] .  
The model drug for this study is metronidazole, which is available in different topi[INVESTIGATOR_84695], gel, cream and lotion, approved by [CONTACT_312173]. The 
metronidazole  gels and cream  have been chosen for this study because the 
therapeutically equ ivalent metronidazole gels will be used to evaluate BE in vivo. The 
metronidazole cream is being used as the non-BE control for this project.   
   
2.2 Rationale  
The goal of this study is to help establish more efficient pathways for approval of topi[INVESTIGATOR_312169]. This study with a RLD 
and generic metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], 0.75% and generic metronidazole  topi[INVESTIGATOR_68549], 
0.75% will provide sufficient systemic concentrations of metronidazole  to characterize t he 
systemic bioavailability. The same products  will also be studied (under a parallel but 
separate in vitro study protocol) using an in vitro permeation test (IVPT) model with 
excised human skin . The IVPT model  has demonstrated IVIVC in previous studies  using 
different drug molecules and formulations . This research will help establish whether the 
IVPT model correlates with and is predictive of in vivo bioavailabil ity, and whether IVPT 
can be utilized as part of a collective weight -of-evidence approach to su pport an approval 
pathway for topi[INVESTIGATOR_312163].  
 
These coordinated evaluations also collectively provide the in vivo reference datasets 
that are needed to establish IVIVC for the IVPT model which may then be utilized to 
support a new pathway for appro val of numerous topi[INVESTIGATOR_312170].

15 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
1)  G enerate human PK data by [CONTACT_312174] :  RLD and generic metronidazole  gel, 0.75%  and generic 
metronidazole  cream , 0.75% . This data will be used to assess the bioequivalen ce of 
these products or lack thereof.   
2)  To develop  in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC) models for  dermal  products . PK data 
from this study as well as in vitro data collected elsewhere from IVPT studies will be 
used to develop IVIVC models which could provide a surrogate for conducting clinical 
endpoint studies (required to demonstrate bioequivalence of dermal product s).  
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
For the PK study t he main outcome measure is the maximum serum  concentration 
(Cmax), time of maximum serum  concentration (T max) of metronidazole  and area under the 
curve (AUC) attained from RLD and generic metronidazole  gel, 0.75%  and generic 
metronidazole  cream , 0.75% .

PK of Metronidazole Dermal Products  Version 7.0; April 12, [ADDRESS_384612]. Blood samples (approximately 5 mL (1 tsp)) will be collected during each study 
session within -[ADDRESS_384613] -application. Non compartmental  
analyses (NCA) will be conducted to estimate the PK parameters such as : maximum 
serum  concentration (C max) and AUC of the serum  concentration –time determi ned by [CONTACT_300235] . All NCA analyses will be conduct ed using Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® 6.4 (Pharsight, a Certara Company, CA).  
5.2 Final Analysis Plan  
The objective of this study is to determine PK parameters (C max, AUC) of metronidazole  
in healthy adults after using metronidazole 0.75% gels or cream.   
Student’s t -test or Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by [CONTACT_447] -hoc Bonferroni test 
will be used , where appropriate, for comparing the differences in the means of the PK 
parameters and significant differences will be declared at p<0.05 .  
 
If metronidazole  PK concentrations are found to be non -normally distributed, then we will 
examine Box -Cox transformations (e.g., log, square -root, etc.) that can achieve 
normality. If no transformation can achieve normality, then will use permutation tests to 
compute empi[INVESTIGATOR_156833] p-values, and will use the bootstrap to compute standard errors and 
confidence intervals that account for within -person correlation.

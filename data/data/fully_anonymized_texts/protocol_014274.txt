 1 Introduction 
Infections are now a leading cause of death and morbidity in kidney transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Herpes viruses such as Epstein- Barr vi rus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) are particularly troublesome.  
 At the present time, valganciclovir (valG) is the primary prophylactic agent against CMV in kidney transplant (KTx) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Although many centers try to prevent CMV disease by [CONTACT_533340], only the high risk patients (defined as CMV 
antibody negative patients  receiving organs from CMV antibody positive donors) on 
antiviral prophylaxis with valG for three to [ADDRESS_692422] -KTx, there continue to be 
patients with break -through infections. CMV viremia has been noted in 22% of pediatric 
post-KTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and the incidence at the University of Minnesota (UMMC) in all KTx 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533318] 17% despi[INVESTIGATOR_533319]. CMV disease post -KTx can 
manifest as fever, leucopenia, or mild to severe organ involvement. While an effective anti-CMV drug, valG has a number of adverse effects including leucopenia, also a side 
effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), one of the cornerstones of current anti -rejection 
regimens.  Combined therapy with MMF and valG frequently results in leucopenia associated infection or leucopenia necessitating reduction in MMF doses, increasing the risk of rejection. In addition, valG is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, rather than prophylaxis, many centers adopt a pre- emptive therapeutic approach whereby [CONTACT_447] -Ktx 
patients are screened for CMV, and at new onset viremia, valG is initiated. This approach has been associated with increased CMV infections and resistant viral strains.   
Therefore, there is need for an alternate drug with a more benign side effect profile and equal effectiveness against CMV. Valacyclovir (valA) was shown to reduce the incidence and delay the onset of CMV disease in both CMV seronegative patients (P<0.001) and CMV seroposit ive patients (P=0.03) and has fewer severe adverse 
events. In fact, very high doses of valA (8g/day), for post -KTx CMV prophylaxis were 
shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side effects compared to placebo.  
 Currently, prevention of EBV infection is conducted by [CONTACT_533341].  A recent study suggested that valG prophylaxis post -KTx is protective against EBV infection, but it had 
design flaws and the number of subjects was limited. Therefore to date, the anti -EBV 
effect of valG is poorly defined. EBV can present post -KTx as infectious mononucleosis 
syndrome, hepatitis and, most importantly, can initiate potentially fatal lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). Between Octo ber 2003 and December 2009, EBV 
viremia occurred in 20% of adults and 50% of pediatric KTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (60/120) at UMMC, and, PTLD occurred in 6% (7/120) of pediatric recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Effective anti -EBV 
prophylaxis could substantially improve KTx outcomes. ValA therapy resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in oral EBV shedding, accompanied by a clinical benefit, and valA is currently used for the therapy of severe cases of infectious mononucleosis in the community.   
 This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part

1.[ADDRESS_692423] patient and kidney transplant survival. In addition to overt CMV and EBV related issues detailed above, subclinical CMV and/or EBV viremia have been associated with deterioration in kidney function in KTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The significance of this research also includes the potential for substantial 
cost-savings. At UMMC, even with dis counted pricing due to the University status and 
bulk ordering, a 90 day supply of 450mg doses of valG administered twice daily is approximately $11,000 compared to $[ADDRESS_692424] $1.[ADDRESS_692425] -KTx, kidneys 
exposed to an immunosuppr essed milieu allowing viral multiplication will increase the 
likelihood of isolating the virus from infected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_533320] -KTx.  
 In summary, valA is less expensive, with few er adverse effects, and less likelihood of 
causing  leucopenia than valG.  If this  agent ha s equivalent efficacy in CMV and any 
efficacy in  EBV prophylaxis, the use of valA will result in significant financial savings, a 
reduced risk of leucopenia- associated infection, and a lower incidence of rejection by 
[CONTACT_533342].  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Valacyclovir (valacyclov ir hydrochloride) is the hydrochloride salt of the L -valyl ester of 
the antiviral drug acyclovir. Caplets are for oral administration. Each caplet contains 
valacyclovir hydrochloride equivalent to 500 mg or 1 gram valacyclovir and the inactive ingredients carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidon, FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake, 
hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, and titanium dioxide. The blue, film -coated caplets are 
printed with edible white ink.  
 Valacyclovir oral suspension (25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) may be prepared extemporaneously from 500 mg VALTREX Caplets for use in pediatric patients for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate.

 The chemical name [CONTACT_533350] L -valine, 2[(2- amion- 1,6-dihydro- 6-
oxo-9H-purin_9_yl)methoxy]ethyl ester, monohydrochloride.  
 
Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analogue DNA polymerase inhibitor. Valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_533321] 1 (HSV -1) and 2 (HSV -2) and VZV both in cell culture and in vivo. 
The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by [CONTACT_242823]. This viral enzyme conv erts acyclovir 
into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by [CONTACT_533343]  a 
number of cellular enzymes.  
 Valganciclovir (valganciclovir hydrochloride) contains valganciclovir hydrochloride  
(valganciclovir HCl), a hydrochloride salt of the L- valyl ester of ganciclovir that exists as 
a mixture of two diasteromers. Ganciclovir is a synthetic guanine derivative active against CMV.  
 Tablets are available as 450 mg for oral administration. Each tablet contains 496.3 mg 
of valganciclovir HCl (corresponding to 450 mg of valganciclovir), and the inactivie ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K -30, crospovidone and stearic acid. 
The film -coat applied t o the tablets contains Opadry Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745].  
 For pediatric patients, valganciclovir HCl is available in an oral solution that must be 
prepared by a pharmacist prior to dispensing.  Valganciclovir HCl for oral solution (50 mg 
per mL) is  supplied as a white to slightly yellow powder for constitution, forming a 
colorless to brownish yellow tutti -frutti flavored solution. Available in glass bottles 
containing approximately 100 mL of solution after constitution.  
 Valganciclovir is an L- valyl ester (prodrug) of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two 
disteromers. After oral administration, both diastereomers are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_533322].  
1.[ADDRESS_692426] of valG has not been conclusively demonstrated or proven. On the 
other hand, data from infectious mononucleosis intervention trials document that two 
weeks of valA therapy resulted in a statistically significant reduction in oral EBV shedding, accompanied by a cli nical benefit ( 1, 2), and valA is currently used for the 
therapy of severe cases of infectious mononucleosis in the community ( 1, 3).  
Oral acyclovir has been shown to prevent CMV disease in post -KTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( 4-7) and 
valA in particular has been shown to reduce the incidence and delay the onset of CMV disease in both CMV seronegative patients (P<0.001) and CMV seropositive patients (P=0.03) (8). But since that trial did not include a comparison arm with the current 
standard of care which is valG and did not provide information on the anti -EBV effect of 
the valA, our study is critical in proving the effectiveness of valA for CMV and EBV prophylaxis.  
 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 9 of 25 
 ValG is associated with adverse events including diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, 
tremor, leucopenia, neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in ≥20% of patients 
based on their package insert which we have attached.  ValG induced leucopenia often 
necessitates a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy, increasing the risk of allograft rejection. Fewer severe adverse events are related to valA, including rash (8%), abdominal pain (1% to 11%), nausea (5% to 15%), vomiting  (less than 1% to 6%), 
headache (13% to 38%) and fatigue (8%). Very high doses of valA (8g/day) for post -
KTx CMV prophylaxis was shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side effects 
compared to placebo (8).  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Prior research at the University of Minnesota has shown that valacyclovir 1g every 8 
hours for a total daily dose of 3g is well tolerated and was associated with a reduction in 
EBV excretion ( 1) in patients with infectious mononucleosis. Subsequently a study done 
at the University of Minnesota to characterize the pharmacokinetics and explore the 
pharmacodynamics of acyclovir in plasma and oral washings of 8 subjects  with EBV 
infectious mononucleosis  receiving the same daily dose of  valacyclovir  (3g) as a twice 
daily dosing of  1500 mg twice daily  demonstrated safety and showed that the quantity of 
EBV DNA in oral washings and blood, and the severity of illness, measured by a graded 
scale, decreased during treatment ( 9).  
Therefore in order to increase the likelihood of compliance in our patients, we have 
decided to utilize 1.5g twice a day dosing of valacyclovir and since it was shown to be effective as therapy in the above study, we hypothesize that it will be adequate for anti -
viral prophylaxis as intended in this study. The dose will of course be adjusted based on GFR and in pediatric patients based on their weight as detailed in package insert and below.  
 No major side effects are anticipated since even very high doses of v alA (8g/day), for 
post-KTx CMV prophylaxis were shown to have no severe or treatment -limiting side 
effects compared to placebo (10).  
  
2 Study Objectives 
 
Primary Objectives :

3 Study Design 
This is a single -center, prospective, randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27977] 200 kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533323] . Randomization of 
subjects will be in a 1:[ADDRESS_692427] of care regimen of ValG. 
Duration of therapy will be 3- 13 months.  
 Subjects will be assessed weekly then monthly for medication compliance, as well as 
assessing adverse events .  Subjects will be assessed at their routine clinic visits, or via 
email/telephone.   Subjects will be followed for a total of 12- [ADDRESS_692428] of care samples for 
immunosuppression drug analysis. From these samples, qualitative PCR assay  (qPCR) 
will assess CMV and EBV  for up to six months post study drug cessation.  C omplete 
blood count and metabolic panels  will be collected clinically, and results recorded for 
this study . CMV and EBV IgG and IgM levels will be measured bi -annually  until 
seroconversion. In the cases where blood is not drawn for cli nical purposes at least 
once a month, 10- 15ml of the subject’s blood may be collected for this testing for 
research purposes. Surveillance kidney transplant biopsies are obtained at the time of 
transplant, [ADDRESS_692429] study participation, kidney tissue (two to three 
cores) from any biopsy will be shared with the research team.  
 Subjects will be followed- up regularly by [CONTACT_533344] p ost 
transplant. During these follow -up assessments, the research team will assess drug 
adherence  as well as evaluate side effects. If subjects are seen during a standard of 
care visit, laboratory values and a review of medical records will also be performe d to 
assess any potential  adverse events.

6.3 Duration of Therapy  
Duration of therapy is dependent on donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533326].   Adult subjects will be treated with their assigned study drug (ValA or ValG) for  three 
months,  unless the donor is antibody positive and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533327] 
(D+R -) to CMV/EBV, then patient will get six months of prophylaxis.    
 Pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533328] (D - R-) for both CMV and EBV, subjects 
will be treated for three months .   
 
Patients that are randomized to ValA that develop CMV disease or CMV viremia X2 
may discontinue ValA and begin standard of care treatment with ValG. At tha t time they 
will continue research related follow up but valA use is up to the discretion of the treating physician. At that time all protocol directed safety follow up with be 
discontinued ; however, outcomes  will be followed until month 12.   
6.4 Method for As signing Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_442472] 1:1 fashion using computer allocation to receive either valA or valG , and will notify the study team of the 
randomization assignment   
6.5 Preparation and Administration of  Study Drug 
After randomization, the treating investigator will order the treatment following this protocol dosing schema (see Tables 2 and 3).  Commercial supply of ValA and ValG will 
be dispensed to the subjects.

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoints are as follows:  
1. Incidence and duration of CMV and EBV viremia and magnitude of viremia as 
measured by [CONTACT_533347]- time curve of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533329]/or EBV in the first year post -Ktx.  
2. Incidence of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_533330].  
3. Presence of EBV and or CMV in renal tissue (protocol biopsies).   
7.2 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Organ donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118267], transplant characteristics, donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533331] (pre- transplant  EBV and CMV IgE antibody status and qPCR in donors

7.4 Statistical Methods  
As per Lowance et al., 80% of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533332] 6 months . Therefore, to establish non- inferiority of valA as 
compared to valG, if I consider a difference less than 10% of no clinical importance, the required sample size with equal allocation between valA and valG to achieve an 80% power (β=0.2) at α=0.05 we wou ld need 54 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

8 Safety and Adverse Events 
Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during t he course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
injuries will be regarded as adverse events .   
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 17 of 25 
 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or  prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of maj or clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533334].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
 
Known side effects of the study drug an d of kidney transplant will not be 
treated as serious adverse events for this study  unless they are life-
threatening or fatal. See section 5.[ADDRESS_692443] of the known adverse effects of the 
study drugs. The know n adverse effects of kidney  transplant includ e: 
• Graft dysfunction, including:  
o Delayed graft function

Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as [ADDRESS_692444] administration of study treatment.   
Preexisting Condition 
ValA vs ValG for CMV/EBV Prophylaxis post KTx  
July 5 2018   Page 18 of 25 
 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A pr eexisting 
condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_283877], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one o f the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g . 
change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533335] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outc ome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186996], unless it is a worsening or increase in freq uency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5113].

July [ADDRESS_692445] seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Inform ation on all 
adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be record ed in the 
source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been deter mined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.[ADDRESS_692446] be documented in the form of a written narrative.  This 
should include a copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event form  (see Appendix) , 
and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new information of ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the PI . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.

 8.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_533336]. Reasons for terminating 
the study may include the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to subjects . 
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory . 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
8.[ADDRESS_692447]  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be compliance with the UMN Clinical 
and Translational Scientific Institute’s Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMB).  
 A DSMB will meet twice per year, with the first meeting occurring once approximately 25% of target enrollment has been accrued. The DSMB will review recruitment, participant status and subject safety associated with the trial and create a report for the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_533337], if any, to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_533338].  
[ADDRESS_692448] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the r evocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study peri od. 
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.

9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error  has been 
made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or unce rtain 
entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
9.4 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_692449].  These documents will be retained for a longer period if required 
by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan

Martha Kruhm, MS, RAC  
Head, Protocol and Information Office  Operations and Informatics Branch Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis National Cancer Institute Executive Plaza North Room 730 Bethesda, MD [ZIP_CODE]  Dear [CONTACT_6827],  Attached is Amendment #4 to ACNS0821 , Temozolomide with Irinotecan versus 
Temozolomide, Irinotecan plus Bevacizumab (NSC# 704865, BB-IND# 7921) for Recurrent/Refractory Medulloblastoma/CNS PNET of Childhood, A COG Randomized Phase II Screening Tria l. 
. The amendment is being submitted in response to an RA from [CONTACT_682354] 
([EMAIL_13050]) dated May 9, 2014.  The bevacizumab monograph has been 
modified to reflect the incorporation of the revised Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) list for bevacizumab provided by [CONTACT_6812]. The changes made due to this request are detailed below.   In addition, the eligibility criteria have been revised regarding measurable disease.  
Liberalizing the eligibility requirement will allow the study to enroll more patients with recurrent/refractory disease and will offer these patients the opportunity for study participation when other therapeutic options are quite limited.   
 The prim ary objective of the study is to compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects 
receiving the combination of temozolomide and irinotecan with that of subjects receiving temozolomide, irinotecan and bevacizumab for recurrent medulloblastoma (MB)/PNET of childhood.  Measurable disease is a vital eligibility criterion only if the primary objective is tumor response and EFS.  However, with OS as the primary outcome of the study, it is not imperative that patients have measurable disease at the time of enrollment.  Patients with leptomeningeal disease or patients with clear residual disease following resection of recurrence will be enrolled and still be assessable for OS.  The Study committee will stratify patients for randomization to each treatment arm according to whether or not they 
have measurable disease.  Thus, exposure to each treatment arm will be similar for an equal number of patients that have no measurable disease at the time of enrollment.  While power may be limited, the investigators will test for a differential effect on outcome based on whether or not measurable disease was present at enrollment. 
 
 In addition, administrative changes have also been included.   Specific changes are detailed below.

ABSTRACT  
 Temozolomide is an orally administered alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine derivatives with excellent CNS penetration.  Phase II studies have shown variable response rates of 16 -47% in children and adolescents 
with recurrent medulloblastomas/PNET. Irinotecan is a water -soluble campothecin derivative that inhibits 
topoisomerase I (topo I), an enzyme involved in DNA repair, transcription and replication.
1-[ADDRESS_923996] recurrent medulloblastomas.4  A British study found a 40% 
objective response rate to the combination of irinotecan and temozolomide in patients with recurrent MB/PNET.  Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal neutralizing antibody bin ding all five isoforms of  
human v ascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . CNS tumors are potentially excellent targets for anti -
angiogenic therapy given the presence of tumor neo -vascularization and high concentrations of pro -angiogenic 
factors .
5-[ADDRESS_923997] recurrent MB/PNET and the combination has been well tolerated in heavily pre-treated patients.
8 The addition of bevacizumab theoretically may 
increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. Therefore, a phase II trial evaluating the addition of bevacizumab to the combination of irinotecan and temozolomide in MB/PNET of childhood will be performed.   This study will use a randomized phase II screening design
4,9 to compare temozolomide 
(150 mg/m2 PO for 5 days) with irinotecan (50 mg/m2 IV for 5 days) to temozolomide, irinotecan plus 
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 15), in children with recurrent MB/PNET. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. Response will be evaluated prior to every other course.  Therapy can be continued for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS) 
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
To compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects receiving the combination of 
temozolomide and irinotecan with that of subjects receiving temozolomide, irinotecan and bevacizumab for recurrent medulloblastoma (MB)/PNET of childhood.  
 1.[ADDRESS_923998] patients who are 
enrolled with measurable disease. 
. 1.2.2 To determine event- free survival (EFS) for each patient compared across 
regimens.

 2.3 Temozolomide   
Temozolomide is an orally administered alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine derivatives with excellent CNS penetration. It is the prodrug of the cytotoxic triazine, monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC), which is the active metabolite of dacarbazine (DTIC).
20  Temozolomide is currently FDA approved for the treatment of 
recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas and newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) conducted a phase I study of temozolomide in children and adolescents with recurrent solid tumors. In this study, responses were seen in medulloblastomas and supratentorial PNETs.
21 A complete response to temozolomide 
has also been reported in a patient with leptomeningeal recurrence of a medulloblastoma.
22  An Italian multicenter study of temozolomide in patients with 
recurrent or refractory MB/PNET following craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_682323] 47%, including 6 of 34 patients with a complete response.
23  A COG phase 2 study of temozolomide in children 
and adolescents with recurrent CNS tumors found temozolomide to be modestly active as a single agent for recurrent MB/PNET with an overall response rate of 16%.  Of 29 
patients with MB/PNET , 25 were evaluable with 1 CR (4%) and 3 PR (12%).
1  Thus, 
temozolomide appears to be active as a single agent for recurrent medulloblastoma although the reported response rates are highly variable. 
 2.4 Irinotecan   
Irinotecan is a water-soluble campothecin derivative that inhibits topoisomerase I (topo 
I), an enzyme involved in DNA repair, transcription and replication.
2,3,[ADDRESS_923999] been studied.  A phase I pediatric study of 
irinotecan given as a 2-hour infusion once every 3 weeks reported 1 partial response, 1 
minor response, and 2 patients with stable disease out of the 19 previously treated medulloblastoma patients.
34 A COG phase II trial evaluated irinotecan 50 mg/m2/day for 
[ADDRESS_924000] response rate was seen in the recurrent medulloblastoma stratum (16%). In a separate pediatric phase II study of irinotecan dosed at 125 mg/m
[ADDRESS_924001], two 
of three patients with MB/PNET had stable disease for [ADDRESS_924002] 5 days of each course. 
 2.5 Combination of Temozolomide and Irinotecan   
The combination of temozolomide with irinotecan was studied in xenograft models of 
neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and glioblastoma.
36 The activity of the combination 
suggested schedule-dependent synergistic efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated no interactions between the agents. To the contrary, administration of irinotecan with temozolomide appeared to reduce temozolomide toxicity in this mouse model. The combination of temozolomide with irinotecan has been evaluated in adult 
solid tumors using a variety of schedules.
  Jones et al.37 reported partial responses in 
patients with GBM, head and neck carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma in a phase I trial 
utilizing three different dosing schedules. A total of 49 patients were enrolled and the ideal dosing schedule could not be determined. Another study for patients with recurrent malignant glioma combined temozolomide 200 mg/m
2 daily for 5 days and irinotecan 
given at different doses and schedules.38 Limited accrual precluded determining an 
advantage of one schedule over the other. Toxicity was mild, and only rare Grade 4 
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were noted. A phase I trial for adults with recurrent malignant glioma determined an MTD of temozolomide 200 mg/m
2/day on Days 1-5 
plus intravenous IRIN  125 mg/m2  (325 mg/m2 for patients receiving enzyme-inducing 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006]) administered Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of each 6-week cycle. The DLTs were h ematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic.
39 
 
Pooled data from children with Ewing sarcoma treated according to a phase I trial schedule using temozolomide 100 mg/m
2/day on Days 1-5 and intravenous irinotecan 
10-20 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5 and 8-12 every 21-28 days reported the combination to be 
generally well tolerated with minimal myelosuppression in heavily pre-treated patients. 
Grade 3-4 diarrhea was seen in 11% of courses.40 The MTD in a pediatric phase I trial of 
temozolomide and irinotecan using a protracted daily irinotecan schedule was temozolomide 100 mg/m
2/day for five days combined with 10 mg/m2/day irinotecan IV 
daily for 5 days for 2 consecutive weeks. Temozolomide was not dose-escalated beyond 100 mg/m
2/day. No pharmacokinetic interactions were seen between the agents, and 
myelosuppression was minimal and noncumulative.41 Patients who had previously 
received craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_682324]. Using a simpler schedule, Kushner et al. published results in children with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma using 150 
mg/m
2/day of temozolomide in combination with intravenous irinotecan 50 mg/m2/day 
for 5 consecutive days every 3-4 weeks.8 Hematologic and GI toxicities were easily 
manageable and no cumulative toxicities were seen. Responses and prolonged stable disease were seen in this heavily pre-treated group of patients with poor bone marrow reserve.

The preliminary results of an ongoing phase 2 open label study of irinotecan and temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma w ere presented at 
the International Society of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology meeting in early July 2008. The study utilizes temozolomide 100 mg/m
2/day on days 1-5 and intravenous irinotecan 10 
mg/m2/day on days 1-5 and 8-12 every 3 weeks with planned escalation of temozolomide 
to 125 mg/m2/day for patients that tolerate the initial dosing. There were [ADDRESS_924003] in 
patients with recurrent rhabdomyosarcomas where similar efficacy was seen in patients randomized to the 5 day regimen as compared to the 5 days x 2.
43  The current study will 
utilize 150 mg/m2/day of temozolomide with intravenous irinotecan 50 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_924004] be assigned a COG patient ID 
number. This number is obtained via the eRDE system once authorization for the release of protected health information (PHI) has been obtained. The COG patient ID number is used to identify the patient in all future interactions with COG. If you have problems with the registration, please refer to the online help.   
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration 
process. Each patient will be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID.

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
          
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan  
Patients will be randomized at enrollment to one of two study arms: temozolomide with 
irinotecan ( TEMO +IRIN) or temozolomide with irinotecan plus bevacizumab 
(TEMO +IRIN +BEVA ). The primary study endpoint is overall survival. Therapy may 
continue for a maximum of 12 courses , in the absence of disease progression (see Section 
10.4. for definition) if off protocol criteria have not yet been satisfied ( see Section 8.1) .  
 
Each course of therapy will last 28 days. The temozolomide dose will be 150 mg/m2/day 
by [CONTACT_682344] 5 days of each course. Irinotecan 50 mg/m2/day will be given 
intravenously for the first 5 days of each course. For patients receiving bevacizumab, the dose will be 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each course.  
 Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care.  Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
  Page 20 
Disease status will be assessed prior to the initiation of therapy and at the end of every 
other course of treatment. In the absence of disease progression (see definition in Section 
10.4) and unacceptable toxicities , patients can begin subsequent courses of therapy once 
the following criteria have been met:  
- ANC ≥ 1,000/µL  - Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL (transfusion independent)
 
 Following completion of a course, the next course begins on Day 29 or when blood count parameters are met (whichever occurs later). 
 
 See Section 7.1 for required observations prior to starting protocol therapy. 
  4.2 Concomitant therapy restrictions  
 
4.2.1 No other cancer chemotherapy or immunomodulating agents are permitted. The use of alternative or complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682331].  4.2.2 Radiotherapy is not permitted. 
 
 
4.2.3 Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be used as necessary.   
 
4.2.4 Corticosteroid therapy is permissible only for treatment of increased intracranial pressure or for hormonal replacement and should not be used as a prophylactic antiemetic. 
 
4.2.5 Irinotecan is a substrate for CYP3A4 (major) and CYP2B6 (major). CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors may increase the level/effects of irinotecan and inducers may decrease the level/effect of irinotecan. Strong inhibitors of cytochrome CYP3A4, include azole antifungals (such as fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole) rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and St. John’s Wort. Additional drugs and inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 can be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis. Interacting drugs with irinotecan should be avoided or used with great caution.
 
 
4.2.6 The use of NSAIDS, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], dypi[INVESTIGATOR_682332], or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457] > 81 mg/day is not 
permitted.  4.2.7 The routine use of growth factors is not recommended for the initial course of therapy, but may be used as clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.

 4.3 TEMO +IRI N Course   
The TEMO+IRIN treatment course will be repeated every [ADDRESS_924020], 
followed by [CONTACT_372338].  See the Parenteral Chemotherapy Administration Guidelines (CAG) on the COG website at: https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/disc/Pharmacy/ChemoAdminGuidelines.pdf for special precautions and suggestions for patient monitoring during the infusion. As applicable, also see the CAGs for suggestions on hydration, or hydrate according to institutional guidelines.  Dose calculations should be based on actual BSA. There is no maximum dosing.  Temozolomide :  PO  
Days: 1 through 5. 
Dose:  150 mg/m2/dose. 
Note : Temozolomide given IV is not permitted.   Temozolomide will be given on an 
empty stomach (to improve absorption and reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting) at least one hour before irinotecan administration. The temozolomide dose should be 
rounded off to the nearest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down [see Appendix I II]). For patients 
with a BSA <  0.5 m2, temozolomide should be given at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day rounded 
off to the nearest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down [see example in Appendix I II]). If emesis 
occurs within 20 minutes of taking a given dose, then the dose may be repeated once. If 
emesis occurs after 20 minutes, the dose should not be repeated. Guidelines for administration of oral temozolomide to patients who are unable to swallow capsules or tablets are provided in Appendix VI  and instructions for the preparation of 
extemporaneous suspension are available in the drug monograph ( section 6.3). 
Antiemetics should be given 30 minutes prior to each temozolomide dose. 
 Pharmacy note: Temozolomide capsules are available in [ADDRESS_924021] be dispensed at one time. See drug monograph for additional details and examples. 
 Irinotecan :  IV , infuse the diluted solution over 90 minutes 
Days: 1 through 5. 
Dose: 50 mg/m2/dose. 
Note : Irinotecan will be given at least one hour after temozolomide administration. 
Higher incidence of cholinergic symptoms has been reported with more rapid infusion rates.  To avoid extravasation; the use of a central line is suggested. 
 Following administration of irinotecan, monitor for signs and symptoms of diarrhea and dehydration.  For diarrhea related to irinotecan therapy, the use of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_682333]-
onset diarrhea and the use of loperamide for late-onset diarrhea are recommended. See

4.4 TEMO +IRIN +BEVA  Course  
 
The TEMO+IRIN+BEVA treatment course will be repeated every [ADDRESS_924025], followed 
by [CONTACT_682345]. 
 See the Parenteral Chemotherapy Administration Guidelines (CAG) on the COG website at: https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/disc/Pharmacy/ChemoAdminGuidelines.pdf for special precautions and suggestions for patient monitoring during the infusion. As applicable, also see the CAGs for suggestions on hydration, or hydrate according to institutional guidelines.  Dose calculations should be based on actual BSA. There is no maximum dosing.  Temozolomide :  PO  
Days: 1 through 5. 
Dose:  150 mg/m2/dose. 
Note :  Temozolomide given IV is not permitted.   Temozolomide will be given on an empty 
stomach (to improve absorption and reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting) at least one hour before  irinotecan administration. The temozolomide dose should be rounded off to the 
nearest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down [see Appendix III]). For patients with BSA < 0.5 m
2, 
temozolomide should be given at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day rounded off to the nearest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down [see example in Appendix I II]). If emesis occurs within 20 minutes of taking a 
given drug dose, then the dose may be repeated once. If emesis occurs after 20 minutes, the dose 
should not be repeated. Guidelines for administration of oral temozolomide to patients who are unable to swallow tablets are provided in Appendix VI  and instructions for the preparation of 
extemporaneous suspension are available in the drug monograph ( section 6.3). It is recommended 
that antiemetics be given 30 minutes prior to the temozolomide dose.  Pharmacy note: Temozolomide capsules are available in [ADDRESS_924026] be dispensed at one time. See drug 
monograph for additional details and examples. 
 
Irinotecan:  IV, infuse the diluted solution over 90 minutes 
Days: 1 through 5. Dose: 50 mg/m
2/dose. 
Note: Irinotecan will be given at least one hour after temozolomide administration. Higher 
incidence of cholinergic symptoms has been reported with more rapid infusion rates. To avoid extravasation; the use of a central line is suggested.
 
 Following administration of irinotecan, monitor for signs and symptoms of diarrhea and dehydration.  For diarrhea related to irinotecan therapy, the use of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_682333]-onset diarrhea and the use of loperamide for late-onset diarrhea are recommended. See https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/prot/reference_materials.asp for dosing and schedule information.

Bevacizumab:  IV over 90 minutes* 
Days: 1 and 15. Dose: 10 mg/kg/dose. Note : *Infuse first dose over [ADDRESS_924027] dose and all subsequent doses may be given over 30 minutes. Check vital signs prior to infusion and monitor for 
infusion-related reactions every 30 minutes (during 60 and 90 minute infusions) and at the end of the infusion. Monitor every [ADDRESS_924028] dose of bevacizumab. If infusional reactions occur, acetaminophen [10-15 mg/kg (max 650 mg)], diphenhydramine [1 mg/kg (max 50 mg)], or other medications may be given for symptom control and for premedication as needed. (See Section 
4.2 for concomitant therapy restrictions. ) Anaphylactic precautions should be observed during 
bevacizumab administration. If an infusion reaction occurs, subsequent doses of bevacizumab 
should be administered over the shortest period that was well-tolerated. Bevacizumab is incompatible with D
5W (the drug is inactivated). 
 Special precautions: Black box warning includes risk of gastrointestinal perforation and wound 
healing complications (fatal results have occurred). Suspend dosing at least [ADDRESS_924029] 14 days after intermediate surgical procedure, and until the surgical wound is fully healed.  
Minor surgical procedures (eg, biopsies, infusaport or Broviac line placement) need to have fully healed and occurred > 7 days prior to initiation of bevacizumab.   See Table in Section [IP_ADDRESS] for examples of major, intermediate, and minor surgical procedures.  
 See Section 5.0 for Dose Modifications based on Toxicities.

5.2 Hematologic Toxicity 
 
If ANC is < 1 ,000/µL and platelets are < 100,000/µL at Day 28, further therapy should 
be delayed and counts should be checked at least weekly until counts recover. If the 
ANC is < 1,000/µL or platelets < 100,000/µL more than seven days beyond the time for the next treatment (ie, the 
subsequent course is delayed by > 7 days due to myelosuppression), reduce the temozolomide dose by 25% (112.5 mg/m
2 for BSA ≥ 0.5 m2 or 3.75 mg/kg for BSA < 
0.5 m2; see Appendix IV ). If a patient again experiences prolonged myelosuppression 
delaying the ability to deliver the subsequent course by D ay 35 of a treatment course, the 
dose of temozolomide should be reduced again by 25% of the original dose (total of 50% dose reduction [75 mg/m
2 for BSA ≥ 0.5 m2 or 2.5 mg/kg for BSA < 0.5 m2; see 
Appendix V ]). If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 50% dose reduction, myelosuppression prevents delivery of 
the subsequent course by [CONTACT_2006] 35, the patient should be taken off protocol therapy. 
 5.3 Non-Hematologic Toxicity 
Patients who experience Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity (NHT) (with the exception of diarrhea, alopecia, nausea or vomiting that occurs without anti- emetic 
treatment, infection or fever) which returns to Grade [ADDRESS_924034] the doses of irinotecan and temozolomide reduced by 25% of the original dose in subsequent courses (to 37.5 mg/m
2/dose for irinotecan, see Appendix IV  for temozolomide doses). 
If, at the reduced dose, a patient again experiences Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity, (with the exception of diarrhea, alopecia, nausea or vomiting, infection or 
fever), the irinotecan and temozolomide doses will be reduced by [CONTACT_33018] 25% of the original dose (ie, 50% of the original dose to 25 mg/m
2/dose for irinotecan, see 
Appendix V  for temozolomide doses). If Grade 3 or higher NHT recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 50% 
dose reduction, the patient should be taken off protocol therapy.  Gastrointestinal Toxicity Secondary to Irinotecan 
Patients with Grade 3-4 diarrhea will receive antibiotics and anti-diarrheals to prevent 
irinotecan induced diarrhea, per the COG supportive care guidelines; for detailed information please refer to 
(https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/protocol/Standard/SupportiveCareGuidelines.pdf). Patients who develop diarrhea and require antibiotics should continue to 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 31 
receive antibiotics for every course of irinotecan during the study period. If patients 
continue to experience  ≥ Grade 3 diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_682334]-diarrheals, subsequent irinotecan doses should be reduced by 25% of the original dose (to 37.5 mg/m
2/dose). If diarrhea persists further 
reduce irinotecan dose by 50% of original dose for subsequent cycles (to 25 mg/m
2/dose). If Grade 3 diarrhea persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 50% dose reduction, the patient 
should be taken off protocol therapy.  Febrile Neutropenia  
Uncomplicated febrile neutropenia is not a reason for dose reduction.

6.1 Bevacizumab    (rhuMAb VEGF, Avastin®) NSC# 704865  IND # 7921  (5/9/14) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) monoclonal antibody, consisting of 93% human and 7% murine amino acid sequences. The agent is composed of human IgG framework and murine antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions. Bevacizumab approximate molecular weight is 149,000 daltons. Bevacizumab blocks the binding of VEGF to its receptors resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis.  
 The estimated half-life of bevacizumab is approximately 20 days (range 11-50 days). The predicted time to reach steady state was 100 days in 491 patients who received 1 to 20 mg/kg weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. The clearance and the central volume of distribution are higher in males than females. Clearance was higher in those patients with a higher tumor volume.  Toxicity:

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_924036] in Pregnancy and Lactation: 
Bevacizumab has been s hown to be teratogenic in rabbits when administered in doses that are 
two-fold greater than the recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis. Observed effects 
included decreases in maternal and fetal body weights, an increased number of fetal resorption, and an  increased incidence of specific gross and skeletal fetal alterations. Adverse 
fetal outcomes were observed at all doses tested. Angiogenesis is critical to fetal development and the inhibition of angiogenesis following administration of Bevacizumab is likely to result in adverse effects on pregnancy. It is not known whether Bevacizumab is secreted in human milk. Because human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, the potential for absorption and harm to the infant after ingestion is unknown.  
 A prospective study of 179 premenopausal women with stage II or III colorectal cancer given adjuvant therapy with mFOLFOX alone (n= 84) or mFOLFOX with bevacizumab (n=95) suggests that the use of bevaciumab with chemotherapy may result in ovarian failure. In this study, ovarian failure was defined as amenorrhea lasting 3 or more 
months, FSH level ≥ 30 mIU/mL and a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test. A new onset of ovarian failure was documented in 34% (32/95) of women who received 
bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 2% (2/84) of women given chemotherapy 
alone [relative risk of 14 (95% CI 4, 53)]. Recovery of ovarian function occurred in 22% (7/32) of these women after discontinuation of bevacizumab. Additional long term 
effects of bevacizumab on fertility are unknown.  Effect on Growth and Development: Studies of bevacizumab in animals showed a decrease in ovarian function and abnormal bone growth. These and other effects of bevacizumab may potentially impair growth and development.  Abnormal changes in the bones after treatment with bevacizumab have 
been observed in young children with growing bones.  This side effect appeared to be reversible after the treatment was stopped, but has not been assessed with long-term use of the drug.  
 Formulation and Stability:  Bevacizumab is supplied as a clear to slightly opalescent, 
sterile liquid ready for parenteral administration. Each 400 mg (25 mg/mL, 16 mL fill) glass vial contains bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon receipt, refrigerate the intact bevacizumab vials at 2-8°C 
(36-46°F). Store in the outer carton to protect bevacizumab vials from light. Do not freeze. Do not shake.  Bevacizumab vials contain no antibacterial preservatives and are labeled for single use. Discard any unused portion left in the vial immediately after use.   Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modification sections of the 
protocol. Do not administer as an intravenous (IV) push or bolus. Prior to administration, dilute the dose in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection to a final concentration of 1.4-16.5 
mg/mL. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.    
 The chemical and physical stability of the diluted solution in 0.9% sodium chloride is 48 hours at 2°C-30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the

responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, 
unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. Bevacizumab is incompatible with D5W.  To ensure complete delivery of bevacizumab I V infusion line must be flushed with 0.9% 
sodium chloride. The following are two recommended methods for flushing the line:  
1. When the bevacizumab infusion is complete, while maintaining a closed system, 
add an additional 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection to the 
bevacizumab infusion bag. Continue the infusion until a volume equal to that of the volume contained in the tubing has been administered. 
2. Replace the empty bevacizumab infusion bag with a 50 mL bag of 0.9% sodium 
chloride for injection and infuse a volume equal to the volume contained in the tubing.  
 Please note: the flush is not included in the total recommended infusion times.  Supplier: Supplied by [CONTACT_439226]. Do not use 
commercially available drug.  Agent Ordering NCI supplied agent   may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized designee) at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.

6.2 IRINOTECAN   
[CPT -11,Camptothecin-11,7-ethyl-10- (4-[1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_99200]]-1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_99200])-carbonyloxy-
camptothecin), Camptosar®],   NSC #616348    (
05/09/11)  
Source and Pharmacology:   
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water-soluble analog of camptothecin (a plant alkaloid isolated from Camptotheca acuminata) . Irinotecan is a prodrug that requires conversion, 
by [CONTACT_99230]-I inhibitor, SN-[ADDRESS_924037] with the ternary complex formed by [CONTACT_99231] I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Renal excretion is a minor route of elimination of 
irinotecan. The majority of the drug is metabolized in the liver. SN-38 is conjugated to glucuronic acid and this metabolite has no anti-tumor activity. The extent of conversion 
of SN-38 to its glucuronide has been inversely correlated with the risk of severe diarrhea, because the other major route of SN-38 excretion is biliary excretion by [CONTACT_99232] (cMOAT) which presumably leads to mucosal injury. In addition, APC and NPC are oxidative metabolites of irinotecan dependent on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half-life of 
the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 to 20 hours. Irinotecan is 30% to 68% bound to 
albumin and SN-38 is approximately 95% bound to albumin.

Formulation & Stability:  
Each mL of irinotecan injection contains 20 mg irinotecan (on the basis of the trihydrate 
salt), 45 mg sorbitol and 0.9 mg lactic acid. When necessary, pH has been adjusted to 3.5 
(range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Irinotecan is available in single-dose amber glass vials in 40 mg (2 mL) and 100 mg (5 mL), 300 mg (15 mL), and 
500 mg (25 mL). Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). Protect from light. It is recommended that the vial (and backing/plastic blister) should remain in the carton until the time of use.   Guidelines for Administration:   See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the 
protocol.  Irinotecan must be diluted prior to infusion. Irinotecan should be diluted in 5% D5W , 
(preferred) or NS, to a final concentration range of 0.12-2.8 mg/mL. The solution is 
physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (approximately 25°C) and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions diluted in D5W and stored at 
refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2°-8°C), and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours. Refrigeration of admixtures using NS is not 
recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation; the use of a central line is suggested.  Supplier :  
Commercially available from various manufacturers. See package insert for more detailed information.

6.3 TEMOZOLOMIDE  
(Temodar®, Temodal®) NSC# 362856      (05/10/11 ) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
An orally administered alkylating agent, a second generation imidazotetrazine. A prodrug of MTIC, temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic pH. Exerts its effect by [CONTACT_12783]-linking DNA. This is likely a site specific alkylation at the O
6-position 
of guanine with some effect at the N7 position. Temozolomide reaches its peak concentration in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of absorption. It has an 
elimination half-life of 1.13 hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29 hr (orally) with an oral bioavailability of 0.98. Total apparent body clearance is 100 mL/min/m
2 and plasma 
elimination half- life is ~  100 minutes .

Formulation and Stability: Temozolomide capsules are available in six different 
strengths (5, 20, 100, 140, 180, 250 mg). The capsules vary in size, color, and imprint according to strength. In the US, capsules are packaged in 5-count and 14-count bottles. In other countries temozolomide may be packaged in 5-count, 14-count or 20-count bottles. Temozolomide capsules are stored at controlled room temperature.  Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the 
protocol.  There is a potential for medication errors involving temozolomide capsules resulting in 
drug overdosages, which may have been caused by [CONTACT_95431]/taking the wrong number of capsules per day and/or product usage exceeding the prescribed dosing schedule.  When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescribing and dispensing include clear instructions on which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only dispense what is needed for the course, and clearly indicate how many days of dosing the patient will have and how many days are without temozolomide dosing. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 42 
When counseling patients, it is important for each patient/parent to understand the 
number of capsules per day and the number of days that they take  temozolomide . It is 
also important for the patient/parent to understand the number of days that they will be off the medication.   Each strength of temozolomide must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original 
glass bottle. Based on the dose prescribed, determine the number of each strength of temozolomide capsules needed for the full course as prescribed by [CONTACT_099]. For 
example, 275 mg/day for 5 days would be dispensed as five 250 mg capsules, five 20 mg capsules, and five 5 mg capsules. Label each container with the appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patient/parent, making sure each container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands to take the appropriate 
number of capsules of temozolomide from each bottle or vial to equal the total daily dose 
prescribed by [CONTACT_099]. Institutions that have the capability to dispense 
temozolomide as daily doses in a blister pack may do so, taking specific precautions to ensure that the appropriate dose is provided and that the patient is educated to understand the daily dosing regimen.  
 For children unable to swallow the capsules whole, the oral capsules may be formulated into a suspension. To prepare a 10mg/mL suspension triturate the contents of ten 100 mg capsules (1000 mg), 500 mg povidone K-30 and 25mg anhydrous citric acid dissolved in 
1.5mL purified water in a glass mortar to form a uniform paste. To the paste add 50 mL of Ora-Plus® by [CONTACT_1583] a small amount, mixing, and then adding the balance. Transfer to a glass graduated cylinder.  Add Ora-Sweet® or Ora-Sweet® SF to a total volume of 
100 mL by [CONTACT_439227] (Ora-Sweet® or Ora-Sweet® SF).  Rinse at least four times. Package in an amber plastic prescription bottle. The packaged suspension is stable for 7 days at room temperature or 60 days in the refrigerator. The suspension should be shaken well before each use. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic 
drugs should be used when preparing the suspension. (Trissel LA, Yanpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] Z, Koontz SE.  Temozolomide stability in extemporaneously compounded oral suspensions. Int J 
Pharm Compounding 10:396-9, 2006.) 
 Alternatively, the capsules can be opened and mixed with apple sauce or juice (see Appendix VI).

7.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED  
All baseline studies must be performed prior to starting protocol therapy unless otherwise 
indicated below.  
    
7.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluations   
 
Obtain prior to start of course unless otherwise indicated.   Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care.  Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
Based on A09071, we estimate 36 eligible patients will be available for enrollment 
annually, at a rate of 3 patients per month for 36 months, for a total of approximately 108 eligible patients. An additional 11 patients will be added to accommodate for a 10% inevaluable and ineligible rate to a maximum accrual of [ADDRESS_924041] patient enrolled will be followed for six months after enrollment at which time the definitive analysis for the study will be conducted. 
 9.2 Study Design  
This is a randomized, phase II screening trial comparing temozolomide with irinotecan to temozolomide, irinotecan and bevacizumab, for the treatment of recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma/PNET. Patients will be randomized at the time of enrollment to receive 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 45 
one of two regimens with equal probability: (1) temozolomide (TEMO) with irinotecan 
(IRIN), or (2) temozolomide with irinotecan plus bevacizumab (TEMO+IRIN+B). Treatment will continue for up to 12 courses as long as there is no tumor progression and/or untoward toxicity. Patients will be stratified for randomization to each treatment arm according to whether or not they have measurable disease. 
 9.3 Methods of Analysis  
Survival will  be the primary outcome measure used to determine whether the addition of 
bevacizumab to temozolomide/irinotecan reduces the risk of death to warrant further study. The secondary objective includes estimation of the risk of disease progression and response  
rate for each treatment arm.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_924042] one dose of their assigned regimen will be considered in the analysis.  The primary analysis will be done with each patient’s outcome assigned to her or his randomized regimen.  A secondary analysis will be done with each patient’s outcome assigned to her or his actual treatment regimen, if there are any patients whose randomized regimen is switched. The risk of death of two regimens will be compared using the log-rank test.  Patients will be enrolled for thirty-six months (108 eligible patients).  The last 
patient enrolled will be followed for six (6) months.  At that point, the primary study analysis can be accomplished.  Data from patients enrolled on CCG-0962, P9761, P9963, A09713 and A09705 provide an estimate of the median survival of 45 weeks from study enrollment for patients with recurrent medulloblastoma.  TEMO+IRIN+B will be considered of sufficient interest for further development if the one-sided test of equality of risk of death between TEMO+IRIN v. TEMO+IRIN+B  has an associated p-value 
of 0.15 or less.  The power characteristics of this design are given in the following figure: 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 46 
 
For example, this design has approximately 87% power for the alternative of a 
40% reduction in risk of death associated with TEMO+IRIN+B.  
 
Each regimen will be monitored for toxicity, however, as described below.  In addition to overall survival, the event-free survival (EFS) will be determined for each patient and compared across regimens using the log-rank test.  The EFS 
interval for a patient will be defined to be the time from enrollment to: (1) disease progression; (2) second malignant neoplasm; (3) death regardless of cause; or (4) date of last contact, whichever comes first. Patients whose EFS follow-up is terminated because of reasons (1)-(3) above will be considered to have experienced an event; otherwise the patient will be considered censored at the conclusion of EFS-time.  Kaplan-Meier estimates of the EFS for each of the 
randomized regimens will be constructed. 
 9.3.[ADDRESS_924043] statistic used 
for this for interim monitoring will be:

stratified according to the factors by [CONTACT_682347].  The bevacizumab-containing therapy is considered the experimental therapy.  The spending function will be α(t)=αt

the p-value obtained by [CONTACT_682348] 0.004, the study will be identified for possible closure of accrual because the alternative hypothesis is not tenable (‘futility monitoring’). 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_924046] one dose of protocol therapy will be considered for this assessment.  Any patient who demonstrates an overall response of complete or partial response at any time will be considered as a “responder”. All other evaluable patients who have had protocol therapy terminated will be considered non-responders. The response rate will be estimated separately for each regimen by [CONTACT_682349]-evaluable patients.  The response rates will be compared by [CONTACT_682350], but decisions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens will be made based on the risk for adverse event as described above.  The estimated response rate for patients with medulloblastoma treated with temozolomide (Temodar) from A09701 was 16%.  If this response rate holds for the two regimens in this study, the expected 95% confidence intervals for the response rates will be 7.36%-28.9%. The response rates will be compared by [CONTACT_682350], but decisions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens will be made based on the risk for death. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_924047] experienced a feasibility- event if the patient dies while receiving protocol therapy and treatment is considered the principal cause of death or the patient is removed from protocol therapy prior to month four because of toxicity. If, at any time, seven or more patients experience feasibility-events, the regimen on which this occurs 
will be considered for modification or termination. If the true feasibility- event rate is 21% and enrollment proceeds to the full [ADDRESS_924048] experienced a feasibility-event will be reported along with the

95% confidence interval for that rate.  If the lower boundary for the confidence interval 
exceeds 5%, the particular therapy will be identified for modification. 
 Furthermore, the dosing regimen will be re-evaluated with consideration for a protocol amendment if: (1) > 30% of patients require a dose reduction on either arm by [CONTACT_941] 4-month time point, or  (2) > 25% of patients need to discontinue bevacizumab by [ADDRESS_924049] experienced a CNS-hemorrhage event (CHE).  A feasibility-evaluable patient who terminates protocol therapy without experiencing a CHE at any time up to 30 days after the termination of protocol therapy or the patient’s death, whichever comes first, will be considered not to have experienced a CHE.  
 
If, at any time, three CHEs are observed on either regimen, the study will be identified for possible modification.  For either regimen, if the true CHE rate is 10%, the regimen 
will be identified as being associated with an excessive CHE rate with probability of at least 91%.  At each formal interim monitoring, the CHE-time will be calculated for every feasibility-evaluable patient. This will be the time from enrollment until CHE event, [ADDRESS_924050] experience a CHE; otherwise the patient will be considered censored for CHE at the end of the CHE-time.  The proportion of patients who experience a CHE event as a function of time since enrollment will be calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier, as well as the 95% confidence interval associated with that proportion. 
 9.5 Detection of Progression  
The administration of bevacizumab may modify the radiographic appearance of the tumor and mask anatomical progressive disease.  We will compare the sites of dise ase at 
recurrence to obtain preliminary data on this hypothesis.  At disease progression, the sites of recurrence will be classified as: (1) recurrence at the primary site only; or (2) recurrence at a site other than one initially involved at the time enrollment onto ACNS0821.  The cumulative incidence of each type of disease progression will be calculated for each regimen separately and compared using the methods of Fine and Gray
53.  A higher cumulative incidence of  new sites of disease relative to those observed 
at enrollment will be taken to support the possibility that bevacizumab may mask anatomical progression.  Because the study is designed to obtain the target power for the overall survival comparison, the power for detecting differences in the modalities by [CONTACT_682351] a conventional statistical test of size 0.05.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and performance reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE  version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website at:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate data collection forms. 
 10.[ADDRESS_924051] estimate of tumor size.  The following section describes the methodology. (See Figure 10.1 below for 
illustration). 
 
1. For MRI imaging (preferred), the longest diameter can be measured from the axial plane or the plane in which the tumor is best seen or measured, provided the same plane is used in follow ups. Longest diameter of target lesion(s) should be selected in the axial plane only for CT. 
2. The longest measurement of the tumor (or width, W) should be determined.  
3. The perpendicular measurement should be determined (transverse (T) measurement-perpendicular to the width in the selected plane. 
4. The cystic or necrotic components of a tumor are not considered in tumor 
measurements. Therefore only the solid component of cystic/necrotic tumors should be measured. If cysts/necrosis compose the majority of the lesion, the lesion may not be “measurable”. Options: - if the cyst/necrosis is eccentric, the W and T of the solid portion should be measured, the cyst/necrosis excluded from measurement 
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a small portion of the tumor (< 25%), disregard and measure the whole lesion 
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a large portion of the tumor, identify a solid aspect of the mass that can be reproducibly measured.  
10.2.2 Assessments of Diffuse Leptomeningeal Disease or Disease that may not be measurable in Two Dia meters  
Patients enrolled without measurable disease as defined above but with diffuse 
leptomeningeal disease OR clear MRI evidence of disease that is not  measurable in two perpendicular diameters (see Figure 10.1 below) will be assessed for disease response with scheduled MRI evaluations and CSF cytology as detailed in Section 7.1. Clear, unequivocal disease extension will be at the discretion of 
the clinical radiologist and must be noted in the MRI report.  If there is concern for disease extension that is not clear, CSF can be obtained and if newly positive for malignant cells should be considered disease progression.  Presence and 
location of leptomeningeal tumor spread should be noted, and change in extent/thickness assessed on follow up studies. 
 
 
10.2.3 Overall Response Assessment 
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non-target lesion, and the appearance of new lesions, where applicable, as defined in Table 10.2a and 10.2b. Response classifications for target lesions, non-target lesions and disease not measurable in two perpendicular diameters are defined in Section 10.4.

10.[ADDRESS_924052] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response.  
2. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non-target lesions (including CSF positive for tumor cells).  
3. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (eg, 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice). 
4. Any change in size of non-target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be measured. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria for Target Lesions 1. Response criteria are assessed in 2 dimensions – the product of WxT.  
2. To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated: 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 53 
WxT (current scan)  
WxT (reference scan) 
 
3. Development of new disease or progression in any established lesions is 
considered progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g. 
when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the progressive disease takes precedence. 
 
4. Response Criteria for target lesions: 
 
Complete Response (CR) : The disappearance of all target lesions. 
Partial response (PR) : ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the t wo 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements. 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient decrease in sum of the products of the t wo 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR (taking as reference the initial baseline measurements), nor sufficient increase in a single  target lesion to qualify for 
PD, (taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started). 
Progressive Disease (PD) : ≥ 25% increase in the product of perpendicular 
diameters of ANY target lesion, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more lesions.   
 Local progression is defined as progression of known residual tumor or the appearance of tumor at known prior sites of disease that were at some point without evidence of disease. Distant progression is defined as the appearance of tumor at sites other than known prior sites of disease. Distant progression most often occurs in the subarachnoid space and may occur at any point within the neuraxis. Although rare, extra- CNS 
metastasis represents distant failure. Combined local and distant progression is defined when evaluation of the entire neuraxis reveals local and distant progression.  5.  For patients enrolled without “measurable disease” but with clear MRI evidence of recurrent disease:   Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all lesions.  
Stable Disease (SD) / Incomplete Response (IR) : The persistence of one or more non-
target lesions but without evidence of progressive disease at any site.  Progressive Disease (PD) : The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing lesions. New CSF positive for malignant cells. 
 10.5 Response Criteria for Non-target Lesions  
Non-target lesions will only be evaluated in patients with measurable disease. 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non-target lesions.  
Stable Disease (SD) / Incomplete Response (IR) : The persistence of one or more non-
target lesions.  
  Progressive Disease (PD) : The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_924053] be reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 11.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), 
and the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of 
the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60778].   An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.   Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead 
from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply. 
• Concurrent administration: When an investigational agent is used in combination with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents. 
• Sequential administration: When a study includes an investigational agent and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of adverse events which occur prior to starting the investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial agents.  Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting guidelines. 
 
 
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol, using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS).  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_924054] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event (experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 
1) Death. 
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience. 
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for ≥ 24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_682337]. 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_924055] administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of 
a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported according to the CTEP- AER S reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP-AERS if it occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE since these are considered to be serious AEs.

o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128746] 28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the

same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying 
disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_924056] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_924057] dose of the 
investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational 
agent/intervention.  11.4.4 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary malignancy.   The NCI requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol. 
 
11.4.5 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal 
NOTE : When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy 
loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 57 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP- AERS as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the 
baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report is required. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fetal Death  
Fetal death, defined in CTCAE as “ A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128747]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation”, needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss) ”. Do 
NOT report a fetal death as a Grade 5 event since CTEP- AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life ” needs to be 
reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “General disorders and 
administration - Other (neonatal loss) ” when the death is the result 
of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study. Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.5.1 Baseli ne AEs 
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is entered on a protocol with a pre-existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re-assessed throughout the study and reported if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. 
 
a. If the pre-existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re-assess the 
event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline. 
 
11.5.2 Persistent AEs 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0821 
 
  Page 58 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.   ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe the AE must be reported again with the new grade. EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course.  
11.5.3  Recurrent AEs 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course. ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862]. EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course does not require CTEP-AERS reporting unless: 
1) The grade increases OR 
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205]. 
 
 11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 11.6.1 Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) 
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected for CTEP- AERS rep orting purposes. (Formerly referred to as the Agent 
Specific Adverse Event List (ASAEL).)   AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_682352]- AERS ONLY if they exceed the grade of the event listed in 
parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using multiple investigational agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
11.6.[ADDRESS_924058] the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner.   Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP-AERS) must also be reported via routine reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database.

11.8 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP- AERS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  An expedited AE report for all studies utilizing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be submitted electronically to NCI via CTEP- AERS at: https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers .  
 In the rare situation where Internet connectivity is disrupted, the 24-hour notification is to be made to the NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND by [CONTACT_439241] [PHONE_101].  In addition, once Internet connectivity is restored, a 24-hour notification that was phoned 
in must be entered into the electronic CTEP-AERS system by [CONTACT_253134].    
• Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as: 
o 24-Hour; [ADDRESS_924059] be 
submitted within 7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.   
• Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopardize the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via CTEP- AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent 
administration.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_924060] dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours .  
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_924061] dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 hours .  
 
CTEP -AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the 
report: 1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of 
the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60778].   Any medical documentation supporting an expedited report (eg, H & P, admission and/or notes, consultations, ECG results, etc.) MUST be faxed within 48-72 hours to the NCI.

12.0 STUDY REPORTING AND MONITORING   
 
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule are posted on the COG web site with each 
protocol under “ Data Collection/Specimens ”.  
 
12.1 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS). Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July [ADDRESS_924065] the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by [CONTACT_4305], in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.   Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC . 
The study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special 
review. Any COG member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the 
DSMC.  
 The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by [CONTACT_431676] (e.g., termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_439154], increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified in the protocol document.

APPENDIX VI: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF TEMO ZOLOMIDE 
(PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO SWALLOW CAPSULES AND CANNOT OBTAIN A 
SUSPENSION)  
 
Temozolomide is an oral cancer medicine that your child will be taking for treatment of his/her medulloblastoma /PNET . If your child is unable to swallow capsules , the following instructions must be 
followed for safe administration of this medicine.  
• Temozolomide must be kept in a dark container. 
• Temozolomide should be taken the same time every day. 
• If your child requires nausea medicine it should be taken prior to the temozolomide. 
• If the dose of temozolomide is vomited (which is unusual) within the first 20 minutes after it is 
taken, the dose should be repeated.   If your child vomits more than 20 minutes after the 
temozolomide has been taken, do not repeat the dose. 
• If the caregiver administering this medicine is pregnant or suspects she is pregnant she should not 
handle this medicine. 
 Since temozolomide is an anti-cancer agent, special precautions must be taken when handling this 
medicine.  There is potential hazard to anyone who handles this medicine once the protective capsule is opened.  Since your child is unable to swallow the capsule you will be required to open the capsules and mix the contents of the capsule in apple sauce or apple juice.  This process must be done according to the following guidelines to ensure safe administration of this medicine.  
• Find a place that is free from drafts or wind and is not an area where food is stored or prepared. 
• The work surface should be covered with an impermeable and disposable mat such as the one a 
pharmacy uses to reduce exposure to other members of the family. 
• Temozolomide can be mixed in apple sauce or apple juice. 
• Place the apple sauce or apple juice in a disposable container. 
• Put on gloves, mask and goggles (eye protection). 
• Open each capsule and place the powder in a medicine cup. 
• Add the whole contents of the medicine cup to either apple sauce or apple juice.  The medicine will not dissolve completely if mixing in apple juice so have extra apple juice on hand so you can add it to any remaining powder in the bottom of the cup. 
• If you need to have additional juice or apple sauce remove your gloves before touching the main container then place new gloves on before adding the additional juice or apple sauce to the medicine. (You do not want to contaminate the main container with any powder that may be on your gloves). 
• Anything that comes into contact [CONTACT_386284], such as the spoon used for mixing or eating the apple sauce. 
• Once all of the medicine is taken, throw away the following in the plastic bags provided to you by [CONTACT_3652]:  Medicine cup, the container the medicine was mixed in, the cover for the work surface, mask, gloves and anything else that has been in contact [CONTACT_386285]. 
• Once a course of medicine is completed bring the plastic bag with you to the clinic so it can be disposed of properly.

APPENDIX VII: Y OUTH INFORMATION SHE ETS  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A Study of New Drug Combinations in Children and Teens with Brain Tumors 
 That are Difficult to Treat or Have Come Back after Treatment 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your brain tumor . Your brain tumor has either come back 
or not gone away with the treatments you already got. 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of 
your tumor. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick.  In this study, we are trying to find out if new combinations of anti-cancer 
medicines can make your tumor get smaller or go away. We do not know if one drug combination is better than the other. That is why we are doing this study.  
 3. All c hildren who are part of this study will be treated with two drugs. Half of the children in this 
study will also be treated with a third drug. You will either get two drugs or three drugs. How 
many drugs you will get is decided on by [CONTACT_3364]. This is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin and saying, “Heads 
means I get the two-drug treatment, but tails means I get the three-drug treatment.” A computer decides which treatment you will get, not you or your doctor. 
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the drug combinations will work to make your tumor smaller or go away but we do not know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are called “risks.” One risk to you from this study is that the study treatments may not work as 
well as other treatments to get rid of the tumor for as long as possible. Another risk is that you may have more side effects from the three-drug treatment than the two-drug treatment. Other things may happen to you that we do not yet know about. 
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions you have.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY  
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
 
A Study of New Drug Combinations in Children and Teens with Brain Tumors 
 That are Difficult to Treat or Have Come Back after Treatment 
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about medulloblastoma/PNET tumors . Medulloblastoma and 
PNET are types of cancer that grow in the brain.  Your tumor has either come back or not gone 
away with previous treatments. 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of 
your medulloblastoma/ PNET  tumor. A research study is when doctors work together to try out 
new ways to help people who are sick. In this study, doctors want to try new combinations of 
anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) to see if the se new drug combinations will work well to make 
your tumor get smaller or go away. 
 
3. All children and teens who are part of this study will be treated with a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, called temozolomide and irinotecan. This drug combination has been used to treat children and teens with other types of cancer. This study will also see if adding another drug to the combination will work better to make the tumor smaller or go away. This added drug is called bevacizumab. It has been used in studies of adults and children with other types of tumors.    
 4. This study is called a randomized study, because you will be randomly assigned to get one drug combination or the other. This is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin and saying, “Heads means I get the t wo-
drug chemotherapy, but tails means I get the three-drug chemotherapy.” A computer decides which chemotherapy plan you will be on, not you or your doctor. Studies like this one are done to learn which drug combination works best and to make sure the number of people is equal among the groups. We do not know if one drug combination is better than another.  
 5. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the drug combinations will make your tumor get smaller or go away, but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
6. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are called “risks.” One risk to you from this study is that the treatment you get may not work as 
well as other treatments to get rid of the tumor for as long as possible. Another risk is that you may have more side effects from the drugs if you get the three-drug combination. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
7. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions you have.

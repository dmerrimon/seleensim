Introduction
 
 
This
 
study
 
focuses
 
on
 
public
 
support
 
for
 
prison
 
nutrition
 
standards—a
 
policy
 
that
 
would
 
require
 
U.S.
 
prisons
 
to
 
serve
 
meals
 
that
 
abide
 
by
 
[CONTACT_548313].
 
Specifically,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
examine
 
whether
 
different
 
framings
 
explaining
 
the
 
rationale
 
for
 
the
 
policy
 
change
 
public
 
support
 
for
 
prison
 
nutrition
 
standards.
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
also
 
explore
 
whether
 
demographic
 
characteristics,
 
such
 
as
 
political
 
affiliation
 
or
 
previous
 
interaction
 
with
 
the
 
criminal
 
legal
 
system
 
moderate
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
policy
 
rationale
 
on
 
public
 
support.
 
This
 
document
 
pre-specifies
 
our
 
planned
 
analytic
 
approach
 
prior
 
to
 
data
 
collection.
 
 
 
Study
 
protocol
 
 
In
 
an
 
online
 
survey,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
imagine
 
a
 
new
 
U.S.
 
policy
 
which
 
would
 
require
 
prisons
 
to
 
serve
 
meals
 
that
 
meet
 
the
 
government
 
definition
 
of
 
healthy.
 
In
 
a
 
between-subjects
 
experiment,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
assigned
 
to
 
view
 
1
 
of
 
3
 
different
 
rationales
 
for
 
the
 
new
 
policy
—
public
 
safety,
 
right-to-health,
 
or
 
cost-saving
—
or
 
be
 
assigned
 
to
 
a
 
control
 
arm
 
where
 
no
 
rationale
 
is
 
given.
 
After
 
viewing
 
the
 
rationale,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
whether
 
they
 
would
 
strongly
 
support,
 
somewhat
 
support,
 
neither
 
support
 
or
 
oppose,
 
somewhat
 
oppose,
 
or
 
strongly
 
oppose
 
the
 
policy.
 
Participants
 
will
 
also
 
answer
 
demographic
 
questions.
 
 
 
Statistical
 
analysis

Predictions
 
 
We
 
predict
 
that
 
public
 
support
 
will
 
be
 
higher
 
among
 
participants
 
who
 
are
 
assigned
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
3
 
policy
 
rationales
 
vs.
 
no
 
rationale
 
(control).
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
predictions
 
as
 
to
 
which
 
rationale
 
will
 
elicit
 
the
 
highest
 
public
 
support.
 
 
 
Statistical
 
methods
 
 
Using
 
linear
 
regression,
 
we
 
will
 
regress
 
policy
 
support
 
on
 
indicator
 
variables
 
for
 
the
 
experimental
 
arm,
 
excluding
 
the
 
control
 
arm
 
as
 
referent.
 
In
 
this
 
model,
 
policy
 
support
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
a
 
continuous
 
variable
 
with
 
responses
 
ranging
 
from
 
1
 
(representing
 
strongly
 
oppose)
 
to
 
5
 
(strongly
 
support).
 
Analyses
 
will
 
estimate
 
average
 
differential
 
effects
 
(ADE,
 
differences
 
in
 
predicted
 
means)
 
for
 
each
 
rationale
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
control.
 
We
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
two-sided
 
critical
 
alpha
 
of
 
0.[ADDRESS_717719]
 
all
 
statistical
 
tests.
 
All
 
confidence
 
intervals
 
presented
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
95%
 
confidence
 
level.
 
We
 
will
 
then
 
use
 
pairwise
 
comparisons
 
to
 
compare
 
the
 
predicted
 
outcomes
 
for
 
each
 
rationale
 
to
 
one
 
another,
 
using
 
Bonferroni-Holm
 
corrected
 
p-values,
 
to
 
adjust
 
for
 
these
 
[ADDRESS_717720]-hoc
 
tests.
 
 
We
 
will
 
use
 
linear
 
regression
 
to
 
examine
 
correlates
 
of
 
policy
 
support.
 
We
 
will
 
regress
 
policy
 
support
 
on
 
the
 
following
 
demographic
 
characteristics
 
in
 
a
 
multivariable
 
model:
  
 
 
●
 
Reason
 
for
 
policy
 
(experimental
 
arm,
 
with
 
control
 
arm
 
as
 
referent)
 
●
 
Age
 
●
 
Gender
 
●
 
Race/
 
ethnicity
 
●
 
Income
 
●
 
Education
 
 
●
 
Political
 
party
 
affiliation
 
 
●
 
Having
 
prior
 
interactions
 
with
 
the
 
criminal
 
legal
 
system
 
●
 
Holding
 
biases
 
toward
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
incarcerated
 
 
For
 
all
 
analyses,
 
we
 
will
 
exclude
 
participants
 
who
 
complete
 
<90%
 
of
 
the
 
survey
 
or
 
who
 
complete
 
the
 
survey
 
implausibly
 
quickly
 
(defined
 
as
 
<1/3
 
of
 
the
 
median
 
completion
 
time).

This
 
study
 
will
 
occur
 
as
 
an
 
auxiliary
 
study
 
to
 
an
 
experiment
 
examining
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
nudges
 
on
 
improving
 
the
 
healthfulness
 
and
 
environmental
 
sustainability
 
of

purchases
 
(i.e.,
 
the
 
parent
 
study).
 
The
 
total
 
sample
 
size
 
(~1,200
 
participants)
 
was
 
calculated
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
anticipated

sizes
 
in
 
the

study.

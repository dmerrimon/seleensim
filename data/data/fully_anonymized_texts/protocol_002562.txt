Version 3 – November [ADDRESS_724051] (GTE) -rich confection . Our central hypothesis  is that  obese adults will have altered 
catechin pharmacokinetics compared to healthy adults  and that  chronic ingestion of a GTE -rich 
confection  in obese adults will attenuate  metabolic endotoxemia  by [CONTACT_226699] -derived endotoxin 
translocation  and modulating gut microbiota composition. Metabolic endotoxemia is a condition 
characterized by [CONTACT_551059] , but at levels 10 -50 times lower than  during sepsis 
(1). To test this, we will  complete the following objectives: 1) define alterations in catechin 
pharmacokinetic s by [CONTACT_157934] ( obese vs healthy adults ), 2) evaluate gastrointestinal -level 
suppression of metabolic endotoxemia by [CONTACT_551060] s, and 3) define changes in gut microbiota 
composition with GTE in relation to improvements in metabolic endotoxemia. Upon completing this 
study, we expect to provide translational evidence for the efficacy of a novel GTE -rich confection to  
attenuate metabolic endotoxemia and alter gut microbiota composition in obese adults. In addition, 
this study will provide preliminary evidence for future controlled trials investigating the benef icial 
impact of GTE in cohorts with underlying obesity, and other obesity -related metabolic disorders 
characterized by [CONTACT_2898] . 
 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis . Nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease in the U.S., affecting over 70 million 
American adults (2). NAFLD is the broad term used to describe a spectrum of progressive chronic 
liver conditions, which includes  liver steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis . 
NASH is characterized by  [CONTACT_384113], hepatocyte ballooning, and inflammation (3). In the U.S., 
approximately 10 -18 million Americans are diagnosed with NASH  (4, 5) . However, these statistics 
are likely under estimating the true prevalence  since accurate diagnosis of the condition is complicated 
due to its asymptomatic presentation and requirement of a liver biopsy (5, 6) . Further exacerbating  
this epi[INVESTIGATOR_551048] -approved treatments for 
NASH, other than weight management strategies. Major risk factors associated with NASH are 
obesity and type 2 diabetes (2, 7 -9). Evidence suggests that between 25 -94% (10-12) and 55 -70% 
(13, 14)  of obese and type [ADDRESS_724052] NASH. Therefore, intervening during 
obesity, in a prophylactic or preventative manner has the potential to mitigate the  long-risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_551049].  
 
Green tea rich confections are a novel catechin delivery system.  Green tea is safe when consumed 
as recommended (15). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_551050] 10 servings/d of green 
tea (equivalent to 1 g/d of GTE)  lowers the risk of liver injury and inflammation (16). Freshly brewed 
green tea is an effective catechin delivery system, and has shown to deliver maximum plasma 
concentrations of catech ins (0.19 -0.73 M) aroun d 1.[ADDRESS_724053] -ingestion with levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_551051] 3 hours (17, 18) . To maintain a sustained plasma catechin level, it would requi re 
frequent ingestion of green tea, which is neither convenient nor practical for individuals. Previously, 
our lab , in collaboration with the Department of Food Science  ([CONTACT_551082]) , developed a 
starch -based green tea extract (GTE) -rich confection that effectively delivered 1 g  of decaffeinated 
GTE to adults  (19). After i ngestion of the GTE -rich confections , maximal plasma catechin 
concentrations (0.45 -1.68 M) were reached  about 2.[ADDRESS_724054] -ingestion peri od (19). Chronic 
exposure  of green tea catechins may lead to intestinal adaptations  that enhances  catechin absorption

 2 and metabolism (20). Not only are GTE -rich confections a ble to adequately deliver catechins, but are 
more appr opriate for frequent ingestion and are palatable, and more acceptable compared with 
brewed green tea  that tends to be perceived by [CONTACT_551061] (19, 21) . For this 
application, our previously developed GTE -rich conf ection will be modified to be low -carbohydrate 
and low -calorie compared to our prior formulation that contained starch (50 g)  (19). 
 
Catechins undergo extensive biotransformation with varying bioavailability . Green tea is a dietary 
rich source of catechins, comprising up to 30% of the dry weight (22). The four maj or catechins found 
in green tea are epi[INVESTIGATOR_99907] (EGCG), epi[INVESTIGATOR_27145] (EGC), epi[INVESTIGATOR_390860] (ECG), 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] (EC) (23, 24) . Catechin pharmacokinetics in humans have been thoroughly studied  
(17, 18, 25 -30). Maximum plasma catechin concentrations range  from 0.07 -1.8 M at approximately 
1-[ADDRESS_724055] -ingestion with half -lives of about  2.5-5.7 hours (17, 30) . Additionally, catechins 
undergo extensive biotransformation , mainly through glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, and 
ring-fission pathways in the live r and small and large intestines (31-35). EGCG appears primarily in 
the free form (unconjugated) in the blood (18, 26) , while more than 80% of the catechins are in 
conjugated forms (25). Suggesting that the conjugated forms are more bioavailable than their parent 
compounds. Furthermore, unabsorbed catechins are metabolized by [CONTACT_551062]  (e.g. valerolactones) and phenolic acids (e.g. hydroxybenzoic acid)  that appear in the blood 
and urine of humans (32, 34, 36) . Although these microbial metabolites are mostly prevalent in urine 
(34), maximal plasma concentrations  have been found in levels greater than 0.2 M (37). The 
bioactivity of conjugated and catechin -derived microbial metabolites have been limitedly study, but 
evidence suggests potential antiinflammatory properties  (33, 38, 39) . Although the metabolism and 
pharmacokinetics of green tea catechins are well studied, most of these studies have been conducted 
in healthy adults. The extent to which catechin pharmacokinetics and metabolism are influenced by 
[CONTACT_551063] . 
 
Green tea attenuates metabolic endotoxemia and improves gut barrier function.  Obesity -mediated 
NASH is implicated through a mechanism involving the gut -liver axis. A key mechanism involves 
binding of the ligand endotoxin to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) , which in turn induces pro -
inflammatory signaling leading to NF B activation and hepatic inflammation. The gut  microbiota  is 
the major source of endotoxin, where it is  found in the outer membrane  of Gram -negative bacteria 
(40). Translocation of gut-derived endotoxin to the liver is primarily du e to increased intestinal 
permeability, mediated in part by [CONTACT_551064] (41, 42) . Our preclinical 
studies  show that GTE treatment attenuates hepatic NF B activation and lowers systemic and portal 
vein endotoxin, otherwise increased in obese mice with NASH  (43). Additionally, we show that  GTE 
improves  gut barrier function  by [CONTACT_551065] 
(occludin , zonal occuldin -1, claudin) to similar levels of healthy controls (43). Studies in humans  
support our findings, showing  obese and NASH patients have  increased endotoxin and gut 
permeability compared to healthy individuals (44-46). Thus , rationale exists to examine GTE 
ingestion as a dietary strategy to mitigate metabolic endotoxemia by [CONTACT_551066].  
 
Green tea alters gut microbiota composition.  Emerging evidence has highlighted the important role 
of the gut microbiota in the development of NASH  (47, 48) . Green tea catechins and the host 
microbiota exhibit a reciprocal rel ationship, where catechins are metabolized to more bioavailable 
metabolites by [CONTACT_551067] (49). Studies 
in mice showed that  a green tea infusion and fermented green tea mitigate  obesity and NASH 
symptoms  (50, 51) . Both studies showed distinct alterations in microbiota composition in the obese 
mice, specifically increases in the  Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, typi[INVESTIGATOR_551052] 3 – November 22 , 2017  
 
 3 and typ e 2 diabetes. However, only the fermented green tea restore d the Firmi cutes/Bacteroidetes 
and Bacteroide tes/Prevotella  ratios to that of control mice.  Green tea catechins modulate the gut 
microbiota possibly through  prebiotic  (52-54) and/or antimicrobial (55-57) mechanisms . In vivo  and 
in vitro  studies have shown the beneficial impact of green tea in inhibiting and reducing pathogenic 
bacteria populations (e.g. Clostridium perfringens , E. coli ) and promoting beneficial/commensal 
bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium  spp., Lactobacillus  sp.) growth (55, 5 6). These data support the health -
promoting effects of green tea on modulating gut microbiota composition.   
 
In conclusion , evidence shows that 1) obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with  NASH, 2) green 
tea-rich confections are an effective  catechin delivery system, 3) catechins are considerably 
biotransformed , and 4) green tea is effective in attenuating metabolic endotoxemia, improving gut 
barrier function, and modulating gut microbiota composition. Our team has the expertise and 
experienc e to safely conduct pharmacokinetic trial s and perform controlled intervention s to assess 
metabolic parameters, gut barrier permeability, and gut microbiota composition. Thus, conducting 
this innovative study will further advance the scientific knowledge o f green tea in humans  and help 
to establish timely dietary recommendations that reduce inflammation in association with obesity .   
 
Anticipated Results  
Our clinical studies showed that a novel GTE -rich confection was a n effective delivery system for 
catechins (19). We expect the GTE -rich confections  to retain its effectiveness , even after modifying 
its composition to create a low carbohydrate and low calorie snack food product . Pharmacokinetic 
studies of green tea catechins have been extensively studied in healthy individuals. However,  the 
extent to which catechin pharmacokinetics are altered in obese individuals has not been reported . We 
anticipate that obese individuals will have impaired catechin pharmacokinetic parameters ( e.g. 
bioavailability, half -life) compared with healthy adults . Furthermore,  prior studies in our lab show 
that GTE ameliorates hepatic inflammation in obese mice with NASH  by [CONTACT_551068] -derived endotoxin translocation (43, 58) . Based on these preclinical 
findings , we expect that obese individuals will have increased end otoxin levels and gut permeability 
compared to healthy controls and that chronic GTE ingestion will mitigate these parameters. Finally, 
evidence in animals (59, 60)  and humans (61, 62)  suggest a reduced microbial diversity and increased 
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes  ratio is associated with an obese phenotype. In addition, obese and NASH 
patient s showed increased abundance of Gram -negative bacteria and higher levels of endotoxin  
compared to healthy individuals (63). Therefore, we expect that obese individuals will exhibit a less 
diverse microb iota composition , greater abundance of Firmicutes  compared to Bacteroidetes , and 
increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria  and chronic GTE consumption will modulate these 
effects.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_551053], and the techniques 
proposed for this study have been well established in our laboratory. Therefore, we do not expect to 
experience any technical problems or difficulties in this a pplication.  
 
Sign ificance of the Research and Potential Benefits  
NAFLD is the most prevalent liver disease in the U.S. affecting 80 -100 million Americans (64), 
which is largely associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (6, 10 -14, 65) . Although several 
mechanisms are involved in the develo pment of NASH  from NAFLD , metabolic endotoxemia due 
to increased gut barrier permeability and alterations in gut microbiota are highly implicated.  Findings 
of this application are expected to provide the first evidence using a  novel  GTE -rich confection  (i.e. 
snack food)  to assess catechin pharmacokinetics in association with improvements in  metabolic  
endotoxemia, gut permeability, and gut micro biota composition to improve gut health, otherwise

Version 3 – November [ADDRESS_724056] a  randomized, double -blind placebo controlled trial in obese and healthy ind ividuals. 
We will enroll overweight/obese (BMI = 28-40 kg/m2) and age- and gender -matched healthy (BMI 
19-24 kg/m2) men and women (18-50 y; n = 20/group ). Participants will be block randomized to 
receive  GTE -rich (1 g GTE)  or placebo confections  and will be asked to consume the confections 
daily f or 4 wk. Prior to (0 wk) and following [ADDRESS_724057] fasting blood, 24 -
hour urine, and 3 -d fecal samples. Additionally, at the beginning (0 wk) , participants w ill perform  a 
sugar probe test to assess gut permeability and a 12-h pharmacokinetics tr ial to assess green tea 
catechin absorption, metabolism, and elimination.  At the end of the intervention (4 wk), participants 
will perform a second sugar probe test to assess  gastrointestinal  changes associated with chronic GTE 
supplementation.  Blood collected at wk 0, 2, and 4 will be used to assess blood chemistries (i.e. liver 
function, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance , markers of inflammation ). In addition, blood pressure, 
anthropometrics, and [ADDRESS_724058] previously developed a starch -based 
GTE -rich confection  (19) as a successful catechin delivery system. For this application, w e will 
modify this confection to produce a GTE -rich confection that is low calorie and carbohydrate while 
delivering 1 g of decaffeinated  GTE. Decaffeinated GTE will be used to minimize potential side 
effects such as excess caffeine consumption and caffein e/drug interactions that may occur. One 
confection will provide about 18 calories. Thus, 6 confections will provide about 110 calories per 
day, while providing 1 g of decaffein ated GTE. The catechin profile 82% catechins (w/w); 63 % 
EGCG, 18% EGC, 10% ECG, 9% EC as we verified (19) is similar to that of freshly brewed green 
teas. All ingredients used will be food grade , meaning they are food certified safe for human 
consumption . The formulation consists of water, sucrose, gelatin, citric acid, and lime flavoring  for 
treatment blinding. Sucrose is the m ain carbohydrate source because sugar alcohols alter microbiota 
composition (66). Placebo confections will be made identical to GTE -rich confections, but without 
GTE.  Confections will have a similar sweet taste, soft texture, and consistency as commercially 
available lime-flavored Jell-O®. To deliver 1 g GTE, 6 confections ( ~1 cm3) will be consumed each 
day throughout the intervention; 2 with each meal. Confections will be packaged into single -serve, 
oxygen impermeable containers, and coded for study  blinding. Participants will be instructed to 
refrigerate the confections  to maintain freshness and quality .  
 
B. Sample  
 
Enrollment Criteria.  Overweight/ obese  men and women are the ideal study population because of 
its close association with NASH (6, 10 -14, 65) . Obese/overweight p articipants  will be required to

Recruitment . We will recruit participants through posted flyers, e -mail, electronic and newsprint 
advertisements (e.g. campus student and faculty/staff newspapers, local and regional newspapers), 
word of mouth, and through use of ResearchMatch (OSU CCTS). The posted advertisements will 
instruct interested participants to call the study center (Bruno Laboratory, Department of Human 
Sciences) to obtain further information. During the phone -in hours, a  trained individual (i.e. project 
coordinator or graduate assistant) will be available to describe the study and determine preliminary 
qualification by [CONTACT_14664] a scripted phone interview (e.g. do you take dietary supplements?, do 
you smoke ?; see Phone S cript  attachment  ). The individual will record answers and assess whether 
or not the person calling is likely or not to be an acceptable study participant. If the caller and the 
interviewer agree that the caller should participate, the prospective particip ant will be invited to a 
screening meeting, where the study will be fully described and the individual will be provided a 
consent form to complete prior to any involvement in the study procedures. Data collected during 
this phase will include participant’s  age, health status, physical activity, and contact [CONTACT_3031] 
(see Informed Consent  attachment ). Recruiting efforts through ResearchMatch will utilize a 
strategy whereby [CONTACT_551069] -identifiable volunteer profile in the system. Unidentified individuals meeting search 
criteria will then be forwarded an electronic recruitment message (see ResearchMatch Recruitment 
Message  attachment ) that identifies them as a potential match for study participation. The secure 
ResearchMatch clearinghouse will route this standard notificatio n that provides specific study 
content (i.e. content similar to that of a posted advertisement) to each of these potential 
ResearchMatch volunteers who will then have the option of replying “yes”, “no”, or not respond 
through a set of quick links available  in this notification.  Note:  This message will not include the 
study’s direct contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g. email, phone) as ResearchMatch will measure the response 
rate through the clearinghouse’s quick links made available in this electronic message. The 
response rate metrics will be made available to researchers through their ResearchMatch dashboard 
as well as the Institutional Liaison dashboards. By [CONTACT_182755] “yes”, the volunteer has authorized 
ResearchMatch to release their contact [CONTACT_551070]. This 
information will be made available on the researcher’s ResearchMatch study dashboard. The 
researcher will be responsible for managing this contact [CONTACT_182756] -
approved study protocol. Research Match will also be collecting aggregate data regarding the status 
of ResearchMatch volunteers within the study. ResearchMatch volunteers consent to this within the 
ResearchMatch volunteer agreement. The ResearchMatch enrollment continuum will allow 
researc hers to indicate where the volunteer currently stands within the recruitment process and thus 
helps researchers monitor the utility and effectiveness of this recruiting tool. Research access to 
recruit through ResearchMatch will last only as long as the du ration of IRB -study approval with the 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_182719] -date of OSU IRB approval. 
Researchers will be able to submit current IRB -approval letters for the lifetime of the study and 
thus provide evidence of successfu l continuing review applications. If an unintentional lapse in time 
occurs and the research is not able to submit this continuing review evidence via ResearchMatch, 
stored ResearchMatch data will not be deleted, but the researcher will not have access to t his 
information until a current IRB -approval letter is uploaded and routed to the Institutional Liaison 
for review. A complete description of ResearchMatch along with the most current IRB approval 
from Vanderbilt University (i.e. this is the site where Res earchMatch was developed and its secure 
computer server s are housed) has been attached.

 6 Power Calculation  and Data Analysis . A power calculation was performed using serum endotoxin 
(lipopolysaccharide; LPS) as the primary outcome. Studies in obese  (44, 67, 6 8) adults and 
individuals with  metabolic syn drome  (69, 70)  show increased serum LPS or LPS -binding protein  
compared to healthy controls . The known difference in metabolic endotoxemia between obese  and 
healthy adults  was used to predict an expected 50 % improvement by [CONTACT_551071].  Based on a 
linear model with treatment and healt h status, we will have >90% power to detect the primary 
contrast of interest (GTE vs. placebo in obese  individuals ) and additionally 80% power to detect an 
interaction between treatment and health status (α=0.05).  Thus, we plan to recruit [ADDRESS_724059] data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_551072] e ffects due to health status, gender, GTE treatment, and their interactions. 
Multivariate regression analysis will be performed to define pairwise correlations between study 
variables in the presence or absence of potential study covariates. Statistical sig nificance for all 
analyses will be set at  P < 0.05. 
 
C. Measurement/Instrumentation  
 
Anthropometric Parameters and Blood Pressure.  At screening, participants will rest for [ADDRESS_724060] 
circumference will be assessed at the level of the umbilicus using a nonflexible measuring tape.  
 
Blood/Urine  Chemistries.  Fasting p lasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glucose will be 
measured  by [CONTACT_226679] (Pointe Scientific) at screening and throughout the study. Fasting insulin 
will be measured by [CONTACT_6428] (ALPCO) during  the 4 -wk study . Serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)  and urinary creatinine  will also be measured throughout the study (Pointe Scientific ).  
 
Diet Assessment.  Participants will be instructed to maintain a low -polyphenol diet  throughout the 
study . Participants will record any consumption of polyphenol -rich foods throughout the study (a 
record sheet will be provided, see Polyphenol Intake Record  attachment). Participants  will be 
instructed to abstain  from polyphenol -rich foods including  tea of any ki nd, coffee, fruits, fruit 
juices, chocolate, nuts , legumes , and wine  (a list will be provided, see List of Polyphenol -Rich 
Foods  attachment ). Food records (3 -d) will be evaluated at wk 0, 2, and 4 using NDSR software 
and the NCC Flavonoid and Proanthocyanin database to assess energy, nutrient, and flavonoid 
intakes as we described (19, 71) . 
 
Plasma  and Urine Catechin a nd Catechin -metabolites.  To assess the absorption, metabolism, and 
excretion of green tea catechins during the pharmacokinetic s trial (wk 0), plasma and urine catechin 
and catechin -metabolites will be measured by [CONTACT_60628] -mass spectromet ry (LC -MS). 
Green tea catechins (EGCG, ECG, EGC, EC) and their metabolites (e.g. valerolactones) will be 
measured using an adapted LC -MS method (72).  
 
Metabolic Endotoxemia . Serum endotoxin will be measured at wk 0, 2, and 4 using a commercially 
available fluorometric assay that assess es endotoxin -mediated activation of recombinant Factor C 
and subsequent cleavage of a flurogenic substrate (PyroGene rFC; Lonza) as we detailed (43).  
 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Permeability.  A 4-sugar probe procedure  appropriate for human clinical 
study will be performed as described (73). In brief, at wk [ADDRESS_724061] a 500-mL solution of sucrose (40 g), lactulose (5 g), mannito l (1 g) and sucralose (1 g)  
dissolved in water . Urine will be collected over a 24 -hour period to assess GI permeability. 
Standardized sucrose -free meals  (i.e. plain  bagel, cream cheese, scrambled eggs,  potato chips ) will

Version 3 – November 22 , 2017  
 
 7 be provided during the urine collection duration. Urinary sugars will be measured by [CONTACT_29864] -MS and 
permeability calculated as urinary excretion (% ) and excretion ratios for sugars from [ADDRESS_724062] upper and lower GI permeability, respectively (74-77).  
 
Inflammation.  During the 4 -wk intervention , we will define systemic and intestinal inflammation 
and the effects of GTE consumption.  Circulating C -reactive protein and myeloperoxidase  will 
provide information as to systemic inflammation , and fecal calprotectin will provide information 
regarding intestinal inflammation (78). These inflammatory markers will be measured using 
commercially available ELISA kits as we described  (70). Additionally, we plan to perform 
polymerase chain reaction experiments to assess p ro-inflammatory gene expression of white blood 
cells. 
 
Microbiota Composition.  Microbiota composition will be assessed from feces collected from  3 
days during week 0 and  4 using previously described procedures (79-83). Total bacterial abu ndance 
will be determined by [CONTACT_62865] (84). Microbiota diversity and community structure will be determined 
for each sample by [CONTACT_36086] 16S rRNA genes using MiSeq. Bacteria will be identified  by 
[CONTACT_551073] (OTU) with databases. 
Multivariate analysis techniques will be used to determine differences in obese and healthy 
individuals the effects of GTE.  
 
D. Detailed Study Procedures  
 
Overview of Study Procedures.  Potential participants who call the study center  in an anonymous 
manner  for more information as well as those identified through ResearchMatch will be given a 
brief  description about the study and asked a few questions to determine their eligibility ( see Phone 
Script  attachment ). If they meet the eligible criteria, they will be invited to the study center for a 
screening meeting. During the meeting, the Informed Consent ( see Informed Consent  attachment ) 
will be explained and provided for t hem to review. The participant will then be given the 
opportunity to review the Informed Consent form. If he/she chooses to participate in the study, they 
will then be asked to provide written consent. Women choosing to participate will also be asked to 
self-administer a urinary pregnancy test. If women self -report that the pregnancy test is negative, 
they will continue with the screening process. After receiving informed consent, the participants’ 
height, weight, waist circumference , and blood pressure wil l be measured. Additionally, a small  
fasting  blood sample will be collected to blood chemistry analysis. If they are not fasted at least 10 
hours), they will be asked to come back in the fasted state at time of mu tual convenience. These 
blood results in combination with anthropometric parameters will determine the participant’s 
eligibility.  
 
Eligible participants who agree to proceed with the study will be invited to meet with a registered 
dietitian or trained research personnel who will instr uct them on how to  complete a dietary food 
record , explain the details regarding following a low -polyphenol diet throughout the intervention,  
and provide instruction of foods to avoid prior to the pharmacokinetic trial  at wk [ADDRESS_724063]  
Version 3 – November [ADDRESS_724064] met the initial criteria of the study (based on 
the telephone interview) will be invited to the study center at a mutually convenient time. During 
this time, the participant and a member of the research team will meet in a p rivate, quiet conference 
room or office. The individual will be provided the informed consent form, and its contents will be 
described to the potential participant. The participant will then have the opportunity to review it, 
and if they choose to particip ate in the study, they will be asked to provide written consent. 
Although the participant will be asked to sign the informed consent, the participant will be told that 
they will not be asked to participate if their body measurements , blood pressure, or plasma 
chemistries  (see Enrollment Criteria ) do not meet the study criteria.  All female participants will be 
asked to undergo a  self-administered  pregnancy test using a pregnancy urine test strip to ensure that 
only non -pregnant  women are included in the study.  If the participant has provided consent, we will 
then measure the participant’s height, weight, waist circumferen ce, and blood pressure. Next, if the 
participant is fasted for at least 10 hours , we will ask if a trained in dividual can draw  a small blood 
sample (10  mL; 1 tube ) so that we may measure blood chemistries (glucose, c holesterol, 
triglyceride). All samples will be coded to maintain participant anonymity. If the participant’s 
anthropometrics, blood pressure, or plasma chemistries do not meet the study criteria, they will be 
told that do not meet the study criteria.  
 
Potential participants who meet the criteria, will be contact[CONTACT_11252] a few days after their 
screening meeting to provide them with their blood and bod y measurement results and inform them 
of their eligibility to participate in the study. Consistent with our CLIA exemption, blood results 
will be provided in a categorical manner (i.e. “normal”, “marginally high”, “high”) rather than 
providing actual blood  concentrations of lab values  (see Subjects Results Sheet ). Potential 
participants having any blood values outside of the “normal range” will be directed/encouraged to 
follow -up with their own phys ician. Those having body measurements, blood pressure, and blood 
values  within acceptable limits (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria), will be invited to participate in 
the study. Subjects will be included or excluded based on a best fit of the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (an example of best fit would be if a p otential subject ’s BMI is 27 kg/m2, which is outside 
the specified BMI inclusion range for overweight/obese participants  they might still be included in 
the study if they meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria more closely than other potential 
subjects). Participants will be read one phone script if they qualify and another phone script if they 
do not qualify (see Participant Eligibility Phone Script  attachment ). Potential participants who 
qualify for the study will be communicated a message as follows: I have your screening results. 
“Congratulations, you meet the eligibility criteria for our clinical trial. Your bo dy measurements, 
blood pressure, and fasting blood chemistries of glucose, triglyceride , and cholesterol were all 
within the specified range. Your glucose falls in the [category], triglyceride falls in the [category] , 
and cholesterol falls in the [category ]. A summary of your results has been prepared for you, which 
you will receive when you come in for your trials. We look forward to and are thankful for your 
participation. ” Potential participants who do not qualify will be provided the following message: “I 
have your screening results. Unfortunately, you do not meet the eligibility criteria for our clinical

Dietary Meeting.  Eligible participants who meet the study inclusion criteria, a dietary meeting will 
be scheduled with a registered dietitian or trained individual (i.e. nutritional sciences grad uate 
student) from the research team. During the dietary meeting, the dietitian/trained individual will 
show the participant ho w to properly complete the [ADDRESS_724066]  (see Diet Record Form 
attachment) . Participants are expected  to follow a low-polyphenol diet  throughout the intervention  
to avoid potential confounding effects on the study outcomes. The dietitian/trained individual will 
clearly identify  polyphenol -rich foods/drinks participants should avoid during the study  and inform 
them to record if they accidently consume any polyphenol -rich foods/drinks during the study (see  
List of Polyphenol -Rich Foods  and Polyphenol Intake Record attachment s). The dietitian/trained 
individual will inform the participant of key foods to avoid, which includes any type of tea, coffee, 
fruits, fruit juices, chocolate, nuts, legumes, and wine. These foods are known to be rich in 
polyphenols, and consumption may co nfound the interpretation  of the pharmacokinetics trial  and 
intervention . In addition to diet ary advice, the participant will be informe d of the proper way to 
collect their urine and feces using the provided sterile collection containers. Fecal samples will be 
collected by [CONTACT_551074] [ADDRESS_724067] 
(wk 0 and  4) and their wk [ADDRESS_724068] Trials.  Participants will be block randomized into two groups to receive either a GTE -rich or 
placebo ( without  GTE) confection. Participants will complete a pharmacokinetics trial prior to 
starting the intervention. Prior to ( wk 0) and following [ADDRESS_724069] trials . For each study center visit, participants will report in a fasted state (10 -12 hours) .  
 
Prior to the first study visit, participants will complete a [ADDRESS_724070] 
beverage  of 40 g sucrose, 5 g lactulose, 1 g manni tol, and 1 g sucralose dissolved in water (500 
mL). After ingestion, the participants will be provided a standardized sucrose -free meal within the 
first [ADDRESS_724071] one -half the daily GTE -
rich confections  (0.5 g GTE). Blood will then be collected at the following  hourly  time points: 0 
(before confection ingestion), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, [ADDRESS_724072]  
Version 3 – November 22 , 2017  
 
 10 Upon completing the pharmacokinetics trial, the intervention phase will begin. Participants will be 
provid ed a 2 -week  supply of GTE -rich or placebo confections. They will be advised to consume 6 
confections/  every day (2 confections/meal; 1 g GTE/ d) for the following 4-wk. After [ADDRESS_724073] will 
be conducted as described (73). Upon arrival, participants  will be asked to empty their urinary 
bladder. Subsequently, they will then be asked to ingest a drink containing 40 g sucrose, 5 g 
lactulose, 1 g mannitol, and 1 g sucralose dissolved in water (500 mL). Within [ADDRESS_724074] 3 -d prior to the 
pharmacokinetics trial, participants will abstain from polyphenol -rich foods and drinks, including 
any type of tea, coffee, fruits, fruit juices, any chocolate  (dark, milk) , nuts, legumes  (soy) , and 
wine. Participants will arrive to the study center after abstaining from food a nd only consuming 
water for [ADDRESS_724075] blood collection, 
participants will consume 3 GTE -rich confections ( 0.5 g GTE). Blood samples will be collected at 
0 (prior to ingestion ), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, and [ADDRESS_724076] will perform all cannula insertions, needle sticks, 
and blood collection s. After the 12  h trial, participants will be provided with a light snack (e.g. 
granola bar) and prepared standardized polyphenol -free meals to consume for the remainder  of the 
24-h urine collection period . Participants will also be provided with a 2 -wk su pply of GTE -rich or 
placebo confections. Participants will be advised to consume 6 confections each day (2 per meal; 
1 g GTE/d) for the entire 4-week  intervention study . Participants will be contact[CONTACT_551075], text, or phone, by [CONTACT_551076].

Intervention Phase  / Test Confections . After completing the pharmacokinetics trial, participants 
will partake in a 4 wk intervention. Participants will be block randomized to receive a GTE -rich or 
placebo (no GTE containing) confection. Confections will be low carbohydrate and low calorie. 
Each serving (6 g) provides <15 kcal, while delivering 1 g of decaffeinated GTE. The catechin 
profile (82% catechins (w/w); 63% EGCG, 18% EGC, 10% ECG , 9% EC) is similar to that of 
freshly brewed green teas. Sucrose will be the main carbohydrate source because sugar alcohols 
alter microbiota composition  (66) and would confound interpretation. Decaffeinated GTE was 
chosen to minimize potential side effects to prevent excess caffeine consumption or caffeine/drug 
interactions that could result during comorbidity management of me tabolic conditions. Placebo 
confections will be identical to GTE -rich confections , but without GTE. Confections will be 
packaged in single -serve, oxygen impermeable containers, and coded for study blinding.  
Participants will be asked to store the confectio ns in the refrigerator to maintain quality and 
freshness.  
 
Participants will be asked to consume 6 confections each day (2 with each meal) for 4 weeks. 
Consumption of 6 GTE -rich confections is equivalent to delivering 1 g GTE/d. Participants will 
receive a [ADDRESS_724077] through 
the intervention (wk 2), participants will visit the study center in a fasted state (10 -12 h). 
Participants will return any leftover confections. After a 5 min stabilization period, a single fasting 
blood sample  will be collected following procedures stated above. After collecting blood, the 
participants will be provided the final 2 -wk supply of confections. At the conclusion of the 
intervention phase (wk 4 ), participants will perform a second  sugar probe test. Compliance  will be 
evaluated based on the number of confections returned throughout the study.  
 
Sampling Handling.  During the pharmacokinetic s trial, a t each time point, a blood sample (20 mL; 
1.4 tablespoons x 10  time points = 200 mL or 0.85 cups)  will be collecte d into evacuated blood 
collection tu bes. Collecting a total of 200 mL or 0.85 cups at the pharmacokinetic s trial is necessary 
to ensure adequate amount of plasma for each time point to accurately analyze  the green tea 
catechin metabolites  over the 12 -hour period . During blood collection, participants may feel an 
initial pain when inserting the needle, bruising  around the insertion area, lightheadedness, or 
fainting, which are common when donating blood. However, w e do not foresee any  additional  
significant risk s for collecting this amount of blood over 12 hours, other than the risks stated 
previously.  
 
Thro ughout the span of the study (~6 -8 weeks in duration depending on participant/investigator 
availability) which consists of one acute ingestion  of GTE -rich confections , a blood collection at 
wk 2  and 4 , and 1 screening day, we will be collecting a total of ~ 255 mL or ~1. 08 cups) of blood.  
Urine will be collected in provided containers (VWR) containing 10% thymol to inhibit bacterial 
growth. Feces will be collected using a commercial commode specimen collection system  (Fisher 
Scientific ). Briefly, the collecti on kit consists of the necessary materials  (e.g. disposable spatula, 
gloves, waste bag)  for participants to easily and hygienically  collect their stool without 
contaminating the sample  or themselves . We will provide participants with coolers with ice to st ore 
their fecal samples for up to [ADDRESS_724078] the participants return their 
fecal samples to the study center or coordinate with study personnel to meet at a public and mutual 
location to return their samples within 24 -h after collection. Volumes of urine will be recorded and 
fecal mass  and observations will be recorded based on the Bristol Stool Chart (85).  
 
During each blood collection , plasma  and white blood cells  will be obtained by [CONTACT_7891], 
and then transferr ed to cryogenic storage tubes.  Serum samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_551077], followed by [CONTACT_226688].  Tubes will be

 12 stored at -80° C un til analysis can be completed. Analyses will include plasma glucose, insulin, 
triglyceride, total cholesterol, catechins (EGCG, ECG, EGC, EC), catechin -metabolites (e.g. 
valerol actones, catechin -derivatives) , C-reactive protein,  myeloperoxid ase, pro-inflammatory 
gene expression  and serum endotoxin and ALT . Urine will be stored at -80ºC until analysis can be 
completed. Analysis from urine will include  catechins, catechin -metabolites,  sucrose, mannitol, 
lactulose, sucralose , and creatinine . Fec al samples will be stored at -80ºC until analysis can be 
completed. Feces analysis will include microbiota composition and calprotectin. Remaining 
plasma , serum , urine, and fecal samples not used for these analyses will be archived for [ADDRESS_724079] the right to refuse our use of these 
specimens for future analyses. Lastly, approval from OSU IRB will be sought via a protocol 
amendment prior to the analysis of any additional biomarkers not specified here in. 
 
Privacy/Confidentiality . For all data and records that are a part of this study, a number (i.e. code) 
will be assigned to each participant, and will only be av ailable to research personnel. Any records 
containing the names of participants will be stor ed in a locked filing cabinet or on a password 
protected computer in the PI’s laboratory or office. Research personnel under the supervision of the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_551054]. The names of 
partic ipants will not be us ed for publication in any form.  The records will be maintained until the 
data are published, up to a maximum of five years. All archived samples will be coded, but the key 
linking the code to each participant’s identifiable information  will have been destroyed. In addition, 
participants will be instructed that their participation in this study is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw at any time without prejudice. Data (food records and biochemical values) obtained from 
this study will s tored on a computer in the PI’s laboratory. In addition, a backup  of digital data will 
be stored on the PI’s computer in his office. Both computers are password protected and both doors 
are locked when work areas  are not in use.  
 
E. Internal Validity  
 
For all data and records that are a part of this study, a number (i.e. code) will be assigned to each 
participant. Test confections will be assigned a code as well. This will minimize measurement bias 
when performing analysis on dietary records, and biochemica l markers because all samples/records 
will be coded. The codes will only be broken once data analysis has been completed and verified by

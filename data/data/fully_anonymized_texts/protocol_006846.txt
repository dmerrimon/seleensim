1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Original 28 April 2016
Amendment 1 10 October 2016
Amendment 2 09 March 2018
The purpose of this amendment is to:
● Update Section 5.5.7, Drug Accountability, to remove requirement for onsite 
monitor confirmation of empty boxes, bottles and returned Sharps containers.
Rationale:  Investigative site staff is responsible for drug accountability and 
destruction per their approved process.  Remote monitoring is conducted to 
ensure information documented is consistent with the investigative site's process.
● Update Section 8.0, Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size.
● To update the pre-specified analysis for the continuous endpoints to be 
MMRM.
Rationale:   MMRM was originally planned as a sensitivity analysis for 
continuous endpoints. Given that MMRM is a more robust statistical method 
in terms of missing data handling as compared to ANCOVA using LOCF, it's 
now elevated to be the primary analysis for continuous endpoints. 
● To update the sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint to  be CMH test 
based on Observed Cases (OC).
Rationale:  Originally planned sensitivity analysis was logistic regression. 
This is being changed to a CMH test based on OC because this is a more 
appropriate sensitivity analysis for the response rate difference which is how 
the primary analysis is being reported. 
● To remove pre-specified sensitivity analysis for secondary end points.

4
Rationale:   Pre-specified sensitivity analyses are deemed not to be necessary 
for non-key secondary endpoints. Additional sensitivity analysis for secondary 
endpoints may be performed post-hoc. 
● To remove pre-specified treatment group homogeneity analysis a nd p values 
for demographics and baseline disease characteristics.
Rationale:   Homogeneity analysis and p values for demographics and baseline 
disease characteristics are only meaningful with appropriate sample size 
otherwise a tiny difference which may not be clinically meaningful can have a 
significant p value.  In addition, this is a randomized study, so demographics and baseline characteristics are expected to be similar by [CONTACT_70020].  
Further testing using p values are not needed.  Therefore, descriptive statistics 
is used to demonstrate the similarity for the demographics and baseline characteristics.  Additional analysis on exploring baseline characteristics may 
be performed post hoc.
● To remove formal summary of pre- and post-treatment Adverse Event 
analysis.
Rationale:   Pre- and post-adverse events will be provided in the AE listing. 
● To update the language in the lab change from baseline analysi s.
Rationale: Observed values of vital signs and laboratory variables at each 
visit will be summarized for all treated subjects. In addition, the change from 
baseline for lab variables of interest will be provided. 
● To update the language in Section 8.2Determination of sample size.
Rationale: For added accuracy.
● To make editorial changes throughout for clarity
● The following administrative changes were made:
○ Update Section 1.0, Title Page, to update Sponsor/Emergency contact 
[CONTACT_3031].
○ Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, to make editorial changes for clarity and to 
align with updates made in Section 8.0, Statistical Methods and 
Determination of Sample Size.
○ Update Section [IP_ADDRESS], Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs, to clarify 
temperature excursion reporting.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 4 open-label randomized controlled study COmparing the effectiveness of 
adalimumab i NTRO duction and methotrexate dose esca Lation in subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis 
(CONTROL)
Objectives:
Primary ObjectiveThe primary objective is to compare the effectiveness based on the achievement of minimal disease 
activity (MDA) at Week 16 between subjects who had adalimumab i ntroduced and those that had 
methotrexate (MTX) escalated to the highest recommended dose of  20 – 25 mg every week (ew) or 
highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew after inadequate disease control on the initial MTX therapy.
Secondary Objectives
•To compare the effectiveness at Week [ADDRESS_945929] recommended dos e of 20 – [ADDRESS_945930] tolerable up to 25 mg ew based on the following clinical, functional and quality of life 
measures:
oPsoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS)
oDisease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score
oPsoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID) score
oAmerican College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR) 
oDisease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)
oPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
oHealth Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
oShort Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) scores:  total, physical co mponent summary (PCS) 
and mental component summary (MCS)
oDermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
oLeeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)
oTender dactylitic digit count
•To evaluate the achievement of MDA at Week 32 on each of the four different treatment regimens involving adalimumab and/or MTX in Part 2 of the study .
The study also has the following Exploratory Objectives:

Objectives (Continued):  
Exploratory Objectives (Continued)
•To assess the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of adalimumab with and without 
concomitant MTX.
•To investigate various biomarkers and their associations with treatment responses and outcomes.
Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as not in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab introduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20 – [ADDRESS_945932] tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatme nt arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting th e selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and tre ated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20 – [ADDRESS_945933] tolerable d ose ew (MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_945934] tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by [CONTACT_122271] 5.[ADDRESS_945935]'s MT X administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance or toxicity, the MTX dose 
may be de-escalated by [ADDRESS_945936] tolerable MTX dose 
below 20 – [ADDRESS_945937] 2016-000191-21

Methodology (Continued):   
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subj ects will be assigned to one of the 
4 treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial ran domized treatment, and treated for 
additional 16 weeks in Part 2 as follows:
•Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_945938] MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 and continue receiving adalimumab as monotherapy (adalimumab 40 mg eow),
•Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_945939] adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combina tion with MTX 15 mg ew 
(adalimumab 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalat ed to 20 – [ADDRESS_945940] tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose  (MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_945941] 
tolerable dose ew),
•Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX esc alated to 20 – [ADDRESS_945942] tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in  combination with MTX 20 –
[ADDRESS_945943] tolerable dose ew (adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MT X 20 – [ADDRESS_945944] 
tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-[ADDRESS_945945] not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the Investigator, but should involve adalimumab and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows:
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) have MTX 15 mg ew added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg ew  (Arm 2) have MTX 
escalated to 20 – 25 mg ew,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_945946] tolerable  dose ew (Arm 3) have 
adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_945947] 
tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to [ADDRESS_945948] 2016-000191-21

Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  For subjects receiving adalimumab, blood samples will be 
collected for determination of adalimumab serum concentrations and the presence of anti-adalimumab 
antibodies (AAA).
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):  Optional samples may be 
collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and n ovel biomarkers.  The types of 
biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94421].
Safety:  Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs , physical examination, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination (if required) and laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Effectiveness:   The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed  for the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication.  Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests wil l be conducted at α = 0.05 level (2-sided).  A 
Week [ADDRESS_945961] completed Week 16 (Part 1) of the 
study and statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary  efficacy endpoints will be performed at 
Week 16 between the Part 1 treatment groups.  No multiplicity a djustment will be performed for the 
statistical testing.  
To account for missing data for the binary effectiveness endpoi nts, a non-responder imputation approach 
(NRI) will be used, e.g., subjects who discontinue during Part 1  with missing data will be imputed as a 
non-responder.  For continuous endpoints, the Mixed-effects Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
analysis based on all observed data will be used.

13
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Effectiveness (Continued):The response rates for the primary endpoint will be compared be tween the treatment groups using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratifica tion factor, the duration of prior MTX 
use of ≤ 3 months  or > [ADDRESS_945963] and baseline value as a covar iate.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_697105], number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, me dian, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by [CONTACT_51064].  Data listings will 
be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of s ummary statistics and plots, concentration 
values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.   In addition, pharmacokinetic model-
based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clea rance (CL/F) and apparent volume of 
distribution (V/F).
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment regimen, and rates of 
AAA positivity will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Ultrasound:  For the analysis of ultrasound endpoints in Part 1, similar MMR M model as described for 
the continuous secondary endpoints will be used and baseline weight will be included as an additional covariate in the MMRM model.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, which includes all subjects that 
received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment-emer gent AEs will be summarized and 
reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study 
medication, and up to within [ADDRESS_945964] dose of the  study medication.  All treatment emergent 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulato ry Activities (MedDRA®).  The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulat ed by [CONTACT_72065].  In addition, a summary of AEs by [CONTACT_697106].  AEs, 
which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to p remature study discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will also be tabulated.

3.0 Introduction 
3.1 Overview of Disease and its Treatment
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory progressive arthri tis occurring in around 30% 
of patients with psoriasis and an estimated prevalence of 0.1%-0.25% in the general 
population.1-[ADDRESS_945983] presentation to the clinic and around 50% may develop erosions within 2 years of the diagnosis.
7  The burden of PsA for the patient and society is 
amplified by [CONTACT_697107], in particular cardiovascul ar, resulting in an increased 
and premature mortality.8
Conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( csDMARDs) remain the 
cornerstone of treating PsA in clinical practice, despi[INVESTIGATOR_697073]9,10  CsDMARDs are also recommended prior to biologic 
DMARDs (bDMARDs) by [CONTACT_697108], unless poor prognostic factors, enthesitis, dactylitis or axial involvement are present.
11-[ADDRESS_945984] in PsA is methotrexate (MT X).11,12  According 
to the clinical practice insights, MTX may be prescribed in up to 90% of PsA patients prior to a biologic agent.
15  However, evidence for the efficacy of MTX in PsA is scant 
and data on the efficacious dose conflicting.
A 6-month double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial (MIP A) with a target MTX 
dose of 15 mg/week did not show a superiority of MTX over place bo in controlling PsA

arthritis.16  Statistically significant improvements were only observed in patient and 
physician global assessments and mean Psoriasis Area and Severi ty Index (PASI) score, 
but not in the primary outcome of Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), or 
secondary outcomes tender and swollen joint count, composite scores for joint activity 
and improvement, skin improvement, measures of pain and function or laboratory inflammatory markers.
16  The trial has been criticized for several methodological 
drawbacks, including the low MTX dose capped at 15 mg/week.13,[ADDRESS_945986], the 
open-label randomized RESPOND study in relatively early, MTX-naive PsA patients that compared infliximab in combination with MTX 15 mg/week with MTX monotherapy at the same dose, showed a better effectiveness of the biologic co mbination, but MTX alone 
provided for high joint and skin responses at Week [ADDRESS_945987] Treat-to-Target (T2T) trial i n PsA, 40.8% and 22.4% of 
early PsA subjects achieved a 20% improvement in the American C ollege of 
Rheumatology Criteria (ACR20) and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA ) status, 
respectively, at Week 12 on MTX alone.  Furthermore, 24.7% of s ubjects in the tight 
control arm received only MTX and remained consistently in MDA until the end of the trial at Week 48.  Improvements were also seen in PASI, nail involvement, enthesitis and dactylitis.
18  Still, the majority of PsA patients will likely be insufficiently controlled on 
MTX alone and inhibition of radiographic progression with MTX r emains unproven.9,10
MTX dosing in PsA is mainly based on clinical experience and evidence from trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The recommended target dose is 15-[ADDRESS_945988] majority, 91% and 
83% of subjects however reached a MTX dose of at least 20 and 25 mg/week, respectively, by [CONTACT_10585] 12 in the tight control arm of TICOPA tri al, following an intense 
MTX escalation scheme.  A trend towards better outcomes with the doses higher than 15 mg/week was observed, but the differences were not significant.  The interpretation of this data is however difficult due to confounding present in th e dose escalation.
[ADDRESS_945989] few decades, it was still16.2 mg/week only in the period between [ADDRESS_945990]-marketing observational stud y, PsA subjects eligible 
for biologic therapy were on a mean of 15.4 mg/week of MTX at e nrolment.15  Likewise, 
the mean MTX dose at baseline in the recent clinical trials wit h new compounds in PsA 
ranged between 15.8-17.5 mg/week.21-23  This implies that in clinical practice PsA patients 
are insufficiently treated for prolonged periods of time with M TX doses lower than the 
recommended target dose.
It is also unclear whether MTX concomitant to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy 
provides an additional benefit in PsA patients that failed MTX.  No difference in the 
efficacy of anti-TNFs with or without MTX was found for peripheral arthritis in randomized controlled trials, though there was some hint that concomitant MTX may decrease the progression of structural damage.  The trials were  however not designed and 
powered to answer this question.  Data from registries suggest that the use of concomitant MTX may prolong drug survival of anti-TNFs, especially monoclon al antibodies, but that 
was not a consistent observation either.

3.1.2 Treat-to Target in Psoriatic Arthritis
The T2T recommendations for spondyloarthritis (SpA) suggested r emission, alternatively 
low disease activity, as the ultimate treatment goal.  It has a lso been noted that a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_945991] of care improves long-term joint and skin outcomes in subjects with early PsA.
27  Per protocol, the tight control arm mandated treatment escalation every 3 months 
if MDA was not achieved, starting with MTX, increasing it up to 25 mg/week within 3 months, followed by [CONTACT_697109], befor e an anti-TNF could 
be introduced.  At 48 weeks (end of the trial), 39% of subjects in the tight control arm were on biologics compared with 7% in the standard care arm wit h no pre-defined

26
treatment protocol.27  It may be speculated that the results of T2T could further be  
improved by [CONTACT_697110]-TNF introduction.
3.1.3 Adalimumab Overview
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
containing only human peptide sequences.  Adalimumab is produce d by [CONTACT_697111] a mammalian cell expression system.  It consi sts of 1330 amino acids 
and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.  Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy and light chain variable regions, which co nfer specificity to human 
TNF, and human IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences.  Adalimumab binds with high affinity and specificity to soluble TNF-α but not to lymphotoxin-α (TNF-β).
TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.  Elevated levels of TNF play an important rol e in pathologic 
inflammation.  Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutral izes the biological 
function of TNF by [CONTACT_51003] p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by [CONTACT_51004].  After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase  reactants of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sediment ation rate [ESR]) and 
serum cytokines rapi[INVESTIGATOR_50948].
Adalimumab was first approved for the treatment of patients with RA in the [LOCATION_002] 
in December 2002 and in the European Union (EU) in September 20 03.  In addition, 
adalimumab is approved for the treatment of patients with early RA, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (2 years of age and older), PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease (adult and pediatric), ulcerative colitis, plaque psori asis (adult), hidradenitis 
suppurativa in the EU, US, and the rest of the world.  Adalimumab is also approved for the treatment of patients with pediatric enthesitis related arthritis (6 years of age and older), pediatric plaque psoriasis (4 years of age and older), and non-radiographic axial 
SpA in the EU and several other countries, as well as for intestinal Behçet's disease in 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_945993] ing approved indications 
can be found in the current edition of the Humira Investigational Drug Brochure.
The efficacy and safety of adalimumab in PsA was originally dem onstrated in the ADEPT 
trial (Study M02-518), which was a multicountry, 24-week random ized, double-blind, 
placebo controlled trial that compared adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) every other 
week (eow) versus placebo in 313 subjects with moderately to se verely active PsA and 
history of inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammato ry drugs (NSAIDs).  
Significantly better results in subjects treated with adalimumab compared with placebo were seen at Weeks [ADDRESS_945994]-hoc analysis of the ADEPT trial, significantly more s ubjects achieved MDA on 
adalimumab than placebo at Week 24:  39% vs. 7%, respectively.34  ADEPT subanalyses 
also indicated that adalimumab monotherapy provides similar results to adalimumab with concurrent MTX.
29,30
No published data are currently available on the efficacy of adalimumab escalated to 40 mg sc every week (ew) in PsA patients that had not achieved s ufficient disease control 
on adalimumab at the standard dose of [ADDRESS_945995]-hoc 
analysis of the PRESTA trial provided some evidence by [CONTACT_697112] 2 years of PsA duration exp erienced greater 
improvements in arthritis related scores and patient reported outcomes (PROs) than those with more than [ADDRESS_945996] 
introduction, as highlighted in the recent EULAR research agenda for PsA.11
The present Study M14-496 (CONTROL) primarily aims to assess th e effectiveness of 
adalimumab introduction compared with MTX dose escalation to the highest recommended dose of 20-[ADDRESS_945997] of the duration of MTX therapy prior to  study enrolment will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_697113] h aving been on MTX 15 mg 
ew for 3 months or less and those more than 3 months on MTX 15 mg ew.
Additionally, the maintenance or attainment of MDA on four diff erent potential treatment 
optimization regimens, using adalimumab and/or MTX will be evaluated in the 
second part of the study.  These treatment regimens include adal imumab monotherapy, 
adalimumab escalation to weekly dosing, delayed introduction of adalimumab and continuous treatment with MTX at the highest recommended dose of 20-[ADDRESS_945998] (adalimumab) introduction in combination with MTX compared with  prolonging and 
escalating MTX alone to the highest recommended
11,27or tolerable dose.  The other 
benefits will be insights into the effectiveness of different potential treatment optimization

regimens consisting of adalimumab and/or MTX in the maintenance  or attainment of the 
outcomes in the second part of the study.  These treatment regimens are used in clinical 
practice but lack scientific evidence.
Adalimumab has a well-established safety profile in PsA and other approved indications.  
Adalimumab will be administered in this study at the approved dosing regimen for PsA (i.e., 40 mg sc eow).
36,37  The only exception will be subjects not achieving MDA on the 
approved adalimumab dosing in combination with MTX, who will be  required to escalate 
adalimumab to 40 mg sc ew in combination with MTX.  Adalimumab 40 mg ew has been used in ACR20 non-responders in the open-label extension of the ADEPT trial through Week 144 with no increased risk of adverse events (AEs) noted.

More than 30,000 subjects participating in hidradenitis suppurativa, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, pediatric enthesitis related arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, psoriasis, pediatric psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-
radiographic axialspondyloarthritis, peripheral spondyloarthrit is, psoriatic arthritis, 
intestinal Behçet's disease, uveitis and ulcerative colitis clinical studies have been treated with adalimumab.
The majority of side effects experienced following administrati on of adalimumab were 
mild to moderate in severity.
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946001] commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (su ch as nasopharyngitis, 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_697074]), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, 
haemorrhage, pain or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pa in.
Serious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira.  TNF-a ntagonists, such as 
Humira affect the immune system and their use may affect the bo dy's defense against 
infection and cancer.  Fatal and life-threatening infections (i ncluding sepsis, opportunistic 
infections and TB), HBV reactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use of Humira.
Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported.  
These include rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, c entral and peripheral 
demyelinating events and reports of lupus, lupus-related condit ions and Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome.
Humira is contraindicated in patients with:
● Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its exci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840];
● Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis,  and opportunistic 
infections;
● Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).
In its Summary of Product Characteristics, Special warnings and  precautions for use for 
Humira are the following:
● Infections
○ Patients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections.
○ Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_48947].
● Serious infections
○ Serious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, 
invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other opportunistic infections such as 
listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in patients 
receiving Humira.
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946002] 2016-000191-21
32
● Tuberculosis
○ Tuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has 
been reported in patients receiving Humira.  Reports included cases of 
pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis .
● Other opportunistic infections
○ Opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been 
observed in patients receiving Humira.  These infections have n ot 
consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF antagonists  and this 
resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting  in fatal 
outcomes.
● Hepatitis B reactivation
○ Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving  a TNF-
antagonist including Humira, who are chronic carriers of this virus 
(i.e., surface antigen positive).
● Neurological events
○ TNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances 
with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radi ographic 
evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease includ ing 
multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelina ting disease, 
including Guillain-Barré syndrome.
● Allergic reactions
○ Serious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical 
trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Humira were 
uncommon during clinical trials.  Reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira 
administration.
● Immunosuppression
○ In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with 
Humira, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type 
hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or chang e in 
enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages,  and 
neutrophils.

M14-[ADDRESS_946003] 2016-000191-21
33
● Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders
○ In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonis ts, more cases 
of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among pat ients 
receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  How ever, the 
occurrence was rare.
● Haematologic reactions
○ Rare reports of pancytopaenia including aplastic anaemia have been 
reported with TNF-antagonists.
○ Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically  
significant cytopoenia (e.g., thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) h ave been 
reported with Humira.
● Vaccinations Patients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except 
for live vaccines.
● Congestive heart failure
○ In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart 
failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure  have been 
observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have als o been 
reported in patients receiving Humira.
● Autoimmune processes
○ Treatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune 
antibodies.  The impact of long term treatment with Humira on the 
development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.
● Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists
○ Concomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic D MARDS 
(e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not 
recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infectio ns, 
including serious infections and other potential pharmacologica l 
interactions.
● Elderly patients
○ The frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subje cts over 
65 years of age (3.6%) was higher than for those under 65 years of age 
(1.4%).
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946004] 2016-000191-21
34
○ Some of those had a fatal outcome.  Particular attention regarding the risk 
for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.
● Surgery
○ There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated 
with Humira.
The SmPC states that the long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration 
if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate act ions should be taken.
The study will be conducted in subjects previously treated with  MTX for PsA at [ADDRESS_946005] recommended dose in PsA
11,27and also approved 
dose for PsA.38  Rapid MTX dose escalation in subjects with PsA up to 25 mg ew  has 
been studied before, though with a different research objective.  The majority, 91% and 83% of patients were able to reach the MTX dose of at least [ADDRESS_946006] Characteristics (SmPC) or prescribin g information.  [COMPANY_013]

responses and outcomes.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlled,  parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of [ADDRESS_946010] 2016-000191-21
37
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on 
adalimumab introduced in combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the 
highest recommended dose of 20-[ADDRESS_946011] tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, 
whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled afte r the initial course of MTX 
at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be open-label, randomized, controlled , parallel group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatmen t 
regimens consisting of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as applicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, parallel group.  Subjec ts will be assigned into the 
four treatment arms based on their MDA status at Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Eligible male and female subjects with PsA will be selected to participate in the study 
according to the selection criteria.
The study will enroll approximately 240 subjects at approximate ly 60 sites to meet the 
scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in 
alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled. 
Following a screening period of up to 30 days, subjects meeting the selection criteria will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and treated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
● Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15  mg ew 
(ADA 40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
● Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20-[ADDRESS_946012] tolerable dose ew (MTX 
20-[ADDRESS_946013] tolerable dose ew).*
* MTX will be escalated by [CONTACT_122271] 5.[ADDRESS_946014]'s MTX administration schedule prior to the study.  In the case of 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946015] tolerable MTX d ose below 
20-25 mg ew as described per the protocol (see Section 6.1.7, Toxicity 
Management).  The event of MTX toxicity or intolerance must be clearly 
documented in source documents.  MTX dose should not exceed 25 mg ew 
in this study.
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subjects will be assigned to 
one of the four (4) treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial randomized treatment, and treated for additional 16 weeks in Pa rt 2 as follows:
● Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946016] MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 
and continue receiving adalimumab as monotherapy (ADA 40 mg eow),
● Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946017] adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (ADA 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
● Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946018] tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose (MTX 20-[ADDRESS_946019] tolerable dose ew),
● Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946020] tolerable dose ew (ADA [ADDRESS_946021] tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-[ADDRESS_946022] not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  
The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the di scretion of the Investigator, 
but should involve adalimumab and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows: 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946023] 2016-000191-21

● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) hav e MTX 
15 mg ew added,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg ew 
(Arm 2) have MTX escalated to 20-25 mg ew,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20-[ADDRESS_946024] tolerabl e dose ew 
(Arm 3) have adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20-[ADDRESS_946025] tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew.
A schematic of the study design is shown below in Figure 1 :
Figure 1. Control Design Scheme
Both adalimumab and MTX will be provided as study drugs.

Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946026] 2016-000191-21

MTX will be provided as a study drug for either oral or subcutaneous (sc) administration.  
The route of MTX administration can be selected at the discretion of the Investigator and may be exchanged between oral and sc at any time during the stu dy.
5.1.1 Screening Period
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures, will receive a unique s ubject number via 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system and will undergo t he study procedures 
identified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] associated with the Screening Visit.  The investigator will 
evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_946027]'s medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 30 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.  The screening pe riod may be extended with 
the approval of the [COMPANY_013] TA MD for certain circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results, holidays or scheduling/ availability issues).
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
● Subjects that initially screen fail for the study may be permi tted to re-screen 
once. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to  re-screen for 
the study.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptio ns noted below 
will be repeated.
● Re-consent is required if there is a newly approved informed consent since the 
original screening visit or if [ADDRESS_946028] passed.
● If there is one exclusionary laboratory result during screenin g, a re-test of that 
one particular value is allowed without repeating all other laboratory tests 
provided no more than [ADDRESS_946029] passed since the original screening visit.
● If the subject had a complete initial Screening visit including the assessment of 
a [COMPANY_003] test (or equivalent), or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, Chest x-ray (if applicable) and ECG, these tests will not be required to be repeated for the re-screening visit, provided the conditions noted in Section 5.2are met and no 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946030] passed since the original screening visi t. Note:  If the 
subject initiated TB treatment and the treatment was completed outside the 
[ADDRESS_946031] the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened.
For subjects who do not meet the study eligibility criteria, th e site personnel must register 
the subject as a screen failure in both IRT and electronic data  capture (EDC) systems.  For 
subjects that re-screen, the Screening number assigned by [CONTACT_941] I RT at the initial Screening 
visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.
5.1.2 Treatment Period
[IP_ADDRESS] Part 1 (Randomized Open Label Treatment Period)
At the Baseline visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm 1 or Arm 2 of Part 1  (as described in 
Section 5.1).  During this period of the study, subjects will visit the st udy site at Week 2, 
Week 4 and then monthly through Week 16 (if local requirements ask for additional safety assessments, e.g., due to MTX treatment, respective labo ratory tests should be done 
locally).  A ± 2-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits.  
IRT will be utilized to dispense the appropriate study drug (adalimumab and MTX) to 
subjects for administration during the visit or at the regularly scheduled day for MTX.  Subjects will be given dosing instructions and a dosing diary at  the Baseline visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Part 2 (Open-Label Treatment Period)
After completing the randomized-open label treatment period at Week 16, subjects will be 
assigned to Arms 1-4 of Part 2 (as described in Section 5.1), based on the achievement of 
MDA and initial randomized treatment, and treated for additional 16 weeks.  Starting at 
Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option based on not ach ieving MDA and 
investigator's judgment.  During this study period, subjects will visit the study site monthly through Week 32.  A ± 2-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits.  
Subjects will be dispensed study drugs at the Week 16 Visit for  administration during the 
visit or at the regularly scheduled day for MTX.
No study drug will be administered or injected after the final visit (Week 32 Visit).  
Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment at any time durin g study participation.  
Subjects who end study participation early will have a Prematur e Discontinuation (PD) 
Visit and complete the procedures outlined for the PD Visit in Appendix C as soon as 
possible after the last dose of study drug and preferably prior to the administration of any 
new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Follow-Up Period
Subjects may discontinue their study participation at any time.   Subjects that end study 
participation early will have a PD Visit.  All subjects will hav e a follow-up phone call 
70 days (± a 7 day window) after the last administration of adal imumab to obtain 
information on any new or ongoing AEs.  For subjects taking only MTX, the follow-up 
phone call will occur 70 days (± 7 day window) after the last administration of MTX.

and frequency on the appropriate electronic case report form (e CRF).
All prior drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_697080], dosage/maximum dosage taken, route of administration and reason for use and for discontinuation, if known.  
MTX use for PsA at a stable dose of 15 mg ew (oral or subcutane ous) for ≥ 4 weeks prior 
to Screening is required per the protocol; dates of use, dosage(s), route of 
administration(s) and reason for use should be documented and must be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
All subjects receiving MTX in this study are recommended to be o n folic or folinic acid 
supplementation with the dose and regimen chosen at the Investigator's discretion.  As per 
general guidance, folic or folinic acid should not be taken on the same day that the MTX is administered, but may be taken all other days in the week, b eginning 24 hours after the 
MTX dose. 
Oral antiemetic agents are permitted to treat transient gastrointestinal tolerability 
problems possibly caused by [CONTACT_697117].  The selection o f an antiemetic agent 
and duration of antiemetic treatment is at the discretion of the Investigator, but is not advised to exceed 2 weeks.
Concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., sulfasalazine ≤ 2 g/day) must be at  a stable dose for 
≥ 4 weeks before the baseline visit and are to remain stable for the duration of the study.  
If csDMARDs (other than MTX) are discontinued before the study,  this must be done 
≥ [ADDRESS_946054] 4 weeks 
prior to the baseline visit and should not be used during the s tudy.
The use of NSAIDs, including COX 2 inhibitors, paracetamol (up to the maximum 
recommended dose in the local country label), are allowed durin g the study, if subjects are 
receiving stable prescribed doses for ≥ [ADDRESS_946055] 2016-000191-21

tolerability (or other safety) issues, the doses of NSAIDs may be skipped, decreased 
and/or resumed as many times as needed during the study.  If ta king any of the above at 
baseline on an as-needed basis, they should continue to use them  for the same reason and 
same dose each time.  On the days that subjects are scheduled t o be seen in clinic, no 
regularly scheduled NSAIDs should be used within [ADDRESS_946056]'s clinic visit.  
In addition, for subjects participating in the US substudy, no N SAIDs should be used 
within 48 hours of the scheduled US examination.
Narcotics other than tramadol or equivalent opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or non opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] 
(including codeine), are prohibited except in fixed combination with acetaminophen.  Administration of combined narcotics and acetaminophen and tramadol or equivalent opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_697081] a stable dose and should not occur 
within 24 hours prior to a study visit with joint assessments.
Concomitant use of oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent) is 
allowed during the study and should be kept at a stable dose fo r ≥ [ADDRESS_946057] remain stable 
throughout study participation (except as medically required due to an AE (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
For subjects who require isoniazid (INH) for TB prophylaxis, co nsideration should be 
given to administer pyridoxine (vitamin B

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
Study procedures are discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of drug 
concentration measurements and antibody measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2 and 
the collection of adverse event (AE) information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study 
data will be recorded in source documents and on the appropriat e eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) approved informe d consent form 
before any study procedures are performed or any medications ar e withheld from the 
subject in order to participate in this study.  Participation i n the pre-specified biomarker 
research analysis is optional, as indicated in the main consent .  A separate consent is 
required from each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory research/validation studies.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be screened to ensure they meet all inclusion cri teria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at the Screening and Baseline visits.
Medical and Surgical History
A complete non-PsA medical and surgical history, including hist ory of alcohol and 
tobacco use will be obtained from each subject at the Screening visit.  Additionally, a list 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946071]'s specific PsA related medical and surgical history should be recorded at 
Screening.  An updated medical history will be obtained prior t o study drug 
administration at Baseline, to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment, and the medical history will be updated as necessary throughout the stu dy.
A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure will be documented.  This 
information needs to include Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vac cination, cohabitation 
with individuals who had TB, and/or reside or work in TB endemic locations.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at the design ated study visits as 
specified in Appendix C .  The physical examination at the baseline visit will serve as  the 
baseline physical examination for the entire study.  Physical e xamination abnormalities 
noted by [CONTACT_697119] o f study drug should be 
recorded in the subject's medical history.  Abnormalities noted  after the Baseline visit and 
first dose of study drug should be evaluated and documented by [CONTACT_697120].  All findings whether related to an adverse event 
or part of each subject's medical history should be captured on  the appropriate eCRF page.
A symptom-directed physical examination will be performed when necessary.
Confirmation of PsA Diagnosis
The clinical diagnosis of PsA of at least 4-week duration prior to the screening date should be verified at the screening visit against the CASPAR classification criteria (40) outlined below.

Study Group,* a patient must have inflammatory articular disease (joint, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or entheseal) with ≥ 3 points from the following 5 categories:
1. Evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasi s, or a family 
history of psoriasis.  Current psoriasis is defined as psoriati c skin or scalp 
disease present today as judged by a rheumatologist or dermatol ogist.
†
A personal history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis that may 
be obtained from a patient, family physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other qualified healthcare provider.  A family history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a first- or se cond-degree 
relative according to patient report.
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_250320], pi[INVESTIGATOR_697088], and 
hyperkeratosis observed on current physical examination.
3. A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor by [CONTACT_697121]-linked immuosorbent assay  or 
nephelometry, according to the local laboratory reference range .
4. Either current dactylitis, defined as swelling of an entire d igit, or a history 
of dactylitis recorded by a rheumatologist.  
5. Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formation, a ppearing as 
ill-defined ossification near joint margins (but excluding osteophyte formation) on plain radiographs of the hand or foot.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study  visits as specified in 
Appendix C .  A qualified physician will interpret the clinical significan ce of any abnormal 
finding, sign, and date each ECG.  Any clinically significant f indings will be documented 
in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropr iate eCRF.  Each signed 
original ECG will be monitored by [CONTACT_697122]'s 
source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within [ADDRESS_946074] X-Ray (CXR)
All subjects will undergo a standard CXR (posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views) at 
the Screening visit to rule out the presence of TB or other cli nically relevant findings.  
The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous norm al chest x-ray within 
90 days of Screening, provided all protocol required documentati on is available at the site 
(as outlined below) and provided nothing has changed in the sub ject's medical history to 
warrant a repeat test.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as warranted based on the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].A radiologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Investigator will indicate the 
clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the  report.  In the assessment 
of the chest x-ray, the Investigator or their delegate must ind icate the presence or absence 
of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, a nd (3) signs of active TB.  If

the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic 
scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_110962]) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_697123].
TB Screening
For subjects treated with corticosteroids (equivalent to Prednisone 5 mg or above – with ongoing treatment or treatment within 1 month prior to TB screening), an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test) mu st be performed 
during the Screening Period for all subjects including those with a prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) administration.
For subjects NOT treated with corticosteroids (equivalent to Pr ednisone 5 mg or above –
with ongoing treatment or treatment within 1 month prior to TB screening), a [COMPANY_003] skin 
test (alternatively, also known as tuberculin skin test) must b e placed, or an Interferon-
Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test) 
must be performed during the Screening Period for all subjects,  including those with a 
prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) administration.If a subject had a negative [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or  IGRA equivalent such 
as T-SPOT TB test) within [ADDRESS_946076]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  All cases where the Investigator feels a repeat test is not needed must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD prior to subject enrollment.
For the [COMPANY_003] test:
The subject will be required to have the [COMPANY_003] test read by a lic ensed healthcare 
professional 48 to 72 hours (or according to manufacturer's guide) after 
placement when the induration is maximal.  An induration (not e rythema) of 
[ADDRESS_946077] 2016-000191-21
62
negative.  The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm," not 
"negative."  (If required by [CONTACT_396075] a two-step test may be performed 
per local guidelines.  The result of the second test should be recorded.  An induration of 5 mm or greater will be considered as [COMPANY_003] positive.)
Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to a [COMPANY_003] skin test in the past should 
not be re-exposed and should not be tested at Screening but will  be considered 
[COMPANY_003] positive.
If there are sites where the accepted testing materials are not available, an 
alternative may be substituted, but the method must be submitte d and approved 
by [CONTACT_697124].
If the [COMPANY_003] or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is positive or the s ubject has a CXR 
indicative of latent TB, the subject will be required to initiate and have taken at least 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) of an ong oing course of Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) recommended prophylaxis or prophylaxis per local guidelines prior to starting study therapy.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have a documented completion of the CDC 
recommended or local guideline recommended prophylaxis may be p ermitted to enroll.  If 
the subject has a prior history of latent TB, but has not completed or received prophylaxis, prophylaxis must be initiated for at least 2 weeks (or per loca l guidelines, whichever is 
longer) prior to starting study therapy.
If the subject has a prior history of active TB, they must have  documentation of 
completion of CDC recommended or local guideline recommended treatment and 
documentation of resolution of the infection.  In the event both a [COMPANY_003] test and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test are performed, the result of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test will supersede the result of the [COMPANY_003] test.  However, only one test is required.  If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, the site should repe at the test with another

M14-[ADDRESS_946078] is considered to be positive and sho uld initiate TB prophylaxis. 
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured on th e concomitant 
medications page in the eCRF and in the source documents.  Prior therapy should be 
captured in medical history.
Hepatitis B Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) at Screening.  
A positive result for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) will be exclusionary.  Samples that are negative for HBs Ag will be tested for surface antibodies (HBs Ab) and core antibodies HBc Ab Total).  Subjects with HBs Ag (–), HBs A b (–), and HBc Ab 
Total (+) require PCR qualitative testing for HBV DNA.  Any HBV  DNA PCR result that 
meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.
Subjects with a negative HBs Ag test and tests showing the results below, do not require 
HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing. 
● HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab (–)
● HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab (+) 
● HBc Ab Total (+) and HBs Ab (+)
Hepatitis C Testing:
Blood samples for Hepatitis C serology will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A subject 
will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti HCV Ab).
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit  on all female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  At the Baseline Visit, subjects of childbearing potential will have 
a urine pregnancy test performed locally by [CONTACT_51015].  A serum

Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be obtained for clinical laborator y tests.  Samples will be 
obtained at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix C .  Samples will be 
obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1.
All Screening laboratory results must be reviewed, signed and d ated by [CONTACT_697125] a subjec t.  Subjects will not be 
randomized into the study if laboratory or other Screening resu lt abnormalities are 
deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737].
When blood draws are performed as part of a clinic visit, the d raws should be performed 
after all clinical assessments and completion of questionnaires and vital sign 
measurements, and before study drug administration.  Urine samp les will be obtained for 
macroscopic urinalysis (dipstick done at the central laboratory  which will include specific 
gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood and nitrites) and  a microscopic urinalysis at 
Screening.  For all other visits that require a urinalysis, the central laboratory will perform a urine dipstick analysis and if the results are abnormal, the central laboratory will perform a microscopic urinalysis.
If required by [CONTACT_697126], subjects will be tested for antibodies to the Human

receive results from the testing and not be made aware of any p ositive result.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  The central laboratory chosen for this study  will provide instructions
regarding the collection, processing and shipment of appropriate samples.
The laboratory results will be provided by [CONTACT_51030], signed and dated by [CONTACT_697127].  
For any abnormal value outside of the reference range, the Inve stigator will indicate on 
the report if the result is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  All 
abnormal laboratory test results that are considered clinically  significant by [CONTACT_51032] a satisfactory resolution.  La boratory abnormalities are 
considered to be adverse events only if they result in disconti nuation from the study, 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Inv estigator considers them to 
be an adverse event.

Tender Joint Count (TJC)
An assessment of 68 joints (TJC68; Appendix E ) will be done for tenderness by [CONTACT_697128].  Joint pain/tenderness wi ll be classified as either 
present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
Swollen Joint Count (SJC)
An assessment of 66 joints (SJC66; Appendix E ) will be done by [CONTACT_5292].  
The joints to be examined for swelling are the same as those examined for tenderness, 
except the hip joints excluded.  Joint swelling will be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by [CONTACT_697129], as much as possible.  In order to 
minimize variability, the same joint assessor should evaluate a  subject at each visit 
throughout the duration of the trial.  A back-up independent as sessor, who is trained and 
competent in performing such assessments, should be identified.   It is the responsibility of 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_697090].  If the independent assessor is not available, the  pre-identified back-up 
assessor will perform such assessments.
Dactylitis Assessment
Dactylitis will be assessed as dactylitic digit count and tende r dactylitic digit count. 
Hands and feet bilaterally will be assessed for the presence/ab sence of dactylitis and 
associated tenderness.  The score for each dactylitic count and  tender dactylitic count can 
range 0-20 ( Appendix F ).  The dactylitis assessments will be performed at the visits

assessment will be performed at the visits specified in Appendix C .
Psoriasis Evaluation
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
The PASI provides quantitative assessment of psoriasis lesional  burden based on the 
amount of body surface area involved and degree of severity of erythema, induration, and 
scale, weighted by [CONTACT_697130].43,44  A qualified Investigator or designee who has been 
trained by [CONTACT_456]/designee, if necessary, will perform the PASI assessment 
(Appendix H ).  The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified 
Investigator or designee perform all PASI assessments on a given subject throughout the study as specified in Appendix C .
Body Surface Area (BSA)

Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID)
PsAID is a validated patient self-reported tool to assess the i mpact of PsA on patient's life.  
Two versions of the questionnaire were developed by [CONTACT_697135] (EULAR) initiative:  one for clinical practice (PsAI D-12) and one for 
clinical trials (PsAID-9).  Both contain physical and psycholog ical domains.  The PsAID-
9 version will be used in this study.47
Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
The HAQ-DI is a standardized measure of physical function in arthritis.  The HAQ-DI 
questionnaire contains 20 items divided into 8 domains that measure:  dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and c ommon daily activities.

used.49,50
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
DLQI is a measure of subject's quality of life (QoL) related to skin disease.  The DLQI questionnaire consists of 10 questions concerning subjects' perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health related quality of life over the last week.  The items of the DLQI encompass aspects such as symptoms and fe elings, daily activities, 
leisure, work or school, personal relationships and the side ef fects of treatment.

Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (US) 
Investigators will at study start indicate if they want to participate in the optional US assessments or not.  If they decide to participate, they should , if possible, perform an US 
evaluation for every subject they enroll at visits indicated in  Appendix C .
For the sites participating in the optional US assessment, high -end ultrasound equipment 
is recommended.  The US must be performed by [CONTACT_697136] (rheumatologist or radiologist) with verifiable training and/or certification in ultrasonography, and at least 3 years of regular US experience.  Prior experience in multicent er ultrasound study(ies) is 
recommended, otherwise training will be provided.  The Ultrasonographer must be independent of the clinical Investigator and should be blinded for subject characteristics and treatment arm; he/she should be the same person throughout the study, and a back-up 
with the same qualifications should be appointed.  
The assessments and scoring will be locally performed.  US shou ld be performed the same 
day as the clinical examination, or the day before the visit if  not possible, and prior to 
injecting study medication.  The subjects undergoing US evaluat ion should not take 
NSAIDs for the last 48 hours prior to the US assessment.  (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited 
Therapy).The ultrasound evaluation will comprise a comprehensive assessm ent of joints, entheses 
and tendons. For the joint evaluation, the following 23 pairs of joints will be scanned: 
● Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints 1 to 5, 
● Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 1 to 5,
● Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints [ADDRESS_946091] 2016-000191-21
72
● Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints 1 to 5,
● Wrist, elbow, knee, ankle (tibiotalar).
The US assessment of synovitis will consist of an evaluation of  hypoechoic synovial

Doppler (PDUS).  The pre-specified set of [ADDRESS_946092] with the joint in a neutral position, except for 
the knee, which will also be examined in a flexed position (30° ).
The presence of synovitis (i.e., SH and Power Doppler) will be scored according to the OMERACT-EULAR PDUS composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3).
53
For the entheses evaluation, the following 5 pairs of entheses will be scanned:
1. Common extensor tendon insertion at the lateral humeral epi[INVESTIGATOR_697093],
2. Quadriceps tendon insertion at the superior pole of the patel la,
3. Patellar tendon proximal insertion at the inferior pole of the patella,
4. Patellar tendon distal insertion at the tibia tuberosity,5. Achilles tendon insertion at the calcaneus; plantar aponeuroses insertion at the 
calcaneus.
Each evaluated enthesis will be scored in terms of inflammatory (i.e., presence of Doppler 
signal within 2 mm from the cortical bony insertion and hypoechogenicity of the tendon insertion with or without increase of its thickness) and structural lesions (i.e., cortical abnormalities erosions and enthesophytes, and calcifications) according to the OMERACT enthesitis composite semi quantitative scale (0 to 3).
55
Finally, the presence of tenosynovitis will be also recorded.  The following 28 bilateral 
tendons will be assessed for Grayscale and Doppler tenosynoviti s:

Dispense Study Drug, Dosing and Compliance
Adalimumab and MTX
Study medication(s), dosing instructions and a dosing diary wil l be dispensed to subjects 
beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and as specified in Appendix C .  Investigators will be 
provided with additional MTX product information from the manufacturer.  The first dose 
of study drug(s) will be administered after all other Baseline (Day 1) procedures are 
completed. 
MTX will be provided for either oral or subcutaneous (sc) admin istration as requested by 
[CONTACT_737].  ADA and sc MTX will be administered to subje cts by [CONTACT_697137], by [CONTACT_12552]/herself or by a designee (friend, family member o r health care professional)

Subjects or a trained designated family member or friend or a h ealth care professional will 
administer the injections of the study medication(s) in the subject's home or in the clinic 
during the weeks the subjects are not in the office for schedul ed study visits.
For subjects that cannot/will not self-administer study medicat ion(s) or do not have 
adequate support (friend, family member or healthcare professional) at home, administration will occur in the clinic.
On those days that a study visit takes place, study medication is to be administered after 
all clinical assessments including questionnaires, ultrasound evaluation (if applicable) and 
vital sign determination.
Adalimumab should be administered sc at approximately the same time of the day eow or 
ew, as per study protocol (with the exception of office visits) .  At all office visits, subjects 
should be observed after study drug administration until judged clinically stable by [CONTACT_197121].  Study drug should be administered after all c linical assessments 
including questionnaires and vital sign determination.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of study medication should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  When dosing at home, subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_29261] w ith any signs or symptoms 
of a reaction.  (See Section 6.1.7 for toxicity management).
MTX should be administered orally or sc at approximately the sa me time of the day ew.  
During the study subjects should continue with their regular MT X administration 
schedule prior to the study enrolment.  If MTX is not routinely taken on the day of the study visit, the MTX will be dispensed to the subject and the s ubject will take the 
medication home and administer it at their regular schedule.  There is no relation between the adalimumab and MTX administration schedule defined per this study protocol, but generally adalimumab and MTX are not recommended to be administ ered on the same 
day.  See Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_946095] back to the study Part 1 or 2 dosing schedule as so on as possible.
Subjects will maintain a dosing diary for all study drug admini stered outside of the study 
visit (i.e., at home) to capture dosing dates and times.  The subject must be instructed to return study drug and diaries at each clinic visit for the purpose of compliance assessment and drug accountability as detailed in Section 5.5.7.  At visits specified in Appendix C , 
the site personnel will review and retain a copy of the dosing diary, returned study drug 
kits, and empty study drug packaging to verify compliance.  Add itionally, any discernible 
departure from the protocol rega rding study drug a dministration will be documented 
appropriately.
Randomization and Assignment of Subject Numbers
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study.

Appendix C only for subjects receiving adalimumab.
Collection of Samples for Serum Adalimumab Concentration and AAA Analysis
Blood samples for serum adalimumab concentration and AAA will be collected prior to dosing by [CONTACT_51036] 6 mL evacuate d serum collection tubes 
without gel separator.  Sufficient blood will be collected to provide approximately 2.4 mL serum for the adalimumab and AAA assays.  The central laboratory will provide supplies for sample collection, processing, storage and shipment.  Pleas e refer to the central 
laboratory manual for specific instructions on sample collectio n, processing, storage and 
shipment.  Additional PK/AAA assays may be analyzed (where allowed by [CONTACT_13144]).
[IP_ADDRESS] Handling/Processing of Samples
The blood samples for adalimumab and AAA will be handled/processed as outlined 
below.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Serum Adalimumab Concentration and AAA Analysis
The blood samples for adalimumab and AAA will be centrifuged within 30-60 minutes of 
collection using a centrifuge to separate the serum and should be documented in the 
source document.  Serum samples will be split into four aliquots, all being shipped to the central laboratory.  Split-2 aliquots should not be shipped wit h the split-1 aliquots from 
the same draw.  The serum samples will be transferred using plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_697094], type of 
sample (serum [SRM]), the protocol number, the subject number, the planned study day, 
and the assay type (PK Split 1, PK Split 2, AAA Split 1, AAA Split 2).  Serum samples will be frozen within 2 hours after collection and will remain frozen at –20°C or colder 
until shipped and should be documented in the source document.  Sites that do not have 
Adalimumab

access to a –20°C or colder freezer will need to ship the sampl es the day they are 
collected.
Additional detailed instructions for the handling and processing of samples will be 
provided from the central laboratory.
[IP_ADDRESS] Disposition of Samples
The frozen blood samples will be packed in dry ice sufficient to  last 3 days during 
transport and shipped from the study site to central laboratory  according to instructions 
from the central laboratory manual.  An inventory of the samples included will 
accompany the package.  The central laboratory will then ship t he samples to [COMPANY_013] for 
analysis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Methods
Serum concentrations of adalimumab and AAA will be determined using validated ligand 
binding methods under the supervision of the Drug Analysis Depa rtment at [COMPANY_013].  Any 
additional analytes may be analyzed using non-validated methods .  The residual serum 
volume of the samples may be used for future exploratory assay development and 
validation.

In the event the incorrect dose is taken or a dose is missed, the subject should be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_697146].  The subject must 
record all dosing information for adalimumab and MTX separately  on the Subject-Dosing 
Diary.

5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated representatives will dis pense study drugs only for 
use by [CONTACT_697147].  
Appropriate site staff will supervise the subject's administration of the study drug at 
required in-office study visits to ensure proper injection tech nique.  In order to document 
compliance with the treatment regimen, the subject will be give n a Subject-Dosing Diary 
for adalimumab and MTX to record all dosing dates and times.  Compliance information will be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Subjects will be c ounseled on missed doses 
of medication and it should be documented in the subjects' source.  If the subject does not return the dosing diary, IP boxes and sharp containers (when applicable), the site should question the subject and obtain as much information as possible  as to the dosing of the 
study drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re-verified and documented in the source whe n the dosing sheet is 
returned before completing on the applicable eCRF page.

including but not limited to date received, the lot number, Kit number(s), date dispensed, subject number and identification of person dispensing the drug .
All empty IP boxes (tablets, pen, prefilled syringes) and the s tatus of each bottle, number 
of tablets remaining in each one returned, will be inventoried by [CONTACT_779].  Each subject 
will be given their own sharps disposal container to store used  adalimumab pre-filled 
syringes and/or methotrexate pre-filled pens, if necessary.  Em pty IP boxes, empty bottles, 
any unused study drug and Sharps containers should be returned by [CONTACT_697150].  Site staff will complete study medication accountability in IRT , using source documents, 
subject dosing diaries, empty IP boxes, bottles and by [CONTACT_697151]/or pens in the Sharps container whenever possible.  Used Sh arps containers should 
never be opened.  The site monitor will verify drug accountabil ity either at the site or 
during remote monitoring and will complete the reconciliation i n IRT.  The site staff will 
document that the used pre-filled syringes and/or pens have bee n destroyed, using 
appropriate biohazard precautions, when appropriate.  All study  drug unit doses must be 
inventoried, accounted for, and returned to [COMPANY_013] or destroyed  per instructions from

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multi-country study in 
subjects with PsA consisting of 2 parts:  Part [ADDRESS_946133] recommended or tolerab le dose; Part 2 is to 
compare the maintenance or achievement of MDA between four diff erent treatment 
regimens using adalimumab and/or MTX, with subject allocation based on the initial randomized treatment and achievement of MDA in Part 1.
An open label design was chosen to be able to allow for the subcutaneous and not solely 
oral MTX use.  Although oral MTX is the usual way of using MTX in PsA, some patients may be switched to parenteral MTX in the case of gastrointestin al intolerance or 
insufficient effectiveness in clinical practice.  This is a pra gmatic study, aiming to reflect 
and inform clinical practice.
Subjects eligible for the study are required to have prior MTX therapy at [ADDRESS_946134] of MTX.38  The treatment regimens investigated in 
Part 2 of the study are used in clinical practice but lack scie ntific evidence.
MDA was selected as the primary effectiveness variable for the following reasons:  it is a 
composite disease activity measure encompassing all crucial domains of PsA, including 
patient perspective, and has been well validated in PsA; corresponds to the status of remission or low disease activity; has been shown to be associated with long-term patient benefits in terms of less radiographic progression and improvements in PROs, has been recommended as the treatment target in PsA; was shown to be abl e to discriminate 
between active treatment and placebo as well as different treatment regimens (T2T approach and standard of care).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An  adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal l aboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a med icinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be rep orted as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are  considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, n ecessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study  will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a  pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the stu dy (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse e vent.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_946142]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively  
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946143] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening , 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
Assessment of adverse event relationship to the study medications(s) will be made with 
respect to adalimumab and MTX.  The investigator will use the f ollowing definitions to 
assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946144] a causal  
relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonab le possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Eve nts assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], another cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_697153].

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1.1 Analysis Population
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed f or the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 
one dose of study medication.  Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group they were randomized to.  In order to ev aluate the impact of major 
protocol violations on the results of the trial, additional ana lysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint may be conducted on the per protocol population if dee med necessary.  The Per 
Protocol population consists of all ITT subjects who entered th e randomized period of the 
study and did not meet any major protocol violation during the Part [ADDRESS_946160] one dose of study 
medication.
8.1.2 Statistical and Analytical Plan
Complete and specific details of the final statistical analysis will be described and fully 
documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP wil l be finalized prior to the 
database lock.  The analysis will be performed using SAS (SAS I nstitute Inc., Cary, NC, 
[LOCATION_003]).
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be conducte d at α = 0.05 level (2-sided).  
Descriptive statistics will be provided including but not limited to the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and max imum for continuous 
endpoints; and counts and percentages for binary endpoints.  
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_946161] completed 
Week 16 (Part 1) of the study.  The Week 16 study results (through Week 16) will be based on this database lock.  Statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed at Week 16 between the Par t 1 treatment groups.  No 
multiplicity adjustment will be performed for the statistical t ests since there is only 
one primary endpoint. 
Data from the subsequent period (Part 2) will be reported at the completion of the study 
by [CONTACT_9524] [ADDRESS_946162] available pre-treatment values recorded on or before D ay 1 (the first dose of 
Part 1) will be considered as the Baseline value for efficacy an alysis.  All subsequent 
study visits will be determined in reference to the baseline. To account for missing data for the binary efficacy endpoints, a non-responder imputation 
approach (NRI) will be used, i.e., subjects who discontinue dur ing Part 1 with missing 
data will be imputed as a non-responder.  For continuous endpoi nts, the Mixed-effects 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis based on all observed data will be used.  The rescued patients' last observation on or before the rescued visit will be included in the 
analysis of Part [ADDRESS_946163] deviation, median, minimum and maximum will 
be summarized for continuous variables; Binary endpoints will b e summarized via counts 
and percentages.

8.1.4 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Variable
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946165] tolerable dose ew.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in response rates between the 
adalimumab + MTX and MTX groups; the alternative hypothesis is that the response rates 
between the treatment groups are different.  The response rates will be tested using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratification factor of the duration of prior (to screening) use of MTX at 15 mg ew.  The stratifica tion factor is defined as the 
duration of prior MTX 15 mg ew use of ≤ 3 months or > 3 months.
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using the same method de scribed above using 
observed cases (OC).
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Variables
A complete list of secondary efficacy endpoints is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Binary 
secondary endpoints in Part [ADDRESS_946166] and baseline value

and standard error for each randomized treatment group, the LS m ean of the treatment 
difference and its associated 95% CI and p-value from the MMRM model will be 
presented.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Exploratory Analyses
Analysis for other efficacy endpoints referenced in (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be performed 
using similar methods to those described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to premature s tudy discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse event of special interest (AESI) will also be 
tabulated. 
Observed values of vital signs and laboratory variables at each visit will be summarized 
for all treated subjects, and change from baseline in selected lab variables will be compared between treatment groups using a one way ANOVA.  The l ast evaluation prior

The number of subjects will be tabulated overall for the following categories:  
randomized, ITT population, completed (e.g., Part 1), and disco ntinued for each treatment 
group and for the total sample as appropriate.  The reasons for  discontinuation will also be 
summarized per CRF categories. 
Treatment compliance will be summarized for adalimumab and MTX respectively for 
Part [ADDRESS_946170]'s participation in the study (rounded to 0.1%).  MTX compliance will be calculated as the number of tablets/inje ctions actually received 
divided by [CONTACT_310795]/injections expected during the  participation in the study.  
Compliance will be summarized for the ITT population.

Appendix H. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
Four anatomic sites – head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities – are assessed 
for erythema, induration and desquamation using a 5-point scale :
● 0 = no symptoms
● 1 = slight
● 2 = moderate
● 3 = marked● 4 = very marked
Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site, the area affected is assigned a 
numerical value:
● 1 = < 10%
● 2 = 10%-29%● 3 = 30%-49%
● 4 = 50%-69%
● 5 = 70%-89%● 6 = 90%-100%
Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to 
approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of body surface area, respe ctively; the PASI 
score is calculated using the formula:
PASI = 0.1(E
h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.3(E t+ It + D t)At+ 0.4(E l+ Il+ D l)Al
where E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respective ly, 
and h, u, t, and l denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, 
respectively.  PASI scores range from 0.[ADDRESS_946213] 2016-000191-21

Appendix J. Ultrasound Assessments and Scoring 
For the sites that will be part of the optional ultrasound assessment, Grey Scale (GS) and 
Power-Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) will be performed to all subjec ts included in the study 
at the defined time points of the protocol ( Appendix C ).
PDUS evaluation will be performed at 46 joints, 10 entheses and 28 tendons/tendon synovial compartments (see also Ultrasound evaluation in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study 
Procedures).
Joints Evaluation
Twenty-three (23) pairs of joints will be scanned at each time point:
● Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints 1 to 5,
● Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 1 to 5,
● Distal interphalangeal (DIP) 2 to 5,
● Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints 1 to 5,● Wrist, elbow, knee and ankle (tibiotalar).
The pre specified set of [ADDRESS_946215] with the joint in a neutral position, except for the knee, which will also be examined in a flexed position (30°). 
The US assessment will consist of an evaluation of hypoechoic s ynovial hyperplasia (SH) 
using Grayscale (or B mode) and synovial vascularization using PDUS.  The presence of 
synovitis (i.e., SH and Power Doppler signal) will be scored ac cording to the OMERACT-
EULAR PDUS composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3).

Entheses Evaluation
The following 5 entheses will be evaluated bilaterally:
1. Common extensor tendon insertion at the lateral humeral epi[INVESTIGATOR_697093],
2. Quadriceps tendon insertion at the superior pole of the patella,
3. Patellar tendon proximal insertion at the inferior pole of the patella,4. Patellar tendon distal insertion at the tibia tuberosity,5. Achilles tendon insertion and plantar aponeuroses insertion at the calcaneus.
For the enthesis evaluation, US will be initially performed in B mode to detect 
morphologic abnormalities, and subsequently with power Doppler to detect abnormal 
vascularization at bony insertion.  For each enthesis the following elementary lesions will be recorded within [ADDRESS_946219] definition of enthesitis:
55
● Presence of Doppler signal, 
● Hypoechogenicity of the tendon insertion, 
● Thickening of tendon insertion,● Erosions,
● Enthesophytes,
● Calcifications.
Except for the presence of Doppler signal, each elementary lesi on will be scored binary as 
present or absent.  The presence of Doppler signal will be scored semiquantitative as 0 
(absent) to 3 (severe), according to the following semi-quantit ative grade:
● 0 = absent
● 1 = maximum 3 Doppler spots, 
● 2 = more than 3 and less than 50% of the enthesis area● 3 = more than 50% of the enthesis area

outcomes.
Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as not in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab introduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20-[ADDRESS_946225] tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled 
after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatm ent arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, t here will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting t he selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and trea ted for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20-[ADDRESS_946226] tolerable d ose ew (MTX 20-[ADDRESS_946227] tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by [CONTACT_122271] 5.[ADDRESS_946228]'s MTX administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance o r toxicity, the MTX dose 
may be de-escalated by [ADDRESS_946229] 2016-000191-21

Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  For subjects receiving adalimumab, blood samples will be 
collected for determination of adalimumab serum concentrations and the presence of anti-adalimumab 
antibodies (AAA).
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):  Optional samples may be 
collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94421].
Safety:  Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, v ital signs, physical examination (if 
required) and laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Effectiveness:   The primary and secondary effectiveness variables will be analyzed for the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were random ized and received at least one dose of 
study medication.  Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tes ts will be conducted at α = 0.05 level 
(2-sided).  Descriptive statistics will be provided including b ut not limited to the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for conti nuous variables; and counts and 
percentages for discrete variables.  Statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints will be performed at Week [ADDRESS_946251] completed Week 16 (Part 1) of the study.  To account for missing data for the discrete effectiveness endpoints, a non-responder imputation ap proach (NRI) will be used, i.e., subjects 
who discontinue during Part [ADDRESS_946252] (LOCF) rule will be used to impute missing continuous effectiveness 
endpoints.  In addition, an analysis using all observed data adjusting for baseline values will be performed as a sensitivity analysis for the effectiveness endpo ints, using mixed-effects model repeated 
measures (MMRM) for continuous variables and logistic random-effect model for binary endpoints.  The rescued patients' last observation on or before the rescued visit will be included in the analysis of Part [ADDRESS_946253] 2016-000191-21
157
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Effectiveness (Continued):The response rates for the primary endpoint will be tested usin g a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test 
adjusting for strata (duration of baseline use of MTX).  Stratu m is defined as the duration of baseline 
MTX use at 15 mg ew ≤ 3 months or > [ADDRESS_946254].  Continuous secondary variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_148216] (number of subjects, mean, 95% confidence interval, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum, maximum).  Change from Baselin e in the continuous variables will be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate for LOCF imputation.  MMRM will be used for observed cases with stratum, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as  random effect and baseline value as 
covariate.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_697105], number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, me dian, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by [CONTACT_51064].  Data listings will 
be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of summary statistics and plots, concentration values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.   In addition, pharmacokinetic model-
based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F).
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment regimen, and rates of 
AAA positivity will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Ultrasound:  Analysis will be performed using similar methods to those described for the primary and 
secondary effectiveness variables.  Baseline weight will also be included as additional covariate in ANCOVA and MMRM.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, which includes all subjects that 
received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment-emer gent, and pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be summarized and reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study 
medication, and up to within [ADDRESS_946255] dose of the  study medication.  All treatment emergent 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA®).  The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulat ed by [CONTACT_72065].  In addition, a summary of AEs by [CONTACT_51066].  AEs, 
which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to p remature study discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will also be tabulated.

Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as n ot in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of theexclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab int roduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20 – [ADDRESS_946261] tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatm ent arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting t he selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and tre ated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20 – [ADDRESS_946262] tolerable dose ew (MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_946263] tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by [CONTACT_122271] 5.[ADDRESS_946264]'s MTX administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance or toxicity, the MTX dose may be de-escalated by [ADDRESS_946265] tolerable MTX dose 
below 20 – [ADDRESS_946266] 2016-000191-21
161
Methodology (Continued):   
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subj ects will be assigned to one of the 
4 treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial rand omized treatment, and treated for 
additional 16 weeks in Part 2 as follows:
•Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946267] MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 and cont inue receiving 
adalimumab as monotherapy (adalimumab 40 mg eow),
•Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week [ADDRESS_946268] adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combina tion with MTX 15 mg ew 
(adalimumab 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalat ed to 20 – [ADDRESS_946269] tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose  (MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_946270] 
tolerable dose ew),
•Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalated to 20 – [ADDRESS_946271] tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in  combination with MTX 20 –
[ADDRESS_946272] tolerable dose ew (adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MT X 20 – [ADDRESS_946273] 
tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-[ADDRESS_946274] not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the Invest igator, but should involve adalimumab 
and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows:
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) have  MTX 15 mg ew added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg e w (Arm 2) have MTX 
escalated to 20 – 25 mg ew,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_946275] tolerable dose ew (Arm 3) have adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20 – [ADDRESS_946276] 
tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to [ADDRESS_946277] 2016-000191-21

Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  For subjects receiving adalimumab, blood samples will be 
collected for determination of adalimumab serum concentrations and the presence of anti-adalimumab 
antibodies (AAA).
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):  Optional samples may be 
collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94421].
Safety:  Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, v ital signs, physical examination (if 
required) and laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Effectiveness:   The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed  for the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication.  Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests wil l be conducted at α = 0.05 level (2-sided).  A 
Week [ADDRESS_946290] completed Week 16 (Part 1) of the 
study and statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed at Week 16 between the Part 1 treatment groups.  No multiplicity a djustment will be performed for the 
statistical testing.  
To account for missing data for the binary effectiveness endpoi nts, a non-responder imputation approach 
(NRI) will be used, e.g., subjects who discontinue during Part 1 with missing data will be imputed as a 
non-responder.  For continuous endpoints, the Mixed-effects Mode l Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
analysis based on all observed data will be used.

Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratifica tion factor, the duration of prior MTX 
use of ≤ 3 mont hs or > [ADDRESS_946292] and baseline value as a covar iate.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_697105], number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, me dian, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by [CONTACT_51064].  Data listings will 
be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of summary statistics and plots, concentration values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.   In addition, pharmacokinetic model-
based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clea rance (CL/F) and apparent volume of 
distribution (V/F).
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment regimen, and rates of 
AAA positivity will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Ultrasound:  For the analysis of ultrasound endpoints in Part 1, similar MMR M model as described for 
the continuous secondary endpoints will be used and baseline weight will be included as an additional covariate in the MMRM model.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, which includes all subjects that 
received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment-emer gent AEs will be summarized and 
reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study 
medication, and up to within [ADDRESS_946293] dose of the  study medication.  All treatment emergent 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA®).  The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulat ed by [CONTACT_72065].  In addition, a summary of AEs by [CONTACT_697106].  AEs, 
which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to premature study discontinuation will be

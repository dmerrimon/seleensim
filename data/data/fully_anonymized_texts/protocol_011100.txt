PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 5 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 2.0 Background  
2.1 Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge : 
Current standards for COVID- 19 diagnosis include  nasopharyngeal  
(NP), nasal or saliva specimens to detect SARS -CoV -2 via 
polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) test . Because NP swabs are 
cumbersome to perform, uncomfortable for the patient, require 
health providers in personal protective equipment, scare young  
children and are not practical for large groups or repeat testing, we have been exploring the use of “lollipop” swabs. A lollipop swab, is 
an oral swab, sucked on like a lollipop for [ADDRESS_515114] to assess the sensitivity of the lollipop swab 
compared to a NP swab for the detectio n of SARS -CoV -2 in 
symptomatic individuals with PCR.  
Additionally, our group has extensive experience training and 
implementing testing for SARS -CoV -2 in K -12 schools. During the 
2020- 2021 academic school year, we trained two elementary schools 
to perform SARS -CoV -2 reverse transcription -loop-mediated 
isothermal amplification (RT -LAMP) saliva -based testing in 
Madison, WI. More broadly, we visited more than a dozen schools and districts to train staff how to perform BinaxNOW antigen tests. 
We generated an on line portal, complete with videos, training slides, 
and examples of consenting documents.
 Through these efforts, we 
provided more than 100 schools in Dane County with the tools needed to perform antigen tests in the spring of 2021.  
2.2 Relevant preliminary dat a: 
Our previous research showed that 25 symptomatic patients assessed within 7 days of onset of symptoms (and known to be infected with 
SARS -CoV -2) were all positive when a lollipop swab was used for 
collection. In addition, 5 asymptomatic patients known t o be infected 
with SARS -CoV -2 also proved to be positive when evaluated with a 
lollipop swab.  
2.3 Significance : The prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 among school -aged 
children in the 2021- 2022 academic year is unknown. Intense 
vaccination campaigns will reduce the num ber of cases, but 
vaccination uptake varies widely across Wisconsin. Children under the age of 12 years will likely not be eligible for vaccination until the 
late fall, leaving many children still susceptible to infection during 
part of the school year. Wi th the large number of children 
simultaneously returning to school (with many extracurricular activities), and potentially decreased attention to mitigation 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515115] COVID -19 shutdowns in Hong Kong and the [LOCATION_006], 
there were rapid increases in the cases of rhinovirus. This anticipated 
rise of symptomatic children requires a comprehensive strategy to 
quickly distinguish between cases of SARS -CoV -2 and non- SARS -
CoV -2 infections and implement a policy to consistently enable a 
prompt return to school.  
In order to appreciate the nuances of testing for infections with 
SARS -CoV -2, it is necessary to briefly discuss clinical presentation 
and viral replication.  
Clinical presentation and viral replication : Since the beginning of 
the pandemic, it was recognized that children are infected with 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_515116] before the onset of symptoms, virus 
multiplication in the nose and throat accelerates and the infected 
individual becomes infectious to others. Infecti vity of a given 
individual peaks in about the next 24 hours. They remain infectious for about 5 days, during which time the amount of virus in the nose 
and throat gradually decreases.  
Diagnostic Testing for SARS -CoV- 2 – Nucleic acid detection : 
The gold sta ndard for diagnostic testing has been detection of SARS -
CoV -2 nucleic acids by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The first 
tests to be developed were performed on a sample obtained from the 
nasopharynx. Eventually, these PCR assays were modified to be 
performed on other samples including either nasal mucosal swabs or 
samples of saliva collected in small receptacles. The transition to the 
use of other samples has been important since acquiring the 
nasopharyngeal (NP) sample requires trained personnel and is  
uncomfortable for the patient. Repeated NP tests are dreaded. Identifying the optimum sampling technique for children remains a 
challenge.   
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 7 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 PCR tests are generally performed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408291]. They are expensive—usually costing $75 to  $150 
dollars. They also take time to perform; although some tests are run in as short a time as an hour or two; others take [ADDRESS_515117] detects the nucleic 
acids even though the virus is no longer capable of replication.  
Antigen testing : Instead of detecting viral nucleic acids, the target 
for antigen tests is the nucleoprotein (N) protein of the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_515118] 
(hereinafter call BinaxNOW). The test comes packaged within a card  
which is the size and shape of a credit card and which opens like a 
small book. In addition, there is a container of reagent. The reagent 
is delivered into a small hole in the card. A nasal swab is obtained 
from the patient by [CONTACT_408296]. The swab is then inserted into the space where the 
reagent is located and turned several times. A positive test is 
indicated by [CONTACT_46917] [ADDRESS_515119] is reported to be approximately 94% sensitive 
in patients with symp tomatic COVID- [ADDRESS_515120] certainly become positive if repeated 
within 24 hours, as the climb in viral load is particularly steep once 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515121] is not infected with 
SARS -CoV -2, the repeat BinaxNOW will be persistently negative.  
Testing in schoo ls:  There are several instances in which testing 
individuals for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_515122] tracing. 
Howe ver, Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) requires 
that a negative BinaxNOW test in a symptomatic individual be followed by a PCR. This requirement reflects the imperfect 
sensitivity of the BinaxNOW card at 94% rather than 100%. 
However, PCR tests  are inconvenient for families and time 
consuming, so many families prefer to be isolated for [ADDRESS_515123] symptomatic individuals for SARS -CoV -
2. 
 
3.0 Study Objectives  and Endpoints  
3.1 Aim 1 : We will test the hypothesis that serial at -home BinaxNOW 
testing will be feasible and non- inferior to the single at -school PCR 
testing program. To do this, we will distribute over -the-counter 
BinaxNOW antigen tests to volunteer families and create a protocol 
to ensure families can perform and report test results accurately to the school. We  will address two key questions:  
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 9 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 1. Is ‘at -home’ BinaxNOW testing feasible for families?  
2. Is serial ‘at -home’ BinaxNOW testing non- inferior to ‘at -school’ 
single PCR testing?  
Aim 2 : We will test the hypothesis that lollipop swabs are more 
acceptable to individuals and PCR testing is non- inferior to 
performing PCR on nasal swabs. To test this hypothesis, we will 
work with MMSD schools to incorporate a lollipop swab for PCR at 
the time a symptomatic student or staff receives a nasal swab for 
PCR that is pa rt of the DHS program. We will address the following 
two key questions:  
1. Are lollipop swabs more acceptable to individuals when compared to nasal swabs?  
2. Will lollipop swabs perform as well as nasal swabs with PCR -
based testing?  
3.2 Hypotheses to be tested : 
Aim 1.1 : “At -home” BinaxNOW testing will be feasible for families.  
Aim 1.2 : Serial “at -home” BinaxNOW testing is non- inferior to “at 
school” single PCR testing.  
Aim 2.1 : Lollipop swabs are more acceptable to individuals than 
nasal swabs.  
Aim 2.2 : Lollipop swabs will perform as well as nasal swabs with 
PCR- based testing.  
 
4.0 Number of Participant s 
4.1 Total number of participants to be accrued:  
We expect to enroll approximately 4 50 participants.  
4.2 Number of participants needed to complete the research pr ocedures:  
To achieve adequate statistical power, [ADDRESS_515124] .  
An additional 50 participants with positive at -school BinaxNOW 
tests need to provide lollipop swabs.  
 
4.3 Replacing enrolled participants:  
If participants  with negative at -school BinaxNOW test  results  do not 
complete the procedures  within the target window , i.e., do not 
successfully completing the at -home BinaxNOW test within 72 
hours , they will be replaced . We will continue enrolling until 358 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS

PCR results.  
5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
5.1 Eligibility Screening:  
This study will enroll MMSD school children ages [ADDRESS_515126] nasal 
swab PCR tests at school , then school -approved  personnel may 
inform adults —staff or children’ s parents —of our research study. 
The staff will either provide a flyer or verbally  let them know it 
involves a lollipop test at that time, and if the at -school Bina xNOW 
is negative, it will also involve  the performance of an at -home 
BinaxNOW test in approximately [ADDRESS_515127] a nasal swab for the “at -school” BinaxNOW test.  
If the study team does not have any BinaxNOW tests due to a supply 
shortage, the at-school and at -home BinaxNOW tests will be 
dropped and participants will be recruited for a Lollipop Only alternative. Additionally, if a potential participant expresses interest 
in the study but is unwilling or unable to do at -home BinaxNOW 
testing, then th e study coordinator will offer them the Lollipop Only 
alternative.  
School -approved personnel  will also let potential participants  know 
that they would not be eligible to participate if they have had a 
previous positive COVID- [ADDRESS_515128] the study team in response to

study will not track information or explanations from participants 
who decline enrollment.   
5.2 Criteria that define who will be included in the final study sample:  
For Aim 1, p articipants with a negative at -school BinaxNOW test 
and nasal PCR results who complete both the  lollipop PCR and at -
home BinaxNOW  tests within [ADDRESS_515130] Sciences  or ACL .  
5.3 Criteria that define who will be excluded from the final study 
sample:  
If certain samples do not provide a result —such as if samples are 
missing, compromised, or invalid —the subject will not be incl uded 
in analyses for one or both of the study aims. Criteria for exclusion from analyses are as follows:

7.0 Recruitment Methods  
7.1 Recruitment Source:  
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515138]  elementary schools.    
 
7.2 Methods to Identify Potential Participants:  
Potential participants may learn about the study from the school 
nurse , nurse’s assistant, or whichever school -approved personnel are 
coordinating or administering COVID- [ADDRESS_515139] symptoms, they are prompted to take a screening 
survey, then school nurses review  the survey. Nurses may talk with 
parents on the phone and recommend that they bring their child (ren) 
to school for testing. If parents agree to at -school testing, the nursing 
staff may inform the parent of the study. Additionally, if a parent has a symptomatic child who attends a different MMSD school  (e.g., a 
child who attends  middle or high school) , the nursing staff may also 
recommend at -school testing for them, as well . If parents agree to at -
school testing for  any of their children ages 4- 19, the nursing staff 
may inform them about the study. The nursing staff will ask whet her 
a potential participant is interested in talking with a study 
coordinator.  
There will also be a sign at the schools near the location where 
COVID- [ADDRESS_515140]. The sign will ask if people are 
symptomatic and getting tested, and if yes, t hey may be eligible to 
participate in a study. I t instructs people to “call the study 
coordinator now” if they would like more information. When they 
call the number provided, the study coordinator would talk with  the 
potential participant or parent  on the phone or in person to provide 
more information about study details and eligibility. The study 
coordinator will also be wearing a UW badge, so if they are in close 
vicinity of the sign, participant s may also walk up to them  to ask 
about the study. Additionally, the study team may gently approach 
potential participants to see if they are interested in learning more 
about the study.  
 
7.3 Where, When and How Participants will be Recruited:  
If an MMSD student , teacher or staff member develops one or more 
symptoms consistent with COVID -19, either at home or at school, 
they may confer with the school nursing staff. The staff may 
recommend COVID -19 testing at the school. If a  symptomatic 
individual (or their parent, in the case of children) agrees  to a nasal 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515141] questions about 
the sign or are interested in learning more about the study. The study 
team will be careful to be respectful, rather than intrusive, in their 
approach.  
7.4 Recruitment Materials:  
Flyers describing the study are available  in both English and  
Spanish. Schools could use the flyer, at their discretion, to inform the 
school community about the study that is taking place. School -
approved  personnel , such as ACL staff,  could also use the flyer to 
inform potential participants about the study  at the time they are 
eligible .  
A sign describing the study wi ll be placed near the location where 
COVID- [ADDRESS_515142]. It instructs people to call the study 
coordinato r if they are experiencing symptoms and getting  tested.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515143] a supply of BinaxNOW tests, the 
Lollipop Only flyer and poster will be used for recruitment.  
7.5 Compensation:  
All participants will be offered a small prize, such as a s ticker or 
small toy, for completing the lollipop swab. All participants who 
complete an at -school BinaxNOW test will also be given a 
BinaxNOW COVID- [ADDRESS_515144] approximately $[ADDRESS_515145] will need to use one of the two tests to 
complete study procedures. Remaining tests may be used at 
participants’ discretion.  
For participants who have a ne gative at -school BinaxNOW test and 
therefore complete the at -home BinaxNOW test, t his study will 
provide subjects or their parent /legal guardian , in the case of 
children, with a $[ADDRESS_515146] . It is possible for 
people to participate in this research study more than once—they 
may be eligible each time they get a BinaxNOW test and nasal PCR 
at school , if they have not had a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_515147] 3 
months . Therefore, participants will be re -consented and 
compensated each time they participate in the study. If participants 
do not complete the virtual/home visit, they will not receive a gift 
card.  
 
8.0 Consent /Assent  Process  
 
8.1 A trained study team member will obtain informed consent from all 
adult participants and all parent/legal guardians of child participants. 
The trained study team member will also obtain assent  from all 
children . If a parent or legal guardian chooses to enr oll more than 
one child in the study, the consent and assent process will be 
completed for each child enrolled. Children ages 4 -14 will be 
assented using the Assent Script . Children ages 15- 17 will be 
assented using the Consent Script.  There will be minor differences in 
assent  discussions depending on children’s ages, as study team 
members will use age- appropriate language.   
 If the study team does not have a supply of BinaxNOW tests, or if a 
potential participant is unwilling or unable to complete at -home 
BinaxNOW testing, the Lollipop Only consent and assent will be 
used.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515148] on the data 
collection form whether or not the parent or legal guardian consents 
to email communicatio n. Consent scripts  will be provided in person, 
by [CONTACT_2319], or by [CONTACT_6968], per the participant or parent’s preference.  
There will not be any waiting period between informing the 
prospective participant and obtaining the consent. Study team 
members will ensure t hat parents and legal guardians will not feel 
pressured to participate. When initially approaching subjects about 
the research participation opportunity, the study team will emphasize 
that there is no penalty for choosing not to participate.  If parents or 
legal guardians indicate that they feel rushed, do not have time to 
fully consider the decision, or they can’t ask all their questions, then 
study team members will encourage them not to enroll.  Assent will 
be sought after obtaining consent from a parent o r legal guardian.  
A trained study team member will ask questions about key elements 
of the consent and assent to ensure the potential participant is 
understanding. Based on their responses to the questions, the study 
team member will determine whether a potential participant 
understands the information.  
At the beginning of the virtual or at -home study visit for BinaxNOW 
testing, the study team member conducting the visit will remind the 
participant and their parent (in the case of children) that participation 
in research is voluntary. Virtual visits will be conducted using a 
UW-approved videoconferencing platform.  
We will be following HRP -090 – SOP – Informed Consent Process 
for Research. In accordance with the SOP, the consent script used for 
this study is the same as the consent form used for the long form of 
consent documentation, ex cept the signature [CONTACT_408316].  
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515149] oaded in 
ARROW. An assent script is also uploaded.  
 
8.2 This research involves no greater than minimal risk to adults or 
children, and it involves no procedures for which written 
documentation of consent is normally required outside of the 
research context. Therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written 
conse nt and assent documentation. We will use consent and assent 
scripts to obtain verbal consent and assent, and we will provide an 
information sheet to the consenting guardian in person and/or via 
email or mail. We will document in the study’s secure database that 
verbal consent and assent occurred prior to any study procedures . 
We anticipate that parents or legal guardians may have someone else 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_408293], such as a grandparent or older 
sibling. Therefore, the ability to obtain consent verbally over the 
telephone is essential to be able to conduct this study. To keep in -
person and phone consent processes consistent by [CONTACT_2329] a script, we 
request a waiver of written consent and assent documentation for all 
participants.  
 
Non-English -Speaki ng Participant s 
We will enroll Spanish -speaking families. The consent script has 
been translated into Spanish by a translator employed by [CONTACT_408298] . Ideally, the study coordinator will be fluent in 
Spanish so that they can read the consent and assent scripts, solicit 
and answer any questions, and directly obtain verbal consent and 
assent. If the study coordinator is not fluent in Spanish, they will u se 
the services of a  translator. In that case, the study coordinator would 
conduct the consenting discussion and solicit questions in English, 
and the translator would relay this information to the participant in 
Spanish . In other words, t he questions woul d be translated to English 
for the study coordinator, and the study coordinator’s responses would be translated back to Spanish. If this process is conducted 
with a parent or legal guardian over the phone and a translator is 
required, the process would occur as described above.  
Participant s who are not yet adults (children)  
We will obtain assent from all children who enroll in this study.  If 
they do not assent, we will not enroll them. The study coordinator 
conducting assent will have sufficient experience  and/or training in 
working with children in this age range . They will use age-
appropriate language to inform children that participating in research 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 18 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 studies is voluntary, meaning it is entirely up to them if they want to 
be in the study. They will be told  that no one on the study team will 
be upset or disappointed if they do not wish to participate . The child 
will be asked directly if they would like to participate, and they will 
need to verbally answer in the affirmative. Passive resignation will 
not be c onsidered assent. Study coordinators will receive training 
from experienced study staff in recognizing and responding to 
children’s dissent . 
Individuals under the age of 18 are considered “children” for the 
purposes of this study. We will enroll students 4  to 19 years old.  
Since no greater than minimal risk to children is presented by [CONTACT_62315], we will obtain permission from one parent or legal guardian, 
even if another parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares legal responsibil ity for the care and custody of 
the child.  
Permission will be obtained from legal guardians, as determined by 
[CONTACT_52721].   
Assent will be obtained from all children enrolled in the study.  
Assent will be obtained using a verbal script. The Assent Script will 
be used for children ages 4 -14, and the Consent Script will be used 
for children ages 15- 17. If children choose to participate, their  verbal 
assent will be documented in the study’s secure database.

be in private, quiet locations whenever conducting virtual study 
visits.   
Since we are conducting research in elementary  schools, we will 
seek approval from school districts. We will submit documentation  
from an appropriate authority at each school or district granting 
permission to conduct the human subjects research. We will contact 
[CONTACT_408299].  
11.0 Study Intervention  
 
11.1 The “lollipop” swab collection method and the BinaxNOW COVID- [ADDRESS_515152] provides 
result s for COVID- 19, Influenza A, and Influenza B.  
11.2 Study team members will store, handle, and guide administration of  
the “lollipop” collection swab. They will instruct participants to suck 
on the swab for [ADDRESS_515153] via 
video chat or in person. For Spanish -speak ing participants/parents, 
the study team member supervising the test will either be fluent in 
Spanish, or they will use the services of a translator.  
11.3 The “lollipop” collection swab is a non -significant risk device. It 
does not meet the definition of “sign ificant risk,” which is a device 
that presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety or welfare of subjects.  
The saliva sample collected from the “lollipop” will be analyzed by [CONTACT_408300] -Flu Multiplex Assay. The FDA 
approved this assay for use  with nasal swabs under the Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) only. The saliva samples collected from the “lollipop” 
may also be analyzed by [CONTACT_408301]- 19 PCR testing  or a multiplex assa y.

13.0 Procedures Involved  
13.1 Study Design: T his is a quantitative community -based study, 
conducted in the K -12 setting with school children 4-19 years old , 
teachers, and staff.  
If a participant’s initial at -school BinaxNOW test is positive , then 
they will only com plete the lollipop swab for PCR testing. They will 
NOT do the at -home BinaxNOW test  virtual visit .  
If a participant’s initial at -school BinaxNOW test is negative , then 
they will complete both the lollipop swab for PCR testing AND an 
at-home BinaxNOW test approximately [ADDRESS_515155] any BinaxNOW tests due to a supply 
shortage, or if a potential participant is unwilling or unable to 
complete at -home BinaxNOW testing, the BinaxNOW procedures 
will be dropped and only the lollipop swab will be collected.

*All adult study participants will provide  informed consent and basic information  
at school. For children  participants , the parent or legal guardian may provide 
consent and basic information either over the phone or in person.  
**Only participants who have a negative at -school BinaxNOW test will be asked 
to do an at -home BinaxNOW test.  
***If the study team runs out of BinaxNOW tests, or if a participant is unwilling 
or unable to complete at -home BinaxNOW testing, these study procedures will 
not be performed. Participants will be consented for the Lollipop -Only alternative.  
13.3 Immediately after consent/assent, the study coordinator will collect 
information about the participant (name, date of birth, gender , race, 
and ethnicity ), as well as the parent or legal guardian’s name, in the 
case of children. The study coordinator will also collect the 
participant’s  physical and mailing address es, phone number, and 
email address. If participants provide their email address, the study coordinator will ask if they are willing to be contact[CONTACT_408302]. The study coordinator will verbally ask questions 
and record responses via real -time electronic data capture in ICTR 
REDCap.  
If the study coordinator is unable to collect data directly in REDCap, such as 
if there is no internet connection or ICTR REDCap is down, then the study 
team will enter data according to an emergency back -up protocol. For this 
protocol, the s tudy team may record answers electronically in a PDF version 
of the data collection form. They may temporarily store PDF files locally on 
an encrypted laptop computer managed by [CONTACT_77504] -Madison Department of 
Pediatrics Computer Services. As soon as possible, st udy team members 
would enter data and upload the PDF into REDCap, then immediately delete 
the file from local storage. The local laptop storage will serve as a transfer proxy, rather than a storage location. Whenever this emergency protocol for 
data collection is followed, the study team will also follow a sanitation 
protocol to ensure that the PDF is stored only in REDCap. For sanitation, 
the PDF will be permanently deleted by [CONTACT_408303], once the primary data collection method b ecomes available. The PDF 
files will be stored locally in a folder specifically set up to be excluded from 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 22 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 the client’s backup routine. If files are accidentally backed up, they will be 
manually removed from the backup and deleted permanently from all 
locations except REDCap.  Additionally, the SMPH VPN via the Palo Alto 
Global Protect client, configured and available for use on all DOP 
endpoints, will be enabled and connected by [CONTACT_5014] -user on data collection 
endpoints whenever study data is being accessed  or transferred.   
The study team will make every effort to enter data directly into REDCap in 
real time. The study team will use a wireless hotspot for reliable internet 
connectivity, rather than relying solely on the school’s Wi -Fi connection, to 
minimize  the need for this emergency data collection protocol.  
After this basic information is collected, the study coordinator will 
begin testing. If the participant did not already receive an at -school 
BinaxNOW test, then the study coordinator will collect the n asal 
swab for and administer the BinaxNOW test. When study staff 
collect the nasal swab for the BinaxNOW test, they may encourage 
parents/legal guardians to comfort their child. Participants under the 
age of [ADDRESS_515156] a nasal swab, they will not be enrolled 
in the study.  
Next, the study coordinator will guide the participant through 
completing a “lollipop” swab at school. The lollipop swab is 
obtained by [CONTACT_408304] a swab for [ADDRESS_515157]’s full name, date 
of birth, and the date and time of collection.  
If the study team does not have any BinaxNOW tests due to a supply 
shortage, study participation will end after the lollipop swab is 
collected . If BinaxNOW test s are available  and the participant 
intends to do the at -home antigen testing , then the at -school antigen 
testing is required.  
If a participant’s initial at -school BinaxNOW test was positive , then 
their study participation is complete after providing the lollipop swab 
for PCR testing.  
If a participant’s initial at -school BinaxNOW test was negative , then 
they will be asked to complete an at -home BinaxNOW test 
approximately 24 hours later.

14.0 Comparison of usual c are and study procedures  
14.1 If individuals want additional testing for COVID -19, they  could obtain 
PCR testing at a variety of locations, such as a local testing center, 
pharmacy, or their child’s PCP’s office. The parent could also choose to 
purchase and administer their own BinaxNOW test from a supplier , such as 
Walgreens or CVS . They may also seek out an alternative type of testing. 
Cost, convenience, and parent and child willingness are all factors that 
influence which types of te sting may or may not be selected.

by [CONTACT_408313]’ HIPAA -secure Box  for 
sharing with Exact . The lollipop collection swabs will be labeled 
with the participant’s study ID  and date of collection.  
 To obtain the nasal swab PCR test results from ACL, the study team 
will include information on the lollipop swab label and 
accompanying requisition form, including the participant’s name, 
date of birth, and date and time of collection. ACL will match this 
information to a nasal swab and provide PCR test results for both the 
lollipop and nasal swab.  
 
The results of the nasal swab and lollipop PCR test s will be sent via 
Exact Sciences’ HIPAA -secure Box  or a UW -Madison

result will govern whether the child is permitted to return to school 
when symptoms resolve (if PCR is negative) or is required to stay at 
home for 10 days  (if PCR is positive) . As the resulting la b, Exact 
Sciences and ACL are  responsible for reporting the nasal PCR 
results to Dane County Department of Health Services. Since the 
lollipop swab is investigational, results do not need to be reported to 
health officials.  
For overall care management and  recommendations, the study team 
is deferring to the school, which conducts and receives results of the 
nasal swab PCR result. Since this is the clinical test, the investigators 
would not recommend changing care management based on the 
exploratory test res ults in this study (lollipop swab and BinaxNOW). 
Any time an at -home BinaxNOW test is positive, the study team will 
encourage participants to follow up with the school and/or their PCP 
for recommendations. In short, the overall care plan will be based on 
the nasal swab PCR and managed by [CONTACT_52721].

20.0 Study Analysis  
20.1 Statistical Hypotheses : 
Aim 1: The null hypothesis is that the negative predictive value of BinaxNOW is at least 91% (which is the reported rate in symptomatic 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515171]) versus the alternative hypothesis that the NPV is 
greater than 91%.  
Aim 2: The lollipop swab test will be non -inferior to the gold- standard PCR 
testing of nasal swabs.  
 
20.2 Sample Size Justification :  
 For Aim [ADDRESS_515172] 
will identify true negatives in >95% of participants. The primary diagnostic 
outcome measure will be the negative predictive value (NPV). The NPV of  
BinaxNow is ~91% in symptomatic subjects. For the proposed study, the 
NPV after the second test ([ADDRESS_515173] negative results), is 
assumed to be substantially higher than 91% since the first test was already 
negative. I n order to detect a true NPV after the second test of at least 95% 
with 90% power at the one -sided 0.05 significance level, a sample size of 
N=[ADDRESS_515174] is required. To reach a 
sample size of N=[ADDRESS_515175], BinaxNOW 
kits will be administrated to 400 participants. We intend to continue 
enrolling until we reach the target sample size of N=[ADDRESS_515176].  
 
20.3 Participant Population for Analysis : 
For Aim 1, we will i nclude all participants who complete the at -home 
BinaxNOW test within 72 hours (N =358) and have nasal PCR results . For 
Aim2, we will include all participants who have both nasal and  lollipop PCR 
results .  
 
20.4 Statistical Methods :  
 Aim 1 . Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and NPV of 
the proposed BinaxNOW testing procedure for symptomatic subjects will be 
calculated and reported along with the corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence interval. Formal non -inferiority t esting of the BinaxN0W testing 
procedure with PCR will be conducted with respect to sensitivity and 
specificity with a non- inferiority margin of δ=5% and a 
sensitivity/specificity of PCR of 99%.    
 
Aim [ADDRESS_515177] results will be evaluated by [CONTACT_408314] -sided 95% confidence interval. The 
nonparametric bootstrap technique will be used to construct the confidence 
interval. A kappa statistic of >0.[ADDRESS_515178] outcomes, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV will be calculated (using the nasal swab -based 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page [ADDRESS_515179]), and reported along with the corresponding two -
sided 95% confidence intervals. For mal non -inferiority testing of the 
lollipop swab test with PCR will be conducted with respect to sensitivity 
and specificity with a non- inferiority margin of δ=5% and a 
sensitivity/specificity of PCR of 99%. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS  software (SAS Institute, Cary NC), version 9.4 or greater.  
 
20.6 Handling of Missing Data : The primary analysis for evaluating the 
diagnostic utility of the BinaxNOW testing procedure will be based on the complete case principle. Since the analyses of this study won’t involve any 
formal multivariate or longitudinal statistical modeling, no imputation -based 
analyses will be conducted.
  
 
21.[ADDRESS_515180] for COVID -19. Through asking 
questions and/or receiving confirmation that they are conducting the test correctly, individuals and families may feel more confident conducting at -home 
tests in the future. If the second test in the BinaxNOW kit is not used as a back -up 
during the study, the participant may keep the test and use it later if they feel 
comfortable doing so. The BinaxNOW te sts are also readily available to families 
at local retailers, such as Wa lgreens. Therefore, if a family member is 
symptomatic in the future, they may feel more comfortable doing at -home testing 
independently.  
 
The results of the BinaxNOW test, along with other information, can help 
participants’ healthcare providers make info rmed recommendations about their 
care. For example, in the case that the original BinaxNOW and nasal swab PCR tests were negative and the delayed, at -home BinaxNOW test is positive, that 
would be helpful information for a participant’s primary care provide r. That 
information will need to be integrated with the results of the nasal PCR that was 
also performed. The probability that the delayed, at -home BinaxNOW test will be 
positive is less than 5%.  
 
If the results of the at -home BinaxNOW test are negative, that may help 
individuals and families feel more confident in the initial results they received.   
The results of the at -home BinaxNOW test in this study, or any future at -home 
BinaxNOW tests that families may conduct, may help limit the spread of COVID -
19 to participants’ families and others in their community.  
 
22.0 Risks to Participant s 
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 32 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 22.1 There are no know n or anticipated risks of the lollipop swab 
collection method. Our study team implemented a similar testing 
method in a previous study (2017- 1425), and it was well tolerated by 
[CONTACT_4317].  
Potential risks of the BinaxNOW at -home test include possible 
discomfort or other complications that can happen during sample 
collection . Since study coordinators will observe sample collection 
and correct or support as needed, the probability of this risk is very 
small.  
Another potential risk of the BinaxNOW test is a possible incorrect 
test result. However, the definitive test result which will govern 
management  of care is the nasal PCR.   
There is a risk of a breach of confidentiality.

23.0 Provisions  to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
Partici pant s 
 
23.1 The study team will build, run, and regularly review reports in 
REDCap to monitor study progress and identify potential problems.  
Regularly reviewed reports will include data elements essential to 
the study’s aims, as well as information about potentially reportable 
events.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: SAFE AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS  
 Page 33 of 34 Version 8, May 2022 Study team members will enter information about any potential 
reportable events, including adverse events, protocol deviations, 
and/or participant complaints into REDCap. Information will be 
reviewed by a principal investigator .  
Information about potentially reportable events will be recorded at 
each participant interaction.  
The principal investigators will review potentially reportable events 
in a timely manner.  
Cumulative data will be reviewed every two months after enrollment 
commences.  
We do not anticipate any conditions that would trigger an immediate 
suspension of the research.  
24.0 Economic Burden to Participant s 
24.1 Participants will not be responsible for any costs because of 
participation in the research.

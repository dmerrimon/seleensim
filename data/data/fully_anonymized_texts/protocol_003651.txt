Title of study : Real world glycemic effectiveness of linagliptin (Tradjenta) among type 2 
diabetes mellitus adults by [CONTACT_712076]:Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have progressive decline in 
renal function and this decline in function is greater than age -related decline 
in patients without diabetes .  Selection of glucose lowering agents is often 
affected by [CONTACT_712077].  Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP -4) 
inhibitors are approved to treat hyperglycemia among adults with T2DM 
with a wide range of renal function.  In contrast to most other DPP -4 
inhibitors, linagliptin does not require dose adjustment as renal function 
declines.  Without further requirement of dose adjustment, linagliptin affords 
simplicity for chronic management of HbA1c.
 
 Current literature indicate that decline in renal 
function is also asso ciated with glycemic control, hypertension, albuminuria 
and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  However, there is limited evidence about the real world 
effectiveness and safety of linagliptin across different age and renal functions 
among adults with T2DM. 
For better manageme nt of hyperglycemia it is pertinent to understand the 
glycemic effectiveness of linagliptin among adults with T2DM with varying 
age and renal function who are treated in the real world setting.  With a 
potentially larger sample size, it is possible to comp are the glycemic 
effectiveness of linagliptin across the range of ages and renal function.  
 
The aim of the curren t study is to compare real world glycemic effectiveness 
across a range of ages and renal function among adults with T2DM who are 
initiated on linagliptin.  
 
Research question

Study size: This study is exploratory and not characterized with a priori hypotheses.  All 
patients identified in the data that meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet 
the exclusion criteria will be included in the study population .
A sample size calculation was c onducted to determine the minimum number 
of patients that would be required to detect a change in HbA1c of at least 
0.5% among the cohort groups.  Based on previously published studies, it 
was assumed that the standard deviation for the [ADDRESS_968545] (e.g., age, renal function, age

HbA1c of at least 0.5% using a two -sided test at an alpha o f 0.05.  If the 
standard deviation for the change in HbA1c is 1.5, then [ADDRESS_968546] groups .

Secondary analysis 
Comparisons of pre -index characteristics and outcome measures will be 
provided, and appropriate tests will be used based on the distribution of the 
measure.  Continuous measures will be compared using t -tests and 
categorical measures will be compared using chi-square tests. P- values and 
95% confidence intervals will be reported. Reported p -values will not be 
adjusted for multiple comparisons.
In addition to the descriptive analyses described above, multivariable 
modelling will be considered to assess chang e in HbA1c, controlling for an a 
priori list of covariates. The use of multivariable modelling will be dependent 
on having robust sample size distribution across age and eGFR categories.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM)have progressive decline in renal function and 
this decline in function is greater than age
-related decline in patients without diabetes (1-4).  
Selection of glucose lowering agents is often affected b y the level of renal function.   
Dipeptidy l peptidase-4 ( DPP-4)inhibitors are approved to treat h yperglycemia among adults 
with T2DM with a wide range of renal function.  In contrast to most other DPP -4 inhibitors
(5),
linagliptin does not require dose adjustment as renal function declines.  Without further 
requirement of dose adjustment, linagliptin affords simplicity  for chronic management of 
HbA1c. 
 
  Current 
literature indicate that decline in renal function is also associated with gl ycemic control, 
hypertension, albuminuria and d yslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (9-11). However , there is limited evidence about 
the real world effectiveness and safety  of linagliptin across different age and renal functions 
among adults with T2DM. 
Data from clinical studies demonstrate that the expected reduction in HbA1c should be 
similar across the range of ages, but direct comparisons with y ounger patients are not 
available.  Barnett et al reported on 238 patients aged 70 or older randomized to linagliptin 5 
mg dail y (n = 160) or placebo (n=78).  The placebo adjusted mean difference in HbA1c after 
24 weeks was - 0.64% (95% CI  -0.81 to -0.48) (12).  Inzucchi et al reported on 247 patients 
aged 70 or older randomized to linaglipti n (n = 126) or placebo (n = 121 ) added to basal 
insulin (13).  The placebo adjusted mean difference in HbA1c after 24 weeks was -0.77 (94% 
CI -0.95 to -0.59).  These values are consistent with other studies of linagliptin , but do not 
provide direct comparison data with y ounger patients.  
Limited data from studies evaluating linagliptin in patients with renal impairment suggest that 
glycemic control is maintained across different levels of renal function.  Groop et al anal yzed 
data from three 24 wee k linagliptin clinical trials (n = 2,262) in which data from 2,143 
subjects were available to calculate renal function using theModified Diet Renal Disease 
(MDRD) equation (14).  Subjects were divided b y renal function into normal renal function 
(eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild renal im pairment (eGFR 60 to < 90 ml/mi n/1.73 m2) and 
moderate renal i mpairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73m2).  Distribution of subjects 
assigned to linagliptin vs. placebo b y renal function category wasas follows:  1) normal renal 
function: 870 linagliptin subjects and 342placebo subjects; 2) mildrenal function: 620
linagliptin subjects and 218placebo subjects; and3) moderate renal function: 68linagliptin 
subjects and 25placebo subjects .  The reduction in HbA1c was consistent across ranges of 
renal function.  However, the number of patients in the moderate renal d ysfunction category  
was quite small, so there is greater uncertainty  about the magnitude of the HbA1c reduction 
in this group.  These observations support the current proposal to demonstrate comparable 
effects in gl ycemic effectiveness across the range of renal function categories and provide 
more information in patients with low renal function especiall y in patients with eGFR < 45 
ml/min/1.73 m2.

inclusion criteria will be extracted from the database using Oracle® and SAS® - based tools 
and housed on Optum UNIX® servers for programming and analy sis by  [CONTACT_712086].
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
9.7.1 Feasibility Assessment
Feasibility  anal yses will include determinations of the number of patients in each potential 
category  of age and renal function. Some cells may  be too small (e.g. eGFR 30 to 44 
ml/min/1.73m2), but as long as most of the key  groups have sufficient numbers (as described 
in Section 9.5 Study  Size) of patients this will not detract from the overall results.  The 
number of AA individuals will not be as large as the full data set and as such some of the age 
and eGFR groups will be much smaller than for the whole group. Since the AA subgroup 
analysis isexploratory ,having some small groups will not significantly  limit the overall 
clinical interpretation even if statistical comparability  cannot be confirmed. 
Optum conducted a f easibility  anal ysis using data from the Optum EHR database. There were 
63,[ADDRESS_968580] one HbA1c result during the six -month period after the index date. 
Of these ,16,566 adult patients were newly  initiated on linagliptin with baseline and follow -
up HbA1c results, race/ethnicity was available in 15,289 patients, a serum creatinine value 
was available for 15,130 patients, and both race/ethnicity  and serum creatinine were available

Results will be stratified by [CONTACT_654], renal function, and race/ethnicity . Pre-index and outcome

The following stratifications will be condu cted among the overall study  population :

9.7.3
Secondary A nalysis
For the secondary  anal ysis, results will be stratified by  [CONTACT_654], renal function, and race/ethnicit y. 
Comparisons of pre -index characteristics and outcome measures across age, renal function, 
and race/ethnicit y strata will be provided, and appropriate tests will be used based on the 
distribution of the measure.  Continuous measures will be compared using t -tests and 
categorical measures will be compared using chi -square tests.  P-values and 95% confidence 
intervals will be reported. Reported p-values will not be adjusted for multiple com parisons.
In addition, as part of the secondary  anal ysis, m ultivariable modelling will be considered to 
assess change in HbA1c, controlling for an a priori list of covariates. The use of multivariable 
modelling will be dependent on having robust sample si ze distribution (as defined in Section 
9.5 Study  Size) across age and eGFR categories.  
Since the primary  outcome of change in HbA1c is calculated using just two timepoints, pre -
index and follow -up, multivariable anal ysis will be conducted using ordinary least squares 
(OLS).  In the event that the assumption that the majority  of patients have only  one HbA1c 
measure during the follow -up period turns out to be false and there are multiple HbA1c 
values per patient during this timeframe, mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) will be 
used to control for the correlation of multiple HbA1c observations from the same patient. 
Following standard procedure, regression diagnostics will be performed for each model to 
assess goodness of fit and violations of model ass umptions (e.g., multicollinearit y, 

Boehringer Ingelheim Page 28of 42

appropriate corrections to the data (i.e., t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_712071]) or i n the method of estimation.
The following list of covariates will be included in the model provided sufficient sample size 
distribution:
Age categories (40 to 54 years, 55 to 64 hears, 65 to 74 y ears, and 
≥ 75 y ears) 
Sex
Race
Ethnicity
Geographic region
Pre-index HbA1c
Pre-index renal function categories based on eGFR (< 30 ml/min/1.73m2, 30 to 44 
ml/min/1.73m2, 45 to 59 ml/min/1.73m2, 60 to 89 ml/min/1.73m2, and ≥ 90 
ml/min/1.73m2)
Pre-index Quan- Charlson comorbidity  score
Pre-index individual comorbidit ies (each of the AHRQ top 20 comorbidities identified 
for this population will be included unless the comorbidity  is already  included in the 
Charlson Comorbidity  Index)
Age and renal function categories will be assessed for adequate sample size across cat egories 
based on the sample size calculation reported in Section 9.5.  If the sample size distribution is 
not sufficient to evaluate age as a categorical variable, age will be included as a continuous 
variable in the model.  The eGFR categories of 45 to 59 ml/min/1.73m2(Stage 3A kidney 
disease) and 30 to 44 ml/min/1.73m2(Stage 3B kidney disease) will be collapsed into one 
category  (Stage 3 kidney  disease) if there is not sufficient sample to evaluate as separate 
categories..   If the sample size distribution is still not sufficient across the eGFR categories, 
then eGFR will be included as a continuous variable in the model.

9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METH ODS
This study  has several l imitations inherent to its non-interventional study  design.  Th ere may  
be baseline differences in the different age and renal function categories.  In randomized 
clinical trials, these differ ences are mitigated b y randomization.  Among the important 
considerations is if there are substantial differences in baseline HbA1c.  It is well known that 
the change from HbA1c is a function of baseline HbA1c, ie, the higher the baseline HbA1c, 
the greate r the change from baseline even with comparable doses of the glucose lowering 
medication.  This observation has been confirmed by  [CONTACT_712089] (22) intheir anal yses of 
several DPP4 inhibitors.  
Second, we have selected a follow up window of 6months rather than a longer window e.g. 
up to [ADDRESS_968589] the observation that medication persistence at 6months will like ly be 
Boehringer Ingelheim Page 31of 42

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_968590] -01(4.0)better than at [ADDRESS_968591], duration of T2DM is likely  to be longer in p atients with lower renal function. 
Increased duration of diabetes is also associated with greater reductions in beta cell function.  
Since one of the mechanisms of DPP4 inhibitor medications is to increase GL P-1 mediated 
insulin secretion , reduced renal function coul d theore ticall y be associated with diminished 
glycemic effectiveness.  If the current study  supports this observation, this will confound the 
claim of comparable gl ycemic effectiveness across the range of renal function, but it will be 
an important observation for themanagement of T2DM patients.  Lajra et al reported on a 
retrospective anal ysis of 202 patients from two separate trials in which patients with > 10 
years of diabetes were randomized to linagliptin 5 mg (n = 122) or placebo (n = 80)(15).  The 
placebo a djusted mean difference in HbA1c was -0.66% (95% CI - 0.85 to - 0.38).  No direct 
comparisons were made with shorter duration of diabetes.  However, these data suggest that 
differences in duration of diabetes are unlikel y to have a major effect on the data o btained in 
the current proposal.
Fourth , in contrast to many  real world evidence studies, this study  does not ha ve an active 
comparator.  Since all other DPP4 inhibitors require dose adjustment for declining renal 
functi on, a comparator study  to show simi lar/different effectiveness would be difficult to 
design to be able to account for all the patient factors that contribute to medication 
distribution, elimination and dosing and likely  would require an inordinately  large data base.
Fifth, due to the descr iptive nature of this study , multiple different comparisons are being 
conducted to evaluate change in HbA1c b y age, renal function, and race categories.  We have 
not adjusted our p values for multiplicity  but we may  perform post hoc adjustments if 
requeste d by [CONTACT_712090].    
Finally , the findings from this study  are expected to have limitations that are common to 
analysesconducted with r etrospective EHR data .  The possibility  of misclassification exists 
in all studies that rely on retrospective data.  Evidence of conditions and events that are based 
on reported diagnosis codes or procedure codes may
 not reflect confirmed diagnoses.  While 
EHR data capture prescriptions written by  a prescriber, it is not possible to know if patients 
received and adhered to their medication and there are no structured data fields to identify  if 
and when a medication was discontinued by  [CONTACT_712083]. The EHR database 
does not include the entire medical chart for the patient, which raises the possibility  of 
missing data.  Unlike claims data, EHR data do not contain eligibility  information and 
continuous eligibility  is not able to be assessed.  Services provided to the patient by  [CONTACT_712091] s ystems providing EHR data to Optum will not be 
captured although this is not expected to be a major limitation in this study  because the
primary  outcome
,HbA1c ,islikely  to be measured by  [CONTACT_712092]’s prescription for linagliptin.  However, there may  be circumstances where a patient 
may receive care that falls outside of their provider’s electronic record s ystem such as being 
treated at an out of network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

STUDY RESULTS
Example table shells showing t hedata lay out for the results for the overall population and for 
the AA subanal ysis are provided in 
the anal ysis plan.  
Results will be shared with the internal medical/marketing team as soon as they  have been 
completed and validated.   Manuscript of all of the results will be considered.   If the AA data 
are robust, this may  be a separate publication.
If abstract submission would not hold up publication this may  be a consideration.  However, 
getting the data into the public domain so that it can be used to answer external questions is 
important.
Authorship of an y publications resulting from this study  will be determined on the basis of 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (I CJME) Recommendations for the 
Conduct, Reporting , Editing and Publication of Scho larly Work in Medical Journals.  The 
Uniform Requirements state that all persons designated as authors should qualify  for 
authorship, and all those who qualify  should have participated sufficiently  in the work to take 
publi c responsibility  for appropriate portions of the content. One or more authors should take 
responsibility  for the integrit y of the work as a whole, from inception to published article.
Authorship credit should be based on:
Substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or anal ysis 
and interpretation of data
Drafting the article or revising it critically  for important intellectual content; and 
Final approval of the version to be published
Authors should meet all three conditio ns.

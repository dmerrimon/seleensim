 2.0 BACKGROUND  
There is a missing link in the present armamentarium to prevent antibody mediated 
rejection (AMR) in solid organ transplantat ion.  In cardiac transplantation, it is 
associated with more hemodynamic compromise, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and a 
higher mortality even when asymptomatic1,2,3,4 With the unavailability of better treatment 
options, present day maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_688160]. In the early eighties, with the introduction of 
cyclosporine and later tacrolimus, the one year actuarial survival rate in cardiac 
transplantation escalated significantly from 40% to  over 90%.1,[ADDRESS_933546] on humoral rejection. Although tacrolimus 
possesses the ability to decrease MHC expression and mod ulate B cell resp onses 
through T cell down -regulation, its efficacy on antibody mediated rejection is limited due 
to dose related side effects (i.e. namely, renal dysfunction, diabetes, anemia, 
neutropenia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesiemia).  Likewise, de spi[INVESTIGATOR_688161] (i.e.: 
IVIG, bortezomib, rituximab) or cytokine expansion (i.e. sirolimus, everolimus, 
mycophenolate), the mortality rate of AMR, accounting for up to 20%  of all long -term 
cardiac transplantation deaths, continues to remain high1,3,4. 
 
The growing proportion of sensitized cardiac recipi[INVESTIGATOR_688162].  Patients pre -exposed or “sensitized” to antigen exposing events 
(i.e.: blood transfusions, multiple pregnancies, prior organ transplantations, ventricular 
support devices) are more likely to both possess preformed and develop de -novo 
antib odies.  Sensitize d patients with panel reactive antibodies > 25% are at risk for 
increased mortality after heart transplantation 5,6.  Present desensitization strategies aim 
to decrease antibodies in the hope of facilitating the likelihood of transplantion .7,8 
However, suc h strategies may in turn be increasing the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s likelihood for AMR 
and subsequent graft failure due to B -cell memory and post -transplant antibody 
rebound. The search for newer therapeutic strategies in solid organ transplantation 
should therefore no t only aim to increase the number of sensitized patients eligible for 
transplantation, but to also prolong post -transplant survival and reduce morbidity.  
 
A central component of antibody -mediated cell injury is complement activation. 
Histo logically, eviden ce of complement activation with the presence of complement c3d 
and c4d deposition and evidence for endothelial cell injury, is highly supportive of the 
diagnosis of AMR and is now an important component in the pathological classification 
of AMR in cardiac  transplantation 6,7,8.  Clearly the best approach to treating AMR is by 
[CONTACT_688181]. One strategy 
would involve prevention of complement activation.

Eculizumab is a monoclo nal antibody that  specifically binds to complement protein C5 
with high affinity, thereby [CONTACT_29638] C5a and C5b and preventing the 
generation of the terminal complement complex C5b -9 9,10.(See Schematic 2.1: 
Description of the Complement C ascade and the Me chanism of Action of Eculizumab)  
By [CONTACT_7652], eculizumab (Soliris®) inhibits terminal complement mediated 
intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients.9  
 
In cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the inhibition o f terminal comple ment activation may be 
the missing link to decreasing possibly both complement -mediated AMR and cellular 
rejection (CR) by [CONTACT_688182].  A recent c linical trial in renal transplantation with 
terminal complement inhibition using eculizumab has shown very promising results, 
significantly reducing the incidence of AMR in the first 3 months after transplant from 
41.2% to 7.7% compared to a historical con trol cohort 5.  At one year post renal 
transplantation, there was a significant decrease in transplant glomerulopathy, a 
process of chronic rejection analogous to chronic allograft vasculopathy in cardiac 
transplantation5,6. 
 
Furthermore, the use of termin al complement inh ibition (at complement protein C5) and 
not earlier in the immune cascade, allows the opsonization of bacteria and the 
clearance of immune complexes to remain intact, potentially minimizing the likelihood 
for the adverse event of infection.9-[ADDRESS_933547] profile (of headache, 
naso -pharyngitis, back pain, nausea, and fatigue8) and the feasibility of administering a 
thirty minute infusion, eculizumab may be easily given at the time of a normally 
scheduled post -operative cl inical follow -up.  Additionally, by [CONTACT_688183]1-5 (when the risk of AMR is the greatest), the devastating repercussions 
of the complement cascade are p otentially obviat ed.  Thus, eculizumab may have the 
potential to minimize the occurrence of AMR, limit graft dysfunction, limit development 
of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and prolong long -term cardiac transplantation survival. 
In cardiac transplantation , the development  of accelerated cardiac allograft 
vasculopathy as defined by [CONTACT_688184] 
≥0.5mm has been shown to be a surrogate marker for increased mortality, non -fatal 
major adverse cardiac events and de velopment of angi ographic vasculopathy at 5 
years16.

endomyocardial biopsies; performed weekly for the first month after t ransplantation, 
then biweekly until the third month, monthly until the sixth month, and bimonthly, 
thereafter, until completion of the first year. If a patient is treated for rejection, a follow -
up biopsy will be performed 2 weeks following tr eatment to do cument regression or 
resolution of rejection . All biopsy specimens will be graded according to the 
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2011 grading 
schemes for both humoral and cellular rejection. Angiograms  will b e performed a t 
baseline (4 -8 weeks after transplant and at one year and will include assessment by 
[CONTACT_688187] .  At the time of 
transplantation and prior to the initiation of any cytolytic therapy a retrospective  cross 
match will be sent. Please refer to Appendix D:  Eculizumab Safety Monitoring and 
Evaluation Schedule for additional procedure and trial laboratories.  
 
Alloantibody Serology Assessment

6.2 TREATMENT MODIFICATION  
*If the patient receives any additi onal plasmapheresis or fresh frozen plasma within the 
first year post -transplantation, 900 mg of eculizumab  will be provided as a infusion 
immediately afterwards.  (Note: this contingent dose was placed on the Eculizumab 
Safety Monitoring and Evaluation Sch edule: Appendix D) on Day [ADDRESS_933563] transplant in a contingent fashion)   
 
6.[ADDRESS_933564] IDENTITY  
Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to compliment protein 
C5, which inhibits its cleavage  to C5a and C5b and prevents the generation of the 
terminal complement complex C5b -9. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH), eculizumab is FDA approved to inhibit terminal complement 
mediated intravascular hemolysis.  Eculizumab is a F DA Pregnancy Category C agent .  
Patients must be administered a meningococcal vaccine at least two weeks prior to

 initiation of eculizumab therapy. It is a contrain dication to provide any patient 
eculizumab with an unresolved Neisseria meningitides or pneu mococcus  infection.  
 
Eculizumab is supplied as an intravenous solution supplied as 300 mg in a 30 ml vial.  
The dose will require dilution  to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by [CONTACT_688193] D5W to a final infusion volume is 120 mL for 600 mg  doses and 180 mL for 
900 mg doses.  Admixed solutions are stable for 24 hours at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 
to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) and at room temperature.  Eac h dose will be administered via 
IV infusion over 35 minutes via gravity feed, a single -type pump, or an infusion pump; 
total infusion time should not exceed 2 hours. Doses should not be administered by [CONTACT_688194].  
 
   6.4 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Possible adverse events with eculizumab include: gastrointestinal: nausea (16%, 
musculoskel etal: Backache (19% ), neurologic: headache (44% ), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: cough 
(12% ), nasopharyngitis (23% ), other: fatigue (12% ), immunologic: viral disease (2% )9.  
Patients will be instructed to report signs/symptoms of meningococcal infection (e.g.: 
fever of 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) or higher; severe muscle aches with flu -like 
symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light; fever and a rash; confusion; or moderate to 
seve re headache with nausea and vomiting, fever, or stiff neck or back) with the 
transplant st udy investigators.  
 
7.0 IMMUNOSUPPRESSION + DESENSITIZATION  PRE + POST  TRANSPLANT  
 
Records of all desensitization will be recorded.  
 
Pre-Transplantation:  
Patients ma y receive antibody reduction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (with high dose IVIG and rituximab, 
and/ or bortezo mib desensitization ) prior to transplantation in an attempt to decrease 
the PRA. While awaiting transplantation a PRA and subsequent cPRA are performed on 
a monthly b asis. Patients will not be eligible for eculizumab therapy  less than one week  
of comp leting  of rituxumab desensitization therapy  and CD20 count >2% .

patient with a calculated PRA > 70% and in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_688171] (ie: UNOS listed 1A status) will receive up to 3 cycles of bortezomib 1.3 
mg/m2 via IV push over [ADDRESS_933565] period. Plasmapheresis will be given on days 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 7 and 8 and 10 and 
11 of each cycle pre -transplant to speed up antibody removal from circulation. On 
plasmapheresis days the bortezomib dose is to be administered after plasmapheresis. If 
not taken for transplantation sooner, a maximum of 3 pre -transplant cycles of 
bortezomib/plasmapheresis may be given to achieve a PRA <50% If platelet count ≤30 
×0109/L or ANC ≤0.75 x 109/L on a bortezomib  dosing day (other than day 1) the dose 
will be held until If platelet count >30 ×0109/L or ANC >0.75. Flow PRA are sent at 
baseline and day 18 of therapy.   Patients refractory to IVIG -Rituximab or UNOS liste d 
Status 1A patients with a calculated  PRA ≥  50% requiring desensitization will be 
considered for bortezomib therapy.  
 
Post -Transplantation :

http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf   
 
Adverse Event Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, 
including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of the drug, whether or not it is considered to be d rug related.  This 
includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity 
or frequency since the administration of drug.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any  dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life-threatening .  Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction 
which hypothetically might have ca used death had it occurred in a more severe 
form.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during 
the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the 
illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial, provided 
that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e .g., surgery 
performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability is defined 
as a substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event .  An important medical event is an event t hat 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217368], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent on e of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.   
 
 
P a g e  | [ADDRESS_933575] be determined.  
 
Intensity   
 
The intensity of an AE should be classified as either mild, moderate, or severe.  
 
Casual Relationship   
 
The assessment of the casual relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
event . The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable 
casual relationship” to the study treatment in question. Possible answers are “yes” or 
“no.” 
 
The assessment of a possible casual relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable casual 
relationship” to protocol -required procedure(s). Possible answers are “yes” or “no.”  
 
Action taken with study treatment  
 
Any action on study treatment (Eculizumab) to resolv e the AE is to be documented 
using the categories listed below.  
  
- Drug interrupted  
- Drug discontinued  
 
Outcome  
 
- Recovered/resolved  
- Recovering/resolving  
- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved  
- Fatal  
- Unknown  
 
Assessments an d documentation of adverse events  
 
AEs (including SAEs) observed, volunteered, and solicited will be recorded. AEs will be 
documented event -based, with change documentation in cases of increases in intensity.  
 
P a g e  | [ADDRESS_933576]’s record.  
 
All documented AEs will be followed up until an outcome has been reported or until at 
least [ADDRESS_933577]’s partner, all efforts should be made 
to obtain similar information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.  
 
Monitoring of adverse events 
 
Life threatening complications following study drug administration will be reported to the 
Independent Medical Monitor within 15 calendar days and deaths within 7 calendar 
days. Serious and unexpected adverse events following study drug administrat ion will 
be submitted as expedited reports to the monitor  on a quarterly basis . 
 
Throughout the study, the Independent Medical Monitor will review safety data on a 
quarterly basis unless it is an adverse event that requires expedited report. Reports will 
be submitted to the IRB biannually.

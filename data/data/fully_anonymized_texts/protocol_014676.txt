3) IRB Review  History  
The IRB reviewed  the protocol  and requested  that the FDA  determines  
whether an IND is needed  or exempt.  
 
4) Objectives  
a) To determine the efficacy  of photodynamic therapy  (PDT) in the  treatment of  
seborrheic dermatitis.  
 
b) To determine how PDT  alters  the skin microbiome  in subjects  with seborrheic  
dermatitis  before  and after treatment.  
 
c) To determine how PDT  alters  sebum  secretion  rates in subjects  with seborrheic  
dermatitis  before  and after treatment.  
 
We hypothesize that  PDT will  be efficacious  in the  treatment  of seborrheic  
dermatitis.  
5) Background  
Seborrheic dermatitis  is a common  chronic inflammatory  disorder  with a prevalence  
estimated  at 3-5% [1, 2].  Although  the exact pathophysiology  is unclear,  seborrheic  
dermatitis  is more prevalent  in indviduals  that are more heavily  colonized  with the 
Malassezia  spp fungal  organism,  those  with more  residual  sebum  (for example  in 
neuropathic patients  such as in Parkinson’s  disease) , and in those  with higher  sebum  
production,  which  leads  to more lipid by[CONTACT_656591] [2]. Current  topi[INVESTIGATOR_656573],  topi[INVESTIGATOR_103993],  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_656574]  [3, 4]. The success  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_656575]-term 
use and depends on the  compliance of the patient.  Furthermore,  these treatments  
can expose  patients  to potential  side effects  such as atrophy,  thinning  of the skin  
and telangiectasias  in response  to topi[INVESTIGATOR_103993].  Therefore,  alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_656576] -term control are needed.  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_656577]:  1) The Malassezia  spp is capable of 
forming  biofilms  [5], 2) PDT has  been shown  to be effective  against  Malassezia spp  
[6, 7], 3) PDT can  break  up bioflims  of both bacterial  and fungal  origin  [8], and 4)

benzoyl  peroxide,  a prooxidant treatment  similar to  PDT,  has been shown  to be 
effective in the  treatment  of seborrheic dermatitis  [9]. 
 
6) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Healthy  subjects  18 years  or older with  seborrheic  dermatitis  of the face will be  
included.  
 
Subjects who are taking systemic corticosteroids  (at doses  of prednisone  greater  
than or equal  to 5 mg daily) or  antibiotics  (PO, IM or IV) will have to undergo a 4 
week “wash -out” period before participating in the study. Subjects who are using 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_138250]-fungals,  steroids,  antibiotics,  permethrin,  or calcineurin  inhibitors will 
have to wait [ADDRESS_884276] to wait until two months after the start of th eir regimen.  
 
Recruited  subjects  will be permitted  to use  bland  emollients,  but they  will instructed  
to refrain  from  using  topi[INVESTIGATOR_656578]®  which  have been 
clinically  studied  for the treatment  of seborrheic dermatitis.  The exclusion criteria  
will also include the presence of other  untreated  inflammatory  conditions  (such  as 
lupus, atopic dermatitis,  or psoriasis) or untreated  malignancies  on the face 
(including  skin cancers  such as basal  cell carcinoma,  squamous  cell carcinoma  and 
melan oma).  
 
Any subjects with known  or suspected  hypersensitivity  to any constituent  of the 
study  medication  or a history  of photosensitivity  due to conditions  such as lupus  
erythematosus  and porphyria  will be excluded.  Subjects  who have had 
photodynamic therap y (PDT)  to the  face for any reason within  the past year will be 
excluded  as well.  
Adults  unable to consent,  individuals  under the age of 18, pregnant  or breastfeeding  
women  and prisoners  will be excluded  from  the study.   
 
7) Study -Wide Number of Subjects  
12 
 
8) Study -Wide Recruitment  Methods  
Patients  will be recruited  from  the outpatient  dermatology  clinics  in the  department  
of Dermatology  at UC Davis . We also recruit participants who live within a [ADDRESS_884277]  the level of  
clinical  care received.  
Recruitment  flyers  are attached.  
 
9) Compensation to the Subjects  
At the end of visit two, the patient  will be paid $40 for comple ting visits one  and 
two. If the patient  does not follow up for visit 2, they  will receive no compensation.  
At the end of visit three,  the patient  will be paid an additional  $20 for completing

10) Study  Timelines  
Revision  date:  Febraury 27, 2018  
 
 
  
 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_656569] [ADDRESS_884278] will participate for  a total of 3-4.5 months from  initiat ion 
of enrollment  to completion  of the study.  
 
11) Study  Endpoints  
The primary  endpoint  of the study  is recruitment  of a sufficient  number of patients  
(12) who  complete two  treatments  of photodynamic  therapy  to the  face with  
grading  of the severity  of seborrhe ic dermatitis  before each  treatment  and after each 
follow -up period.  
 
The secondary  endpoints  for the study  are obtaining  swabs for microbiome  analysis  
and facial  sebum  production rates before each  treatment and after each follow -up 
period.  
 
12) Procedures  Involved  
Duration  of seborrheic dermatitis,  previous  treatments  for seborrheic dermatitis and 
patient  response to the  treatments  will be recorded.  Facial  photography  will be  done  
for grading  the Seborrhea  Area and  Severity Index  Face (SASI -F). All seborrheic  
dermatitis  patients  will be graded  using  the SASI -F [3]. This score is a composite  
score as  follows:  the area index, also known  as the relative area of facial  
involvement,  is denoted  as a fraction  of [ADDRESS_884279]  Psoriasis  Area and  Severity Index  scoring  (ie, 
0 = none,  1 = slight,  2 = moderate,  3 = striking,  and 4 =  exceptionally  striking).  
The scores  for erythema  and scale  are then summed  and multiplied  by [CONTACT_656592].   The maximal score is [ADDRESS_884280] a score  of 0.  The inclusion  criteria  will be similar to the  previous  trial 
that used the SASI -F in their  analysis  [3]. This study  will consist  of subjects with 
an erythema score  of at least one with  the presence  of at an area index  of 5% or 
more.  
This study  will be a single blinded,  randomized,  intra-individual  comparison  study  
consisting  of a total of [ADDRESS_884281]  of split-face comparisons  of no application  of aminolevulinic acid  (ALA) vs 
ALA application  to either  half of the face.  Prior to ALA application,  the face will be 
swabbed  for microbiome  analysis.   A schematic  for the split-face study  is shown  in 
Figure 1.  After the ALA  application,  the subjects  will incubate with  the ALA on 
their face per the standard  PDT protocol  used at UC Davis  Derm atology  clinic for 
facial  PDT treatments.  The side of the face being  treated  will remain  the same 
during all treatments.   The investigator  applying  the ALA to the patient  will be 
aware of which  side is receiving  treatment  and which  side is not, but  the patient 
will be blinded.   For the placebo,  Demo Levulan Kerastick, which contains no active 
ingredient and is enclosed in same cardboard sleeve and cap, will be applied to the 
other side of the face to mimic the surface of the ALA application stick.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_656569] 5 of 12   
After the ALA  incubation is completed,  the subjects will be exposed  to a treatment  
dose of blue light from a  Blu-U unit  per UC  Davis Dermatology  clinic protocol  for 
PDT treatments.  
Calibrated  facial  pi[INVESTIGATOR_656579] -F scoring

A flow diagram  of the protocol is shown  in Figure  2.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_656580]®  Kerasticks  (D[LOCATION_003] Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.).  Facial  sebum  
production  rate will  be measured  with SebuMeter®.  The swabbing  for the 
microbiome  will be performed  as non-invasive swabbing  from the  face that  will not 
cause the patient any pain or discomfort.   For the blue light treatment,  the total light 
dose to the  face will  be consistent with the currently  used standard  facial  exposure  
PDT protoc ols at UC Davis.  
 
After the third visit, patients have the option of  being  seen in the  regular  
dermatology  clinics.   Based on the  disease severity, a  treatment  modality  will then 
be selected  and administered  for the untreated  side of the face.  
 
The Levulan  Kerasticks and Demo Levulan Kerastick s are stored at  the 
Investigatio nal Drug Services (IDS) , a Div ision of the Pharmacy Departmen at the 
University of [LOCATION_004], Davis . IDS dispenses the Kerasticks  upon the 
investigators’ request.   
 
13) Data  and Specimen Ba nking  
N/A 
 
14) Data  Management  
This study  will be a single blinded,  randomized,  intra-individual  comparison  study  
consisting  of a total of 12 subjects.   A power  analysis is not truly  applicable  because  
this is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_656581] a  potential  treatment  for seborrheic dermatitis  that 
has not been  previously  investigated.   We plan to recruit  up to 12 patients.  
 
SASI -F scores  and the SebuMeter®  measurements  will be compared  within  the 
treatment  group  and an intra-individual  comparison  will be performed  by [CONTACT_656593]  t-test. A p-value  of 0.[ADDRESS_884282]. 
All participants  will be included  in the  study  on an intent -to-treat basis.

there are any treatment  related adverse effects  such as erythema,  blisters,  pain, or  
secondary  infec tion. Any side effects  will be noted  in a secure document.  
Secondary  infections  will be treated  with appropriate antibiotics  and local  
inflammation  will be treated  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_656583].  
 
16) Withdrawal  of Subjects  
Subjects  may be withdrawn  withou t their consent  if they acquire any medical  issues  
during  the study  period which  require the use of any other  topi[INVESTIGATOR_551030], oral 
or parenteral  steroids,  oral or  parenteral  antibiotics.  They  may also be withdrawn  if 
they are found  to have any abnorma l sensitivity/allergy  to the  ALA.  
 
If a subject  is to be  withdrawn  without  their consent, they  will be contact[CONTACT_656594](s) for their  withdrawal  will be explained  in full. No further data will be  
collected  from the  subject.  
 
17) Risks  to Subjects  
There is a low chance for  any physical,  psychological,  social  or legal injury  from  
participation  in the  study.  The patient  will be warned of  the standard  risks of 
treatment  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_656584],  pain,  blisters,  increased  temporary  
photosensitivity  for [ADDRESS_884284]  dermatitis  after exposure  to the  
topi[INVESTIGATOR_656585].  This can be adequately  managed  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_656586],  if necessary.  
 
18) Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
The individual  subject  may benefit  from the  treatment,  but this cannot  be 
guaranteed  since this study  aims  to explore  the efficacy  of PDT in the  setting  of 
seborrheic dermatitis.   The greater community  of patients  with seborrheic  derm atitis  
would  benefit  as this study  would  provide  more insight  into the  efficacy  of PDT for  
the treatment  of seborrheic  dermatitis.

 PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_656587] 7 of 12   
Given  that half of the subjects’  face will  receive the standard PDT treatment, as per 
the dermatology  clinic protocol  for actinic keratoses on the  face,  there  is the 
possibility  that the treatments  will concurrently  treat their actinic keratoses.

Seborrheic dermatitis  is one  of the most common  conditions  encountered  in 
dermat ology  and among our  patients.  Therefore,  we will  have a sufficient  
recruitment  pool to meet  our required  number  of subjects.  
 
Photodynamic therapy  is frequently  used at the Dermatology  clinic and we do 
not expect  significant  adverse  effects.  However,  the patient  will be asked  to 
contact  [CONTACT_656595]-call in the  event that there is an adverse  
effect.  
 
To ensure that  all assisting  personnel  are aware  of the research  protocols, we  will 
have a pre-recruitment  meeting  followed  by [CONTACT_656596], the  protocol,  study  progress,  and any changes  as

29) Provisions  to Protect the Privacy  Interests  of Subjects  
To protect  subjects'  privacy  interests,  data and/or specimens  will be labeled  with a 
code that  the research  team can link to personal  identifying  information  when  
acquired.   The code  sheet  will be secured  and kept separate from  the dataset.   Only  
authorized  research  personnel will have access  to this information.  All paper  
records  containing  study  data will  be stored  in a study  binder.  This study  binder  
will be securely  stored  in a locked  cabinet,  in a locked office,  in the  UC Davis  
Department  of Dermatology  at [ADDRESS_884286] -protected  computer  
database.   Only  the PI, study  staff,  IRB and other  authorized/designated  governing  
bodies  and individuals  will be allowed  to access  these study -related  documents. All 
HIPAA,  IRB, State,  and Federal  policies  and guidelines  will be followed  to ensure  
patient  confidentiality.  
 
Patient  photograph s taken during  this study  will be handled  according  to the  UC 
Davis  Dermatology  clinic  protocol,  which  is as follows.  Photographs  will be taken  
with the clinic’s  cameras  (which  never  leave  the clinic),  uploaded  to the  patient’s  
electronic medical  record, and deleted from the  camera.  
 
Interviews  with patients  will be conducted  in a private  clinic room.  The participant  
may choose not to answer any or all of the questions during  the interview,  or they 
may stop the  interview at  any time,  if they are uncomforta ble or unsure  about the  
study.  
 
30) Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
If the patient  is injured  as a result  of being  in the  study,  the University  of [LOCATION_004]  
will provide necessary  medical  treatment.   Depending  on the  circumstances, the  
costs  of the treatment  may be covered  by [CONTACT_656599]’s  insurance company.  The University  and the study  sponsor  do not  
normally  provide  any other  form  of compensation  for injury.  
 
31) Economic Burden to Subjects  
The patient  will need to com e to the  dermatology  clinic  for the PDT treatments.  As 
such,  they will need to pay  for the expense  of travel. Although  this may  be offset  by 
[CONTACT_656600],  the patient will need  to pay for the 
travel  expense  ahead  of receiving  their compensation.  
 
32) Consent Process  
Written  consent  will be obtained  from  patients  at the UC Davis  outpatient  
Dermatology  clinic in Sacramento.   We will be following  the SOP:  Informed  
Consent  Process  for Research.   After obtaining  consent, there will  be a two-week  
waiting  period before initiating  treatment  so that the patient  may begin  using  only

  Page [ADDRESS_15707] University School of Medicine .   1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a hu man research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US an d inter national standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines) , applicable government regulations and 
Institutional re search policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Since its initi al descri ption in 2010, POEM has been suggested to be a safe and effective surgery 
for achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders.1,2 Compared to patients who undergo the 
traditional laparos copic Heller myotomy, patients managed with POEM experience  shorter 
procedure times, longer myotomies, lower adverse events, and improved functional outcomes.3 
However, postoperative retrosternal pain  and regurgitation due to residual carbon dioxide and/or  
increased intraoperative esophageal exposure to gastric ac id remain  common. Dual innervation 
of the esophagus by [CONTACT_16463][INVESTIGATOR_16446], accounting for patients' reports of vague discomforts an d localized retrosternal 
sensations, respectively.[ADDRESS_15708], 
magnesium is a noncompetitive N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that can 
decrease visce ral hyperalgesia.[ADDRESS_15709] been also documented in the context of pre eclampsia management in 
obstetrics. 12 We also re cently published a case report t hat high lighted the role of magnesium in 
decreasing postoperativ e pain specific  to esophageal spasms and reflux. 13 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/ Benefits  
The magnesium bolus dosing of 50 mg/kg emulate s the dose  used in a recent urologic study  that 
explored the effect of  magne sium  to decrease bladder catheter -associated disco mfort .[ADDRESS_15710] fr equently reported dose/rate  in a 
meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_15711] finding  a statistically and 
clinical ly significant  decrease in po stoperative pain . The m edication i s administered 
intravenously as part of the intraoperati ve anesthe tic regim en. The POEM surg ery lasts on 
average 1 to 2 hours , which is  the maximum  duration of the  magnesium infusion . This will limit 
the risk of magnesium  toxicity. Hence, t he study will be safe ly investigating a nonopio id 
analgesic that has been shown to be efficacious in similar  populations undergoing a diverse range 
of surgeries , with the hope of clarifying  the antispasmod ic potential of magnesium.  
2 Study O bjectives

3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
• Prospective r andomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
• Expected duration of subject participation : [ADDRESS_15712] Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
i) Ages 18 and over  
ii) Subjects  capable of givi ng informed consent, or h ave an acceptable  surro gate 
capable of giv ing consent  on the subject ’s behalf   
iii) Planned peroral endos copic myotomy  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
i) cannot give consent  
ii) patients who are clinically unstable and/or require urgent/emergent intervention   
iii) previous esophageal myotomy  
iv) preexisting hypermagnesemia  
v) end-stage renal disease  
vi) neuromuscular disease, including but not limited to Guillain -Barre syndrome, myasthenia 
gravis, congenital myopathy, and muscular dystrophy  
vii) preexisting heart fail ure  
viii) severe ventricular systol ic dysfunction (left or right ventricle)  
4.[ADDRESS_15713]/surgeon or other health care provider(e.g. nurse pr actitioner, nursing  staff) will 
inform eligible participants of the study. If the patient expresses interest they will be approached 
by [CONTACT_2327]. If they decline they will not receive any further information about 
the study. In cases where it is not feasible for an endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_16448], 
or the patient has not yet met the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  a research personnel will screen for eligibility 
using chart review. Eligible patients will be approached about the study if history review reveals 
a potential candidate for the study. If the family expresses interest, the research personnel will 
proceed with consent and protocol. If patient decline interest, we will respect their decision and 
will not pursue the family any further for this study.  Parti cipants will be asked if they are 
participating in other studies. They will be allowed to participate in more than one study if it can 
be determined that this poses no increased risk to the participants or the integrity of the data 
collect ed for either stu dy. 
4.[ADDRESS_15714] -secured encrypted devices, only accessible 
to research personnel.  For withdrawn subjects, we wil l attempt to seek perm ission for 
magnesium levels drawn during the defined  follow -up period ( postoperative day s 0 and  1). This 
is related to the  safety profil e of the study drug . Otherwise, all other data related to the 
withdrawn subject will be destroyed , and no further follo w-up information wil l be collected.  
[ADDRESS_15715] and smooth muscle re laxant properties. The medication will appear  as 
magnesium sulfa te USP 50%, a steril e, con centrated solu tion of magnesium sulfate in water . In 
the vial, each milliliter contains 500  mg magnesium sulfate heptahydrate.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
A loading dose of 50 mg/kg (based on lean body weight ) will be administered  intraven ously over 
15 minutes  at start of mucosal incision , followed  by 25 mg/kg/ hr inf usion  intravenou sly that is 
turned off at patient  extubation . The e xpected treatment duration is 1 to 2 hours.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Randomization co des will be generated using  web-based randomization software (RStudio)  with 
block sizes of four and an allocation rat io of 1:1 for either intravenous magnesium sulfate 
(magnesium group) or intravenous normal saline as control (control group) . These randomi zation 
codes will be enclosed in sequentially numbered, ident ical, opaque, and sealed envelopes . The y 
will be kept in a cl osed box during the entire study period. The envelopes will be provided in 
sequence to the anesthesia team . 
5.4 Preparation and Administra tion of S tudy  Drug  
The anesthesi a team will prepare the study treatment based o n the instructions within the 
envelope. Specifically, the anesthesi a team will be instructed to  draw up 10 g (20 ml) of the 
study drug within a [ADDRESS_15716], the syringes will be labeled as “study ” to minimize drug error during the 
intraoperative anesthetic manag ement.  These  medications  will be administered using a  syringe 
pump (Alaris ; Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey , [LOCATION_003]) available in all SHC 
operating rooms.  Instructions to manually program the syringe pump will be provided . 
Specifically, the anesthes ia team will be instructed to enter 10 g of the study drug in 20 ml of  
volume , and to enter the patient ’s lean body weight . The team will e nter the infusion rate as 25  
mg/kg/hr , and save these settings.  
When the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_16449]/he will start the mucosal incision, the syringe pump 
will be programmed  to bolus  50 mg/kg over 15 minute s. After the bolu s is administe red, the 
syringe pump will default to the infusion rate of 25 mg/kg/hr. The anesthesia team will stop the 
infusion at extubation.

hypnotics , narcotics, neuromuscular block ers (e.g. succinylcholine /rocuronium), antiem etics,  
vasopressors,  antihypertensives, and ane sthetics as nee ded at the anesthesia team ’s discr etion.  
In the rare case of magnesium toxicity, all healthcare providers will have access to calcium 
chloride/ gluconate therapy  to reverse the cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_16450] . 
5.7 Packaging  
As described  above, the  magnesium  sulfate is packaged in 2 ml vials , each containing 1 g (500  
mg/ml). Multiple vials are already available  in the anesthe sia medication carts in every operating 
room. In addition, the n ormal saline v ials are packaged in [ADDRESS_15718] will not be present in the operating room 
environment.  The 20 ml syringe in which the drug is prepared will be labeled as “study ” for the 
purpose of m inimizing drug error during the course  of intraoperative manageme nt.

By [CONTACT_16466], the drug ’s bolus and infu sion wi ll be documented in 
the electronic anesthetic re cord. Th e usused study  drug remaining  in the syringe  will be 
wasted  and destroyed .  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 24 to 72 hours prior to scheduled surgery  
6.1.1 Patients undergoing per -oral endoscopic myotomy ( POEM) in the SHC  operating ro oms 
will be identified , and screened  by [CONTACT_16467] . 
6.[ADDRESS_15720]  preoperative plasma 
calcium and magnesium levels drawn and complete the esophageal symptoms 
questionnaire (ESQ), a validated survey to assess symptoms of dysphagia, globus, and 
reflux.  
6.2.2 The pat ient will proceed to the OR for anesthetic care.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients will undergo rapid sequence induction of general anesthesia. In the control 
group, the anesthesia team w ill use ketamine, propofol, succinylcholine, and esmolol 
and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_16451]. In the treatment arm, the anesthesia team will use 
ketamine and propofol using lean body weight (LBW) dosing, and succinyl choline at 
total body weight (TBW) dosing . After endotracheal tube placement and confirmation, 
sevoflurane in air and oxygen will be u sed for maintenance of general anesthesia. The 
anesthesiologist will ensure adequate neuromuscular relaxation throughout t he case.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In the treatment arm, the anesth esia team will prepare a magnesium sulfate infusion  
within a 20 ml syringe. Patients will re ceive a magnesium sulfate bolus of 50 mg/kg 
lean bod y weight over 15 minutes, followed by a magnesium sulfate infusion at 25 
mg/kg/hr when the endosco pi[INVESTIGATOR_16452] . In addition, the patients will 
receive dexamethasone 0.1 -0.2 mg/kg at the st art of case, and ondansetron 4 mg at the 
end of case. The magnesium  infusion will be dis continued at extubation.  After sur gery, 
patients will be admitted to the postanesthesia care unit . For mild pain reported as a 
numeric score ranging from 1 to 3, acetam inophen 1000 mg IV will be offered. For pain 
greater than a score of 3, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ( fentanyl and hydromorphone) will be avail able. For 
nausea and vomiting, prochlorperazine and haloperidol will be provided. Calcium 
gluconate and a code cart with emergency dru gs and airway equipment will be made 
available in case of symptoms concerning for  magnesium toxicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In the control arm, the anesthesia team will prepare a normal saline infusion within a 20 
ml syringe. Patients will receive a normal saline bolus of 50 mg /kg lean body weight  
over 15 minutes, followed by a normal saline infusion at 25 mg/kg/hr when  the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_16453]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (fentanyl and hydromorphone) will be 
administered for analgesia at the discretion of the anesthesia team. In add ition, patients 
  Page [ADDRESS_15721] University School of Medicine .   will receive dexamethasone and ondansetron in the aforementioned doses. After 
surgery, patients will be ad mitted to the  postanesthesia care unit , where opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 
(fentanyl and hydromorphone) and antiemetics (anesthesia team's discretion) will  be 
available for further pain and nausea management.  
6.3 All study participants will repeat the ESQ in the PACU when the nur sing team deems the 
patient's recovery appropriate enough to participate.  
6.4 Postoperative Day 1   
6.4.1 The ESQ and serum calcium/magnesium le vels will be reobtained in the morning  of 
POD1. 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Unpublished  data at our institution reveals an 60% in cidence of esophageal spasm -related pain. 
We assume  that magnesiu m might decrease the incidence of esophageal  spasm-related  pain by 
30%. Based on this assumption, our calculation show  that 45 patients in each group would be 
necessary to acquire statistical significance, w ith a two -sided α = 0.05 and β = 0. 20. Considering 
a 10% dropout rate, 50 patients are necessary for  each group.   
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Data will be  expressed as means ± SD, number (proportion), relative risk, 95% CI, absolute risk 
reduction, or number neede d to treat.  
The primary outcome is the incidence of esophageal spasm -related pain  at [ADDRESS_15722] or Fisher’s exact test as 
appropriate. Continuous variables will be  compared using the Mann –Whitney U test. Categorical 
variab les will be  compared using the chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  
Post hoc  subgroup analyses  will be conducted  regarding the incidence of esophageal spasm -
related pain  according to achalasia type ( e.g. type 1, 2, or 3) , preoperative H2-receptor an tagonist 
use, preoperative pro ton pump in hibitor use, and in traoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444] . Post hoc subgroup 
analysis will be further conducted o n postoperative magnesium levels and the incidence of 
esophageal spasm -related pain at 24 hours.  
All P values w ill be two-sided, and a value of P < 0.05 w ill be considered statistically 
significant.  
Comparisons of postoperative pain between the two groups at time 0  h and time 24  h will be  
analyzed using the Mann –Whitney U test and performed using  an adjust ed significance level of 
0.0125 (0.05/4) after post hoc  analysis using the Bonferroni method.  
Statistical anal yses will be performed using R version 4.0.3.  
  
  Page [ADDRESS_15723] Population(s) for Analysis  
Enrollment will ce ase when the target sample size is obtained.  Analyses will be performed on an 
intention -to-treat basis. All patients who are enrolled and randomly allocated for treatmen t will 
be included in the analysis.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Even t 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign,  illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of  diagnostic procedure s are considered to 
be adverse events if the abno rmality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_16468] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or sign ificant disabilit y or incapacity  
• a congenital ano maly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.   They m ay jeopardize the sub ject, and may req uire 
intervention to prevent one  of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive 
treatment of bronchospasm in a n emergency departmen t wo uld typi[INVESTIGATOR_16454].  
 
All ad verse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse even ts must be reported i s normally define d as the 
period from the initiat ion of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -
up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_15724] University School of Medicine .   A pre existing condition is one that i s present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the stu dy period.  
General Ph ysical Examinatio n Findings  
At screening, any cli nically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of  an adverse event mus t also be recorde d and documented as an 
adverse e vent.  
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event  is otherwise explain ed.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigato r should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this stud y.  The investigator shou ld notify the  study 
sponsor of any death or a dverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued 
or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified i f the investigator sh ould become aware  of the development of 
cancer or  of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that 
has participated in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be d ocumented as an adver se event if any o ne of 
the following  conditions i s met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a d egree that requires a ctive management;  e.g. change of 
dose, discontinu ation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16455] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise 
in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an 
adverse event if the conditi on meets the criteria  for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16456] a preex isting condition.  Surgery shoul d not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic 
and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16457].  
  Page [ADDRESS_15725] University School of Medicine .   • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16458], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16459]. 
8.[ADDRESS_15726] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the  source document, and  also in the appr opriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped 
under one di agnosis.  
 
All adverse  events occurring  during the study period must be  recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cau se.  Serious adverse even ts that are s till ongoing 
at the end of the s tudy period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
study treatm ent or study particip ation should be r ecorded and reported immediately . 
8.[ADDRESS_15727] be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 
hours of the event.  A Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE) form mu st be completed by [CONTACT_16471] 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a 
copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_16472] l to:

information.  Other serious, unexpected adverse events associated with the use of study 
drug shall be reported to t he FDA no later than 15 calendar days fr om t he sponsors’ 
original rece ipt of the information.  
 
If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit 
the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a written 
report to the FDA as soon  as possible,  but no later  than [ADDRESS_15729] udy participant experien ces a 
serious adverse event  postope ratively , including cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_16461] t, unblinding will occur to 
ensure the patient ’s safety by [CONTACT_16475].  The patient ’s randomization en velope contents w ill be shared wi th the 
care team . Docu mentation of this will be indicated in our data collection spreadsheets. The 
sponsor will be notified of each participant who  was unblinded wi thin 24 hours  by [CONTACT_16476],  followed by a w ritten narr ative of the event within 48 hours.   
8.5 Medical Monit oring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of a dverse  
events as noted above, as well as  the construction  and implementation of a site data and safety -
monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will 
include a regular assessment of the number and type of seri ous ad verse events.

2.2. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo- and 
active-controlled, parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06650833 at Week 12 in subjects with moderate-severe, active, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies(ACPA)-positive RA who have had an inadequate response to MTX (up to approximately50% of subjects may have also received one (and only one) approved tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-inhibiting biologic agent administered in accordance with its labeling recommendations).  The TNF-inhibiting biologic could have been discontinued due to its being deemed inadequately effective and/or not tolerated as defined, for the purpose of this study, by [CONTACT_737]’s and subject’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_809401]-TNF plus the presence of sufficient residual disease activity tomeet the entry criteria.  The anti-TNF biologic could also have been discontinued due to lack of continued access.  Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the 6 treatment arms described in the schematic below where use of tofacitinib as an active control in this study is acceptable to regulatory authorities and ethics committees.  PF-06650833 or matching placebo modified release (MR) tablets will be administered orally once a day (QD) under fasting conditions, and tofacitinib or matching tofacitinib placebo tablets will be administered orally BID for [ADDRESS_1119288] approximately 198 subjects complete 12 weeks of active dosing (assuming a dropout rate of approximately 15%). Since the use of 
tofacitinib in this study may be not be acceptable by [CONTACT_12721]/ethics committees in all countries, achieving full randomization into the tofacitinib arm may prove logistically challenging.  Since the tofacitinib arm is serving as an active control for the study, enrollment of approximately 20-30 subjects into that arm will be acceptable.  Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 20 weeks.  This includes an up to 28 day screening period, a 12 week treatment period, and a 4 week follow-up period.CCI

In order to maintain the blind and minimize bias, all subjects will receive the same number 
and ty pes of tablets each day  as described in the Tables below.  Subjects assigned to 
PF
-06650833 will all take 4 MR tablets, consisting of a mixture of active 
PF-06650833 and/or matching placebo tablets dis pensed in a blister pack, once per day .  In 
countries in which regulatory  authorities and ethics committees accept the use of tofacitinib 
as an active control in this trial, subjects also will take 1 matching tofacitinib placebo tablet 
(dispensed in bottle s) BID.  Subjects assigned to receive tofacitinib will take 1 tablet 
(dispensed in bottles) of tofacitinib citrate (5 mg) BI D.  These subjects will also take 4 MR 
tablets of placebo matching PF
-06650833 MR tablets (dispensed in a blister pack) once daily.
In regions where tofacitinib’s inclusion in this study  as an active control is notaccepted b y 
local regulatory  authorities and ethics committees, subjects will only  be randomized to

3.6.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event is considered treatment emergent relative to a given treatment if:
The event occurs for the first time during the effective duration of treatment and was 
not seen prior to the start of treatmen t (for example, during the baseline or ru n-in 
period), or
The event was seen prior to the start of treatment but increased in severi t
yduring 
treatment.
A 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs.  Under this approach, AEs are classified 
into 1 of 3 
tiers.  Different anal yses will be performed for different tiers ( see Section 6.7.1).
Tier-1 events: These are pre -specified events of clinical importance and are maintained in a 
list in the product’s Safety Review Plan .
Tier-2 events: These are events that are not tier-1 but are “common” .  A Medical Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA )Preferred Term ( PT)is defined as a tie r-[ADDRESS_1119289] 4 in anytreatment group.
Tier-3 events: These are events that are neither tier -1 nor tier -2 events.
3.6.2. Laboratory D ata
Laboratory data will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_809403].
3.6.3. Vital Signs
Absolute values and changes from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate and temperature will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659], 
according to [COMPANY_007] reporting standards.
3.6.4. Electroca rdiogram (ECG)
Categorical summary tables will be summarized by [CONTACT_809404] .  A listing of ECG comments on findings and normal/abnormal results will be 
provided.
4.ANALYSIS SETS
4.1.Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analy sis set will include all subjects who were randomized to the 
study  and received at least one dose of the randomized investigational drug ( PF
-06650833, 
tofacitinib, or placebo ).

The safet y (SAF) anal ysis set is defined as those subjects who received at least one dose of 
the investigational drug .
4.3. Other Analysis Sets
Per-protocol (PP) analy sis set is defined as a subset of I TT who had no major protocol 
violations.  The subjects excluded from the PP will be determined and documented before the 
study  is unblinded.
5.GENERAL METHODOLOGY AND CONVENTIONS
Final anal yses will occur after database lock after Last S ubject Last Visit(LSLV).
5.1. Hypotheses and Decision Rules
For any  given active arm, the null hy pothesis that the di stributions of SDAI change from 
baseline at Week [ADDRESS_1119290] ( *)being

5.2.General Methods
In general, number and percent will be presented for binary  variables.  Number, mean, 
standard deviation (or standard error of the mean), median, minimum, and maximum will be 
presented for continuous variables .  In addition, graphics may  be used to present the data.
5.2.1. Analyses for Binary 
Data
The normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions will be used to assess
the differen cebetween active and placebo.

Page 135.2.2. Analyses for Continuous Data
Mixed Effect Model Repeat Measurement ( MMRM ) for Longitudinal Continuous Data:
The fixed effects of treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction will be included, along 
with patient as a random effect.  Unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed.
When modeling the change from baseline values, the variable of visit will start with the first 
post-baseline visit, and the actual baseline value will be included as a covariate.  At each 
visit, estimates of mean values and the mean differences between the active treated group and 
the placebo g
roup will be derived from the model.  The corresponding p -values, standard 
errors and 95% confidence intervals will also be derived from the model.

Analy sis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for Non -longitudinal Continuous Data :
The non- longitudinal continuous data will be analy zed by  [CONTACT_809405] .  When modelling change from baseline values, the actual baseline value will be 
included as a covariate .  Active dose group will be contrasted versus placebo.

Thefrequency and percentage for each category  will be presented.
5.2.4. Analyses for Time to Event Data
None.
5.3. Methods to Manage Missing Data
In general, for descriptive statistics missing values will not be imputed.  In addition, for 
safet y endpoints missing values will not be imputed .  Unless there is an explici t instruction, 
missing values will be used for lower limits of detection and quantitation.

Page 145.3.1. Binary Endpoint
For the binary  response endpoints (eg, SDAI remission rates), subjects with missing values 
will be handled b y:
non-responder imputation (NRI) method, ie, setting any  missing values to be 
non-responsive (0).
will be used as observed (ie, excluding an y missing values from analysis) .
5.3.2. Continuous Endpoints
For non
-patient reported outcome variables, the missing values will be handle d as following:
For continuous endpoints measured longitudinally , the missing values post -baseline 
will be handled in a linear mixed -effect model with repeated measures for this 
continuous variable, where the values are assumed to be missing at random.
Forthe continuous endpoint not measured longitudinally , the post -baseline missing 
values will be:
as observed (ie, excluding any  missing values from analy sis);
imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).
For PRO endpoints, rules suggested by  [CONTACT_941] d evelopers of these PROs will be followed in 
calculating the values of a given component at a scheduled assessment.  If these rules are not 
enough for imputing a value, then the missing values will be handled in the same way  as 
non-patient reported outcome variables.
6.ANALYSES AND SUMMARIES

All clinical AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-emergent signs and symptoms
(TEAEs), withdrawal due to AEs, ECGs, vital signs and safety laboratory data will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of subjects.
Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized 
descriptively, where appropriate.  All safety endpoints will be listed and summarized in accordance with [COMPANY_007] Data Standards.  Categorical outcomes (eg, AEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_153856].  Continuous outcome (eg, blood pressure, pulse rate, etc) will be summarized using N, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  Change from baseline in laboratory data, ECGs and vital signs will also be summarized.  Subject listings will be produced for these safety endpoints accordingly.
6.7.1. Adverse Events
It should be recognized that most studies are not designed to reliably demonstrate a causal 
relationship between the use of a pharmaceutical product and an adverse event or a group ofadverse events.  Except for select events in unique situations, studies do not employ formal adjudication procedures for the purpose of event classification. 
 
 
Nominal p-values (Tier-1 events only) and 95% confidence intervals (Tier-1 and Tier-2 
events) will be provided for between treatment differences in the percentage of patients with events.  Reporting p-values and confidence intervals will follow [COMPANY_007] standards.

Page 24Appendix 3 :Data Derivation Details
A patient is said to have achieved the ACR20 criteria+when all of the following bulleted 
point s are true:
A 20% improvement from baseline in the tender/painful joint count (TCJ28).
A 20% improvement from baseline in the swollen joint count (SJC28).
A 20% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 variables:
1.PhGAof Arthritis VAS;
2.PAAP VAS;
3. P tGA of Arthritis VAS;
4.HAQ disability  index;
5. Results of ESR or CRP blood test (both of which test for inflammation).
ACR50 and ACR70 are defined analogously .
There are man y forms of the DAS .  The DAS used in this study  is the DAS using the 
28-count subsets of tender/painful joints and swollen joints, together with either CRP or 
ESR, to derive the DAS28 -3 (CRP), DAS28
-4 (CRP), or DAS28- 3 (ESR) and DAS28-4 
(ESR), which are calculated using the following formulae, respectivel y:
DAS28 -4(ESR) = (0.56*sqr t(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR) + 0.014*GH
DAS28 -3(ESR) = [0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR)]*1.08 + 0.16
DAS28 -4(CRP) = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96
DAS28 -3(CRP) = [0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1)] * 1.10 + 1.15
where TJC28 is number of painful joints out of 28 joints, SJC28 is number of swollen joints 
out of 28 joints, GH is the general health or patients’ global assessment of disease activity  on 
a [ADDRESS_1119294] i s the natural logarithm, ESR is in mm/first hour, and CRP is in mg/L .
Handling Missing Joint Counts:
A missing painful/tender assessment or one NOT DONE at baseline is set to “not 
painful/tender”;
A missing swollen assessment or one NOT DONE at baseline is set to “not swollen”;
A missing painful/tender assessment or one NOT DONE post baseline is set to 
“painful/tender”;

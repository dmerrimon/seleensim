1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
   1.1. Postpartum depression. [Note: Although postpartum depression is a time-honored 
diagnosis, the DSM-[ADDRESS_555418] its onset even prior to  parturition. However, because the focus of 
this proposal is the prevention of depressive symptoms following  parturition, we will use the 
term postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003]) throughout this proposal.] [COMPANY_003] is a debilitating disorder. New 
mothers must struggle with the adverse consequences of depression and at the same time be 
responsible for parenting their child. [COMPANY_003] poses a threat to mother and infant health, which in 
extreme cases may involve maternal suicide and/or infanticide. An estimated 600,[ADDRESS_555419] frequent complications of 
pregnancy . Available secondary preventive interventions often are ineffective, which calls for 
identifying novel approaches (O’Hara and McCabe, 2013).  
 
Impaired infant-mother bonding is a hallmark of [COMPANY_003] (O’Higgins et al., 2013) . Depressed 
mothers have more difficulties developi[INVESTIGATOR_438225], providing fewer opportunities for reciprocal engagement. 
In turn, bonding impairments may worsen the mother’s depression, creating a vicious cycle. 
Resultant disruptions in the early mother –infant relationship may engender insecure attachment, 
with consequent lifelong disruptions in the child’s socioemotional and cognitive development.  
 
   1.2. Postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PP-PTSD). Posttraumatic stress symptoms have 
also been described in mothers following a traumatic childbirth experience, and these may 
overlap with [COMPANY_003] (Söderquist et al., 2009), creating further maternal morbidity as well as 
Ver. 1.13.2021  
  
 3 diminishing mother-infant bonding (Parfitt and Ayers, 2009). As our study and others show, 
women who develop PP-PTSD are also at risk for suffering from bonding impairment (Dekel et 
al., 2018) and interruption in the mother-infant bonding relationship in the sensitive postpartum 
period which can adversely modify the child’s developmental trajectory.  
 
   1.3. Current treatment status. Antidepressant medication is the most common treatment for 
[COMPANY_003] and also for PP-PTSD, although there is no evidence that antidepressant perform better than 
placebo and women who breastfeed are ambivalent about taking the drug (O’Hara and McCabe, 
2013). There is no treatment that specifically targets PP-PTSD (Olde et al., 2006). Moreover, 
antidepressant has not been found to help with bonding impairments. Antidepressants do not 
prevent PP-PTSD (Dekel et al., 2016). To date there are two  direct interventions to promote 
bonding, viz., baby [CONTACT_438247];  both are partially effective at best. There is a need for 
a brief, inexpensive, feasible treatment to enhance bonding. Here we propose a novel 
intervention aimed at enhancing maternal bonding, and reducing [COMPANY_003] and posttraumatic 
symptom severity.  We will test the heretofore uninvestigated clinical preventive potential of the 
posterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_438226]  (OXT), administered intranasally (IN), to mothers 
during the first postpartum days. 
 
    1.4. Theoretical basis for administering oxytocin.  In addition to IN- OXT’s putative anxiolytic 
and antidepressant properties (Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn, 2013), a  large body 
of research supports OXT’s role in the maintenance of maternal behavior across species. OXT 
knockout mice display deficits in maternal behavior, and exogenous administration of OXT 
enhances it. Recent evidence in postpartum mothers indicates that high peripartum OXT levels 
are associated with enhanced maternal behavior (Feldman et al., 2007), and low levels with 
depressive symptoms (Skrundz et al., 2011). Low OXT levels during bonding have been 
documented in depressed women (Stuebe et al., 2013), suggesting that OXT deficiency is an 
underlying mechanism of impaired bonding in [COMPANY_003]. Exogenous OXT administration has been 
found to enhance maternal brain responses in women (Riem et al., 2011), as well as to reduce the 
fear response in healthy humans ( Acheson et al., 2013 ), suggesting it may also be a promising 
candidate for PP-PTSD. In a non-postpartum sample, IN OXT given to individuals at risk for 
PTSD following trauma exposure shows beneficial effects of the treatment in lowering non-
postpartum PTSD (van Zuiden et al., 2017). Abnormalities in the biological stress response 
manifested in dysregulations in the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis is a hallmark of 
PTSD. OXT deficiency may heighten the stress response in humans (Donadon et al., 2018) in 
part through failure to reestablish bodily homeostasis following exposure to the trauma. Low 
OXT after traumatic exposure has been documented in individuals with PTSD. OXT production 
peaks in labor (Fuchs et al., 2016), as is the norm, and has been associated with extinction of the 
memory for the traumatic nature of the birth experience (Brindle et al., 1991; Brett and 
Baxendale, 2001 ). This accords with OXT’s specific role in reducing traumatic memory 
overconsolidation to protect against PTSD. Thus, increase of OXT in the immediate postpartum 
may protect women following a traumatic delivery. 
 
   1.5. Intranasal oxytocin and brain access. For exogenous OXT to enhance bonding it must 
exert effects on the central nervous system (CNS) through brain OXT receptors. IN 
administration of OXT has been found to produce significantly increased OXT levels in 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) after IN delivery (Striepens et al., 2013). Side effects were not 
Ver. 1.13.2021  
  
 4 observed after the delivery of short-term 18 to 40 IU IN-OXT to humans (MacDonald et al., 
2011), including postpartum women (Rupp et al., 2014). Of direct relevance to the proposed 
project, a study that investigated the role of sequential IN-OXT in promoting lactation  at a dose 
of 4 IU in each nostril q 4h (total daily dose 48 IU), from as early as one day postpartum, found 
no safety concerns (e.g., Fewtrell et al., 2006). Administration of OXT was documented to 
reduce the fear response in healthy humans (Acheson et al., 2013). In an animal model, central 
OXT administration in the immediate post-stressor phase reduced PTSD-like behavior (Cohen et 
al., 2010). A few studies support of the use of OXT to facilitate fear extinction in the treatment 
of individuals suffering from PTSD (Koch et al., 2014; Koch et al., 2016). However, given the 
unpredictable nature of traumatic events, designing prospective studies to test OXT’s protective 
role is challenging. A recent study of sequential IN-OXT administration after  (day 12) an 
automobile accident shows some beneficial effects for PTSD reduction (van Zuiden et al., 2016). 
Along these lines, it is suggested that there might be a <window of opportunity= for a p reventive 
intervention in the first days  following traumatic exposure, viz, before the trauma memory is 
consolidated and symptoms arise (Zohar et al., 2011). 
 
   1.6. Significance of the study. Our study will attempt to fill the current gap in effective 
preventive interventions for pregnant mothers at risk. No study has yet examined the therapeutic 
effects of OXT on maternal bonding as well as on early [COMPANY_003] and PP-PTSD symptoms. If we 
succeed in establishing the effectiveness of this highly feasible preventive intervention, it could 
become a stand-alone treatment for bonding impairment. Our intervention may also offer hope 
for women at risk for the aversive complications of childbirth-related psychopathology. 
Strengthening the important process of mother-infant bonding from the very beginning of the 
child’s life may also have long -lasting positive implications of the child’s psychological 
development. We further expect that our findings will advance the scientific knowledge 
concerning the major role of OXT in social interaction, and its anti-anxiety and anti-depressive 
properties in humans. Research on the clinical potential of IN-OXT for treating mental illness, 
although promising, is in its infancy, and our study may provide knowledge concerning issues of 
dosage and timing in order to achieve sustained central nervous system effects. Lastly, our 
findings may revise central concepts in postpartum psychopathology. Obtaining data that 
attribute [COMPANY_003] to a bonding impairment, and the prevention of [COMPANY_003] by [CONTACT_438248], may 
challenge the current psychiatric conceptualization of [COMPANY_003] as merely a subtype of depression. 
Implication of posttraumatic stress symptoms in [COMPANY_003] may shift the focus of postpartum mental 
health to include traumatic stress responses. Evidence of sustained OXT effects on bonding may 
provide empi[INVESTIGATOR_438227] a sensitive period for mother-infant bonding in the early 
postpartum period, which would have important health care implications. 
 
2. SPECIFIC AIM 
 
   2.1. The primary hypothesis is that administration of a course of four days of IN-OXT at a dose 
of 4 IU in each nostril q 4h (total daily dose 48 IU), from as early as one day postpartum, 
initiated immediately following delivery, in comparison to placebo (PLA), will: 1) enhance 
mother-infant bonding, and 2) reduce [COMPANY_003] and PP-PTSD symptoms, at [ADDRESS_555420] SELECTION 
 
For Oxytocin study 
 
   3.1. Inclusion Criteria . 1) Third-trimester pregnant women being followed at the MGH 
Obstetrics Program who are at risk of [COMPANY_003] as indicated by [CONTACT_438249] >9 on a prenatal 
administration of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). (Note: Although the 
adjective <Postnatal= refers to the use of the EPDS during the postpartum period, this instrument 
is also used as a prepartum screening instrument for [COMPANY_003] risk.) Additionally, we will enroll 
women with score of >21 on the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) who might also be at 
risk for bonding impairment from [COMPANY_003] and PP-PTSD.  
 
   3.2. Exclusion criteria.  1) Age <18 or >50; 2) Failure to participate in regular prenatal check-
ups; 3) Current diagnosis of psychosis; 4) Obstetric complication (e.g., preeclampsia, excessive 
hemorrhaging, gestational diabetes insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562], emergency Caesarian section resulting in the 
newborn being admitted to the NICU). Note that planned Caesarian section will not serve as an 
exclusion criterion because immediate contact [CONTACT_438250].); 5) 
Use of potentially confounding or interacting medications (e.g. antidiuretic hormone, steroids); 
6) Complicating pediatric medical condition in the newborn.; 7) suicidality (candidates 
indicating 2+ on EPDS item [ADDRESS_555421]); 
8) current substance abuse. 
 
   3.3. Recruitment methods. 3596 women delivered a baby [CONTACT_438251][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(MGH) in 2012. During proposed five-year project period, we plan to recruit 110 subjects (Sbjs) 
(who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and expect a drop-out rate of 20% between 
assessments, resulting in an anticipated final sample of 56 women. Additionally, we plan to 
recruit and study 88 partners (starting at day 1 postpartum, taking into account women’s drop -out 
rate between pre-partum and day 1 postpartum assessments), also expecting a drop-out rate of 
20% between assessments, resulting in a final sample of [ADDRESS_555422] ENROLLMENT 
 
Study candidates will be primarily enrolled through social workers, medical assistants and nurses 
at MGH OB/GYN. After administering and scoring the EPDS, the social workers, medical 
assistants, and nurses will introduce the study and obtain permission from the study candidate to 
be contact[CONTACT_66696]. We will also identify potential study candidates through their EPDS 
score in their medical records. We will then approach physicians of qualified candidates to 
obtain permission that their patient will participate in the study and permission that study staff 
contact [CONTACT_438252], if not approached through other OB staff. Physicians will not take part in the 
study recruitment. Candidates will secondarily be enrolled via study flyers and by [CONTACT_438253][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s websites.

 6 5. STUDY PROCEDURES 
 
   5.1. Design.  
Phase I: Screening (two stages).  
First, study candidates (third trimester of pregnancy) will undergo screening via self-report 
questionnaire, the EPDS, to identify women at risk for [COMPANY_003]. Next, study candidates will be 
further screened over the telephone or in person at the OB by a study staff.  For exclusion 
criteria, use of potentially confounding or interacting medications (e.g. antidiuretic hormone, 
steroids), and current mental disorders assessed by [CONTACT_438254] (mini SCID). The treating obstetrician will be asked regarding contraindicating medical 
conditions (e.g., preeclampsia). Also, candidates’ medical records will be reviewed for exclusion 
criteria. For those who will be enrolled from the Mothers Wellbeing Study, we will enroll them 
based on their PDI score obtained as part of the Mothers Wellbeing Study. Medical records will 
be reviewed for exclusion. 
 
Phase II: Assessment. i) At approximately 32 weeks of pregnancy , study Sbj will complete 
additional self-report questionnaires and 40 mL of blood will be collected from Sbj, if she 
agrees. ii) Postpartum (PP) Day [ADDRESS_555423] dose of study medication in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In cases of delays due 
to medical procedures (e.g., emergency C-section) medication start time will be extended to up 
to [ADDRESS_555424]-delivery. iii) PP Days 1-4, Sbj will  continue to self-administer the medication in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438228]. iv) Approximately PP Day 5,  Sbj will complete additional self-
report questionnaires. v) [ADDRESS_555425] and make mental health treatment referral, if indicated and desired. 
Women enrolled through the Mothers Wellbeing Study will begin this study at PP Day 1.  
 
   5.1.1. Assessment # 1 (after approximately  32 weeks pregnancy). At MGH, Sbj will provide 
written informed consent after a full explanation of the procedures. Alternatively, for the 
convenience of the Sbj given their condition as well as to adhere to their visits to the OB, Sbj 
will be consented by [CONTACT_438255] [INVESTIGATOR_438229]. If the consenting process occurs via telephone, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_438230]. She will then review the Consent Form with 
the study physician over the phone. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_438231]. At this time, Sbj will be asked for her permission for study staff to contact 
[CONTACT_138970]. Sbj will be provided with the <Partner Study Introduction Letter= to give to her 
partner, which invites the partner to participate in the study. Her decision on this matter will not 
affect her enrollment in the study. Next, study staff will email a copy of the consent form to the 
Sbj. The study doctor will sign the document upon receipt from Sbj. Next, study staff and the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_438232]-report questionnaires (60 minutes total) pertaining to 
demographics, medication usage (Medication Questionnaire [MED]), attachment (Maternal-Fetal 
Attachment Scale [MFAS]), mental health (Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI], PTSD CheckList 
for DSM-5 [PCL-5 1]), personality (Five Factory Inventory [NEO-FFI]), relationships and social 
support (Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire [ECR-R] and 
Ver. 1.13.2021  
  
 7 Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support [MSPSS]), trauma history (Life Events 
Checklist for DSM-5 [LEC-5], Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form [CTQSF]), sleep 
(Bergen Insomnia Scale [BIS]), and expectations about delivery (Wijma Delivery 
Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire [W-DEQ 1]). All study questionnaires will be completed 
electronically, with the option to complete hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If needed, self-report measures may be 
completed remotely. Following this, Sbj will be taught to self-administer the nasal spray 
containing either drug or placebo. Finally, if agreed by [CONTACT_438256], 40 mL of blood will be collected 
from Sbj from venipuncture specimens performed for the purpose of this study and related 
studies. Samples will be later analyzed for hormone levels (e.g., oxytocin and cortisol) and DNA. 
Sbj (and her partner, if involved) will be contact[CONTACT_41576] 1 month after Assessment 1 as 
a reminder about her participation in the study.  
 
 5.1. 2. Assessment # 2 and initial study medication administration (approximately 8 hours after 
delivery). Study staff will receive epic notification indicating that Sbj has been admitted to the 
Labor and Delivery Unit (L&D). Sbj will complete questionnaires (25 minutes total) at MGH’s 
postpartum unit targeting mental health (BSI), peritraumatic responses (Peritraumatic 
Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire [PDEQ], Peritraumatic Distress Inventory [PDI], [W-
DEQ 2]), depressive symptoms [EPDS], maternal bonding (Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale 
[MIBS], and medication (MED). Additionally, as prescribed in the physicians order sheet (OXT 
order sheet), Sbj will self-administer the study medication (Syntocinon 40 mg/ml or placebo 
nasal spray, per randomization schedule), 1 spray into each nostril, before feeding their baby [CONTACT_438257], q 4 hours, including nighttime.  
 
   5.1.3. Continued study medication administration (up to 4 days after delivery). Sbj will 
continue using the spray as instructed over 4 consecutive days. Sbj will complete a diary 
recording their use of the study medication over the 4-day period (10 minutes total). Drug diary 
will be completed electronically, with the option to complete a hard copy version. Sbj will be 
called after the assessment #2 to provide any assistance with the study medication or the diary, 
and to monitor responses to questionnaires. Sbj will also be called or texted as a reminder to use 
the spray over the 4 days, if desired. Further, as part of routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], Sbjs’ vital signs are 
taken in the postpartum unit before medication administration and are consistently monitored by 
[CONTACT_438258]’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438233].  
 
   5.1.4. Assessment # 3 (approximately 5 days after delivery). Sbj will complete self-report 
questionnaires (30 minutes total) pertaining to mental health (EPDS, PCL-5 2, BSI, PTGI), 
breastfeeding (Index of Breastfeeding Status [IBS]), maternal bonding and attachment (MIBS, 
Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire [PBQ], Maternal Attachment Inventory [MAI]), childbirth 
experience (W-DEQ 2), and medication (MED). Sbj will be called after assessment to monitor 
responses to questionnaires. Additionally, if Sbj’s partner expressed interest in participating in 
the study, they will receive the < Partner Recruitment Letter= and, upon implied consent, will 
complete the EPDS (EPDS-P) and MIBS (MIBS-P) adapted for partners. Partners will complete 
all questionnaires electronically, with the option to complete hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
   5.1.5. Assessment # 4 (approximately 2 months after delivery). Sbj will complete (40 minutes 
total) concerning mental health (EPDS, PCL-5 2, BSI), bonding (MIBS, PBQ), breastfeeding 
(IBS), child development and temperament (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 2 months [ASQ-3], 
Ver. 1.13.2021  
  
 8 Infant Behavior Questionnaire [IBQ-R]), psychological growth (PTGI) and medication (MED), 
administered by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_438234]. If needed, self-report measures may be 
completed remotely.  Sbj will also participate in a short video-clip of free play with their infant 
(10 minutes total) obtained by [CONTACT_3647] (see Video Completion Form), which will later be 
coded using Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB). Sbj is instructed to freely interact with baby. 
Assessment may be completed at Sbjs home, if desired. Child development will also be 
measured by [CONTACT_438259] (Bayley-III), relevant for the age group 
studied. The Bayley-III, which focuses on observational behavior, will be conducted by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_438235], supervised by [CONTACT_976]. Finally, if agreed by [CONTACT_438256], 40 mL of blood will be 
collected from Sbj from venipuncture specimens performed for the purpose of this study and 
related studies. Samples will be later analyzed for hormone levels (e.g., oxytocin and cortisol) 
and DNA. After completion, a member of the study team will answer any questions Sbj may 
have about the study and provide mental health referral, as needed and desired. Additionally, 
partner’s enrolled in the study will complete the EPDS -P and MIBS-P. 
 
6. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
   6.1. Statistical analysis will be performed via a mixed model for repeated measures, with Drug 
(OXT vs. PLA) as a Class factor, psychometric scores as univariate and/or simultaneous 
multivariate dependent measures, additional covariates as appropriate, and Sbj as a random 
effect. Currently available mixed model analytic programs are able to handle missing data. Effect 
sizes will be employed in power analyses to calculate sample sizes for subsequent larger studies. 
Path analysis will be employed to test the role of bonding as a mediating factor of drug effect on 
depression outcome. 
 
   6.2. Power analysis. The major goal of this first study is to obtain measures of effect size that 
can be used to calculate sample size requirements for a subsequent, larger study, should the data 
from this study be promising. Thus, even if we are unable to meet the recruitment goals below, 
the study will still obtain useful and important data. That being said, we offer the following 
power analysis below, should recruitment go as well as hoped. 
 
   Because of the novelty of this project’s hypothesis, no data are available regarding the potential 
protective effect of IN-OXT against the development of [COMPANY_003], from which to estimate an effect 
size for the proposed study. However, a meta-analysis of studies of the effect of intranasal OXT 
in both healthy and clinical groups with implications for pharmacotherapy yielded an estimated 
effect size of d=0.32 (Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn, 2013), on which we will base 
our power analysis. With α set a t 0.05, and 1- β (i.e., power) set at 0.80, n=56 Sbjs 
(approximately 28 completed Sbjs in each of two groups) will be required to detect an effect size 
of d=0.[ADDRESS_555426] analysis comparing OXT and PLA subjects. Estimating dropouts at 
20% between assessments, [ADDRESS_555427] postpartum assessments, respectively, and 110 Sbjs will be required to complete the pre-
partum assessment. Of all pre-partum women given psychometrics, an estimated 20% will be 
found to be at-risk, requiring the administration of psychometrics to 550 study candidates. To 
summarize: 
 
550 administered psychometrics

56 women complete participation; [ADDRESS_555428] of our obtaining  sufficient data that, if promising, will 
allow planning of a further, more definitive study of the effec tive role of IN-OXT in enhancing 
maternal bonding and/or preventing postpartum depressive and or  posttraumatic symptoms, 
including calculating sample size requirements. Successful re sults also pertain to gaining 
knowledge about the potential positive effects of IN-OXT o n mother at risk and knowledge about 
the feasibility of the intervention. Given the under-researc hed area of PP-PTSD, successful 
findings will include knowledge about the prevalence, course and risk factors of posttraumatic 
stress and its relations with depressive symptoms and mother-infant bonding. 
 
7. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
 
   7.1. Study Medication. OXT nasal spray has been previously administered to women following 
childbirth. There are reports of mild side effects at a dosage to promote lactation for as early as 
day 1 postpartum (e.g., Fewtrell et al., 2006; Ruis et al., 1981). Mild complaints may include: 
breast and nipple discomfort (13-20 out of 100) and uterine cramps (5 out of 100). However, 
such side effects were also reported by [CONTACT_438260] (Stern, 1961). As indicated in 
the drug brochure, women experiencing painful uterine cramps should not drive or operate 
machinery. Other uncommon side effects include bleeding from the nose after using the drug (1 
out of 48) (Huntingford, 1961), unfamiliar sensation in the nose (5 out of 100), and complaint 
about taste (1 out of 100) (Stern, 1961). Use of the drug by [CONTACT_438261] (Mah et al., 2013). A subsequent 
study, however, by [CONTACT_438262] (Mah et al., 2015), nor were 
these outcomes reported elsewhere (Clarici et al., 2015). A recent study by [CONTACT_438263] 
(2017), based on the [ADDRESS_555429] of IN-OXT on maternal sensitive interaction 
with own baby [CONTACT_438264]’s baby. The authors warrant 
further research on IN-OXT in depressed mothers. Other potential undesirable effects mentioned 
in the nasal spray package insert but not encountered in the literature include: headache, nausea, 
rash and allergic dermatitis (all rare).  
 
   7.2. Questionnaires and video recording. Sbj may experience emotional distress from 
answering questions concerning their mental health and childbirth experience. Interacting with 
their infant on camera may cause Sbj discomfort.  
 
   7.3. Blood drawn. Sbj may experience discomfort from having blood drawn. Side effects may 
include bruising, swelling at the injection site, dizziness and lightheadedness. 
  
   7.4. Unknown Risks. There may be other risks and side effects that are not known at this time. 
If any significant new findings develop during the course of this study that may affect the risk: 
benefit ratio for participants, appropriate institutional reporting protocol will be followed. 
Ver. 1.13.[ADDRESS_555430] an increased 
incidence of lactation problems (Assarian et al., 2014), and they are at risk for breastfeeding 
failure and cessation (see Figueiredo et al., 2013, for a review). This can be unfortunate, because 
breastfeeding helps to reduce [COMPANY_003] symptoms (Fairlie et al., 2009; Figueiredo et al., 2014; 
Ystrom, 2012). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of our Sbjs (and 
their newborns) who receive active drug will benefit from the lactation-promoting effect of IN-
OXT, with consequent benefit to infant nutrition and reduction in maternal anxiety. Second, in a 
recent study of women with [COMPANY_003] three months following delivery (Mah et al., 2015), IN-OXT 
was found to enhance the quality of mother-infant bonding and maternal protective behavior. 
Hence, our proposed active intervention may benefit the newborn as well. Third, women who 
receive active drug may be protected from developi[INVESTIGATOR_438236]. Other less 
substantive benefits include, if this turns out to be the case, the use of IN-OXT may reduce or 
obviate the need for antidepressant medication, with a reduction of possible transmission via 
secretion into maternal milk. Further, [COMPANY_003] is often accompanied by [CONTACT_438265] ( Righetti-Veltema et al., 2003) . OXT has been shown to attenuate the neural 
response to arousing stimuli (Rupp et al., 2013) and to reduce amygdala activation in response to 
infant crying (Riem et al., 2011). Thus we have reason to expect that OXT may prevent to some 
degree PP-PTSD symptoms in women at risk.  
 
   8.2. Potential benefits to society. The information collected from this study may enable 
researchers to obtain knowledge on the effectiveness of oxytocin for enhancing bonding and 
preventing depressive and posttraumatic symptoms in postpartum women. If the findings are 
promising, this study may serve as a platform for larger-scale studies that may ultimately support 
a new drug indication for postpartum women at risk.  
 
9. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
9.1. Administration of Protocol.  
The protocol will be conducted in accordance with the protocol submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_438266], as well as by [CONTACT_438267]. Sbjs will not be recruited until written 
notification of approval of the research project is issued by [CONTACT_438268].  
 
   9.2. Data Monitoring. Given the reduced risk of this study, monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_438237]. A physician investigator will review all laboratory/questionnaire 
results. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_438238] (BSI, question #9, responses of 2 or more; 
EPDS question #10, responses of <sometimes= or <yes, quite often=) . Women who report 
suicidality in the screening and consent to the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_438239]. Likewise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_438240]. If needed, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a suicidality assessment . Based on Sbj’s 
response, several actions will take place, including frequent contact [CONTACT_438269], suicide contract, referral for psychiatric consultation and treatment for medication, 
Ver. 1.13.[ADDRESS_555431] for assessment and appropriate triage. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_438241], in accordance with IRB’s policies.  
In the event possible serious or adverse effects of participation, Paul Cannistraro, M.D., an MGH 
psychiatrist who has served as a Medical Monitor on other studies conducted by [CONTACT_438270], and who is not an investigator on the present study, will be available to review the event 
and make recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_72616].

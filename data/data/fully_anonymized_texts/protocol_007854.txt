PROTOCOL TITLE:  
Extremity Occlusion with Tourniquets Increases Proximal Systolic Pressure  
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Taufiek Konrad Rajab  
 
1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims  
We intend to demonstrate that non -invasive, peripheral vascular occlusion increases blood 
pressure in the conserved vasculature in healthy humans. Data from this study will provide proof 
of concept for the development of a novel device to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
outcomes during non -traumatic cardiac arrest. W e hypothesize that peripheral vascular occlusion 
of non -vital vascular beds (the lower extremities) will increase blood flow to the more vital 
organs, the heart and the brain, leading to an improvement in survival and neurologic recovery 
after cardiac arre st as these outcomes are dependent on heart and brain ischemic injury. By [CONTACT_14111], FDA -approved, tourniquets on healthy humans to measure blood pressure 
with peripheral vascular occlusion, we will be testing our hypothesis in the safes t way.  We also 
will demonstrate no substantial change in heart rate.  
2.[ADDRESS_13402] has yet to be realized.12-14 
Rationale:  To our knowledge, blood flow or pressure to vascular beds supplying vital organs (i.e., brain, 
heart) has not been measured in healthy adult subjects following administration of a non -invasive 
peripheral vascular occlusion device.  This proof -of-concept d ata is necessary for future development and 
hypothesis testing for novel CPR adjuncts, which could improve survival and neurologic recovery 
following cardiac arrest.  
2.0 Intervention to be studied  
The fluid dynamics Hagen -Poiseuille Equation demonstrates in physical law why peripheral 
vasoconstriction increases the flow in conserved vascular networks. The Hagen -Poiseuille Equation ( 𝑸 = 
∆Pπ𝑟4) gives the volumetric flow rate ( 𝑄) in a cylindrical tube as it relates to the viscosity of the fluid ( 𝜈), 
length of the system ( 𝐿), radius of the tube ( 𝑟), and pressure gradient across the tubing (∆ 𝑃). Tourniquets 
placed on the legs would decrease the length of the system ( 𝐿), thereby [CONTACT_14112] ( 𝑄) as these 
variables are inversely proportional. While this equation is an obvious oversimplification, we find it 
models our expectant results and confirms what we intuitively and anecdotally have noted in our patients. 
Beyond theory, studies in large anim al models and clinical trials offer additional proof of concept.4,12-13,15 -

controls.17 
In order to complete our hypothesis testing safely, we plan to deploy well -studied and FDA approved 
combat application tourniquets (CAT) on  both thighs of  volunteer healthy adult subjects while measuring 
blood pressure in the upper extremities.  Research participants in this study will have their blood pressure 
measured in their upper extremities before and after tourniquet administration in order to serve as within 
subject controls. The tourniquets will be deployed for no longer than [ADDRESS_13403] for 3 -5 minutes 
before the next application of the tourniquet.    
CAT tourniquets were developed in 2005 by [CONTACT_14113]. (US Patent numbers 7,842,067  and 
7,892,253 ) and soon after obtained FDA approval.  CAT tourniquets have been indicated for use in 
emergency situations revolving around a wounded limb, such as hemorrhage control.22-23  CAT 
tourniquets are the official tourniquet of the US Army since in 2005.  
4.0 Study Endpoints (if applicable)  
● Primary Study Endpoint:  A cardiac arrest porcine model that utilized an intra -aortic 
balloon catheter for occlusion of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm demonstrated a 
mean increase in systolic pressure of 17mmHg.18 Extrapolating from this data to our more 
distal point of occlusion at the lower extremities, we define the primary study endpoint as 
successful application of CAT tourniquets in normal physiology in healthy humans with a 
minimum increase in blood pressure of 10 mmHg measured in the arms. Another primary 
endpoint  is demonstrating no significant change in participant heart rate.  
● Primary Safety Endpoint:  The most common complications following application of a 
CAT tourniquet is pain or discomfort at the site of tourniquet application.  This usually 
occurs at the edges of the tourniquet due to the increased pressure gradient.  Symptoms are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_14096].  In order to increase safety of the 
study and reduce the likelihood of complications, the tournique t will be tightened to the 
minimum pressure needed to occlude blood flow to the lower extremities and will be 
removed after 5 minutes since injury usually occurs 30 -60 minutes following tourniquet 
application20. If any of the subjects report intolerable pain during the study, their 
participation will be ended immediately.  
● Secondary Safety Endpoints:  There are no secondary safety endpoints.

 Page 4 of 7  10.0 Study Design / Methods  
After expressing interest in the study, participants will be asked to come to MUSC for the study visit. On 
the day of the study, each volunteer will be taken to a private room by [CONTACT_14116] a signed written consent form.  They will be asked to confirm their eligibility 
in the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Their blood pressure in their upper extremity will 
be taken to ensure that it is not elevated  on the day of the study (must not be >130/80mmHg). Their 
responses  and blood pressure  will be documented.  Once the participants have consented to the study, they 
will have their height and weight recorded. Then, each participant will have their blood pressure measured 
in each arm by [CONTACT_14117] a medical  bench .  The blood 
pressures and the heart rate will be recorded by [CONTACT_14118]. This will allow each research 
participant to act as their own control for t he experimental procedure.  Then, one CAT tourniquet will be 
placed around each thigh and tightened until no pulse can be felt in the lower extremity.  Blood pressure 
measurements will be repeated in each arm once the tourniquets are secured. Once these bl ood pressures 
are documented, the tourniquets will be removed. The maximum time the tourniquets will be applied is [ADDRESS_13405] been noted for up to two hours of continuous use.  This team will prioritize the safety and comfor t of 
the participant and will limit the tourniquet application time to a maximum of 5 minutes. We will be using 
the FDA -approved Co mbat Application Tourniquet (CAT) tourniquet (North American Rescue, Greer, 
South Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).   After the data is collected , a debrief session will be conducted, allowing for 
additional subject monitoring after removal of the tourniquets.  During the debrief session, the participant 
will be asked to lay down or sit in a relaxed position for [ADDRESS_13406] an evaluation . If any of the safety endpoints are noted, it will be recorded, 
and the participant will be taken to the emergency room  for full examination and work -up.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_14097]-approved personnel will follow -up with the participant remotely until the safety concern is resolved.  
11.0 Data Management   
● All data associated with the research participants will be kept in a secure 
database with a password protected server.  The data will be coded and a 
linking document containing any identifiers will be kept separate from the 
research data.  
● Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_14098] a locked 
file cabinet with the key stored separately.    
● Data may be used in future studies following IRB approval without additional 
informed consent from research participants.   
12.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
● Research subjects may refuse to participate or stop participating in the study at any 
time by [CONTACT_14119] [INVESTIGATOR_14099].  
● If research participants would like to have their data removed from the study, they 
must notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14100] a week of completing the 
study.  
Version 3; Version Date : 11/10/2022 
 Page 5 of 7  ● If the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14101], they may remove the 
research participant from the study.    
13.0 Risks to Subjects  
● There is a possibility of pain or discomfort  at the site of tourniquet application 
following deployment of the tourniquet.  Symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_14102], numbness,  or tingling.  Injury typi[INVESTIGATOR_14103].  Risk for injury 
increases with duration of tourniquet application (>60 minutes) and the tightness of 
the tourniquet applied.  CAT tourni quets will be deployed for less than 5 minutes 
and will be tightened up to the necessary pressure to occlude distal blood flow.  
● If the above occur s during the research study, IRB approved personnel will 
discontinue testing for that individual and recommend that the research participant 
seek medical assistance at the closet emergency room.  IRB-approved personnel  or 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_14104].  
● There is a risk for injury/discomfort to the skin or subcutaneous tissue at the site of 
tourniquet or sphygmomanometer application such as, bruising or petechiae.  These 
symptoms are transient and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105].   
● There is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality in the unlikely event of a data 
leakage.  
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects or Others  
The research participants will receive a small monetary benefit of $10 for their participation.  
15.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
Results or data collected in the study will not be disclosed to study participants.  
16.0 Drugs or Devices  
CAT tourniquets and automated sphygmomanometers will be purchased by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_14106].  IRB 
approved personnel will be trained on how to properly and safely deploy the CAT tourniquets on 
the lower extremities (i.e., thigh) and the automated sphygmomanometers on the upper extremities 
prior to the start of the study.  Prior to deployment of either the CAT tourniquet or the automated 
sphygmomanometer, IRB approved perso nnel will inspect the devices for any defects and sterilize 
the devices with 70% isopropyl alcohol or 70% ethanol.  Following removal of the devices from 
the study participants, they will be sterilized with 70% isopropyl alcohol or 70% ethanol.

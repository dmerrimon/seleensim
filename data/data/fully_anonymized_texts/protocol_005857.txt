Introduction  
 
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair is a common outpatient orthopedic surgery .  Patients undergoing 
this procedure  experience significant post -operative pain that is poorly controlled by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_159687].1 Multimodal analgesic regimens are used in many centers to help optimize pain control and to 
reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which are associated with many adverse effects, including nausea, 
constipation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_159688], tolerance, and hyperalgesia .  Multi modal treatments  can include  
medications such as acetaminophen, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications , gabapentinoids, 
periarticular local anesthetic infiltration , ketamine, and peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) .  In our institution, 
we routinely t reat ACL surgery patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], acetaminophen, and adductor canal nerve blocks.  
 
Nerve  blocks  are commonly  used to provide  post-operative  analgesia  for orthopedic  procedures .  The 
knee has many  nerves  and t he complete  innervation  of the knee is complex.  There  are nerves  w hic h are 
sensory  (which  control  pain)  and motor  (which  control  movement).7,9 The adductor  canal block  (ACB)  is 
more commonly being  used to provide  post-operative  analgesia  since it  provides  a sensory  block  with 
minimal  motor  block.1,[ADDRESS_185475]-operative  rehabilitation .  Adductor canal nerve blocks are 
performed for knee surgery to help with pain control by [CONTACT_159703] g nerves of the adductor c anal.1 ,3,5 ,7  
While the saphenous nerve is one of our targets, our goal is to anesthetize several other small nerves that 
travel thr ough the adductor canal as well .  The adductor canal contains:  saphenous nerve, nerve to the 
vastus  medialis, medial femoral cutaneous nerve, and the distal portion of the posterior division of the 
obturator nerve.[ADDRESS_185476] -of care anesthetic plan that we use at NYU Ambulatory Surgery Center includes  general 
anesthesia and an adductor canal nerve block for ACL surgery.  
 
We are planning  a study  designed  as a prospective,  randomized,  single  blinded  trial involving  human 
subjects .  The goal of this study  is to determine  an optimal location (proximal or distal) for the nerve 
block and whether it will make a difference in how much opi[INVESTIGATOR_159689].  
 
For this study, we will use ultrasound to identify the adductor canal  and the proximal end of the  adduc tor 
canal /apex of the femoral triangle  to determine the location of the block s.   We will have two randomized 
groups:  
 
1. ACB within true AC with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 5% 2 0cc 
2. ACB proximal to true AC with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 5% [ADDRESS_185477] 24 hours (including intraop erative medications ).  We 
will s end the patient home with a medication log where they can record  when and how much pain 
medication (percocet, etc.) they take .  We will call after 24 hours and ask them to give  us the information 
over the phone .  We would convert the intraop, PACU, and home narcotics to morphine equivalents and

 calculate the total dose in 24 hours and compare each patient use in mg/kg.  
 
Purpose  
 
The purpose  of this prospective,  randomized  blinde d study  is to determine  whether  the location of the 
nerve block plays a role in decreasing pain experienced with ACL surgery and thereby [CONTACT_159704][INVESTIGATOR_159690] . 
 
Hypothesis  
 
An adductor canal nerve block in a more proximal  part of th e thigh will provide more effective analgesia 
and therefore decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] . 
 
Description  of study  and study  procedure  
 
Subjects:  
All patients  undergoing  ACL surgery at NYU will be considered  for inclusion  with their surgeon’s  
approval .   Both males and females will be asked to participate .  Their involvement in the study w ill 
last approximately 1 year . 
 
Inclusion  Criteria:  
1. Patients between  [ADDRESS_185478] be English proficient . 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients younger  than 18 or older  than 75 years  of age. 
2. Patients with a history  of chronic  pain or who are taking  medications  intended  to treat  
chronic pain such  as strong  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
3. Patients with history  of neurologic  disorder  that can interfere  with pain sensation.  
4. Patients with a history  of drug or alcohol  abuse.  
5. Patients who are unable  to understand  or follow  instructions.  
6. Patients with an allergy  or a contraindication  to any of the medications  used in the study  
or patients  with a contraindication  to any of the study  procedures.  
7. Patients with severe  liver disease,  renal  insufficiency,  congestive  heart  failure,  and/or 
significant  heart  disease.  
8. Patients with a BMI over 42. 
9. Any patient  that the inves tigators  feel cannot  comply  with all study  related  
procedures.  
10. Patient s who do not tolerate Percocet.  
 
Number of Subjects:  
Our sample size estimate is based on testing the one -sided non -inferiority hypothesis of the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_159691] 24 hours (incl uding intraoperative medications) , the primary outcome .  This study is powered to 
detect the difference between the two randomized groups .  Assume total opi[INVESTIGATOR_159692] 24 hours  w ith 
ACB within true AC with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% 20cc  is 32.9±6.0 mg (based o n reference paper Abdallah et al., 
2016) .  Considering a non -inferiority margin (Δ) of 15% (i.e., 4.9 mg opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]), and assuming that the true 
difference in total opi[INVESTIGATOR_159693] 0 , we need 20 patients for each group to 
achieve 80% power and α=0.0 5.  To account for a 15% drop out rate, we need to obtain data from  23 
4 S17-[ZIP_CODE]  
NCT0340145 0 
ACB in ACL Repair Version 2 dated 10/01/18 
 
 patients for each group, i.e., a total of 46 patients .  We estimate that we’ll have to consent about 75 patients 
to get data, since there may be problems reaching the patients the days after surgery.  
 
Randomization:  
Participating subjects will be randomized  to one of  two groups .  The randomization list will be maintained 
by a member of the study staff .  Randomization will be done ahead of time using a computer -generated 
randomization schedule  and using opaque sealed envelopes .  These groups include:  
1. ACB within true AC with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 5% 2 0cc 
2. ACB proximal to true AC with  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 5% 2 0cc 
 
Procedures:  
The research  portion  of this protocol  is the randomization  of patients .  All anesthesia,  perineural blocks,  
hydration,  surgical  treatment , pain treatment, and post -operative follow up visits are standard  of care for 
this patient  population .  Brief  descriptions  of these  standards  of care  procedures  are explained  below.  
 
Preoperatively,  ASA monitors  will be applied  and an intravenous  line will be placed .  Patients  will receive  
IV sedation  (midazolam  and fentanyl)  titrated  to effect  at the discretion  of the anesthesiologist .  All 
patients will receive dexamethasone 10mg IV and Zofran 4mg IV intraoperatively for nausea p rophylaxis .  
Intraop narcotics will be limited to fentanyl and dilaudid .  No intramuscular or intra -articular opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] w ill 
be administered.  
 
Following patient enrollment, t he anesthesiologist will receive  a sealed opaque envelope  from the research 
coordina tor indicating  adductor  canal  block  location .  Each patient’s thigh will be scanned using 
ultrasound to identify the adductor canal and the apex of the femoral triangle .  The distances from the base 
of the patella will be recorded .   The patients  will receive an ultrasound -guided  single  injection adductor  
canal  block  or femoral triangle block with 20 mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 
 
All included  patients  will receive  general anesthesia as the primary  anesthetic  for the case,  as this is our 
standard  of care for patients undergoing  ACL surgery . 
 
As per standard  practice,  all patients  will receive  standard  of care pain control  with Percocet  
postoperatively .   
 
In the PACU, muscle weakness will be assessed and recorded .  At this time, patients will be given a 
medication  record to take home, in which they will record  their medication use, pain scores,  side 
effects, and any additional medication for [ADDRESS_185479] within 2 business days of the patient’s discharge.  
 
Post-operative follow up visits at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_185480] in the surgeon’s clinic and are 
standard of care for all patients regardless of whether they are in the study or not .  During these visits, 
muscle weakness will also be assessed and recorded.  
 
 
Statement of Compliance  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of 
Human Subject s (45 CFR Part 46), 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, 312, and 812 as applicable, any other applicable 
US government research regulations, and institutional research policies and procedures .  The International 
Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) Guideline for Good Clin ical Practice (“GCP”) (sometimes referred 
to as “ICH -GCP” or “E6”) will be applied only to the extent that it is compatible with FDA and DHHS 
5 S17-[ZIP_CODE]  
NCT0340145 0 
ACB in ACL Repair Version 2 dated 10/01/[ADDRESS_185481] (IRB), except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial participants .  
All personnel involved in the conduct of this study hav e completed Human Subjects Protection Training.  
Risks  
 
All medications  used in this study  are standard  of care for surgical  patients .  The risks  of nerve bloc ks are 
infection, bleeding,  nerve  injury,  injury to surrounding tissues, and hematoma  (collection  of blood  at the 
injection  site).  
 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_159694] .  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_159695] a risk of severe  neurologic and 
cardiac  toxicity  if injected  intravascularly .  However,  it should  be noted  that ultrasound guided 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_159696] c anal blocks are standard of care for this surgery and therefore the risk to the 
patient will not be increased .  The use of  ultrasound  guidance  will minimize  the possibility  of injecting  
the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_159697] a blood  vessel.  
 
Randomization will not add risks  as both study groups are standard of care.  
 
Protection Against R isks 
 
Experienced anesthesiologists trained in regional anesthesia will perform the blocks  as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159698] .  Ultrasound guidance is used to ensure proper anatomic placement of the blocks .  
Anesthesiologists will be unblinded.  
 
Benefits  
 
It is not known if this study will benefit the patients .   All patients  undergoing this procedure will have a  
block  whether or not they participate in this study , barring any restrictions .   We hope the knowledge gained 
from this study will benefit future patients.  
 
Patient Recruitment and Consent  
 
All subjects  will be required  to sign a [LOCATION_001] Uni versity School of Medicine (NYU SOM) Internal 
Review Board (IRB)  approved  informed consent form ( ICF) prior to any research  procedures .  Potential 
subjects who are scheduled for ACL surgery will be screened ahead of time .  Patients will then be given 
the opportunity to ask questions  and will sign the consent form prior to surgery .  Subjects will be 
informed of the study and consented in a pri vate setting .  Because the patients would have an adductor 
canal block regardless of participation in the study, patients are consenting to being randomized to 
location of the ACB as well as the review of their medical ch arts.  All questions will be answered and 
patients will not be coerced in any way to participate in the study .  Those patients that meet inclusion 
criteria and are willing to participate in the study will be consented and enrolled .  The subject will be 
given a copy of the consent  and one will be placed  in the medical  chart .  The original  signed  consent  w ill 
be maintained  in the research  folder .  Because an ACB is standard of care for this surgery regardless of 
participation in the study, the subject  will be responsible  for payment  for all  medical  services  rendered  
and will not be reimbursed.  
We currently perform 600 ACL reconstruction procedures a year at NYU  and t herefore  estimate that with 
approximately 10% of patients being enrolled, we can complete the s tudy in 8 months.

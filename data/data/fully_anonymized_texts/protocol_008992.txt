other regulatory -approved preparations of hyaluronidase in Europe and Asia. Collectively, this  
usage  spans  nearly  60 years  of clinical  history in  humans. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contracted a review of the efficacy and safety of  
several hyaluronidase drug products through a program known as the Drug Efficacy Study 
Implementation (DESI).  The studies were conducted by [CONTACT_763647].  The DESI review findings published in the (Federal Register  
Sept 1970) established that hyaluronidase injection was “effective” for the following indications:  
For use as an adjunct to increase the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs; for  
hypodermoclysis [subcutaneous fluid admini stration]; as an adjunct in subcutaneous urography;  
for improving the resorption of radiopaque agents.  
The hyaluronidase drugs included in the DESI reviews included injectable hyaluronidase  
preparation derived from bovine testes. Replacing animal -derived s laughterhouse products with 
recombinant human biotechnology- developed materials potentially alleviates risks associated  
with animal pathogens, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and allergy and 
immunogenicity  to foreign  proteins. 
rHuPH20 is a 447- amino acid single chain polypeptide with N -linked and O -linked glycan 
structures.  rHuPH20 is synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that have been 
transfected  with a plasmid containing  the DNA sequence  encoding  the GPI -anchor  deleted  
human PH20 hyaluronidase. The protein is purified through a series of chromatographic steps  
that results in a purified protein with high specific activity.  rHuPH20 is up to [ADDRESS_1046473] based on specific  
activity.  rHuPH20 depolymerizes hyaluronan (HA) by [CONTACT_321608] β -1,[ADDRESS_1046474] formulation of rHuPH20 (HYLENEX) obtained FDA approval on 2 December  
2005. The approval indication is an adjuvant to increase absorption and dispersion of other  
injected drugs; for subcutaneous fluid administration; and as an adjunct in subcutaneous  
urography for improving resorption of radiopaque agents.  HYLENEX was made available as  
saleable product beginning October [ADDRESS_1046475] one dose of  
HYLENEX/r HuPH20.  Of the 510 subjects exposed to HYLENEX/rHuPH20 in clinical studies,

admixed with a co -injected drug or fluid administration. Table [ADDRESS_1046477] been exposed according to the dose of HYLENEX/rHuPH20. There  
have been six studies to date in whi ch at least some study subjects are known to have received  
more  than a single  exposure  to HYLENEX:  HZ2 -07-03 (two doses per subject), 1838- 003 (more  
than one dose permitted), HZ2- 07-02 (a two- part study with some subjects participating in both 
parts), HZ2 -07-04 (up to four doses per subject), HZ2- 08-04 (up to six doses per subject) HZ2-

The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) have been self -limited, transient, localized  
injection/infusion site observations. Comparison of the nature and incidence of AEs for  
HYLENEX versus the saline placebo in the double -blinded, placebo- controlled study designs  
shows that, with few exceptions, there were no AEs clearly attributable to HYLENEX, and in 
general the AE profile for HYLENEX was similar to that for saline placebo.  The clinical data 
have not prompted any consideration of changes to the HYLENEX product label. The  
Investigator is to refer to the rHuPH20 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) Version 1.0 for all current  
safety  information.

 1.2. Eczema,  Spongiosis,  and the Role  of Hyaluronan  
Spongiosis is a characteristic histopathological feature in acute eczema1. It is believed to be  
caused by [CONTACT_763649][INVESTIGATOR_763610].  Serous exudate extends from the dermis; as it expands, epi[INVESTIGATOR_763611], acquiring a stellate appearance  
and giving the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] a sponge -like morphology2. Investigators have conducted research to  
better understand the pathogenesis of spongiosi s, specifically to understand whether HA may 
have  a functional  role in its pathogenesis. 
HA is a well -known component of the connective tissues, such as in the cartilage of joints and 
the dermis of the skin. In the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], Tammi and Wells3,[ADDRESS_1046481] used hyaluronic -acid- 
binding protein (HABP) to localize HA in the matrix between keratinocytes in the middle and 
upper parts of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_763612]. In addition, Sakai reported that even the normal stratum  
corneum  contains HA supplied by [CONTACT_327450]5. 
In the process of assessing whether HA participates in epi[INVESTIGATOR_85783], Maytin and 
colleagues6 delivered  Streptomyces  hyaluronidase  (Strep  H) topi[INVESTIGATOR_763613]. Strep H significantly reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_763614]. This reduction in epi[INVESTIGATOR_763615],  but rather  to an apparent acceleration in  terminal differentiation.  
Overall, the data showed that HA is a significant participant in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_763616]. 
Ohtani and colleagues
[ADDRESS_1046482], they demonstrated increased intercellular accumulation  
of HA in the spongiotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_763617]  3 (HAS3)  mRNA  expression by [CONTACT_763650].  
Secondly, they showed that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_763618] E-cadherin.  Thirdly, IL -4, IL -13, and IFN -γ 
increased HA production, enhanced HAS3 mRNA expression, and decreased membrane E - 
cahedrin expression by [CONTACT_763651][INVESTIGATOR_763619] - and high Ca+ media. 
Lastly, they demonstrated that IL -4, IL-13, their combination, and IFN -γ could induce  
intercellular space widening in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_763620] E - 
cadherin expression. These results suggest that the augmented production of HA and the  
decreased E -cadherin expression by [CONTACT_763652] -4/IL-[ADDRESS_1046483] common skin diseases  
affecting up to 20% of children and up to 3 % of adults8,9. While mild cases can be treated with  
emollients alone , most cases require the use of pharmacologic interventions. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_763621].  However due to  
potential side effects including both local effects (skin atrophy and pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491]) and  
systemic effects (adrenal suppression) new topi[INVESTIGATOR_763622]. The most  
efficacious of theses topi[INVESTIGATOR_763623] (TCIs), tacrolimus  
ointment and pi[INVESTIGATOR_71861]10. These were widely used until 2006 when the FDA issued a  
boxed warning due to rare cases of cutaneous and systemic malignancy. Thus there is a 
significant  need for novel safe and effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491].  
The dose of rHuPH20 selected for this proof of concept study (3,000 U/dose) is intended to model a future topi[INVESTIGATOR_763624]20 that will provide controlled release of rHuPH20  
into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_763625]. The intradermal administration of rHuPH20 in 
this study will  not require  diffusion through the  stratum  corneum, and it  is therefore considered  a 
more direct route of administration for this proof of concept study. While daily intradermal 
injection of 3,000 U of rHuPH20 in 0.25mL is not likely to provide sustained re lease of enzyme  
at the injection site, it is anticipated that this dose will be sufficient to temporarily depolymerize  
the hyaluronan present in the dermis and  epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  
Doses of rHuPH20 in non- human primates up to approximately 3.6 million U/kg were wel l 
tolerated, and daily repeat subcutaneous dosing of 600,000 U/kg showed no histologic findings  
at the injection site.  Additionally, in a Halozyme sponsored clinical study, [ADDRESS_1046484] dermatitis/eczema.  Therefore, we propose to 
conduct  this Phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_763626]  a + or ++ reaction  (see Appendix B ) to

3. STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_583257], prospective, double -blind, placebo- controlled study to compare the  
efficacy,  safety  and tolerability  of rHuPH20  or placebo  control  administered  intradermally  (ID) 
in the prevention and treatment of subjects with contact [CONTACT_763653].  This study will involve  
two treatment regimens, which will run in parallel (Treatment Regimens 1 and 2).  A maximum 
of [ADDRESS_1046488] allergy to nickel will be recruited for the Screening 
period. During the Screening period, subjects will be tested to confirm the presence of cutaneous  
nickel sensitivity  using the 1, 2.5, and 5% nickel sulfate patch. The concentration of nickel  
sulfate for each subject that causes no greater than a ++ cutaneous reaction (2 out of 4), 
International Contact [CONTACT_173867] [ICDRG11] scoring scale will be the  
concentration  administered at Baseline.  
After re -confirmation of the subject meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and prior to dosing, 
each subject will have the upper half of the posterior aspect of the torso divided into two equal  
spaces  using a template and  marking the edges with a medical marking pen.  
There will be two treatment regimens in this study (1 and 2), which will be conducted in parallel. Within each regimen, the four patch areas will be randomized to rHuPH20 or placebo control for  
each subject.  The randomization for Treatment Regimen 1 will be independent of the  
randomization for Treatment Regimen 2; thus, two randomization schemes (one for each 
Treatment Regimen) will be used.  Specifically, for each subject, two random patch areas in 
Treatment Regimen 1 will be assigned rHuPH20; the other two patch areas in Treatment  
Regimen 1 will receive Placebo control.  This same randomization concept will be used in 
Treatment  Regimen 2.  
Treatment  Regimen  1: 
This r egimen will assess the treatment of contact [CONTACT_763653]: At baseline, a single row of  
four patches (1, 2.5, or 5% nickel sulfate patches; determined for each subject during the  
Screening period) will be placed on the upper space on the upper back. After [ADDRESS_1046489] dose of study treatment.  
Treat ment  Regimen  2: 
This regimen will assess the prevention and treatment of contact [CONTACT_763654]. Each  
subject will receive in the center of each lower space on the back, either an ID syringe push  
bolus  injection of  rHuPH20 or placebo control. Exactly  10 minutes  after the injection,  a single

 row of four patches (1, 2.5, or 5% nickel sulfate patches; determined for each subject during the  
Screening period) will be placed over the center of the ID injection. After [ADDRESS_1046490] of 0.25 mL of rHuPH20 (3,000 U) or 0.25 mL of placebo 
contr ol. 
Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will be assessed through physical examinations, signs and 
symptoms  at injection sites, vital signs, and adverse events.  
 
3.2. Duration  Of Time  On Study

Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046510]  Replacement/Completion  Criteria  
Subjects who are not evaluable will be replaced.  An evaluable subject is one who has completed  
dosing (or prematurely discontinued the administration due to a toxicity) and has undergone  
sufficient  assessments to  allow an  assessment of  the tolerability  of the  administration.  
As this study is being conducted at a single site, the site personnel, in conjunction with the  
Sponsor, will make the determination when a subject will need to be replaced in the study. This  
information will be collected on the Enrollment Log. Each subject not meeting the completion 
criteria will be replaced by [CONTACT_763657].  In the event that a subject  
withdraws from the study premat urely or does not meet the completion criteria, every effort will  
be made to document  the reason  for termination  and obtain follow -up safety data.  
 
5.3. Study  Methods  and Procedures  
5.3.1. Informed  Consent  
The Investigator or designee must present and explain the study protocol to prospective study 
subjects prior to any screening procedures. Once the subject has had an opportunity to read the  
IRB-approved ICF, the Investigator  (or designee)  must  be available to answer  any questions  the 
subject  may have  regarding the  study protocol  and procedures.  
 
5.3.2. Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  Review  
Review the inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Section 4.1 and Section 4.2) to ensure the subject  
qualifies  for this study at  the screening  visit.  
 
5.3.3. Demographics  
Collect demographic information, including the subject’s initials, date of birth, gender, race and 
ethnic  origin at  the screening  visit.  
 
5.3.4. Medical  History  
A complete  medical  history will be  collected  at the screening  visit.  
 
5.3.5. Complete Physical  Exam  
Physical examination, including ears/eyes/nose/throat/neck, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular,  
gastrointestinal including mouth, musculo- skeletal, central and peripheral nervous system and  
dermatological  assessments will  be performed  by [CONTACT_763658].  
 
5.3.6. Targeted Physical Exam  
An abbreviated physical exam, reviewing only those body systems for which an abnormality was  
noted during the complete review  of systems or a  follow  up of  previous  physical  exam(s),  will be  
performed by [CONTACT_763659] 1- 7, and at the Follow -up 
Visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  22 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 5.3.7. Vital  Signs  
Assessment of vital signs includes the measurement of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), 
heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_339749] (at screening).  Blood pressure and heart  
rate will be measured with the subject at rest and in supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes prior to  
recording.  Vital signs will be re corded at screening, baseline, prior to injection, immediately 
after each  injection,  and before  discharge.  
 
5.3.8. Pregnancy  Testing  
For females of childbearing potential, serum or urine pregnancy testing will be performed at the  
screening and baseline visits.  
 
5.3.9. Hematology 
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count (differential), and platelet  
count  will be  determined  at the screening  visit.  
 
5.3.10. Study  Drug  Administration  
There will be two treatment regimens in this study (1 and 2), which will be conducted in parallel. Within each regimen, the four patch areas will be randomized to rHuPH20 or placebo control for  
each subject (Figure 1).  The randomization for Treatment Regimen 1 will be independent of the  
randomization for Treatment Re gimen 2; thus, two randomization schemes (one for each 
Treatment Regimen) will be used.  Specifically, for each subject, two random patch areas in 
Treatment Regimen 1 will be assigned rHuPH20; the other two patch areas in Treatment  
Regimen [ADDRESS_1046511] acebo control.  This same randomization concept will be used in 
Treatment  Regimen 2.

 Treatment  Regimen  1 (Spaces  1-4): 
This regimen will assess the treatment of contact [CONTACT_763653]: At baseline, a single row of  
four patches (1, 2.5, or 5% nickel sulfate patches; determined for each subject during the  
Screening period) will be placed on the upper space on the upper back. After [ADDRESS_1046512] dose  
of study treatment.  
Treatment  Regimen  2 (Spaces  5-8): 
This regimen will assess the prevention and treatment of contact [CONTACT_763654]. Each  
subject will receive in the center of each lower space on the back, either an ID syringe push  
bolus injection of rHuPH20 or placebo control. Exactly 10 minutes after the injection, a single  
row of four patches (1, 2.5, or 5% nickel sulfate patches; determined for each subject during the  
Screen ing period) will be placed over the center of the ID injection. After [ADDRESS_1046513] of 0.25 mL of rHuPH20 (3,000 U) or 0.25 mL of placebo 
control. 
 
5.3.11. Determination  of Nickel  Sulfate  Sensitivity  
During the Screening period, subjects will be tested to confirm the presence of cutaneous nickel  
sensitivity  using t he 1, 2.5, and 5%  nickel  sulfate  patch.  The test site will not be in the same area 
where patches will be placed at Baseline.  The concentration of nickel sulfate for each subject  
that causes no greater than a ++ cutaneous reaction ([ADDRESS_1046514] Dermatitis  
Research  Group  [ICDRG11] scoring scale will be  the concentration  administered  at Baseline  
(Day 1).  
 
5.3.12. Nickel  Sulfate Patch  
At baseline the nickel sulfate patch will be applied.  For Treatment reg imen 1, the nickel sulfate  
patches will be applied and the subject will return within [ADDRESS_1046515]-injection  of either rHuPH20 or placebo.  
The concentration of nickel sulfate (1, 2.5, or 5%) will be determined during the Screening 
period. Once the concentration is confirmed, this will be the concentration applied on the subject  
at the baseline visit.  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046516] nickel sulfate concentration.  
The procedure for using the allergy patch system  is found in Appendix C . 
 
5.3.13. Trans -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_763609] (TEWL)  
All measurements should be conducted in an enclosed room in which air movement is  
minimized.  Subjects must equilibrate for 30 minutes prior to testing in the controlled 
environment of 72 plus/minus 2 degrees F and a relati ve humidity (RH) of less than 50% prior to 
measurement reading.  Make sure the skin area to be read is dry and clean.  Press and securely  
hold the evaporimeter probe to the skin surface for [ADDRESS_1046517] data.  
 
5.3.14. Digital  Photographs  
In these clinical photographs, for the duration of the study, the only variable allowed to change is  
the skin condition itself. Therefore, anything extraneous to the condition (jewelry, clothing, 
furniture, walls, etc.) is to be eliminated from the fields to be photographed, from the baseline  
through the final photographs. The necessity of good end- of-study photos should be stressed to 
the subjects to ensure their cooperation. Lighting, framing, exposure and reproduction ratios  
must be held constant. In the end, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_94141] a time -lapse movie. Detailed  
instructions  are found in  Appendix D . 
 
5.3.15. Chromometer 
Make sure the skin area to be read is dry and clean. To collect data, position the device directly 
over the skin area without applying pressure to the skin surface.  Ensure the position of the  
device on the skin is level or parallel with the surface of the skin. Press the trigger once on the  
chromometer.  A reading will be recorded on the program. Data collection should be done by a  
validated  Chromometer Operator only.  
 
5.3.16. Adverse Events  
Each study participant will be carefully monitored for the development of adverse events  
(Section 7 ). 
 
5.3.17. Injection  Site Assessment  
An assessment of local tolerability at the injection site will be performed prior to and [ADDRESS_1046518] be recorded as an adverse event.  Local tolerability will be assessed  
by a qualified person. 
 
5.3.18. Prior/Concomitant  Medications  
Review any concomitant medications the subject is taking at each study visit, beginning [ADDRESS_1046519] of  prohibited medications.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  25 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 5.4. Premature  Termination  of Treatment/Withdrawal  of Subjects  
The Investigator must guard the subject’s welfare and should discontinue study drug treatment at  
any time that this action appears to be in the subject’s best interest.  Subjects may discontinue  
study drug treatment and may withdraw or be removed from the study at any time. Possible  
reasons  for such  actions  may  include, but are not limited to,  the following:  
• The occurrence of serious or unexpected unwanted effects attributable to the study 
drug(s) or study procedure(s)  
• In the event of abnormal laboratory results judged to be related to study drug(s) or  
study procedure(s)  and of clinical significance  
• Any significant protocol  violation  (including demonstrated lack of compliance)  
• Serious  difficulty  in obtaining blood samples  
• Enrolled subject  withdraws  consent  
• Intercurrent  illness  requiring medication  that might interfere with  the study 
• Other  reasons  as deter mined  by [CONTACT_763660] -being may be threatened  by [CONTACT_763661].  
Once a  study subject  has received  study drug under  this protocol, the subject  must  be followed 
for safety as required in the protocol (see Section 7 ). In the event that a study subject  
discontinues treatment prematurely, every effort will be made to document the reason for  
prematu re termination and obtain follow -up safety data.  
Should the  enrollment rate  lag or  significant numbers  of clearly  non- eligible and/or  
non-evaluable subjects be entered in the study, Halozyme may elect to terminate the study at any 
and all investigational s ites. Halozyme also has the right to terminate the study at any time for  
non-adherence to protocol, unavailability of the Investigator or his or her study staff for  
Halozyme or its designated monitoring personnel, or  for administrative  reasons, at any time.

6. STUDY  MEDICATIONS  AND  ADMINISTRATION 
6.1. Study  Medication  
rHuPH20 (recombinant hyaluronidase human injection), also designated as Study Drug, will be  
provided as 12,000 USP units/mL in [ADDRESS_1046520] known as HYLENEX (150 USP units/mL), with 
the exception  that Study Drug  does  not contain  calcium  chloride and disodium  edentate.  
Clinical Study Drug placebo will consist of the same formulat ion of rHuPH20 Clinical Study 
Drug  without  active drug substance.  
The manufacturing and packaging  of the study products  will be in  accordance with  GMP.  
 
6.2. Packaging  and Labeling of Study  Products  
Labeling  of study products  will be in accordance with  local  law and study requirements.  
Blinding of the study products will be done at the investigational site. Before dosing, the  
unblinded person at the investigational site, the pharmacist or designee, will prepare the dosing syringe containing the study products. The pharmacist or designee will give the dosing syringe  
to the physician for dose administration, making sure that the content of the syringe is not  
revealed  to the subject  or the study staff.  
 
6.3. Storage  and Drug  Accountability  of Study  Products  
All study drug products will be stored refrigerated (2ºC to 8ºC) at the Investigator’s site and should not  be exposed to  excessive heat,  direct  sunlight  and never  be frozen.  
All used and unused vials  must  be kept by [CONTACT_763662]  2ºC and 8ºC. 
Used and unused vials must be  stored  separately.  
All study -specific supplies must be kept in a secure area with access limited to only authorized  
clinical  investigation  personnel. 
No study products may be dispensed to any person  not enrolled  in the study. 
In order to ensure that the vials reach room temperature prior to performing the study drug preparation  procedure, they  will be removed  from  the refrigerator /  storage  approximately  
1-[ADDRESS_1046521] randomization number (e.g., subject number) available at the  
time of randomization. 
Replacement subjects will be added if a subject discontinues prior to fulfilling the evaluability criteria ( Section 5.2).  Replacement subjects must always be assigned to the lowest available 
subject  ID number available from  the replacement randomization code.  
 
6.5. Unblinding Procedures  
The randomization code will be kept in a secure, limited- access area, so that no one other than 
the pharmacist or designee preparing the syringes has access.  The rest of the investigational  
staff, the study subjects, and the Sponsor and representatives of the Sponsor will not have access  
to the randomization code until the study as a whole has been unblinded, after the last data have  
been  collected  for the  last subject  in the study.  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046522] and ensure the  
patient’s well- being. If such treatment constitutes a deviation from this protocol, Halozyme must  
be notified and the Investigator should comply with applicable IRB reporting requirements. If 
the pa tient is withdrawn from the study as a result of this AE, the reason will be appropriately 
documented.  
7.1. Adverse  Event  Definitions  
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_763663] U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 1998) and are included herein. The terms  
"serious adverse event" and "adverse event," inserted in parentheses, are commonly used 
terminology. 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal  
relationship  with this treatment.  
Serious adverse drug experience  (serious adverse event, SAE) is any adverse drug experience  
(AE) occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Is fatal or immediately life -threatening (life -threatening is defined as a medical event  
during which the patient is at immediate risk of death f rom the reaction as it occurred;  
it does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have  
caused death);  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], regardless of duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], will be considered as in- patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763631]  a serious  AE. 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disabil ity/incapacity ; 
• Results  in a congenital  anomaly or  birth  defect ; or 
• Is any other Important Medical Event.  Important Medical Events that may not result  
in death, be  life-threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763632], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or  
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65891], or the development of  
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-201 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  29 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 Life-threatening is any adverse drug experience (adverse event) that places the patient or subject, 
in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it  
does not include  a reaction that,  had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might have  caused death.  
Associated with the use of the drug means that there is a reasonable possibility that the  
experience (adverse  event)  may  have  been  caused  by [CONTACT_45821]. 
Unexpected adverse drug experience means any adverse drug experience (adverse event), the  
specificity  or severity  of which  is not consistent  with the current IB.  
 
7.2. Pre-Treatment -Emergent  Adverse  Events  
Halozyme considers AEs that occur between the time the subject signs the informed consent  
document for the study to the time leading up to when that subject is first exposed to study drug 
as “pre- treatment -emergent” events.  All known pre -treatment- emergent AEs  that are serious  
(see Section 7.1) should be immediately reported to Halozyme.  The reason for collection of  
serious pre -treatment -emergent AEs is to allow for an assessment of whether or not the SAE was  
causally associated with any protocol -related activities.  Halozyme does not intend to collect  
information on pre -treatment -emergent AEs that do not meet at least one accepted criterion for a 
serious  classification under the  most  rigid and comprehensive  of the applicable regulatory  
agency criteria  for this study, unless  the event  was related to a study procedure. Events  
occurring during or immediately after first administration of study drug will be considered  
treatment -emergent  AEs and will be  captured on the AE  CRF.  
 
7.3. Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse  Events  
It is anticipated that many laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of a study will be  
encompassed under a reported AE describing a clinical syndrome (e.g., elevated BUN and  
creatinine in the setting of an AE of renal failure, or elevated SGOT/ SGPT in the setting of an 
AE of hepatitis).  In these cases (e.g., an AE of renal failure), the laboratory abnormality itself  
(e.g., elevated creatinine) does not  need  to be recorded  as an AE. 
In the absence of a reported AE identifying a clinical syndrome that encompasses the observed  
laboratory abnormality  that isolated  laboratory abnormality  itself  should  be reported  as an AE if 
it is judged by [CONTACT_763664].  
For the purposes of this study, criteria defining a "clinically significant" laboratory abnormality  
are: 
a. Laboratory abnormality leads to a dose -limiting toxicity (e.g., judged to be associated 
with study drug administration and resulting in study drug dose reduction, suspension  
or discontinuation), or  
b. Laboratory abnormality results in any therapeutic intervention (i.e., concomitant  
medication  or therapy),  or 
c. Other laboratory abnormality judged by [CONTACT_763665].  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046523]  categorize the  severity  of each  AE according  to the following guidelines. 
The level of severity is guided by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria (CTC) for adverse events, which will be provided to each study center and is available  
on line  at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  (CTCAE,  National Cancer  Institute).  
Mild:  
Grade 1 NCI Common Terminology Criteria AE; if not found in the Common Terminology 
tables, an AE that is asymptomatic or barely noticeable to the patient; not interfering with  
patient’s daily activity performance or functioning; generally not requiring alteration or  
cessation of study drug administration; and/or ordinarily not needing therapeutic  
intervention. 
Modera te: 
Grade 2 NCI Common Terminology Criteria AE; if not found in the Common Terminology 
tables, an AE of sufficient severity as to possibly make the patient moderately 
uncomfortable; possibly influencing the patient’s daily activity performance or functioni ng; 
generally  not impairing the patient’s  ability  to continue  in the study;  and/or  possibly needing 
therapeutic intervention.  
Severe:  
Grade 3 or 4 NCI Common Terminology Criteria AE; if not found in the Common 
Terminology tables, an AE generally causing se vere discomfort; significantly influencing the  
patient’s daily activity performance or functioning; generally requiring alteration or cessation 
of study drug administration; life -threatening; resulting in significant disability or incapacity; 
and/or  generally  requiring therapeutic intervention. 
 
7.5. Classification  of Adverse  Events  by [CONTACT_763666]. Investigators will consider  
AEs to be either causally related to the therapy or to be not causally related; the following definitions  apply:  
Causally Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or  
in which the drug level has been established in body fluid or tissue; it follows a known or  
expected pattern of response to the study drug; or it can not be readily explained by [CONTACT_10070] - 
documented concurrent or co -existent pathological processes, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other therapy administered to the subject. A causal relationship may be confirmed by [CONTACT_763667], especially  if the 
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046524].  
Not Causally Related:  
The event does not meet the “causally related” criteria.  The Investig ator should record an 
AE as not causally related if the Investigator concludes that the balance of all available data  
is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_763633]. 
 
7.6. Known  Toxicity  Profiles  of Study  Drugs  
As noted in Section 7.5 the Investigator is expected to make his/her best assessment of the causal  
relationship of each AE in this clinical study.  The Investigator should base the assessment on all  
available information including, but  not limited to,  the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
7.7. Reporting  of Adverse  Events  
For the purpose of this study, all  AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, expectedness, or  
relationship to the study drug, will be collected if the date and time of onset of the AE was after  
the subject’s first exposure to any study drug and through Visit 8 (Day 14 follow up visit). There 
is no time limitation on the reporting of AEs that are treatment- emergent and assessed as  
reasonably associated with study drug (i.e., a drug -assoc iated AE should be reported even if after  
Visit 8).  
Events that occur prior to first study drug administration will be considered pre -treatment-  
emergent because the time of onset preceded the first exposure to study drug (see Section 7.2),  
and these observations will be captured on the patient’s Medical History CRF. Events occurring 
during or after first administration of study drug will be considered treatment -emergent AEs and  
will be  captured  on the  AE CRF.  
Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by [CONTACT_59049]/her designee for  
evidence of AEs.  The questioning of study subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of  
AEs will be generalized such as, “How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  Information 
gathering for AEs should generally not begin with direct solicitation from subjects regarding the  
presence or absence of  specific AEs.  
All serious  AEs  (SAEs) occurring  with any patient participating  in this clinical  study must  be 
immediately  reported  to Halozyme as  described  in Section 7.7.1. 
 
7.7.1. Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Halozyme or designee WITHIN [ADDRESS_1046525] be  
recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Form and faxed along with all available pertinent  
information  to: 
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-201 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  32 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 Halozyme Safety Department 
Fax:  
The minimum required  information  for an initial report  of an  SAE  is: 
1. Reporter’s  name [CONTACT_10780]  [CONTACT_3031], 
2. Protocol number, 
3. Site and patient identification  information, and  
4. The SAE term(s) with a brief summary of the event(s) including the causality assessment, 
if possible. 
 
7.7.2. Duration of Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
Ongoing AEs and laboratory abnormalities that are considered by [CONTACT_763668], returned to pre-study 
drug exposure level, stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator, or later determined by [CONTACT_763669]. Ongoing events and laboratory abnormalities that are considered Not Causally Related to the study drug need only be followed until the patient’s  final study visit (i.e., Visit 8, or earlier  if the  patient is  withdrawn from study). 
 
7.7.3. Other Information on the Reporting of Adverse Events  
Follow-up information regarding serious AEs must be provided to Halozyme promptly as it 
becomes  known to the Investigator. 
The Institutional Review  Board  (IRB) that  approved the clinical investigation  must be notified of 
any fatal, life -threatening and/or serious AEs regardless of cause on a timely basis, according to 
the IRB’s  established  procedures  (see Section 7.7.4). 
A written report of all serious AEs and deaths will be submitted by [CONTACT_763670]. In this report, the Investigator will advise whether or not the AE is judged to be related to the study drug administration. All such subjects with AEs should be followed  
clinically  and by [CONTACT_763671]. 
All AEs, regardless of severity, and whether or not ascribed to the study drug administration, will 
be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
 
7.7.4. Reporting  of Safety  Information to the Ins titutional  Review  Board 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform the study center’s Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) of all SAEs and other safety information in accordance with applicable IRB’s requirements.  At the completion or early termina tion of the study, a final report should be made 
to the IRB  by [CONTACT_763672].  
 
7.7.5. Pregnancy  
A negative pregnancy test during screening for women of childbearing potential and the use of effective contraceptive methods for the duration of the study are required. 

Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046526] be immediately reported to the Investigator and in turn to  
Halozyme (see Section 7.7.[ADDRESS_1046527] informat ion). Pregnancy during the study period will be  
reported and followed until final resolution (i.e., delivery or early termination). Any birth defect  
or congenital anomaly will  be reported to Halozyme  immediately as an  SAE.  
 
7.8. Precautions/Over -Dosage  
Normal  precautions  taken  for a human study, including the  provision of  emergency equipment, 
will be taken during this study. Qualified and well trained physicians and medical staff will 
instruct  the subjects.  
 
7.9. Prior/Concomitant  Medications and Procedures  
Any medication taken during the study other than study drug is regarded as concomitant  
medication.  A history of current medications will be obtained from each subject during 
screening  and recorded  in the  CRF  under  Prior/Concomitant medications.  Subjects  must b e 
queried  regarding both prescription and  over -the-counter  medications  that they  take.  
Prior/Concomitant medications taken during the time period beginning [ADDRESS_1046528] visit on study, anticipated to the be the  follow -up visit, Visit 8,  
will be collected for all subjects.  
Concomitant medications will be updated at each subsequent visit according to the Study 
Schedule of Activities (see Appendix A ), including any medication taken to treat an AE.  At each  
study visit,  subjects  will be asked  if there  has been  any change in the medications  they have  
taken  since their last study visit.  Changes  will be recorded  on the Prior/Concomitant  
Medications  CRF.  
Recording of concomitant medications will include the name [CONTACT_18467], dosage, route,  
frequency,  date of treatment,  and the clinical  indication  for which  the medication  was taken.  
Subjects may receive medical care during the study including but not limited to antibiotics,  
analgesics, antipyretics, etc., when clinically indicated. Whenever possible, the subject should avoid starting any new medications during the treatment period of this study (including over -the- 
counter medications) unless the Investigator dee ms such medication medically necessary.  A list 
of medications prohibited during the study is  provided in  Section 4.[ADDRESS_1046529] comparison of endpoint parameters for the  
injections with and without rHuPH20. The primary analysis is the observer’s assessment of the  
nickel sulfate allergen reaction site.  The ICDRG scoring system wil l be used to conduct this  
assessment, which is either + (Weak [non -vesicular] positive reaction: Erythema, infiltration,  
possibly papules) or ++ (Strong [vesicular] positive reaction: Erythema, infiltration, papules, 
vesicles).  Secondary analysis of the st udy is the comparison of safety and other endpoint  
parameters  for the SC administration  between rHuPH20  and placebo control. 
Dataset  for Analysis  
The primary analysis data set for this study will consist of all evaluable subjects.  An evaluable 
subject  is one who has completed  dosing (or prematurely  discontinued  the administration  due to 
a toxicity) and has undergone sufficient assessments to allow an assessment of the tolerability of  
the administration.  A secondary analysis data set will consist  of all intent- to treat subjects (ITT)  
(i.e., all subjects enrolled, defined as subjects assigned a subject identification number at the time  
of study enrollment in anticipation of receiving a dose of study drug). The safety analysis data 
set is all subjects  exposed to rHuPH20 or placebo  control. 
The hypothesis is that 1) pre -treatment of rHuPH20 prior to nickel allergy testing will decrease  
the severity of the allergic skin reaction as compared to placebo control and 2) rHuPH20 will  
decrease the severity of nickel contact [CONTACT_763673].  The null hypothesis for  
this study is that rHuPH20 will not be different than what will be observed from placebo control. The alternative hypothesis is that  rHuPH20 will be better  than  placebo contr ol. 
The sample  size of  [ADDRESS_1046530] dermatitis scor ing, 
safety data, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Descriptive statistics including the number  
of observations (N), mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be presented for the  
continuous  variables.  Frequency  and percentage will be presented  for categorical variables.  
Figures of the individual measurements over time by [CONTACT_763674].  
Descriptive  statistics  will be used  to summarize  all efficacy  variables.  No formal  statistical 
comparisons  between  treatments  are planned.  
All safety data will be examined, including AEs, physical examination findings, and vital signs. 
The incidence of subjects with AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC)  
and Preferred Term, seriousness, severit y grade, relatedness to study drug, and localization to 
infusion site.  Descriptive statistics  will be  used to summarize  all safety  variables.

voluntary participation in this s tudy. Updated safety information will be provided to the  
Investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and subjects as necessary in order that they may consider relevant and emerging information that could affect their willingness to continue  
participa tion in this study. 
 
9.2. Institutional Review  Board  and Approval  
In accordance with [ADDRESS_1046531] (IRB) with all appropriate material, including a copy of the protocol, 
ICF, IB, and any proposed advertisement  for the  study prior  to the start  of the study. 
The proposed ICF and any proposed advertisement must also be agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]  
(Halozyme).  A copy of the IRB approval letter of the protocol and the ICF must be supplied to 
Halozyme prior to consent of any subjects for the study. A copy of the IRB approval letter of  
any protocol amendments and any advertisements must be supplied to Halozyme prior to 
implementing these documents. The study may not begin screening or enrolling subjects until  
the Investigator has obtained IRB approval of the protocol and ICF and Halozyme has received a  
hardcopy documentation of each.  
The Investigator  will supply to Halozyme a  list of  the names,  professions, and affiliations  of IRB 
mem bers to demonstrate  compliance with  membership requirements. If the Investigator  or a 
sub-investigator is a routine voting member of the IRB, Halozyme will be provided with a  
statement from the IRB that the Investigator/sub -investigator did not and will not vote on the  
subject of this investigation. 
During the course of the study, the Investigator shall make timely and accurate reports to the IRB  
on the progress of the study, at intervals not exceeding one year, as well as satisfying any other  
local IRB regulations regarding reporting. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_763634]. Furthermore, at the completion or early 
termination of the study, a final report should be made to the IRB by [CONTACT_763676].  A copy  of this  report  will be  provided to  Halozyme.  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046532] be approved by [CONTACT_572112] (and may require FDA/other regulatory agency review  
and/or  approval) and must be  approved in writing  by [CONTACT_763677]  
(see Section 9.7 for protocol  amendments).  The Investigator  must  also receive  a written  notice  
of approval from Halozyme prior to initiating the revised changes to the study protocol. A  
protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard may be implemented  
immediately, provided that Halozyme is immediately notified and an amend ment is subsequently 
provided by [CONTACT_763678].  
It is the Investigator's obligation to maintain an IRB correspondence file, and to make this  
available for review by [CONTACT_763679].  
 
9.3. Informed  Consent  
A copy of the proposed ICF document must be submitted to Halozyme for review and comment  
prior  to submission to the reviewing  IRB.  The ICF must  be approved by [CONTACT_763680], state, local, and institutional regulations or  
requirements prior to consenting a subject. Authorization to use or disclose Personal Health Information (PHI) in accordance with requirements of the Health Insurance Portability Act of  
1996 (HIPAA) should be covered in the ICF or in a separate document to be signed by [CONTACT_167801].  
The proposed ICF must contain a full explanation of the purpose and nature of the study, a  
description of the procedures, the possible advantages, risks, alternate treatment options, and a  
statement of confidentiality of subject study records, a statement regarding voluntary compensation and availability of treatment in the case of injury, an explanation of whom to contact [CONTACT_763681] h, the subject’s rights, and notification  that participation is  voluntary 
and refusal will involve no penalty or loss of medical benefits. These requirements are in  
accordance with the U.S. Federal Regulations as detailed in the 21CFR50.[ADDRESS_1046533], or where appropriate,  
legal guardian/representative, permits access to relevant medical records by [CONTACT_1034]  
(Halozyme) and/or the Sponsor's duly appointed agent and by [CONTACT_8233] U.S. Food  
and Drug Administration (FDA) or other applicable regulatory agency and permits their data to be used in publications. 
The Investigator will be responsible for obtaining written informed consent from potential  
subjects  prior  to any study specific screening  and entry  into the study. The research  study will be 
completely explained to each prospective study subject. The Investigator or designee must  
explain that the subject is free to refuse to enter the study, and free to withdraw from it at any  
time for any reason. If new safety information becomes available and results in significant  
changes  in the risk/benefit  assessment,  the ICF should be  reviewed and  updated if necessary.  
Under this circumstance, all subjects (includin g those already being treated) should be informed 
of the new information, given a copy of the revised ICF, and be allowed to re -evaluate their  
consent  to continue  in the study. 
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046534] (and/or legally authorized representative if the sub ject is a minor, mentally  
incompetent or physically incapacitated) found to be eligible for the study must have voluntarily 
provided written informed consent using the IRB -approved ICF prior to screening procedures or  
enrollment in the study (i.e., before performing any protocol -dictated procedures that are not part  
of normal subject care). A copy of the signed and dated ICF document will be provided to the  
subject,  and a copy  will be  maintained  with  the subject's  CRFs,  or in the study documentation. 
The original will be retained by [CONTACT_763682]. The ICF must be in a  
language  that the subject  can read and understand.  
 
9.4. Laboratory Accreditation  
Any laboratory facility intended to be used for analysis of clinical laboratory samples required by  
[CONTACT_763683]. Reference values  
and/or normal ranges for the test results must be provided to Halozyme. Halozyme must be  
notified immediately in writing of  any changes occurring in reference values during the course of  
the study. 
All local  and central  laboratories used  in the study must have, as necessary,  the following. 
• College  of American  Pathologists  (CAP) accreditation,  and/or  
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement  Amendments  (CLIA)  accreditation  
• Listing  of laboratory normal  reference  values  (for all protocol  required  tests)  
• Laboratory license  
• Curriculum  vitae  of laboratory director  may  also be  requested  
9.5. Drug  Accountability 
Upon receipt of study drug(s), the Investigator, pharmacist or qualified designee is responsible  
for taking an inventory of the study drug(s). A record of this inventory must be kept and all  
usage of study drugs must be documented. All vials of study drug, both used and unused, must  
be retained as discussed in Section 6. The investigational drug is to be administered/ prescribed 
only by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_763635]- investigators named 
on the Form FDA 1572. Under no circumstances will the Investigator(s) allow the  
investigational drug to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_3181]. Although appropriate  
personnel may be designated to administer/dispense drug and maintain drug accountability 
records,  the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_763636].  
The Investigator or their designee must maintain accurate records accounting for the receipt of  
the investigational drug supplies and for the disposition of the drug. Documentation of the  
disposition of the drug should consist of a dosing record including the identification of the  
person to whom  the drug is dosed, the quantity and  the date of  dosing, and any unused drug. 
This record  is in addition  to any drug accountability  information  recorded  on the CRFs.  At study 
end, unused drug will be reconciled  with  dosing records.  All unused investigational  drug shall  
be returned to Halozyme upon request  unless otherwise instructed.  A  copy of the reconciled  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046535] at increased risk or the anticipated risk of  
potential benefit outweighs the anticipated risk of potential harm.  All such protocol “waivers”  
must be provided in advance and in writing by [CONTACT_572112], and will be forwarded to the  
Investigator for filing with the subject’s study records. The Investigator must notify the IRB of  
any and all protocol deviations  according to the applicable  IRB policy.  
Written documentation of all major protocol deviations must be kept in the study center file and  
provided to Halozyme.  Examples of possible major protocol deviations include, but are not  
limited  to: 
• failure  to obtain/maintain  approval  for research  
• failure  to obtain required  informed  consent  
• failure  to collect,  report  or file AE reports  
• performance of an unapproved study procedure  
• performance of research  at an unapproved  location  
• failure  to file protocol  modifications,  and failure  to adhere to an approved protocol  
9.7. Protocol  Amendments  
If the protocol is revised, protocol amendments will be prepared and must be approved by  
[CONTACT_572112].  All protocol amendments must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval  
prior to implementation.  However, as discussed in Section 9.2, immediate implementatio n of a  
protocol amendment may be necessary if the nature of the amendment concerns the safety of  
subjects and is required to be implemented on an urgent basis to protect the safety of subjects. 
Any such immediate implementation of protocol amendments must be agreed to in advance and in writing by [CONTACT_572112]. Hard copy documentation of IRB approval must be forwarded to  
Halozyme.  
If an amendment significantly alters the study design, increases potential risk to the subject or  
otherwise affects statements in the ICF, the ICF must be revised accordingly and submitted to the  
IRB for review and approval (see Section 9.3).  The approved ICF must be used to obtain 
informed consent from new subjects prior to enrollment and must be used to obtain informed consent from  subjects  already enrolled  if they  are potentially affected  by [CONTACT_763684].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  39 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 9.8. Data  Collection  and Case  Report  Forms  
In accordance with 21 CFR  312.62, a  case repor t form  (CRF)  must  be completed for  each subject  
enrolled in the study. CRFs are an integral part of the study and subsequent reports. All data  
collected  for each  study subject  will be  recorded  on CRFs  provided or  approved by [CONTACT_572112].  
CRFs need not be completed by [CONTACT_737], but all entries in CRFs are the responsibility of  
the Investigator and entry of CRF data must be made under the supervision of the Investigator.  
CRF completion may be formally delegated to other study personnel.  However, the Sponsor  
(Halozyme) must be informed in writing of the name [CONTACT_763703]. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of  all data  reported in  the CRFs  and all requir ed reports  for each study  subject.  It is 
the obligation of the Investigator to review each page of the CRFs and to sign the designated and  
appropriate CRFs as the study's authority. The Investigator is also responsible for maintaining 
any source documentat ion related to the study, including, but not limited to, any operative  
reports,  laboratory results,  radiographic films, tracings, and computer  discs,  files or tapes.  
CRFs must be completed legibly, preferably with black ballpoint pen. A correction should be  
made by [CONTACT_1022] a single line and entering the correct  
information adjacent to the incorrect entry.  The correction must be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_763685].  Erasure or the use  of correction fluid or film is unacceptable.  
Entries to the CRFs should be made only in the spaces provided, and not in the margins. 
Information that cannot be accommodated by [CONTACT_763686].  
For each study subject, the completed CRFs must be promptly reviewed, and required pages  
signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. The original copy of all CRFs will be reviewed and 
retrieved by [CONTACT_763687]. The Investigator must retain a copy of  
all CRFs.  
 
9.9. Study  Initiation,  Monitoring and Closeout  Visits  and Reports  
Representatives of Halozyme, in conjunction with Study Monitor(s) representing Halozyme, will  
perform a numb er of on -site visits to the study center.  Prior to commencement of the study, 
representatives of Halozyme will visit the study center to ensure adequacy of facilities to conduct  
the protocol, and to discuss with the Investigator the general obligations regarding studies with investigational new drugs. This visit will be documented in a report.  If the study center has  
participated in a clinical study in conjunction with Halozyme within one year, this Pre -Study 
Qualification  visit may be waived . 
Upon satisfactory receipt of all necessary documentation (including, but not limited to, an allowed IND, the Form FDA 1572, an executed Clinical Trials Agreement, and IRB approval of  
the protocol and informed  consent form), Halozyme or  its designee monit or(s) will arrange for  
all study material to be delivered to the study center and for the scheduling of a mutually convenient appointment for a Study Initiation visit. Subject entry must not begin until this  
initiation visit by [CONTACT_763688].  At this meeting, all 
personnel expected to be involved in the conduct of the study should undergo an orientation to include  review  of the study protocol, instruction  for CRF  completion, and overall  responsibilities  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-201 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  40 of 53 Version  1.0 27 May 2009   
 inclu ding those for drug accountability and study file maintenance. This visit will be  
documented in a report.  
Throughout the course of the study, the Halozyme or its designee monitor(s) will make frequent  
contacts with the Investigator. Study Monitors representing Halozyme will visit study centers  
periodically throughout the study for Routine Monitoring visits. The Study Monitor will review  
CRFs to verify that they are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documents. They will  
also verify  the rights  and well-being of  the study subjects  are protected  and that the study 
conduct is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and 
with the applicable regu latory requirements. As part of the data review it is expected that source  
documents (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office records) will be made available for review by [CONTACT_763689](s). The study and its monitors may also be similarly evaluat ed by  
[CONTACT_763690]. For these purposes, the Investigator will make CRFs, source  
documents and study files available when requested. A report will be generated for each  
monitoring visit.  
At fulfillment of subject enrollment, each Investiga tor will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_572112].  
The study will be terminated and the study center closed when all completed original CRFs have  
been collected, all data discrepancies resolved, and drug accountability has been reconciled.  A 
Closeout visit will be scheduled for study centers that enrolled at least one subject, during which Halozyme or its representative will review all informed consents, CRFs, drug accountability  
records, and other study- related documents.  Halozyme or its representative will hold  a final  
meeting with the Investigator and study staff to explain procedures for record retention, publication policy, site audit notification, and financial disclosure. A final letter to the site will record  the events of this  closeout  visit.  Study- closure activities will be  documented in a  report.  
It will be the responsibility of the Investigator to notify the IRB that the study has been  
completed  (see Section  9.11).  
The Sponsor (Halozyme) has the right to terminate the study for non- adherence to protocol,  
unavailability of the Investigator or his or her study staff for Halozyme or its designee  
monitoring personnel, or for administrative reasons, at any time. In that event, Halozyme will 
notify each Investigator i n writing that the study is to be discontinued. The Investigator will  
comply with Halozyme’s written instructions for study discontinuation, which will include the  
following:  
• Date discontinuation will occur  
• Rationale for discontinuation 
• Instructions  on how  discontinuation is to be performed 
• Instructions  for subjects  participating  in the study 
• Instructions  for retention  of study documents  
In addition to monitoring by [CONTACT_572137], the study may be audited by [CONTACT_763691] (FDA), who will also be allowed access to study documents. The Investigator  should immediately  notify the Clinical Research  Department  
at Halozyme of  any proposed or  scheduled audits  with  any regulatory a uthorities.  
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046536] be retained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited 
to, the following. 
• Protocol  and all protocol  amendments  
• All signed versions of the Statement  of Investigator, Form  FDA 1572  
• All drug accountability  records  
• All IRB  approvals, correspondence and reports  
• Signed and dated  informed  consent  forms  for each  subject  
• Completed  CRFs for each subject  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_763637]  
• Any advertisements for  this study  
• The Investigator’s  final report  to the IRB 
• Source documents pertaining to the study, including, but not limited to, any operative  
reports, laboratory results, radiographic films, tracings, and computer discs, files or  
tapes  
The period of time these documents must be maintained is governed by U.S. law and, when applicable, non- U.S., regulations. Some countries require these documents to be maintained for  
15 years  or longer. All records  are to  be retained  by [CONTACT_741650] a minimum of fifteen  
(15) years after the FDA has approved the new drug application, or after the Sponsor (Halozyme)  
has notified the Investigator in writing that all investigations of the drug have been discontinued.  
However,  because  of international  regulatory  requirements,  Halozyme  may request  retention  for 
a longer period of time. Therefore, Halozyme or its designee will  inform the Investigator when 
these documents may be destroyed. The Investigator must obtain written approval from the  
Halozyme prior  to destruction of  any records.  
The Investigator must advise Halozyme in writing if  the records are to be moved to a location  
other than the Investigator’s archives. If the Investigator leaves the institution or study center,  
the records shall be transferred to an appropriate designee, at the study center, who assumes the  
responsibility for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be documented in writing and 
provided to Halozyme.  
In the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records, the Investigator will  
immediately  notify Halozyme in  writing.  Halozyme or  its designee must  be notified  in writing  at 
least 30 days prior  to the intended date of disposal  of any study records  related  to this protocol. 
 
9.11. Investigator’s Final Report  
Shortly after completion of the Investigator’s participation in the study, the Investigator will 
submit a written report to Halozyme.  This report may be a copy of the Investigator’s end- of- 
study report  to their IRB,  which  will include, but  not be  limited to;  notification that the  study has

APPENDIX  C. NICKEL  SULFATE  ALLERGY  SYSTEM  
Application  for Nickel  Sulfate  Concentration  Determination : 
 
Preparing  Patch:  
Place a filter paper disc in the chamber and moisten thoroughly with the 1%, 2.5% or 5% nickel  
sulfate solution. 
Applying Patch:  
1. Skin should be clean, healthy, and free of ointments, lotions, powders, acne, dermatitis, 
scars, hair or any other condition that might interfere with the application of the chamber or  
interpretation  of the results.  
2. The subject  should stand  or sit in a relaxed  position. Apply prepared  patches  to the back.  
3. Affix tape to the skin at the lower end and slowly roll patches up the back, pushing out air. 
Gently press patch to skin to ensure an even distribution of allergens. Rub the tape gently but  
firmly  to en sure good adherence.  
4. Mark the four corners of each unit with Chemotechnique Skin Markers to indicate each 
unit’s  location  on the  subject’s  skin. 
5. Subjects should refrain from exposing patch tests to excess moisture or sweat and should 
return for patch test removal in [ADDRESS_1046540] in the source documentation the location of the patch and the nickel sulfate  
concentration  for each location. 
Removing Patch:  
After 48 hours, remove the patch. The initial visual patch imprint on the patien t's back indicates  
excellent occlusion. 
Reading  the Results:  
1. Allow about [ADDRESS_1046541] 
results  (Appendix B ).

Digital Format Photographic Considerations : Each memory card will contain one patient  
photo session.  
Procedure:  
In these clinical photographs, for the duration of the study, the only variable allowed to change is  
the skin condition itself. Therefore, anything extraneous to the condition (jewelry, clothing, 
furniture, walls, etc.) is to be eliminated from the fields to be photographed, from the baseline  
through the final photographs. The necessity of good end- of-study photos should be stressed to 
the patients to ensure their cooperation. Lighting, framing, exposure and reproduction ratios must  
be held constant. In  the end, the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_763642] a time-lapse movie. 
1. The supplied equipment is to be used exclusively for this study. Modifications, adjustments  
or repairs of the camera equipment are not to be  undertaken without the expressed instruction 
of Canfield Scientific, Inc.  
2. After obtaining informed consent, the patients are prepped for photography. All jewelry, makeup and clothing are to be removed from the photographic field prior to photography. Target area(s) are identified for photos. The supplied standardized blue deluxe felt  
background is to be used  for the  photographs. Do not use folded or crimped material.  
3. Magnifications for digital camera: A standardized reproduction ratio (35MM film equivalent)  
of 1:3 (red index on lens focusing barrel) is used for the target area close -up views. Focusing 
at 1:3 is accomplished with the use of the mm scale arm attachment dictating distance. A  
standardized reproduction rat io of 1:9 (green index on lens focusing barrel) is used for the  
target area anatomical views. Focusing at 1:9 is accomplished by [CONTACT_763698]/lens  
close to/away  from  the target  area until  it is in focus. 
4. Apertures for digital camera: Each and every ta rget area close- up view is taken at f/22. Each 
and every  target  area anatomical  location  view  is taken  at f/16. 
5. SD is the media format used to capture images. If there is any doubt as to the correctness of  
technique  or data, re -shoots  are strongly urged. 
Halozyme  Therapeutics,  Inc. Protocol  HALO -114-[ADDRESS_1046543] at every photographic session  includes an  exposure series  of: 
a. Two exposures of patient’s ID card which includes the following legible information in 
black indelible ink: Protocol No. Date Investigator Number Visit Week Number Patient's  
Initials  Patient's ID Number Photographer's Initials  Color card  
b. Two exposures of close -up view  of target  area(s)  
c. Two exposures of anatomical  location  view  of target  area(s)  
7. Upon completion of the photographic session, the contents of the S D memory card are  
uploaded to the Canfield Clinical Website once a patient’s photographic session has been 
recorded on it. A secure, validated, compliant web server set up at Canfield is used for this 
secure transfer of study images by [CONTACT_8979]. Images are transferred the day recorded.  
Remote access to all images by [CONTACT_763699]. Only approved individuals by 
[CONTACT_763700].  
8. Upon a successful upload of all images contained on the SD memory card, the memory 
card’s images are deleted and the memory card re-used for the next photographic session. 
These memory cards are reserved for use on this project only. Any doubt as to the 
correctness  of technique or data warrants  a re-shoot then  and there.  
9. All images are monitored for technical adherence according to Canfield’s internal SOPs. The 
study site is contact[CONTACT_763701]. All communication  to the study  site relating  to the photography is  the responsibility  of Canfield. 
10. All supplied photographic equipment and photographic originals remain the property of the sponsor. One set of photography result report forms for all photographic time-points is supplied for the Investigators' study records.  
11. Questions or problems regarding the photographic portion of this study protocol should be directed  to the respective  Canfield  Project Manager assigned  to the study.

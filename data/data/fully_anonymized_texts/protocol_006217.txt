7 Study Summary  
 This is a single arm phase II study to evaluate the activity of the multi-targeted inhibitor cabozantinib (with activity against MET, VEGFR2, TIE2, RET, AXL and KIT) in endometrial cancer (with a dual primary endpoint of improved response rate and 12-week progression- free-
survival (PFS)). Cabozantinib co- mines the simultaneous targeting of epi[INVESTIGATOR_755355]. Correlative studies include evaluation of mutational profiles and met amplification status  as baseline molecular predictors of 
response.  Eligible patients include those with serous  or endometroid histology endometrial cancer with 
radiographic disease progression after one line of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease or with progression wit hin 12 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and 
radiation administered in the adjuvant setting will be allowed as well as prior hormonal manipulation. In addition, a separate cohort of patients with unusual histology endometrial cancer (including clear cell, carcinosarcoma) will also be accrued  applying same eligibility 
criteria. The statistical plan to assess efficacy will only apply to the experimental cohort (serous and endometroid histology patients).   Dosing of cabozantinib will be continuous (7 days a week) on a [ADDRESS_1033957] (Study Schema).  
 Statistical plan is based on efficacy in serous  and endometroid histology endometrial cancer. A 
modified Simon two -stage design is planned with a maximum accrual of 36 patients  per 
histological cohort (i.e. 72 patients in total) to discriminate between co -primary endpoints of 
tumor response rates of 30% vs. 10% and 12-week progression- free-survival (PFS) rates of 55% 
vs. 30% (corresponding to median PFS of 3.4 vs. 1.7 months). Stage I has a planned accrual of 18 patients per histological group. If no more than 2 objective responses (no more than 11%), and no more than 6 instances of 12-week PFS (no more than 33%), are observed among the 
initial [ADDRESS_1033958] 8 objective 
responses (at least 22%), or at least 16 instances of 12- week PFS (at least 44%) are observed 
among the 36 evaluable patients, this agent would be considered w orthy of further testing in that 
particular  histological subgroup of endometrial cancer. 
 Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE v 5.0.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
 Endometrial  Cancer: Epi[INVESTIGATOR_755357] 4th most common cancer diagnosis in North American women less frequent only to diagnoses of breast, lung and colorectal cancer. In 2012, approximately 5600 more women will be diagnosed with, and 900 will die of this disease in Canada. US statistics parallel those of Canada with an approximately 10- fold difference [1, 2]. 
 The main risk factor for the development of endometrial cancer continues to be prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen. Other identified risk factors (nulliparity, use of taxomifen, hormone replacement therapy etc) are likely relevant due to the pathology- promoting imbalance 
of estrogen/progesterone they create. The ever growing obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_755358] a major contributing factor to the burden of disease we currently see related to endometrial cancer.  
 Uterine cancer is predominantly a disease of older women who present with aberrant post-menopausal bleeding as the first symptom of their disease. The majority of women are diagnosed with early stage disease and have a relatively good prognosis, with 5- year disease- free survivals 
of greater than 80%. Surgery continues to be the mainstay of managemen t; however both 
chemotherapy and radiation have demonstrated utility at reducing the risk of local and distant disease recurrence and have now become standard practice. Unfortunately a not insignificant percentage of women with early stage disease are at a greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_755359]. Factors like age > 60, depth of invasion, involvement of lower uterine segment, non-endometroid histology and the presence of lymphovascular invasion or aneuploidy, have demonstrated importance in identifying  those at a particularly high risk of failing primary

11 therapy [3, 4]. These women, together with those with more advanced disease at initial presentation have a relatively poor prognosis, and in contrast with the high [ADDRESS_1033960] about a 20% chance of the same. There is significant heterogeneity within this group as patients with endometroid histology cancer tend to have more slow-growing disease that may respond to hormonal manipulation while patients with high grade serous cancers follow a more aggressive course and benefit from a limited number of cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The best responses are to agents like doxorubicin and cisplatin which are still modest and in the range of 20 to 40% and where noted are transient in duration [3, 5]. Although combination regimens have demonstrated higher response rates, given their increased toxicities and unclear impact on survival their use in the palliative setting of these patients is unclear [6].  
 Relevance of Histopathology and Molecular Characterization 
 Endometrial cancers encompass a broad range of tumour histologies. The majori ty of patients 
close to 80%, are diagnosed with endometroid adenocarcinomas also known as Type I cancers. These are the traditional uterine cancers characterized by [CONTACT_755380] a relatively indolent course, developi[INVESTIGATOR_755360]. The Type II or non-endometroid histology endometrial cancers follow a very different clinical course. The most common histology in this uncommon group is the serous histology cancers which in spi[INVESTIGATOR_755361] a similar context to serous ovarian cancers, have demonstrated an inferior clinical course matched stage- for-stage. This group also includes clear cell, carcinosarcoma an d 
stromal sarcomas albeit at much lower frequencies all with their own unique clinical and molecular profiles. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_755362] a small proportion of all uterine cancers, non-endometroid histology cancers account for about 50% cases of recurrent dise ase and therefore 
represent a significant management challenge [3].   Apart from their distinctive clinical trajectories, the different histologies of endometrial cancer also have somewhat divergent molecular backgrounds suggesting a dualistic model of endometrial carcinogenesis that is especially relevant in the context of developi[INVESTIGATOR_755363]. Endometroid cancers tend to be low grade (grade 1) occurring on a background of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_755364]. They express both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors and demonstrate loss of PTEN tumour suppressor gene (with uninhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway), mutation in KRAS and defects in DNA damage mismatch repair pathways. Serous endometrial cancers are exclusively high grade arising on a background of atrophy, tend to be non-diploid karyotype, ER/PR negative and demonstrating loss of p53 and activation of Her2/neu [3] . Molecular profiles of clear cell and carcinosarcoma 
have been less well evaluated an d these appear to be a somewhat heterogenous group of diseases 
in their own right [7].  
 
Given the heterogeneity inherent in this patient population with respect to both clinical course and therapeutic respon se, there is optimism that novel approaches aimed specifically at 
differential vulnerabilities within different molecular subgroups of this disease will improve outcomes for patients with endometrial cancer. [8]

 XL-184 (Cabozatinib) 
 Characterization of XL-184 and rationale for HGF targeting in cancer  XL184 (cabozantinib) inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011). The primary targets of XL184 are MET (c-MET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2); additional targets include RET, AXL, KIT, and TIE-2. Both c-Met and VEGFR2 are important mediators of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis, and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of XL184 against c-Met and VEGFR2 has been demonstrated in preclinica l and clinical studies.  
 RTKs regulate numerous processes including cell growth and survival, organ morphogenesis, neovascularization, and tissue repair [9]. Dysregulation of RTKs by [CONTACT_147844], gene rearrangement, gene amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and ligand have all been implicated as causative factors in the development and progression of numerous human cancers. The RTK c -Met, encodes the high- affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or scatter 
factor (SF) [9]. c -Met and HGF are each required for normal mammalian development and have 
been shown to be important in cell migration, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of three-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular cells, gland formation, etc.), as well as cell growth, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Upregulation of MET is found in a wide range of malignancies including thyroid, prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancers, and is associated with more aggressive and invasive phenotypes of cancer cells in vitro and metastases in vivo (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011). c- Met-driven metastasis may be exacerbated 
by a number of factors, including tumor hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_408229].  Evidence linking c- Met and HGF  as causative or progression factors in human cancers include: 
(1) Overexpression of both receptor and ligand in neoplasms relative to surrounding tissues; (2) Correlation of receptor and ligand overexpression with disease severity and outcome; (3) Genetic alteration of c -Met by [CONTACT_408230]; (4) Introduction 
of c-Met and HGF (or mutant c-Met) into cell lines, conferred the properties of tumorgenicity 
and metastatic propensity on engineered cells; (5) Introduction of c -Met or HGF as transgenes 
into the germline of mice resulted in primary and secondary neoplasms; and (6) Inhibition of c-Met or HGF function with dominant-negative receptors, antibody antagonists (both Met and HGF), and biologic antagonists (e.g., NK4) have reversed cancer -associated phenotypes such as 
motility, invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, and tumor growth and dissemination in vivo [9]. 
 A wide variety of human cancers, including brain, colorectal, gastric, and lung, demonstrate dysregula ted c -Met activity [10], either by [CONTACT_3553] c-Met kinase overexpression [11]; activating 
c-Met gene mutations and/or amplification [11 -13]; or increased autocrine and/or paracrine 
secretion of the c-Met ligand, HGF/SF [14, 15]. These alterations have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, and a high constitutive activation of c- Met has been correlated with 
poor clinical prognosis [14].

13 VEGFR2 is the predominant mediator of VEGF- stimulated endothelial cell migration, 
proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular permeability [16]. Increased expression of VEGFR2, often in combination with VEGFR3, has been observed in the tumor vascular endothelium in most common human solid tumor types, on tumor cells in melanoma and hematological malignancies,  and in colitis -associated colon cancer [17]. High VEGFR2 
expression is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and correlated with triple -negative (i.e., therapy-resistant) breast cancer and poor survival. 
 Nonclinical Devel opment of XL184   
 
In Vivo Activity 
Inhibition of VEGF signaling pathway was previously shown to result in more invasive tumors in the transgenic RIP-Tag2 mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer that spontaneously develops aggressive tumors (Paez-Ribes et al., 2009). In RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice, tumors treated with XL184 were smaller (P <0.05) than in mice treated with vehicle or an anti -VEGF 
antibody, but were also less invasive (P <0.05) and had no liver metastases [18]. All mice treated with XL184 (n = 6) survived until 20 weeks, but none treated with vehicle (n = 14) or anti- VEGF 
antibody (n = 8) reached that endpoint. Tumor vascularity decreased after treatment, with reductions ranging from 67% at 3 mg/kg to 83% at 30 mg/kg for 7 days [19]. Tumors were 35% smaller after XL184 treatment than corresponding values for vehicle control mice. c-Met protein expression in tumors was slightly decreased, but phosphorylated c- Met was markedly reduced 
after treatment for 7 days.   Mice bearing MDA -MB-231 cel ls (expressing MET and VEGF) were administered four oral 
doses of 100 mg/kg [20]. XL184 increased tumor hypoxia (13-fold) and apoptosis (TUNEL; 2.5-fold) at [ADDRESS_1033961] and second doses, respectively, when compared to vehicle-treated tumo rs. In addition, XL184 disrupted tumor vasculature by [CONTACT_755381]. XL184 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition of MDA- MB-231 tumors (P <0.001) at all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) 
when compared to vehicle-treated tumors. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses (P <0.01), and complete inhibition was observed at the 30 and 60 mg/kg doses. A single 100 mg/kg dose resulted in sustained MDA- MB-231 tumor growth inhibition for ~8 
days after which tumors began growing at a rate similar to vehicle -treated control tumors. In 
addition, XL184 inhibited tumor growth (P <0.001) in the MET- expressing rat C6 glioma cell 
line for all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared with vehicle-treated tumors. The 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses resulted in significant tumor regression (62% and 85%, P <0.0001) when compared with predose tumor weights. Subchronic administration of XL184 was well tolerated in mice and rats  with no signs of toxicity, as determined by [CONTACT_408232]/or increasing 
body weights during the treatment period.  ARCaP -M is a human prostate cancer model which expresses both c- Met and VEGF co -receptor 
NP-1 used in a human prostate tumor xenograft study in mouse bone [21] (Zhang et al., 2010). 
ARCaP -M cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice on Day 1, and on D ay 31 animals with 
established bone lesions were randomized to receive XL184 or vehicle daily (qd) for 7 weeks of treatment (Investigator’s brochure, 2011). Tibiae from vehicle- treated animals exhibited both 
osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions, whereas tibiae from XL184 treated animals appeared mostly

14 normal. Thus, XL184 treatment blocked both osteoblastic and osteolytic progression of ARCaP-M xenograft tumors in bone.  
Nonclinical Pharmacodynamics  
In mice, the effective dose resulting in 50% inhibition (ED 50) of targets was achieved at well 
tolerated doses of XL184 and at plasma exposures comparable to exposure observed in clinical trials (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010). XL184 produced prolonged inhibition of receptor phosphorylation, such as sustained inhibition of c-Met and VEGFR2 for 10 hours after administration of a single dose of XL184. This extended inhibition occurred in a manner that was generally predicted by [CONTACT_408233], i.e., inhibition was diminished when plasma levels fell below approximate ly 20 μM for c -Met, 5 μM for VEGFR2, and 23 μM for TIE -2. 
 Once daily administration of XL184 resulted in significant inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in TT tumors, relative to tumors from vehicle control- treated mice, with maximal inhibition of 
70% seen at 60 mg/kg, [22]. Dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of c- Met and RET 
was observed among the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose groups as well.   c-Met phosphorylation was inhibited by a single 100 mg/kg oral dose of XL184, 2–[ADDRESS_1033962] dose in H441 tumors (human lung papi[INVESTIGATOR_448553]) that harbor constitutively phosphorylated c- Met [20]. This effect was reversible, as c-Met phosphorylation returned to 
basal levels by 48 hours after treatment.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
In the various xenograft models, plasma exposures were similar and plasma concentrations in the range of 3 to 27 μM were associated with efficacy [22]. In rats, plasma concentrations in the range of 5 to 15 μM were associated with maximal anti -tumor activity. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755365], trough concentrations as low as 0.1 μM were observed at highly efficacious doses in mice. These results were consistent with in vivo target modulation studies in mice which demonstrated long (4- to 10-hour) durations of action, and indicated that continuous high exposure was not required to maintain efficacy.   Dose proportional increases in exposure occurred at oral doses of 3–100 mg/kg in mice and at 3–30 mg/kg in rats (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010). In rats, the oral bioavailability of XL184 dosed as a solid was approximately 100% of XL184 dosed as a liquid. In comparison, oral bioavailability was much lower in dogs (20%) and monkeys (18%) for the solid versus liquid dosage forms.  Systemic drug exposure parameters (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax] and area under the time-concentration curve from [ADDRESS_1033963]- dose [AUC0 -t] values) associated with single 
XL184 oral doses in rats increased less than dose-proportionally with increasing dose (100–900 mg/k g) [22]. With repeat daily oral dosing in rats, systemic exposure (AUC0- t values) increased 
generally dose -proportionally following 14 and 178 dosing days (dose ranges 1–15 mg/kg/day 
and 0.1–1 mg/kg/day, respectively). The Cmax and AUC0- t values in rats ad ministered 100 
mg/kg were approximately 2 -fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, than for dogs given 2000 
mg/kg; therefore, the higher systemic exposure to XL184 in rats correlated with the greater toxicity observed in this species at lower administered dos es. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
15 Systemic drug exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0 -t values) associated with single XL184 
oral doses in dogs increased less than dose-proportionally with increasing XL184 dose (400–2000 mg/kg), suggesting possible saturation of systemic absorption [23]. With repeat daily 
dosing, exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24 values) both increased greater than dose-proportionally from 10 to 100 mg/kg and less than dose proportionally from 100 to 1000 mg/kg following 14 dosing days.   
Toxicology 
In rodents and non-rodents, histopathological changes associated with XL184 administration were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and adrenal and reproductive tract tissues [23]. Histopathological changes present in the bone and pancreas were considered secondary to XL184 administration. Adverse effects following oral exposure to 
XL184 were generally dose -related, clinically monitorable, and self -resolving upon 
discontinuation of dosing. In 6-month chronic toxicity studies, treatment- related  changes were 
present only in kidney (rats) and reproductive tissues (dog). In reproductive/developmental toxicity studies, XL184 administration resulted in decreased fertility in male and female rats, in embryotoxicity when given to pregnant rats, and in a visceral tissue malformation (small spleen) when given to pregnant rabbits. The no-observable-adverse- effect -levels (NOAELs) for the 
chronic toxicity and reproductive/developmental toxicity studies occurred at plasma exposures (AUC) below steady -state values measured in subjects with solid tumors administered 175 mg 
XL184 capsule form daily (Study XL184-001).  In definitive genotoxicity bioassays, XL184 was negative in an S. typhimurium / E.coli bacterial mutagenicity study, an in vitro chromosome aberration study using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus study (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010). In safety pharmacology studies, no adverse effects occurred on neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_408177]184- treated rats or on cardiovascular function in XL184- treated dogs.  
 Clinical Experience  As of May 4, 2011, [ADDRESS_1033964] been studied in 12 ongoing Exelixis-sponsored clinical trials with XL184 treatment 1) as a single agent at does ranging from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an intermittent dosing schedule, 2) from 25 to 265 mg (19.7-209 mg freebase equivalent weight) on a fixed daily dosing schedule and 3) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT), or with erlotinib (Exelixis Communication,  2011). The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) on once daily (qd) by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) dosing schedule was determined to be 175 mg L-malate salt (or approximately 138 mg freebase equivalent weight).  
 Detailed information for each of these studies, including pharmacokinetic data, can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (2011). Safety and efficacy information, from the 2011 Investigator’s Brochure, is summarized below.

16 Phase I Studies  
Study XL184-001 was a phase 1 dose- escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Eighty -five 
subjects, across 13 dosing levels (DL) ranging from 0.08 mg/kg qd (using powder -in-bottle [PIB] 
suspension on a 5 days on, 9 days off schedule) to 265 qd were enrolled. Capsule dose levels were 175mg qd and 250mg qd (using capsules [25 and/or 100mg] for two, 14- day cycles). The 
capsule MTD was determined to be 175 mg qd (Kurzrock et al., 2011). Of the 35 subjects with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and measureable  disease, 10 (29%, 95% CI) had confirmed 
partial responses (cPR) (with a duration up to 48+ months), 17 (49%) had tumor shrinkage of ≥30%, and stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months was observed in 15/37 (41%) of the MTC subjects.   In Study XL184-002, t reatment of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) consisted of 
cabozantinib in combination with TMZ with or without radiation therapy. Enrollment has been terminated and no clinical efficacy data is presented in the 2011 Investigator’s Brochure. All adverse events (AEs) were assessed with respect to combination treatment and not the individual components. Nineteen patients were evaluated for AEs, the most common grade 3 or higher included neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (16%), leucopenia (16%), and hypertension (11%). Myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, is a dose- limiting toxicity (DLTs) 
associated with TMZ use. The frequency at which bone marrow toxicity was observed in this study is consistent with the TMZ prescribing information.   Study XL184-[ADDRESS_1033965] ([ADDRESS_1033966]) or Reference (175 mg cabozantinib, dosed as one 100 mg capsule and three 25 mg capsules under fasting conditions). Blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_1033967] after each treatment to assess plasma cabozantinib pharmacokinetics. See “Pharmacokinetics” section for results.  
 Study XL184-[ADDRESS_1033968] 
crossover comparative bioavailability study of cabozantinib tablet and capsule formulations in healthy volunteers. Subjects received single oral doses of the assigned treatment of Tes t (100 mg 
cabozantinib, dosed as one 100 mg tablet) or Reference (100 mg cabozantinib, dosed as two 50 mg capsules), according to a randomization scheme. Each dosing was administered under fasting conditions, and blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_1033969] after 
each treatment to assess plasma cabozantinib PK. See “Pharmacokinetics” section for results.  
 In Study XL184- 008, subjects with advanced solid tumors (particularly renal cell carcinoma 
[RCC] and differentiated thyroid cancer [DTC]) are evaluated for any potential clinically significant drug -drug interaction of cabozantinib on the CYP isozyme CYP2C8. The effect of qd 
dosing of [ADDRESS_1033970] common grade 3 or higher AEs were fatigue (9%), 
hypophosphatemia (27%), blood amylase increase (9%), and hyponatremia (9%).

[ADDRESS_1033971] was enrolled as of May 2011 at 50 mg PO qd.  
 Study XL184-202 was a phase 1b/2 trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib and erlotinib administered in combination in non- small- cell lung can cer (NSCLC) subjects. Of 
the 64 subjects enrolled in the phase 1 dose -escalation portion of the study, all but two had been 
previously treated with and progressed on erlotinib therapy. A cPR was observed in 5 subjects (8%) and 24 subjects (37%) had SD/PR ≥ [ADDRESS_1033972] common grade 3 or higher AEs in 
the phase 1 portion included diarrhea (44%), fatigue (22%), hypokalemia (11%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnea (14%), lipase increase (6%), hypomagnesemia (6%), and dehydration (5%). Twenty -eight subjects  were enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study, in which subjects 
who had received clinical benefit from erlotinib and subsequently experienced progressive disease (PD), received single- agent cabozantinib or cabozantinib with erlotinib. AEs ≥grade 3 
included dehydration (8%) and hypertension (8%). One patient, who was treated with single-
agent cabozantinib, had a cPR.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1033973] or second 
relapse were enrolled to receive cabozantinib qd as a single agent. Group A received an initial dose of 175 mg (Group A), subsequent cohorts (Groups B and C) received an initial dose of 125 mg. Forty -six subjects were enrolled in Group A, and a total of 176 subjects were enrolled in 
Groups B/C. Fifty- seven subjects experienced one or more serious adverse events (SAEs) that 
were assessed to be related to treatment, including five fatal related.  
 Study XL184- 203 is a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial. Subjects are enrolled into one of 
nine tumor- specific cohorts: breast cancer, gastric / gastroesophageal (GEJ) cancer, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Eligible subjects with advanc ed solid tumors receive 
open- label cabozantinib at starting dose of [ADDRESS_1033974] or second relapse. Subjects received one of four regimens: 25 mg qd (Arm 1) continuously, 75 mg qd (Arm 2) continuously, 125 mg qd for 2 weeks followed by 50 mg qd continuously (Arm 3), and 125 mg qd on an intermittent 3 week on/1 week off schedule (Arm 4). A total of [ADDRESS_1033975] experienced an SAE assessed to be related to 
treatment with cabozantinib.   
Phase 3 Studies 
Study XL184- 301 is a blinded, randomized control trial for subjects with unresectable, locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC, randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib or placebo. SAEs reported in 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
18 Study XL184-301 are: one grade 4 reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), one grade [ADDRESS_1033976] following asystolic vagal reaction after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_528893], and three SAEs of acquired  trachea-esophageal fistula (two grade 3, one grade 5). 
 
Adverse Events  
The clinical studies with XL184 are ongoing and thus the AE data from the clinical database as of March 1, 2011 and May 4, 2011 do not yet include all SAEs (Exelixis Communication, 2011). As of March 2011, AE data are available for [ADDRESS_1033977] been dosed with XL184 (806 in single-agent studies and 107 in combination studies of XL184 with erlotinib, rosiglitazone, or TMZ ± radiation) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011). Data from t he [ADDRESS_1033978] frequently (>20%) observed AEs regardless of causality were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, constipation, palmar -
plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, vomiting, dysphonia, and hypertension. Effects that may be related to the inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, thromboembolic events, GI perforation, fistula formation, hemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and proteinuria, have been observed in the single-agent and combination XL184 studies. The most commonly reported SAEs that were assessed as related to study treatment with XL184 (as a single-agent or combination) were pulmonary embolism (PE), diarrhea, dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, wound dehiscence, and PPE syndrome.  There have been 15 grade 5 AEs related to study treatment: GI hemorrhage (two subjects), PE (two subjects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (two subjects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447] (one subject), hemoptysis (one subject), death due to unknown cause (two subjects), intracranial hemorrhage (one subject), intestinal perforation (one subject), enterocutaneous fistula (one subject), hemorrhage (presumed to be hemoptysis; one subject), and diverticular perforation, peritonitis (one subject) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic analysis of 74 patients in trial XL184-001 showed dose proportional increases in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUC both for PIB (dose range 0.08-11.52 mg/kg)  and the capsule formulation (dose range: 175 and 250 mg qd) (Kurzrock, 2011). 
Terminal -phase half -life (t1/2,z) values were 59.1 to 136 hours (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011). 
After repeat dosing, t1/2,z values (mean ± standard deviation) for XL184 were 91.3 ± 33.3 hours (n = 23), and apparent steady-state plasma levels were reached by [CONTACT_2006] 15 (Kurzrock, 2011). Steady -state clearance for the 175 mg capsule dose derived from repeat dose data was 4.2 ± 1.5 
L/h. Patients who received 175 mg capsules had four- to five-fold higher steady- state exposure 
(AUC) compared with Day 1 (7.68 ± 2.85 mcg∙h/mL; n = 23 vs. 41.6 ± 15.3 mcg∙h/mL; n = 23), indicating that XL184 accumulated with repeat daily dosing. There was no significant difference in exposure between patients with MTC and those without MTC.  Based on the preliminary PK data from 23 subjects in XL184-005 who completed both treatments, after a single oral dose of cabozantinib at 100 mg, the terminal t1/2, z of cabozantinib appeared to be similar for both tablet and capsule formulations, with approximately mean values of 110 hours (Exelixis Communication, 2012). The median time to the maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was [ADDRESS_1033979] variability for Cmax and the area under the plasma drug

19 concentration time curve (AUC) values were observed for both formulations (coefficient of variation [CV]% Cmax: 51% for the tablet formulation, 61% for the capsule formulation; CV% for the AUC fro m time zero to the last quantifiable timepoint or to infinity [AUC0 -last or AUC0 -
inf]: 40-43% for the tablet formulation, 43% for the capsule formulation). The geometric mean Cmax of the tablet formulation was approximately 39% higher than the value observed for the capsule formulation. The geometric mean AUC0 -last and AUC0 -inf values for the tablet 
formulation were also higher (15% and 19%, respectively) than those observed for the capsule formulation. However, due to the high within- formulation variabilit y observed, no statistical 
difference in exposure between the two formulations was apparent.  Based on the preliminary PK data from 46 subjects who completed both treatments on trial XL184-004, a high fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t1/2, z of cabozantinib [mean t1/2, z : 131 hours (fed) vs 128 hours (fasted)]. The high fat meal significantly increased the median tmax to 6 hours from 4 hours (fasted). The high fat meal also significantly increased both the cabozantinib Cmax and AUC values by 39% and 56%, respectively. The geometric mean ratio of Cmax fed/fasted was 1.39 (90% CI: 1.16-1.67), and the geometric mean ratio of AUC0-last fed/fasted was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.34-1.80). Based on this result, cabozantinib must be taken on an empty stomach (fas ting is required 2 hour before and 1 hours after each cabozantinib dose). 
 
 Rationale for Targeting HGF and Angiogenesis in Endometrial Cancer 
 Endometrial cancers are a heterogeneous group that can be separated into two distinct histological sub -types with  differing molecular backgrounds. The more common endometriod 
cancers are characterized by [CONTACT_755382]3K/PTEN/AKT pathway activation as a consequence of oncogenic mutation of PI3K, PTEN loss and over-expression of upstream growth factor receptors. Serous c ancers on the other hand, harbour mutations in p53 and p16 with consequent 
cell-cycle dysregulation. A subset of these also demonstrates up-regulation of PI3K signaling 
through gene amplification and oncogenic mutation. Also noteworthy is abnormal regulation of growth factor (HER2, EGFR) and MAPK signalling, the latter via KRAS mutation, specifically in endometroid cancers [8].   It is increasingly evident that focused inhibition of single oncogenic pathways is of limited utility in genetically complex tumours where molecularly driven escape and resistance mechanisms emerge under the selection pressure of isolated pathway inhibition. Consequently, targeting multiple arms of a network (either through combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_755366]- targeted agents) has 
become the recent focus of drug development [24] . In addition, the recognition of the importance of cellular and physical features of the tumoral microenvironment in cancer progression has identified further targets for a multi-pronged approach to tumour targeting [25].  The prognostic importance of microvascular density (MVD) in predicting for advanced disease stage and inferior patient outcome in endometrial cancer lends credence to targeting angiogenic pathways in this disease [26, 27] . It is a particularly appealing therapeutic strategy as it involves 
simultaneous inhibition of mitogenic pathways in malignant epi[INVESTIGATOR_755367] [28] . Since multiple molecular pathways have been 
implicated in the promotion of angiogenesis the findings of Wagatsuma correlating high MVD with diffuse membranous c- MET e xpression are interesting  and suggest a potential relevance of

20 hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) – MET molecular cross -talk in promoting tumoral angiogenesis 
in endometrial cancer [29]. Preclinical work in a variety of in vivo tumour models supports a potentiation of antiangiogenic strategies through contemporaneous inhibition of MET and VEGF RTK pathway s [19, 30, 31]. 
c-MET is a RTK for which the only known ligand is HGF. Ligand binding promotes receptor activation and downstream signalling through MAPK and PI3K, influencing a number of processes integral to malignant progression including growth, motility, invasion and angiogenesis [32]. Over-expression of the MET receptor has been reported in a variety of cancers, and leads to increased paracrine and autocrine signalling through increased se nsitivity to 
stroma produced HGF [33]. Similar findings have been demonstrated in endometrial cancer (in endometroid and serous subtypes) where increased tumour expression of MET and stromal reactivity for HGF correlated with more aggressive tumour biology and inferior patient outcome [29, 34].  Unfortunately, clinical benefit across tumour types from i solated VEGF -pathway targeting 
strategies has been modest at best and transient in duration[35] . In situations where treatment results in an initial response followed by [CONTACT_755383]. Multiple molecular mediators have been implicated in this regard including FGF (fibroblast growth factor), ephrins, angiopoietins and HGF. Preclinical work also suggests that these mechanisms may also be relevant to the increased metastatic potential noted with VEGF -targeting [36]. It has been suggested that either through targeting of multiple 
pathways or initiating inhibition of compensatory pathways at the emergence of resistance may result in greater clinical efficacy [37, 38].   The recently reported Phase II trial of single agent bevacizumab in endometrial cancer is one such example. Although activity level was encouraging with a response rate of 13% and a 40% 6-month PFS, these responses were transient. Benefit was noted in all histological subgroups. Interestingly, although tumour VEGF-A levels did not predict for response, circulating levels of the same cytokine seemed to correlate with poor outcome on trial. What remains unclear is whether the lack of discrepancy is related to the use of archival tumour or a true lack of correlation [39].  Current data implies that dual targeting of VEGFR2 and MET signaling, as can be achieved with the multi- targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozatinib, is likely to result in significant clinical 
efficacy in endometrial cancer where high levels of angiogenesis and aberrant proliferation  
pathways are relevant.  
 Targeting angiogenic pathways has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy in endometrial cancer given the prognostic relevance of micro -vascular density (and hence heightened 
angiogenic activity) in this disease [26, 27, 40]. The results of the recently reported endometrial bevacizumab t rial are in accordance with this hypothesis. In women previously receiving 
cytotoxic treatment for advanced disease, the VEGF monoclonal antibody had a response rate of 13.5%, with 40% women remaining progression- free for at least 6 months [39] . Still, benefit 
from VEGF targeting strategies is generally transient due to alternate angiogenic pathways and

21 stromal elaboration of soluble factors [28, 38]. In this regard, two independent studies have suggested relevance of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling and angiogenesis in endometrial cancer, demonstrating increased expression of HGF’s cognate receptor c- MET, in 
around 60% of endometroid and serous cancers. Further, upregulated c- MET/HGF correlated 
with aggressive tumour biology and inferior patient survival [29, 34] . From a mechanistic 
standpoint, preclinical experimental work demonstrates effic acy of HGF -MET targeting through 
inhibition of both mitogenic and angiogenic tumoral pathways [41].   Study Hypothesis   
 This is a single arm phase II study to evaluate the hypothesis that the multi-targeted inhibitor cabo zantinib (with activity against MET, VEGFR2, TIE2, RET, AXL and KIT) will demonstrate 
significant activity across various histologies of endometrial cancer (with a dual primary endpoint of improved response rate and 12-week progression- free-survival (PFS)). Ef ficacy of 
this approach is likely to be related to the simultaneous targeting of epi[INVESTIGATOR_755368]. Exploratory correlative studies are incorporated to evaluate the predictive potential of archival mutational profiles (including c- met 
amplification status )
. 
 
 Correlative Studies Background  
 Rationale for HGF/MET pathway biomarkers 
 
Oncogenic MET signaling  is a consequence of various molecular mechanisms including gene 
amplification, mutation, over-expression, and autocrine activation, with the hierarchal relevance dictated by [CONTACT_755384]. In addition, downstream HGF-MET signaling is complex and involves several networks that are already aberrantly regulated in human cancers includin g (but 
not limited to) PI3K/Akt and RAS -RAF -MEK -ERK. Therefore, molecular markers indicative of 
(1) the type of pathway aberration, (2) the mutational context of a patient’s tumour or (3) the activation status of downstream signaling mediators, may indicate dependence on MET pathway, potentially acting as biomarkers of response to cabozantinib/XL-184.   Overview of correlative studies  
 Correlative studies evaluating tumour biology relevant to endometrial cancer will focus on baseline amplification status of  MET tumour mutational profiling using a custom panel to assess 
a large panel of cancer -associated mutations as well as baseline status of met amplification.

 General Guidelines  
 The Study Coordinator at the Princess Margaret Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755371].  All sites should call the Study Coordinator (listed on cover 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
28 page) to verify cohort availabilities.  The required forms (Eli gibility Checklist) will be provided 
upon site activation.  Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 72 hours.  Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator (cc the central office study coordinator).  If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, 
the patient’s registration on the study may be cancelled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD -supplied 
agents directly from CTEP.  A participating site may order agents only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477] ([EMAIL_617]
) except for Group studies. 
 
 Registration Process  
 Prior to registering a patient, each institution must have submitted all necessary regulatory documentation to the PMH Phase II Consortium Central Office.  The eligibility checklist will only be sent once this has been received.    No patient can receive p rotocol treatment until registration with the Central Office has taken 
place.  All eligibility criteria must be met at the time of registration.  There will be no exceptions.  Any questions should be addressed with the Central Office prior to registration.    To register a patient, the following documents are to be completed by [CONTACT_755387] / faxed to the Central Office Study Coordinator: • Signed patient consent form • Eligibility Checklist CRF signed by [CONTACT_755388], central office will review the checklist and once eligibility 
has been confirmed:  
• Assign a patient study number  
• Assign the patient a dose • Register the patient on the study  
• Fax or e -mail the confirmation worksheet with the patient study number and dose to the 
participating site  
 To ensure immediate attention is given to the faxed checklist, each site is advised to also call the study coordinator listed on the front sheet. Patient registration will be accepted between the hours of 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, excluding Canadian statutory holidays when the central office will be closed.  
 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 This is a single agent, two stage non- randomized phase II clinical trial in women with recurrent 
or me tastatic endometrial cancer. Patients will be accrued in two cohorts – experimental , and 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
29 exploratory. The study is powered to evaluate efficacy in two  histological strata (of serous and 
endometroid) of endometrial cancer as outlined in statistical plan.  
 A second exploratory cohort of patients with unusual histology endometrial cancer (including clear cell, carcinosarcoma, mixed ) will be accrued to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1034015] and > 4/10 objective responses in a particular  histology (if 
available depending on accrual) will be considered a signal of activity in that particular subtype. Correlative studies are proposed to further elucidate unique features of tumour biology in these rare sub -types.  
 
 Agent Administration  
 Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6. No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_37342]'s malignancy.  
 
5.1.1 XL184 
 
XL184 will be dosed continuously (once daily) on a 28 day cycle starting at 60mg daily dose. Skipped/missed doses will not be made up. Patients will undergo their first response evaluation after 3 cycle s (12 week s) of treatment (irrespective of missed/held dose).

[IP_ADDRESS] Anticancer Therapy  
 If a subject requires additional systemic anticancer treatment, study treatment must be discontinued. Local intervention is discouraged unless medically unavoidable. Subjects  receiving 
local intervention ( e.g., palliative radiation) are allowed to continue to receive study treatment at 
the PMHC  investigator’s discretion.   
 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Medications 
 Subjects must be instructed to inform the investigators of the current or planned use or all other medications during the study (including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins and herbal and nutritional supplements). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are  documented. 
 Bisphosphonates started prior to screening activities or initiated during the course of the study to control bone pain may be used with caution.  Colony stimulating factors ( e.g., erythropoietin and granulocyte colony- stimulating factors) and  
pain medications administered as dictated by [CONTACT_755389]. However, colony stimulating factors should not be administered prophylactically prior to the first dose of study treatment.   No conc urrent investigational agents are permitted.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug Interactions 
 
Cytochrome P450:  Preliminary data from a clinical drug interaction study (Study XL184 -008) 
show that clinically relevant steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no 
marked effect on the AUC of co-administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 ( i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitro data indicate 
that cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrat ions (30 μM).  
 Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on data from in vitro studies using CYP- isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies.  
 Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -006, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family ( e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations. The 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
[ADDRESS_1034017] the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib ( e.g., chronic use of modafinil) should be avoided because of its potential to 
reduce cab ozantinib exposure. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or 
minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended. In addition, caution must be used when discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receivi ng a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the 
exposure to cabozantinib.   Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family ( e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and 
ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapefruit / grapefruit juice and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.   Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways ( e.g., 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib exposure is not known. Therefore, these drugs should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib.   
Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and inhibitors 
of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/
). 
 
Protein Binding:  Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) to human plasma 
proteins. Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because there is a potential displacement interaction that could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-administered highly protein-bound drug (and a corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect). Factors that influe nce plasma protein binding may affect individual 
tolerance to cabozantinib. Therefore, concomitant medications that are highly protein bound (e.g., diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol) should be used with caution. 
Because warfarin is a hig hly protein bound drug with a low therapeutic index, administration of 
warfarin at therapeutic doses should be avoided in subjects receiving cabozantinib due to the potential for a protein binding displacement interaction.  
 
Drugs Associated with QTc Prolo ngation:  Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with 
a mild prolongation of the QTc interval. Caution should be used when treating subjects on cabozantinib with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
www.crediblemeds.org  ). 
Additional QTc monitoring is suggested for subjects who are treated concomitantly with QTc prolonging drugs. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
32  
Other Interactions : In a relative bioavailability study in dogs, cabozantinib exposure was not 
significantly affe cted by [CONTACT_528924].  Co-administration of gastric pH modifying 
drugs such as PPI, H2- blockers or antacids has no clinically -relevant effect on XL184 plasma PK 
in healthy volunteers; thus, concomitant use of these drugs with XL184 is now allowed.  (Note : 
Cimetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere with CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of cabozantinib).  
 In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P glycoprotein (P-gp), but it does appear to ha ve the potential to inhibit the P -gp transport activity.  
 Additional details related to these overall conclusions are provided in the Investigators Brochure.

Diarrhea  
Subjects should be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the first signs of poorly 
formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of antidiarrheal agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management. Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy. Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_528896]. Additional agents to consider in subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above include deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342845] (Benson et al., 2004). Some subjects may require concomitant therapy with loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342846]. The dose modification guidance in Table 6-[ADDRESS_1034027] sign of nausea and vomiting. The dose modification guidance in Table 6-1 should be followed.   The 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists are recommended over chronic use of NK-1 receptor antagonists 
and dexamethasone (NK-1 receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure). However given the potential of the 5- HT
[ADDRESS_1034028] local treatments 
such as non-traumatic cleansing, and oral rinses ( e.g., with a weak solution of salt and baking 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
38 soda) should be maintained. The oral cavity should be rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms. When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be consi dered.  
 Hepatobiliary Disorders  
 Elevations of transaminases have also been observed during treatment with cabozantinib. In general, it is recommended that subjects with elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. If possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in subjects who develop elevated transaminases.  
Since subjects may enter the study with elevations of AST/ALT at baseline, the following guideline should be used for dose modifications:  
Transaminase 
elevation CTCAE v 5.[ADDRESS_1034029] at baseline  
Grade 1  Continue cabozantinib with weekly monitoring of liver function tests 
(LFTs) for at least [ADDRESS_1034030] weekly LFTs until resolution to Grade ≤  1. Study treatment may 
then be resumed at a one -dose-level reduction of cabozantinib  
Grade [ADDRESS_1034031] twice 
weekly LFTs until Grade ≤  2. Then continue with at least weekly 
LFTs until resolution to Grade ≤  1. Cabozantinib may then be 
resumed at a one-dose-level reduction.  
Grade [ADDRESS_1034032] 2 -3 times per week, until resolution to 
Grade ≤  1.  If the subject was  unequivocally deriving clinical benefit, 
the subject may be able to resume treatment at a lower dose of cabozantinib as determined by [CONTACT_755392].  
Subjects with AST or ALT above the ULN  but ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_1034033] (i.e., Grade 1) at  baseline

be resumed at a one -dose-level reduction of cabozantinib  
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
39  Cabozantinib treatment s hould also be interrupted when transaminase increases are accompanied 
by [CONTACT_408251], and/or elevations of coagulation tests ( e.g., 
International Normalized Ratio [INR]). Monitoring of transaminases should be intensified (2–3 times per week) and cabozantinib should be held until the etiology of the abnormalities is determined and these abnormalities are corrected or stabilize at clinically acceptable levels (INR 
< 1.5 ×  ULN, total bilirubin <  1.5 ×  ULN, aminotransferases ≤  baseline grade).  
 
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_528930] (bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN), in the 
absence of evidence of biliary obstruction ( i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase) or 
some other explanation of the injury ( e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), as the combined 
finding ( i.e., Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver 
injury.

41 Skin Disorders  
 Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand-foot syndrome), skin 
rash (including blister, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], and alopecia have been reported in cabozantinib- treated subjects . All subjects on study should be advised to use 
prophylactic measures for skin care. These measures include the use of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, sunscreen with SPF ≥30; avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot water; protection of pressure- sensit ive areas of hands and feet; and use of 
thick cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep the palms and soles dry. Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection ( e.g., abscess, cellulitis, 
or impetigo).  
 Early signs of hand-foot syndrome can include tingling, numbness, and slight redness or mild hyperkeratosis. Early manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the palms and soles. The lateral sides of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected areas. Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology referral.  Treatment guidelines for PPE related to study treatment are presented in the table below.  
 In the case of study treatment -related skin changes ( e.g., rash, hand-foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent. These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated un til the skin changes resolve.

Embolism and Thrombosis   Deep vein thrombosis and PE have been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib; including fatal events (please refer to the IB). Subjects who develop a PE or DVT should have study treatment held until therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins is established. Study treatment may be resumed with a one dose- level reduction in subjects who have uncomplicated PE or DVT 
and are deriving clinical benefit from study treatment.. During treatment with a nticoagulants, 
subjects need to be monitored on an ongoing basis for bleeding risk and signs of bleeding. Subjects with life -threatening PE or DVT should have study treatment discontinued unless 
toxicity can be managed and subject is deriving clear clinica l benefit as determined by [CONTACT_629945]. Venous filters ( e.g. vena cava filters) are not 
recommended due to the high incidence of complications associated with their use. Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per investigator judgment at one dose lower. Subjects should permanently discontinue after a second thrombotic event. Although routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjects, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed for i ndividual subjects at the discretion of the investigator.  
 Arterial thrombotic events ( e.g., transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction) have been 
observed rarely in studies with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute MI or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.  
 Hypertension  
 Hypertension is a relatively common complication of other VEGF-pathway inhibitors and has been observed in cabozantinib clinical studies.  Subjects with known hypertension should be optimally managed prior to study entry.  Patients are to be provided with a BP machine for at home daily monitoring for the first 28 days of treatment; further daily monitoring is to be determined at the physician ’s discretion.  Decisions 
to decrease or hold the dose of study treatment should be based on BP readings taken by a medical professional and confirmed with a second measurement at least [ADDRESS_1034049] measurement. However a physician can alt er the patient’s treatment if there is significant 
reasoning to due to  their daily BP monitoring.  Clinical judgment should be used in deciding

43 whether new or worsened hypertension emerging during treatment with cabozantinib requires immediate therapy, or whether therapeutic intervention can be delayed in order to confirm the 
finding of new or worsened hypertension at a second visit before taking new therapeutic action. It is recommended that this second visit occur within 1  week. Blood pressure should be 
monitored in a constant position visit to visit, either sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Cabozantinib dosing should be interrupted in subjects with severe hypertension (180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic; or sustained ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled with medical interventions and discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or hypertensive encephalopathy (see next Table below).

 Proteinuria  
 Proteinuria has been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. Any level of proteinuria diagnosed by [CONTACT_408256] a UPCR (mg/dL protein / mg/dL creatinine). When a UPCR exceeds 1, a repeat UPCR or a 24 -hour urine 
protein and creatinine should be performed to confirm the result. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day in combination with hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) or any other releva nt renal 
disease. Also, given the nephrotoxic potential of bisphosphonates, these agents should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with cabozantinib. Details of management are described in the next Table below.

Guidelines for the Prevention of Hemorrhagic Events  
 Hemorrhagic events have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
 
• Tumor lesions with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or abut major blood vessels. The anatomic location and characteristics of primary tumors or metastases as well as the medical history should be carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
• Recent or concu rrent radiation to the thoracic cavity.  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory GI diseases.  
• Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis ( e.g., deficiencies in clotting 
factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia). 
• Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis. 
• History of clinically significant hemoptysis.  
 Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious and life -threatening bleeding 
events or recent hemoptysis (≥0.5 teaspoon (2.5mL) of red blood). Treatment with cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after the cause of hemorrhage has been identified and the risk o f bleeding has subsided 
at a dose agreed to by [CONTACT_16998]. Therapy of bleeding events should include supportive care and standard medical interventions.   Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel while on study treatment must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment.   
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_755375]. Patients deemed high 
risk of bleeding based on tumour location should be discontinued. If t he investigator feels patient 
is low risk , a discussion should take place with PMHC investigator. Therapy may continue at the 
discretion of the PMHC PI.

[ADDRESS_1034052].   Guidelines  for Prevention  of GI Perforation/Fistula and Non-GI Fistula Formation 
 GI perforation/fistula and Non-GI fistula formation have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. Carefully monitor for epi[INVESTIGATOR_151949], especially in subjects with known risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_629925]/fistula or non-GI fistula, to allow for early diagnosis. Such risk factors include (but may not be limited to) the following:  
 
GI-perforation/fistula : 
• Intra -abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa.  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis .  
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra- abdominal abscess  
• Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing). Complete healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed p rior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib.  
 Additional risk factors include concurrent chronic use of steroid treatment or non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Constipation indicative of bowel obstruction should be monitored and 
effectively managed.   
 
Non-GI fistula : 
• Radiation therapy has been identified as a possible predisposing risk factor for non- GI fistula 
formation in subjects undergoing treatment with drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways . In 
addition, subjects who have undergone extensive surgery may be at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fistula of the involved organs Non-GI fistula should be ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy.  
  Discontinue all study treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI or non- GI 
perforation/fistula.  
 Wound Healing and Surgery  VEGF in hibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which may 
occur even long after a wound has been considered healed. Therefore, surgical and traumatic wounds must have completely healed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment and be monitored for wound dehiscence or wound infection while the subject is being treated with cabozantinib.   Treatment with cabozantinib must be interrupted for any wound healing complication which needs medical intervention. Treatment with cabozantinib can be resumed once wound healing

 Endocrine Disorders  
 Prospective studies of markers of thyroid functions are currently ongoing in two single-agent studies to characterize the effects of cabozantinib on thyroid function. Preliminary data indicate that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (TFTs) in a high number of subjects (see Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure). Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments for signs and symptoms assoc iated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated 
with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction ( e.g., symptomatic hypothyroidism) 
should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines.  
 Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects. Monitoring with standard laboratory tests for endocrine disorders and clinical examination prior to initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib is required. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-threatening endocrine dysfunction. 
 Guidelines for Prevention  of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw 
 
Osteonecrosis  of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with use of antiangiogenic drugs and 
bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients. Additional risk factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease i tself. Cases of osteonecrosis 
have been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib, the details of which are provided in the current version of Investigator’s Brochure. As a preventive measure, invasive dental procedures should be avoided if possible i n subjects who have previously been treated with or concomitantly 
receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental procedure and the extent of the procedure as well as the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_755376] a

48 Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc interval. Other factors which may co ntribute to QTc prolongation include 
• Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see http://www.qtdrugs.org).  
• Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may increase cabozantinib drug levels) 
• Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia).  
• Medical conditions which can alter electrolyte status e.g., severe or prolonged diarrhea. 
 
Subjects having any of these additional risk factors while on cabozantinib must have ECGs performed approximately one week after the onset of these factors.  
 If at any time on study there is an increase in QTc interval to an absolute value >500 msec, two additional ECGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG with intervals not less than 3 minutes apart. If the average QTcF from the three ECGs is >[ADDRESS_1034055] be withheld and the following actions should be taken:

appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of 
events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf
 for further clarification. 
Frequency is provided based on 2438 patients. Below is the CAEPR for XL184 (Cabozantinib s -malate).  
NOTE: Report AEs on the SPEE R ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE 
listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if e xpedited reporting is required.

.   
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
• AEs for the agent that are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1) should be reported through CTEP -AERS  only if the grade 
is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
53 • Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in section 
7.3.4. 
 
• Attributi on of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 7.2.[ADDRESS_1034059] use 
CTEP -AERS  (CTEP -Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://ctep.cancer.gov ). The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded f rom the CTEP Web site 
(
https://ctep.cancer.gov ). These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below 
(Section 7.3.3). 
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to CTEP by [CONTACT_1381] [PHONE_101]. Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into 
CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_25521].  
 
7.2.2 CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic d istribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Study Coordinator of the Lead Organization, Principal Investigator, and the local treating physician. Each site will submit the electronic version of the 
CTEP -AERS  report to the PMH Phase II Consortium Central Office.  Once review 
by [CONTACT_755394].  CTEP -
AERS  provides a copy feature for other e- mail recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 7.2.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol- specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)”  
under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
54 or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.   In order to ensure the timely fulfillment of both US and Canadian IND regulatory reporting requirements, all 
CTEP -AERS  reports must be sent to the PMH Phase II 
Consortium Central Office within 3 working days from the date the event was known to the investigator.  
 
• In the unlikely event that an adverse event occurs that does not meet the reporting requirements for 
CTEP -AERS , but does meet the definition of a Serious Adverse 
Event, a  CTEP -AERS  report must still be completed and sent to the Central Office 
within [ADDRESS_1034060] be telephoned or e- mailed to Central Office within 1 working day.   
 
• The PMH Phase II Consortium Central Office will be responsible for reporting to Canadian regulatory authorities all Serious Adverse Events that are both unexpected and related to study drug.  The Central Office will notify all Investigators of all Serious Adverse Events that are reportable to regulatory authorities in Canada from this trial or from other clinical trials  as reported to the Central Office by [CONTACT_6812] U.S.  
 
• Investigators must notify their local Research Ethics Boards (REB/IRBs), according to their guidelines, of all SAE reports from their centre and file the report in their regulatory study binder.   In addition, all reports sent out to centres by [CONTACT_583047]/IRBs, according to their guidelines.  Documentation from the REB/IRB of receipt of these reportable events must be kept on file in each institution's regulatory binder.

1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or 
not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 
24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/bi rth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via 
CTEP -AERS  within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE:  Protocol -specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - T he AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted  within [ADDRESS_1034062] administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by [CONTACT_6794] 5 calendar days for: 
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Grade [ADDRESS_1034063] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above applies after this reporting period.

[ADDRESS_1034064] also  be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malign ancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via 
CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukem ia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms  
 Second Malignancy  
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.   8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION 
 A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent admi nistered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.

 Storage:  Store intact bottles at controlled room temperature, 20
0 to 250C. 
  Stability:  “ Stability testing of the intact bottles is on -going.  XL184 is stable up to 24 hours when 
dispensed in an open container such as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_408200], and up to 7 days when dispensed in a closed container such as a pharmacy bottle other than the origina l container.”  
 Route of Administration: Oral.  
 Method of Administration: T ake XL184 on an empty stomach, 2 hours before and 1 hour after 
food. Do not crush or chew.  
 Potential Drug Interactions : XL184 is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of XL184 wi th 
medications that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifampentin, Phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors a re ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithroumycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir. Use alternative medications. Avoid grapefruit/ grapefruit juice and Seville oranges while participating in this trial.  
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
58  In vitro data, XL184 is not a P -gp su bstrate but may inhibit the P -gp transport activity.  
 XL184 is highly protein bound, 99.9%. Use caution when coadminister XL184 with medications that are highly protein -bound (e.g., diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol). Avoid 
administrati on of warfarin with XL184 as warfarin is highly protein- bound and has a very narrow 
therapeutic index.  
 Cimetidine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Avoid using cimetidine with XL184. Co-
administration of gastric pH modifying drugs such as PPI, H2- blockers or antacids has no clinically -
relevant effect on XL184 plasma PK in healthy volunteers; thus, concomitant use of these drugs with XL184 is now allowed. 
 
Patient Care Implications :  Do not take grapefruit/ grapefruit juice or Seville oranges while 
participat ing in this trial. Inform physician and study healthcare team about current medications 
including over the counter drugs, herbals, or natural medicines. Cimetidine or omeprazole is also available over -the-counter (OTC). Do not use cimetidine.   
 Availability  
XL184 (cabozantinib) is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_329208] (DCTD), NCI.  
 XL184 (cabozantinib) is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between the Pharmaceutical Collaborato r and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.3). 
 
8.1.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
 [IP_ADDRESS] NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained). The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational agents. The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, S upplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and 
Financial Disclosure Form (FDF). If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_170739].  
 Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator-designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_528903] (OAOP) application (
https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ). Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account (

Oncogenic MET signaling is a consequence of various molecular mechanisms including gene amplification, mutation, over-expression, and autocrine activation, with the hierarchal relevance dictated by [CONTACT_755384]. In addition, downstream HGF-MET signaling is complex and involves several networks that are already aberrantly regulated in human cancers including (but not limited to) PI3K/Akt and RAS -RAF -MEK -ERK. Therefore, molecular markers indicative of 
(1) the type of pathway aberration, (2) the mutational context of a patient’s tumour or (3) the activation status of downstream signaling mediators, may indicate dependence on MET pathway, potentially acting as biomarkers of response to cabozantinib/XL-184.   Overview of correlative studies  
 Exploratory studies in archival tumour or fresh biopsies (if possible) will evaluate baseline mutational profiles and met amplification status as predictive markers of cabozantinib response.    Correlative studies evaluating tumour biology relevant to endometrial cancer will focus on (1) evaluating baseline status of MET (using standard FISH to identify MET amplification and sequencing to highlight activating mutations) and (2) tumour mutational profiling using a custom panel to assess a large panel of cancer -associated mutations.  
 All Correlative Studies will be conducted in the Applied Molecular Profiling Laboratory at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre following developed SOPs for both sample acquisition and performing individual assays.  
 Baseline Mutationa l Profiling of Archival Samples 
 All enrolled patients should have archival samples available for baseline mutational profiling.  If archival tissue is not available, a sufficient tumour biopsy can  be performed a minimum of 28 
days prior to start of treatm ent if clinically reasonable to do so.

Baseline (pre -study) evaluations are to be conducted ≤  [ADDRESS_1034067] be done ≤ 28 days prior 
to the start of therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory 
evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.  The following schedule of assessments applies to all subjects.  More frequent assessments should be obtained if clinically indicated.  A cycle is 28 days long.  A 14- day delay/l apse in treatment 
will result in the patient being removed from study unless specified differently; refer to section 6.  Refer to the calendar for cycle 1 day 1 timelines.  For subsequent cycles (2+), day 1 and day 15 assessments can be completed up to 3 d ays prior to day 1 or day 15 as applicable.

For the purposes of this study, patients should be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]- sectional imaging at 
baseline, at the end of cycle 3 and then every 8 weeks irrespective of missed or held doses. (every 3 cycles  (12 weeks) for patients on study for 2 years or longer) 
  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1034073] their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered eval uable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response. Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated wil l be considered evaluable for non- target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
   
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
[ADDRESS_1034074] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_1034075] x- ray or as >[ADDRESS_1034076] be reco rded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable  
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be >[ADDRESS_1034077] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningea l disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographi cally defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representati ve of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.

11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinic al lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined  and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1034078] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickne ss. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).  
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of t he type and site of disease. 
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to presc ribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can do cument that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
[ADDRESS_1034079] in  selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following co mplete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical  response. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin 
Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008]. In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_1034080] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 
2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease ). New lesions on the basis of FDG-
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT  scans are needed to determi ne if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, 
the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG-
PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing 
on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
[ADDRESS_1034081] be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
  11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study , including 
baseline.  Patients will not go from PR to SD.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response ( CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
67 Non-CR/Non -PD:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions an d/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.    
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 11.1.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive d isease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 Study Design/Endpoints  
 Evaluation of the experimental cohort s of this trial is based on a modified Simon two -stage 
design with co-primary endpoints of response rate (RR) and 12-week progression- free survival 
(PFS). A maximum of 36 evaluable patients will be enrolled  to each histological cohort to 
discriminate between tumor RR rates of 30% vs. 10% and 12-week PFS rates of 55% vs. 30% (corresponding to median PFS of 3.4 to 1.7 months). Each cohort will be reviewed on its individual results. If at least 8 responses (at least 22%), or at least 16 ins tances of 12 -week PFS 
(at least 44%), were observed among the 36 evaluable patients, this regimen would be considered worthy of further testing in that particular histological subgroup of endometrial cancer.    Stage I has a planned accrual of 18 patients  per histologic al cohort . If no more than 2 objective 
responses (no more than 11%), and  no more than 6 instances of 12-week PFS (no more than 33%) were  observed amongst the initial 18 patients accrued per histological cohort, study would

It yields at least 0.94 probability of a negative result if the true objective response rate is no more than 10% and the true 12-week PFS rate is no more than 30% (median PFS of 1.7 months), with approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1034088] two probabilities are calculated assuming that tumor response rate and PFS rate are uncorrelated. If they are positively correlated, as is likely, the probabilities will be a bit higher.  
 Patients with rare histology endometrial canc er (including clear cell, carcinosarcoma) will be 
enrolled in an exploratory cohort in which > 4/[ADDRESS_1034089] significant activity. A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued to this exploratory cohort.  Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE v 5.0.  13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 In the experimental cohort, stage I has a planned accrual of 18 patients per histological cohort . If 
> 2 PRs or > [ADDRESS_1034090] anned total 
accrual of 36 evaluable patients  per histological cohort. Accrual to the exploratory cohort will 
proceed as long as patients are being accrued to experimental cohort to a maximum of 30 patients.   
 Estimated accrual is 2 -3 pts per month and is e xpected to take 24 to 36 months. 
 13.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary endpoints to be evaluated include:  
• baseline molecular status of archival tumour (c -met amplification & mutation status)  
• pharmacodynamic responses in levels of soluble, circulating angiogenic factors  
• overall survival 
  Correlating with clinical response  
 13.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.4.1 Evaluation of toxicity  – All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with XL184.  
 
13.4.2 Evaluation of response – All patients included in the study must be assessed for response 
to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
73 Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 8) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], categor y 8 
usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_1034091] a 
treatment failure (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rat e. Precise 
definitions for categories [ADDRESS_1034092] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early 
discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for  excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% 
confidence intervals should also be provided.

[ADDRESS_1034097] be followed.  
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO). The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, 
submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments. The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_36475]. There will be  only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use that 
document. The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating institutions and for monitoring its progress. All reporting requirements to CTEP are the responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data for study analysis.  
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate ass urance on file with the Office for 
Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH. The Coordinating Center is responsible for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_36419].  
•  Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 310 (documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO. 
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration. The Coordinating Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for review by [CONTACT_36476].  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports. There are two options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP. The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research records for selected patients ar e brought from participating sites to the Coordinating Center 
for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating sites. If the 
NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018

Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
 The title page must include the name [CONTACT_379563], telephone number and e-mail address of the responsible investigator at each participating institution.  
 The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
 Central registration of patients is required. The procedures for registration must be stated in 
the protocol. 
 Data collection forms should be of a common format. Sample forms should be submitted 
with the protocol. The frequency and timing of data submission forms to the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
 Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to 
CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
 Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to 
participating institutions.  
 
Agent Ordering 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP. Investigational agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477].

80 APPENDIX C  INFORMATION ON  POSSIBLE  DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers and Non- Study Healthcare Team  
 The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent XL184 (cabozantinib) . This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_28129]. This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.   XL184 interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813]. Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study. It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.   Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions. You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part i n a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet . These are 
the things that you and they need to know:   XL184 interacts with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver.  
• The enzyme(s) in question is CYP3A4 . This enzyme breaks down XL184, gradually 
reducing the level of the active drug in your system.   
• Other medicines may affect the activity of the enzyme. XL184 must be used very carefully 
with these medicines, or you may need to switch to alternate medications.  
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity (“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the chance of harmful side effects.  
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular pres criber to 
switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4 .” 
• Your prescribers should look at this web site http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ or 
consult a medical reference to see if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.  
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye. They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list. Find the generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an adverse interaction.  
•   Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age. 
NCI Protocol #: 9322 
Version Date: 09Feb2018 
 
81 Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold. 
o If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit:  Avoid these until the study is over.  
o If you take her bal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while 
you are taking XL184 (cabozantinib) . 
 Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.   
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
XL184 (cabozantinib) interacts with a specific liver enzyme called 
CYP3A4 , and must be used very carefully with other medicines that 
interact with this enzyme.  
Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your 
regular prescriber to switch any medicines that are considered 
“strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4. ” 
Before prescribing new medicines, your regular prescribers should go to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ for a list of drugs 
to avoid, or contact [CONTACT_6814].  
Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832] ______________  and can be 
contact[CONTACT_6811] ______________ .  
INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent XL184 (cabozantinib). This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_6812]. XL184 
(cabozantinib) interacts with drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813]. 
Because of this, it is very important to:  
Tell your doctors if you stop taking regular medicine or if you start 
taking a new medicine.  
Tell all of your prescribers (doctor, physicians’ assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist) that you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over- the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.

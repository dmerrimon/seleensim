INDV-6000-301
Study Phase: Phase 3
Study Objective:
To provide ongoing treatment with RBP- 6000 and safet y monitoring for subjects who complete 
the RB -US-13-0003 study  and for whom a new treatment venue has not been identified or 
arranged.
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, open- label, RBP -6000 treatment extension study  in which approximately  
300 subjects diagnosed with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (OUD) will be enrolled. Enrollment is defined 
as the first dose of RBP -[ADDRESS_943182] completed the 
End of Study  (EOS) procedures for Study  RB-US-13-0003, have signed the INDV -6000-301 
informed consent form (ICF), and meet all the enrollment criteria may  be considered for 
inclusion in this study .
The institutional review board (IRB) approved ICF may  be shared w ith the potential subject up 
to [ADDRESS_943183] not be signed until 
all assessments for the RB -US-13-0003 EOS Vis it are complete.
The RB -US-13-0003 EOS assessments completed at the EOS Visit will serve as part of the 
screening assessments for this study . In addition, medical history  will be collected, height 
measured, and subjects will be requested to complete a Colu mbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) baseline survey. The same -day Study  RB-US-13-0003 EOS Visit / I NDV -6000-301 
Screening Visit will also be considered Day  1 of this study .
On Day  1, eligible subjects will receive a subcutaneous (SC) injection of RBP -6000. For each 
injection, subjects may  receive either a dose of 100 mg RBP -6000 or 300 mg RBP -6000, based 
on the medical judgment of the Investigator. Following RBP -6000 injection, vital signs and the 
injection site will be assessed. The injection site will be assessed by  [CONTACT_695214], tenderness, 
warmth, itching, ery thema, inflammation or swelling, and bruising using a 5- point severity  scale 
RBP -6000 Indivior Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV- 6000 -301 Amendment 1:  30 September 20 16
Page 3of 67 Confidential(the Injection Site Grading Scale). In addition, the subject will assess their own injection site 
pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) (referred to as the Injection Site Pain VAS).  Before 
departing the site, the subject will also be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and use of 
concomitant medications. 
Subjects will not be permitted to receive supplemental bu prenorphine during the RBP -6000 
treatment period (Day  1 to EOS/ET Visit).  Subjects who require supplemental buprenorphine 
pharmacotherap y during the RBP -[ADDRESS_943184] s will return to the site for monthly  injection visits every  28days (-2 / +7 day s) for a total 
of up to 6 injections. Subjects are not required to complete all 6 injections and may  choose to 
“earl y terminate” (ET) the study  at any  time.
At each subsequent visit (Injection Visits 2 through 6) the following procedures and assessments 
will be performed:   urine pregnancy  test for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential 
before each injection; evaluation of previous injection site for potential re action and evidence of 
attempts to remove the depot; collection of vital signs pre- and post -injection; RBP -6000 
injection, urine drug screen (UDS); C- SSRS since last visit, counseling (manual -guided 
behavioral therap y); local injection site grading; subje ct self -assessment of injection site pain 
(Injection Site Pain VAS); use of concomitant medications; and assessment for AEs. Laboratory  
tests (hematology , chemistry  and urinal ysis) may  be requested by  [CONTACT_695215] -hoc 
basis as necessary  to fur ther examine any  AEs. 
Alternative treatment options should be assessed at least two months before EOS at each visit, 
however it is recommended where possible to assess at every  visit. 
At the EOS/ET Visit, the following procedures and assessments will be performed: urine 
pregnancy  test for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential; evaluation of previous 
injection site for potential reaction and evidence of attempts to remove the depot; vital sign 
measurements; UDS; C -SSRS since last visit, counseling (manual -guided behavioral therap y); 
use of concomitant medications; assessment for AEs; brief ph ysical exam; height and bod y 
weight measurement (to determine a subject’s body  mass index [BMI ]); hip and waist 
circumference measurement (to determin e a subject’s hip -to-waist ratio); and laboratory  tests 
(hematology , chemistry , urinaly sis). 
Approximately  4 weeks after EOS/ET Visit, all subjects should be contact[CONTACT_695216] a 
safet y follow- up assessment of AEs and use of any  concomitant medica tions.

adverse events (SAE)s, discontinuations from study due to AEs; local injection site tolerability  
(based on injection site grading); injection site pain using a subject- reported VAS; suicidality  
using the C -SSRS, use of concomitant medications; clinically  significant changes in clinical 
laboratory  results; vital sign measurements; ph ysical examination findings; and measurements of 
body  weight, height, waist and hip circumference (for calculation of BMI and ab dominal fat 
measurement [waist -to-hip ratio]).
Statistical Methods:
A Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock occurs.  The SAP will 
provide further details regarding the definition of anal ysis endpoints, data handling rules , and the 
statistical methodology  to be used to address all study  objectives.  The SAP will also include 
formats for the summary  and anal ysis tables, listings, and graphical displays.
Determination of Sample Size :
Approximately  300 subjects who completed S tudy RB -US-13-0003 will be enrolled into this 
study .
Safety Analyses:
Safety  variables will include AEs, local injection site tolerability  (e.g., injection site grading); 
injection site pain using a subject -reported VAS; suicidality  using the C -SSRS, concomitant 
medications; changes in clinical laboratory  results (hematology , chemistry  and urinal ysis); vital 
sign measurements; ph ysical examination results; body  weight, height, BMI, and abdominal fat 
measurement (waist -to-hip ratio). Safet y variables will be described using descriptive statistics 
for continuous endpoints (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum) 
and frequency  counts with percentages for discrete endpoints.
Baseline is defined as the value collected at Screening.  No i mputation of missing values will be 
performed.

Page 11of 67 Confidential1INTRODUCTION
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition ( DSM -5; American Ps ychiatric Association 2013 ),is a neurobehavioral s yndrome 
characterized b y the repeated, compulsive seeking or use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2451], 
psychological, and/or phy sical consequences.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) is a medical illness 
with high costs to individuals, families, and society.  Direct and indirect costs attributable to 
illicit drug use are estimated in 3 principal areas: crime, productivity , and health ( US Department 
of Justice, Economic I mpact of Illicit Drug Use on American Societ y, 2011). These high costs 
have prompted researchers to seek new medications and treatment strategies for opi[INVESTIGATOR_695185].  
Buprenorphine, a mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_695186] -
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634], is one 
such medication that has had a significant role in expanding access to effective opi[INVESTIGATOR_695187]. Buprenorphine has been approved for use in the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43364] a number of countries worldwide. Buprenorphine has been reported to have a 
lower ph ysical dependence liability  than pure agonist analgesics such as morphine, and at a 
sufficient dose, it can suppress opi[INVESTIGATOR_695188] s ymptoms for at least [ADDRESS_943191] led to its therapeutic use as a 
pharmacotherap y for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].
The sponsor is currently  developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a buprenorphine depot (RBP- 6000), which is a 
subcutaneousl y injected for the treatment of OUD.  I t contains buprenor
phine in the ATRIGEL 
Delivery  System and provides sustained plasma levels of buprenorphine over a minimum of 28 
days (RBP -6000 IB ).  
The ATRIGEL Delivery  System is a sterile, pol ymeric solution of a biodegradable 
poly DL-lactide -co-glycolide (PL GH) copol ymer, dissolved in the water -miscible, biocompatible 
solvent N -methy l-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).  The ATRI GEL Delivery  System is well characterized.  
It is currentl y used in [ADDRESS_943192]®products 
(subcutaneous [SC] depot formulations of leuprolide acetate), ATRIDOX®(doxycycline h yclate 
applied to the periodontal pocket), the ATRISORB® Bioabsorbable Guided Tissue Regeneration 
Barrier for periodontal application, and the ATRISORB -D Barrier (A TRISORB with 
doxy cycline) for periodontal guided tissue regeneration.

A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed to characterize the disposition of 
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine following SC injection of RBP -6000 ( Nasser 2014 ).  The 
population PK model accuratel ypredicted the PK data after repeated doses of RBP -6000 in the 
multiple ascending dose study  (RB
-US-12-0005 ) and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2481]  (RB-US-13-

0001. 
1.2 Rationale for Dose Selection
The doses proposed in this study are 100 mg RBP -6000 and 300 mg RBP -6000, which are the 
doses subjects are current ly receiving in the RB -US-13-0003 study . These doses were chosen in 
the RB -US-
13-0001 and RB -US-13-0003 studies as modeling and simulation (Nasser 2014 ) 
demonstrated that the 300 mg SC dose is an appropriate dose to assess for efficacy . The 100 mg 
RBP -6000 dose is provided because it is recognized that some individuals may  need or desire 
lower dosages. 
Doses of RBP -6000 may  be adjusted up or down (to either 100 mg or 300 mg) throughout the 
course of the stud y based on the medical judgment of the Investigat or. 
1.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits
The AE profile of buprenorphine is well -characterized; commonly  reported effects include 
constipation, nausea, vomiting, and headache.  Buprenorphine is approved for use b y various 
routes of administration (e.g., sublingual [SL ], intramuscular [IM], intravenous [I V], 
transdermal, and rectal).
Studies of buprenorphine receptor binding in human subjects have consistently  and reproducibl y 
established that buprenorphine is a highl y lipophilic, mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_695195].  Buprenorphine has an improved safet y 
profile relative to mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2502].  These 
attributes of buprenorphine allow it to perform we ll as substitution therap y for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
individuals over short -term and long -term durations.  The experiments used to establish the 
binding profile of buprenorphine were consistent across differing parenteral routes of 
administration (IV, IM, and S L); therefore, RBP -6000 is expected to perform similarly  when 
administered as a SC depot in the ATRI GEL Delivery  System.
The purpose of this stud y (INDV -6000- 301) is to continue to provide up to an additional [ADDRESS_943196], evaluation, and documentation 
of this study , are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, designees and Investigator abide b y Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) as described in 21CFR parts 50, 54, 56, and 312 as well as in the

3.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, open- label, RBP -6000 treatment extension study  in which approximately  
300 subjects diagnosed with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (OUD) will be enrolled. Enrollment is defined 
as the first dose of RBP -[ADDRESS_943197] completed the 
End of Study  (EOS) procedures for Study  RB-US-13-0003, have signed the INDV -6000-301 
informed consent form (ICF), and meet all the enrollment criteria may  be considered for 
inclusion in this study .  
The I RB approved I CF may be shared with the potential subject up to [ADDRESS_943198] not be signed until all assessments for the RB- US-13-
0003 EOS Visit are complete.
The RB -US-13-0003 EOS assessments completed at the EOS Visit will serve as part of the 
screening assessments for this study . In addition, medical history  will be collected, height 
measured, and the subjects will be requested to complete a Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS) baseline/screening survey . The same -day Study  RB-US-13-0003 EOS Visit / 
INDV-6000- 301 Screening Visit will also be considered Day  1 of this study .
On Day  1, eligible subjects will receive a subcut aneous (SC) injection of RBP-6000. For each 
injection, subjects may  receive either a dose of 100 mg RBP -6000 or 300 mg RBP -6000, based 
on the medical judgment of the Investigator. Following RBP -6000 injection, vital signs and the 
injection site will be ass essed. The injection site will be assessed for pain, tenderness, warmth, 
itching, ery thema, inflammation or swelling, and bruising using a 5- point severity  scale 
(Injection Site Grading Scale). In addition, the subject will assess their own injection site pain 
using a visual analog scale (VAS) (referred to as the Injection Site Pain VAS). Before departing 
the site, the subject will also be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and use of concomitant 
medications.
Subjects will not be permitted to receive supplem ental buprenorphine during the RBP-6000 
treatment period (Day  1 to EOS/ET Visit).  Subjects who require supplemental buprenorphine 
pharmacotherap y during the RBP -6000 treatment period will be withdrawn from the study  and 
referred for appropriate treatment.   [Note: If subjects complete their EOS/ET Visit and a new 
treatment venue for them has not been identified, the Investigator may  provide the subject further 
buprenorphine treatment or another appropriate treatment according to their own medical 
judgement.]
Subjects will return to the site for monthly  injection visits every  28days (-2 / +7 day s) for a total 
of up to 6 injections. Subjects are not required to complete all 6 injections and may  choose to 
“earl y terminate” (ET) the study  at any  time.
At each s ubsequent visit (Injection Visits 2 through 6) the following procedures and assessments 
will be performed:   urine pregnancy  test for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential 
before each injection; evaluation of previous injection site for pot ential reaction and evidence of 
attempts to remove the depot; collection of vital signs pre- and post -injection; RBP -6000 
injection; urine drug screen (UDS); C-SSRS since last visit assessment, counseling (manual-

Page 18of 67 Confidentialguided behavioral therapy); local injection site grading; subject self -assessment of injection site 
pain (Injection site Pain VAS); use of concomitant medications; and assessment for AEs. 
Laboratory  tests (hematology, chemistry  and urinaly sis) may  be requested by  [CONTACT_695217] -hoc basi s as necessary  to further examine any  AEs . 
Alternative treatment options should be assessed at least two months before EOS at each visit, 
however it is recommended where possible to assess at every  visit.
At the EOS/ET Visit, the following procedures and assessments will be performed: urine 
pregnancy  test for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential; evaluation of previous 
injection site for potential reaction and evidence of attempts to remove the depot; vital sign 
measurements; UDS; C -SSRS “since last visit” assessment, counseling (manual- guided 
behavioral therap y); use of concomitant medications; assessment for AEs; brief ph ysical exam; 
height and bod y weight measurement (to determine a subject’s BMI); hip and waist 
circumference (to deter mine a subject’s hip- to-waist ratio); and laboratory  tests (hematology , 
chemistry
, urinal ysis). 
Approximately  4 weeks after EOS/ET Visit, all subjects should be contact[CONTACT_695216] a 
safet y follow- up assessment of AEs and use of any  concomitant med ications.

Clinical L aboratory  Changes:  It is the Inve stigator’s responsibility  to review the results of all 
laboratory  tests as they  become available.  This review will be documented by  [CONTACT_695219].  For each abnormal laboratory  test result, the Investigator needs to 
ascertain i f this is a clinically  significant abnormal change from baseline for that individual 
subject. 
Any liver abnormalit y > [ADDRESS_943221] should be carefully assessed b y the Investigator to determine 
whether it should be considered an AE. Guidance for the procedures to follow for elevated liver 
function tests are provided in Appendix 8 .
6.6 Suicidality  Assessments  
The C -SSRS is a questionnaire designed for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in 
adolescents and adults (Posner 2011).  Suicidality  assessment will be conducted according to the 
SOE table in Appendix 1 , using two versions of t he C-SSRS (“baseline/screening” and “since 
last visit ”).The C -SSRS “baseline/screening” assessment will include both a lifetime and past 6-
month time interval.  The two C-
SSRS versions are presented in Appendix [ADDRESS_943222].  If the suicidality  is deemed to be related to IMP and it is within 14 day s 
of an injection, the depot may  be removed ( Section 6.12.1 ).
If there is a positive (“y es”) response on the C-SSRS (“since last visit”) assessment after 
screening, the subject will be evaluated b y the Investigator for continuation in the study .  If 
needed, the Investigator can consult with the Medical Monitor.
6.7 Local Injection Site Tolerability
6.7.1 Injection Site Evaluation
At Injection Visits 2 through the EOS/ET Visit, the local injection site will be evaluated for 
potential reaction and evidence of an y attempts to remove the depo t medication following a 
previous injection of RBP- 6000.  This evaluation should be performed b y the Investigator or a 
trained and qualified licensed healthcare professional.  Any  detected removal attempts should be 
RBP -6000 Indivior Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV- 6000 -301 Amendment 1:  [ADDRESS_943223] should be terminated from 
the study .  In addition, detection of an y depot removal attempt at the EOS Visit for the prior 
study  (Study  RB-US-13-0003) should be discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine 
whether a subject sho uld be enrolled into the current study .  
Depot removal attempts are to be captured in the e -CRF (using “Yes” or “No” answers). 
6.7.2 Injection Site Grading
Local injection site grading will be performed b y the Investigator or a trained and qualified 
licensed healthcare professional, unless a designated person is pre -approved by  [CONTACT_1034] , 
according to the SOE in Appendix 1 .  Grading should be performed 1 hour ( + 30 minutes) post-
completion of injection.  Injection sites will be assessed for pain, tenderness, ery thema/redness, 
induration, or swelling.  Local injection site tolerability  will be assigned a severit y grade, 
including none (grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe (grade 3), or potentially  life 
threatening (grade 4) utilizing the 5- point I njection Site Grading Scale in Appendix 6 .
6.7.3 Injection Site Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
Injection site pain will be assessed b y the subject at each Injection Visit with a 100 mm VAS 
scale ranging from 0 to 100 , where 0 represents “ no pain ”and 100represents “maximum pain ”
(Appendix 7 ). The injection site pain VAS scores will be obtained approximately  [ADDRESS_943224] represents their perception of their current state, the subjec t will also answer the

6.9.5 Severity
Adverse events with changes in severit y should be documented as separate events.
Intensit y Definition
Mild Causes transient or mild discomfort; no limitation of usual activities; no 
medical intervention required
Moderate Causes mild to moderate limitation in activity ;some limitation of usual 
activities: no or minimal medical intervention or therap y is required.
Severe Causes marked limitation in activity ; some assistance is usually  required; 
medical intervention or therap y is required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2530].  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively  minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on subject/event 
outcome or action criteria usually  associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations.
6.9.6 Relationship
TheInvestigator or a medically  qualified Sub- investigator, trained on this study  protocol, listed 
on the 1572 form or equivalent document and on the delegation of authority form is responsible 
for determining the AE relationship to the I MP.
The following cat egories will be used to define the relationship of an AE to the administration of 
the IMP:
Not Related: Data are available to identify  a clear alternative cause for the AE other than 
the IMP.
Related: The cause of the AE is related to the investigational product and cannot be 
reasonabl y explained by  [CONTACT_1604] (e.g., the subject’s clinical state, 
concomitant therap y, and/or other interventions).
6.9.7 Expectedness
An unexpected AE is an y AE, the nature and severity  of which is not consistent with the IB fo r 
the IMP.

6.9.9 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Changes in laboratory  values or vital signs, or other safety  parameters (e.g., neurological and 
clinical sy mptom assessments) as noted in the protocol are a subse t of AEs and are reportable 
only if considered to be clinically  significant b y the Investigator or medically  qualified Sub-

6.9.10 Serious Adverse Events
6.9.11 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A SAE is defined as a ny AE occurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following outcomes: 
death, 
life-threatening AE,
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411], 
a persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions, or
a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
“Important medical events may  be considered an SAE when, based upo n appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.” 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Event Definition
A suspected unexpected seriou s adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any  SAE that, in its nature or 
severit y, is inconsistent with available medication information (e.g., IB or Package Insert). 
Indivior Pharmacovigilance will determine if an SAE is a S[LOCATION_003]R.

checks that have been created b y the Clinical Data Manager and programmed by [CONTACT_695233].  Data discrepancies will b e brought to the attention of the clinical 
team and investigated b y the CRA and Site Study  Coordinator.  CRAs will review and verify  all 
data collected in the eCRF against source documentation as defined in the clinical monitoring 
plan.  The CRA will work closely  with the Site Study  Coordinator to address any  discrepancies 
which have been found so that proper resolutions can be made and documented into the clinical 
database.  An audit trail within the sy stem will track all changes made to the data.

1.All indicated screening assessments conducted during the RB -US-13-0003 EOS Visit will be used as part of the overall screening process for the present 
study.  However, required assessments indicated under “Screening Visit INDV -6000- 301” must only be performed after the ICF is signed.
2.The ICF may be shared w ith the subject up to [ADDRESS_943260] is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ≥ 3 m inutes. With 
the exception of Day 1, vita l signs will be taken ≤ 60 m inutes prior to injection, and 1 hour (± 30 minutes) post-completion of injection. 
5.On Day 1, vital signs are only required to be collected 1 hour (± 30 minutes) post-completion of injection; the screening value will serve as th e pre -
injection value.
6.Only for female subjects who are of childbearing potential (not postmenopausal or surgically sterile for at least 1 year).
7.Oxycodone may not show  up in all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2528].
8.At the EOS Visit for Study R B-US-13-0003, the C -SSRS “since last visit” (e -PRO) version will be used for confirming exclusion 3 only.  In addition, as 
part of the Screening Visit for INDV -6000
-301, the C -SSRS “baseline/screening” (paper) version will be required to be completed; on a ll other visits, 
the “since last visit” (paper) version should be used.  The C -SSRS “baseline/screening” assessment will include both a lifetime and past 6 -month time 
interval.  
9.Injection site will be evaluated for potential reaction and evidence of attem pted removal before the next injection of RBP -6000 is administered.  
10.Local injection site grading will be performed 1 hour (± 30 minutes) post-completion of injection.
11.Injection Site Pain VAS will be completed by [CONTACT_423] 1 hour (± 30 minutes) post-completion of injection.
12.Subject’s alternative treatment options should be assessed at least two months before EOS , however it is recommended to review  at each visit.
13.Brief physical examination including general appearance, chest/lungs, heart, abdomen and a b rief neurological assessment.
14.Additional unscheduled labs may be added at the Investigator’s discretion in order to fully assess any AEs.
All subjects should receive a safety follow -up contact. Subjects should be contact[CONTACT_695234], or a stop date 
for any ongoing AEs or concomitant medications. They are not required to return to the site, unless the Investigator deems it medically necessary. In the 
event a subject cannot be contact[CONTACT_695235] -up telephone cont act, a minimum of [ADDRESS_943261] cannot be made, any open AEs will be 
designated as “ongoing.”

RBP -6000 PREPARATION AND DOSING PROCEDURE
100 MG BUPRENORPHINE
300 MG BUPRENORPHINE
IMPORTANT:  Onl y qualified study personnel can prepare the IMP. Protective gloves (latex 
or nitrile) should be worn when preparing and dosing RBP -6000.  Remove the product from the 
refrigerator at least [ADDRESS_943262] Prior to Administration: 
The following components will be used in the preparation of RBP -6000:
•One sea led foil pouch containing a s yringe pre -filled with RBP -6000 and an oxy gen 
absorber pack. 
•One sterile 19 -gauge, 1 -or 5/8- inch h ypodermic safet y needle
1.On a clean field, open the foil pouch and remove the contents. Discard the oxy gen absorber 
pack. The pouch must be retained for accountability .
2.Un-cap the pre -filled RBP -[ADDRESS_943263] is now read y for administration.  Carefully recap the needle.
Administration Procedure:
IMPORTANT: Once prepared (removed from foil pouch), the product must be 
administered within a maximum of [ADDRESS_943264] but above the hip bone; from where the bod y curves at 
the side to about [ADDRESS_943265] exces sive pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517], nodules, lesions, or hair.  Since y ou 
can vary  the injection site with a subcutaneous injection, choose an area that has not recently  
been used.

Clinical Study Protocol:  INDV -6000 -301 Amendment 1:  [ADDRESS_943269] the depot surgicall y 
removed b y a ph ysician delegated to perform surgery . The medicall y responsible physician 
should carefull y discuss this option with subjects given the use of ATRIGEL Delivery  System 
and the feasibility  of extracting the depot.
The following sur gical procedure should be followed:
1. Palpate the depot and surrounding area to confirm its exact location.
2. Cleanse the area with an antiseptic solution (e.g., Betadine).  
3. Infiltrate the area with a local anesthesia (e.g., Lidocaine 1% or a lidoca ine/adrenaline 
[epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]] mixture) and wait for it to take effect.
4. Cover the area with a sterile drape.
5. Incise the skin up to the subcutaneous tissues using a scalpel. 
6. Using blunt and sharp dissection, identify the plane between the depot and surrounding 
subcutaneous tissues.  Once the plane is identified, separate the superficial 25% of the 
circumference of the depot with blunt dissection. 
7. Gently  lift the incised ellipse of skin and depot with forceps.  
8. Once the depot is removed, ensure hemostasis, and close the skin with non- absorbable 
sutures.  
9. The extracted RBP -[ADDRESS_943270] 
container per the SOP at the clinical site.

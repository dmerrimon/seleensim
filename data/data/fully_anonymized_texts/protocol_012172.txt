Title  
A Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694608] .  
 
This project will take place at the University of Chicago .  [CONTACT_225719] E. Grant, MD, JD is the 
Princ ipal Investigator and can be phoned at [PHONE_3567]  or reached by [CONTACT_25541]

This clinical trial will be conducted in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_694609] -approved protocol.  No deviation from the proto col will be implemented without the 
prior review and approval of the IRB except where it may be necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to a research subject.  In such a case, the deviation will be reported to the IRB 
as soon as possible.  
 
Objective   
The primary objective  of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694610]  (BPD ). Eighty  subjects with BPD 
will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]  (starting at 1mg/da y for one week 
and going to 2mg in a fixed dose fashion  after 1 week ) or matching placebo f or 12 weeks  of 
active treatment . The hypothesis to be tested is that Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694611]  (improvement in symptoms will be 
indicated by [CONTACT_694635] ). 
 
Background  of BPD 
Borderline personality disorder is characterized by  [CONTACT_694636], cognitive symptoms, 
impulsive behavior, and  disturbed relationships (1 –3). A variety of psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_694612] (4 –6) and, while research on the use  of medication is ongoing, no drug has been 
approved in  the [LOCATION_002] or elsewhere for its treatment (7). Second  generation  
antipsychotics have been the most intensively  studied  (8–11). Current treatments for BPD  are 
often inadequate. Dialectical  behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce BPD  but finding 
trained psychologists is difficult.  
 
Choice of Medication  
One illness  that is difficult to treat is borderline personality disorder  (12–17), which is 
characterized by a pervasive pattern  of severe psychopathological symptoms with  instability of 
Page [ADDRESS_942258] regulation, impulse control, and aggression  (18-24). Dysfunctions in the serotoninergic 
and dopaminergic systems have been demonstrated in —and considered as possible causes for —
symptoms associated  with the disorder ( 25-28). Several studies on the use of  traditional ( 29) and 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_694613] (3 0–31) have  shown 
a positive effect on individual symptoms ( 29, 32–36). However, we are not aware of any study 
evaluating  Brex pi[INVESTIGATOR_694614]. In the 
proposed  doub le-blind, placebo -controlled study, the influence of Brex pi[INVESTIGATOR_694615].  
 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694616] t make it a promising option for patients 
with BPD . Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_297562] a novel D2 partial agonist , has affinity for [ADDRESS_942259] of the noradrenergic α1/[ADDRESS_942260] for 5 -HT2A 
(37-39).  In addition, because of low rates of side effects, Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694617] a well -
tolerated and  in fact desired medication approach to BPD. 
 
The aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy and safety of Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_123247]. placebo 
in adults with BPD , as indicated by a score of at least 9 on the Zanarini Rating Scale for 
Borderline Personality  Disorder (“Zanarini scale”) , a scale of illness severi ty, at t he baseline 
visit.   
 
Study Design/Methodology   
Eighty  individuals with a prior diagnosis of  BPD  will be recruited for a double -blind, placebo -
controlled  pi[INVESTIGATOR_694618] a 1:[ADDRESS_942261] current BPD  per DSM -5 criteria . Following baseline measures, subjects will 
receive Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]  (1mg/day for one week and then 2mg /day thereafter)  or inactive placebo. 
Participants will be seen every week for the first 2 weeks and then every 2 weeks after that . At 
week 12, subjects will start a 1-week taper off the medication. Efficacy and s afety measures will 
be performed at each visit.   
 
Study Population/Sample Size  
80 male and female outpatients aged 18 -65 with a current primary diagnosis of  BPD . 
 
Subjects  
 Inclusion criteria :  
1) Men and women age 18-65;  
2) Primary diagnosis of BPD

rating Scale (C -SSRS) (www.cssrs.columbia.edu/docs)   
Page 3 of 11  
February 12, 2020  6) Illegal substance use based on urine toxicology screening  (excluding marijuana  given 
the hi gh rates of marijuana use in BPD and the lack of interaction with brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] ).  
7) Initiation of psychological interventions within 3 months of screening   
8) Use of any new psychotropic medication  started within the last 3 months prior to study 
initiati on 
9) Previous treatment with Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]  
10) Cognitive impairment that interferes with the capacity to understand and self -
administer medication or provide written informed consent  
 
Advertisements wil l target this study population. Interested individua ls will be asked to contact a 
study coordinator or complete an online survey expressing interest. Individuals will then undergo 
a phone screen before being scheduled for a first appointment. After being screened, potential 
subjects will be scheduled for a first appointment in which we will confirm medical and 
psychiatric history, laboratory tests, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
Drugs, Dosages, and Regimens   
All subjects w ho are randomized to Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694619] 1mg/day during the first week of 
the study,  and then 2 mg/day for the remain der of the study . Dosage changes and reductions w ill 
not be permitted.  After study conclusion, the dose will be tapered off during a 1-week follow -up 
period.  
 
Randomization  
 
Participants are randomized (1:1) to rec eive placebo or brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694620]. The study blind will be maintained by [CONTACT_46431] -
encapsulation, making placebo and active treatments appear identical in size, weight, shape, and 
color. Dosage changes an d reductions will not  be permitted during the study and participants will 
be discontinued if they experienced intolerance.  
 
Blinding  
 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical 
emergency or pregnancy in  an individual subject, in which knowledge of the investigational 
product is critical to the subject’s management, the blind for that patient may be broken by [CONTACT_47806] . 
 
Treatment Duration, Visit Frequency, and Procedures    
This is a 13-week study  (12 weeks of ac ute treatment followed by a 1-week tapering phase ). 
Subjects will be seen at baseline and then  every week for the first 2 -4 weeks and then  every two 
week s after that . 
 
Assessments at each  visit 
Those subjects who appear appropriate for  the study , based on telephone screening , will be 
invited for a baseline assessment. The duration of the baseline assessment will be approximately 
90 minutes and will include the following:  Informed consent , Demographic data , Concomitant 
medications  (no ps ychotropic medications will be allowed), Family history data , Medical 
evaluation including physical examination , EKG, weight,  and vital signs , Urine pregnancy test 
(for women of childbearing years) and urine drug screen , and a p sychiatric evaluation  (using  the 
following measures: MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview  (40); Depressive symptoms  
will be  rated with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D) (41); Anxiety 
Page 4 of 11  
February 12, 2020  symptom s will be assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) (42); 
Psychosocial functioning w ill be  evaluated using the patient -rated version of the Sheehan 
Disability Scale  (SDS)  (43); Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) ( 44); The Cambridge -Chicago 
Compulsivity Trait Scale (CHI -T); and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) ). 
During the consent process, individuals will be given time to review the consent form and given 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise  before signing the informed consent form . 
Throughout the study, subjects will be aske d questions about the study to ensure that they 
continue understanding study procedures. Blood samples will be collected at both baseline and 
last visits to measure blood sugar , glutathione, and cholesterol levels. All follow -up visits will 
include safety measures (adverse events, vital signs, C -SSRS), weight, BPD  measures, and other 
psychiatric measures.  
 
Due to the pandemic of COVID19, study participants can perform their baseline and follow -up 
visits online using encrypted Zoom instead of in person visit s. All inventories will be assessed. 
Blood samples and urine toxicology, however, will be at the discretion of the study PI. In cases 
where they are considered medically necessary, the participant can have them drawn locally and 
submitted to the study team .  
 
Efficacy evaluation : 
The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline using the Zanarini Rating Scale 
for Borderline Personality Disorder (“Zanarini scale”)  (45).  This semistructured interview has 
anchored ratings (0=no symptoms, 4=severe s ymptoms) on nine items that correspond to the 
DSM -5 BPD criteria. Its subscales will be considered secondary efficacy measures.  
 
Secondary efficacy measures include Modified Overt Aggression Scale (46), the Young Mania 
Rating Scale (47), and the self -repor t version of the Zanarini scale (48), the Borderline 
Evaluation of Severity Over Time (49), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale  (50) the  
Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (51), the Symptom Checklist –90–Revised (SCL -90-R) 
(52), and the scales listed abov e (41 -44). 
 
Cognitive Measures  
Cognitive assessments consist of two previously validated tests taken from CANTABeclipse 
software. The choice of cognitive challenges was based on the clinical features of BPD. The 
order of the tasks will be fixed and partici pants will complete the tasks at first visit (baseline) , 
midway through 13-week timeline , and endpoint.  
 
Cognitive flexibility, i.e., set -shifting, will be measured using the Intra -dimensional/Extra -
dimensional Shift Task (ID/ED task). Participants are pre sented with two stimuli on -screen for 
each trial and attempted to learn an underlying ‘rule’ about which stimulus was correct. Key 
outcome measures will be number of errors made at the intra -dimensional shift and at the extra -
dimensional shift stage.  
 
The Tower of London task will be used to examine executive planning. On each trial of the task, 
subjects observe two sets of pockets each containing three colored balls on -screen. On ‘move’ 
trials, subjects have to attempt to work out ‘in mind’ the minimum nu mber of moves required to 
move the balls in one set of pockets to match a goal arrangement also shown in the other set of 
pockets.  
 
The p robabilistic beliefs task  will allow us to examine the subject’s self -other distinction.  
Participants observe a sequen ce of neutral images on the screen and are occasionally asked to 
Page [ADDRESS_942262]. Participants will be asked to keep track of the images they see 
and make predictions about what will happen next. They will also be asked to keep track of 
anothe r theoretical person’s beliefs about what will happen next. The task will allow us to submit 
self-other distinctions, a potentially important dimension of BPD, to quantitative assessment and 
computational modelling.  
 
Subject Withdrawal  
If a subject withdra ws from the study, all instruments administered at the screening visit will be 
completed at the final visit.  These will be conducted when the subject is able to come in for an 
early termination visit.  Withdrawn subjects will be given the phone number of the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_694621] .   
 
Safety Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using spontaneously reported adverse events data, C-
SSRS, vital signs, and by [CONTACT_694637].   Safety assessments (sitting blood 
pressure, heart rate, adverse effects, and concomitant medications) will be documented at each 
visit. Subjects who are an immediate suicide risk  will be removed from the study and appropriate 
clinical intervention (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be arranged. Study team members are mandated 
reporters and as such, will arrange for the subject to be taken to the emergency room if any intent 
to harm themselves is expressed. Urine pregnancy tests will be perform ed at the initial visit . 
Subjects who have a positive urine pregnancy test will be excluded from the study. Assessment 
of side effects will be done at each visit.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Unanticipated  (unexpected) problems/events , those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the consent form, or not part of an underlying disease , will be reported to the IRB as 
soon as possible .  The same will be done for serious problems/events and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], are possibly, probably or definitely related  to the research procedures.  A follow -up 
report will also be submitted to the IRB with any documentation related to a previously 
submitted adverse event.  
 
Risks  
Participants  may experience side effects while taking the drugs used in t his study. Side effects 
are usually reversible when the drug is stopped but occasionally continue and may cau se serious 
complications, if subjects  experience any side effects, they will be asked to  contact [CONTACT_694638].  
 
There may be other  risks that could arise which are not reasonably foreseeable. If new 
information becomes avai lable which could influence their  willingness to continue, this new 
inform ation will be discussed with the participant . 
 
While taking the study drug, the subject’s  condition may remain the same or worsen due to no 
effect of the study drug.  
 
Risks of Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694622]:  
 Weight gain  
 Inner sense o f restlessness (feeling like one  need s to move)  
 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_694623]:  
Page 6 of 11  
February 12, 2020   Stroke in elderly people  
 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (high fever, stiff muscles, sweating, changes in 
pulse, heart rate and blood pressure)  
 Tardive dyskinesia (uncontrollable body movements)  
 High blood sug ar 
 Low white blood cell count  
 Decreased blood pressure  
 Seizures  
 Problems controlling y our body temperature so that the individual  feel too warm  
 Difficulty swallowing that can cause  food or liquid to get into the  lungs  
 
Risks of Electrocardiagram  
If subject s are asked to get an ECG, they may have some discomfort when the electrodes (soft 
patches attached using adhesive tape) are removed from their chest and limbs. There is a 
possibility they could develop a minor rash when the electrodes were placed. This ra sh should go 
away without treatment.  
 
Risks of blood draws  
Needle sticks can cause discomfort, pain, burning sensation or bruising.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
1. Responsibility for Data and Safety Monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_694624] m onitoring the integrity of study data and 
participant safety.  
2. Procedures for Monitoring Participant Safety  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_161599].  
 A number of elements of the  research plan are intended to minimize the risks of 
study participation. If subjects become actively suicidal with intent and plan to 
kill themselves, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221632] -study 
treatment. Any participant endorsing su icidal thoughts with intent and plan will be 
immediately evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_161602] a higher level of care if clinically 
indicated.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221633], as 
such issues arise. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221634] a written report summarizing any 
decisions that are made pertaining to participant disposition.  
 Data integrity and confidentiality will be safeguarded as discusse d above in the 
Data Management and Statistical Analysis section under Research Methods.  
 
Monitoring Committee  
We will establish a monitoring committee and define in detail its role, its composition, and its 
operating procedures for reviewing patient safet y and data from this study.  The monitoring 
committee , comprised of two individuals independent of personnel involved in the study, 
including a p sychiatrist and a statistician, will come together via conference call yearly. The 
committee will use a standar dized approach employing contemporary bio statistical, 
psychiatric/psychological, and ethical principles to review study design and interim data every 
year. The committee will audit the records from the study and will ensure the data are being 
collected, m anaged and protected. The committee will have the ability to ask for more frequent 
Page [ADDRESS_942263] study outcome.  
3. Reporting Adverse Events  
 Any serious adverse event will be repor ted to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) at the University of Chicago  in a full written report within 10 working days 
of the event.  For fatal/life -threatening serious adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221636].  
 Any moderate ad verse event which appears definitely, probably, or possibly 
related to study participation will be reported to the University of Chicago IRB in 
writing within 20 working days.  
 Any mild adverse event will be summarized in the IRB annual progress reports.  
 
Data Analysis  
Data analysis will involve all visit s during  the 12-week  double -blind treatment phase (up until 
week 12). Data from the tapering phase (weeks 12 -13), although collected, will not be included 
for purposes of the primary goal of this study.  
 
All enrolled  subjects w ill be  included in the analyses of baseline demographics and safety 
according to an intent -to-treat (ITT) principle . For statistical analysis, the full -analysis set w ill be  
defined as all participants who took at least [ADDRESS_942264] 1 follow -up safety 
assessment.  
 
The statistical model will be a linear mixed -effects regression model (LME) that includes terms 
for treatment group, time, and treatment -by-time interaction.  The analyses will run using the 
nlme package on R for Windows (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria; http://www.r -projec t.org). 
Literature suggests LME without imputation may provide more accurate and stable results than 
LME models using fixed and multiple imputation methods for handling missing data, so no 
imputation will be undertaken for missing data. All tests of hypoth eses will be performed using a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05.  
 
Sample Size  
The sample size was calculated for the primary endpoint of change from baseline . Assuming a 
similar magnitude of effect seen in other studies of medications for BPD , it was determined that 
[ADDRESS_942265] a difference with an overall 
5% type -I error risk. Given the particularly low rates of adverse events reported with 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] , as well as its more positive side effect pr ofile in terms of sexual side effects,  we 
expect few drop -outs from the study  and therefore a smaller sample is needed .  
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA regulat ions 21 CFR 312 for IND studies and FDA guidance E6) for all studies.  
Applicable government regulations and University of Chicago  research policies and procedures 
will also be followed.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_942266] (IRB) for formal approval to conduct the study.  The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator.   
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_5040].  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained 
before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.  This consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_24492], and the investigator -designated research professiona l 
obtaining the consent.  
 
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_694625].  Subjects will be seen at the University of Chicago .  Patient binders will be kept i n a 
locked room only accessible to research staff.   
 
Estimated Total Costs/Budget  
$400,000.  
 
Publication/Presentation Schedule  
These data  will be presented at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology  (ACNP) , 
the American Psychiatric Association ann ual meeting, or the NCDEU annual meeting. The 
resulting article will be submitted to a peer -reviewed publication (e.g., American Journal of 
Psychiatry, Biological Psychiatry) within 3 months of study completion.

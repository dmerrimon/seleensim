Study Title  
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing to Improve Gynecologic Cancer Surgery 
Outcomes : Aim II  
Objectives  
The overall aim  of the study is to field-test implementation strategies  of the Mindful 
Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention  that ha s been adapted to the eHealth Format . 
To accomplish this  aim, we will adopt mixed -methods to iteratively refine eMMB 
implementation strategies in 10 -15 women who undergo surgery for a suspected gynecologic 
malignancy.   
Design and Outcomes   
We propose a  one-arm feasibility  study  to iteratively refine the eMMB  implementation 
strategies with 10 -15 consecutive participants enrolled . Participants will be asked to complete 
a brief usability questionnaire about their confidence in their ability to complete the 
intervention, satisfaction, and concerns. Other study as sessments will be given at four time 
points: before surgery, one day after surgery, two weeks after surgery and [ADDRESS_112852] with 
interventionists,  adverse events,  and completion of assessments. Changes will be made  to 
design of the eMMB  based on feedback  and then tested in the next 5 patients. No power 
analysis is necessary for this Aim; however, the number of participants will depend on when 
a consensus is reached on a manual for implementing interventions.  
 
Interventions and Duration  
An in-person MMB intervention investigated in our preliminary r esearch will be adapted in 
the proposed research to be implemented by [CONTACT_101938] . The initial dose of the eMMB  
intervention will include a call to invite participants to initiate additional guidance upon 
request prior to surgery and a meeting with the par ticipant via videoconferencing the day 
following surgery. Participants will also be given a self -directed video  to be used  before 
surgery and  daily for two weeks following surgery.  The approximately 20 -minute eMMB will 
teach: (a) Awareness Meditation - noticing the current state of the body, emotions, thoughts, 
energy, and breath ; (b) Movement –gentle movements coo rdinated with the breath; (c) 
Breathing and Relaxation - placing the hands above the navel and noticing them rise and fall 
with a focus on slightly extending the exhale; (d) Awareness Meditation – 5 minutes of 
awareness of noticing the natural breath witho ut changing it to enhance mindfulness. The 
intention to maintain attention or mindfulness (sthira), comfort and ease (sukha) is 
highlighted throughout the eMMB.  
Sample Size and Population  
The target population of the proposed research is adult women sche duled to undergo surgery 
for a suspected gynecologic malignancy at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer 
Center (WFBCCC).  We will enroll 10-[ADDRESS_112853] implementation strategies  of the Mindful 
Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention that has been adapted to the eHealth 
Format. To accomplish this aim, we  will adopt mixed -meth ods to iteratively refine 
eMMB implementation strategies in [ADDRESS_112854] (64%) experience considerable pain,2 yet 
management of postoperative pain is still inadequate.3 For exam ple, less than half of 
patients who underwent surgery for cancer felt their postsurgical pain was relieved by 
50% (on scale from 0 -100%).9 In addition, many of these women also report 
postoperative sleep disturbances (39 -70%),2,4 and psychological distress (20%),2,5 
both associated with pain.2,6–[ADDRESS_112855] -treatment, the prevalence of chronic 
pain is estimated to be up to 40% among post -treatment cancer survivors15 and 
women with cancer report more severe pain than do men.16 Due to the increasing 
numbers of patients surviving cancer for longer periods of time, pain management is a 
chronic problem with guidelines for treatment similar to treatment of chronic pain in 
the general population.17 These guidelines recommend use of multimodal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101899] a stated preference for n onpharmac ologic therapy  (including mind -body 
techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation)  and nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_101900] .14,18 However, the level of evidence for use of such modalities is only 
moderate .14,19 Additional fully -powered randomized controlled trials of 
nonpharmacological interventions compare d to active control groups are needed . 
Similarly, adverse effects of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_101901].17,20,21 
Indeed, one study reported that 29% of cancer patients were at high risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422]21 and women respond differently to pain medication such that they use more 
postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_101902].13,[ADDRESS_112856] on pain relief.19 Pain has sensory (e.g., location, 
physical characteristics) and affective dimensions (e.g., unpleasantness, appraisal of 
consequences); interventions to alleviate both may be more effective than those that 
address only the sensory aspects of pain.23,24 Mind -body interventions, are commonly 
sought after nonpharmacological approaches for addressing pa in, sleep disturbances, 
and psychological stress, particularly in cancer patients.13,25,26 Specifically, yoga is 
gaining popularity,27 and there is a generally positive impression of and curiosity 
about yoga.28 Yoga is a promising interv ention to simultaneously improve such 
aspects of pain, and associated symptoms (i.e., sleep disturbances, psychological 
distress). The key elements of yoga are movements, breathing exercises, and 
meditation.29 Empi[INVESTIGATOR_101903] e efficacy of yoga as an intervention for 
reducing pain,30–32 sleep disturbances,33 and psychological distress,34,35 in a variety of 
populations36 and in studies  specific to cancer survivors.37–[ADDRESS_112857] cancer or studies of yoga for low back pain.30,41 There are limited studies 
investigating the efficacy of yoga for other cancer types or perioperatively.  
 
Yoga has a potential advantage over other perioperative interventions (i.e., relaxation, 
hypnosis)32,42 because it has multiple components that also support the goals of usual 
care (e.g., to encourage early postoperative ambulation and deep breathing via 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) and thus may help treat other surgical c omplications.43–45 Usual 
care to manage pain includes teaching patients to splint the abdomen by [CONTACT_101939] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_101904], allowing them to perform these 
functions with less pain and monitoring pain every four hours on a scale from 0 -10 
([ADDRESS_112858] pain) to ensure that adequate pain medication is given. Early 
postoperative ambulation aims to reduce postoperative il eus (bowel obstruction) and 
deep venous thrombosis (blood clots ). Deep breathing via incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_101905]. About 30% of 
women undergoing surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy hav e a surgical 
complication (e.g., postoperative ileus, deep venous thrombosis, pneumonia );46,47 
these contribute substantially to costs.8,46 Research supports that yoga breathing 
practices improve lung function36,48 and yoga movements increase mobility (i.e., 
balance an d flexibility).36 Further, c ombining awarene ss with movement is a method

methods that are taught while still.49 Thus, adding  yoga to usual care may be helpful 
for postsurgical pain in a number of ways.  
 
Proposed mechanisms of effects of yoga on pain and co -morbid symptoms.  A 
Self-Regulation Framework50,51 proposes both psychological (e.g., mindfulness , self -
efficacy) and physiological (e.g., relaxation, ambulation, deep breathing) explanations 
for the positive influence of yoga, which primarily affects psychological and physical 
well-being through reducing the stress response. One component of the Self -
Regulation Framework proposes that cognitive appraisals such as self -efficacy for 
managing pain30,52,[ADDRESS_112859] of learning self -regulation 
skills (i.e., yoga) on pain. A recent study also suggested that mind -body interventions 
likely address pain through a mechanism di fferent than opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536], potentially 
providing a self -regulation strategy that works with medication in an additive fashion 
to improve pain management.[ADDRESS_112860] . A growing body of lite ratures supports the idea that behavioral skills can be 
taught through information technology (eHealth).[ADDRESS_112861] been quantitatively evaluated specifically for people w ith cancer; 
thus their efficacy for cancer patients is unclear.56,[ADDRESS_112862].56 EHealth addresses barriers to participation such as 
accessibility (e.g., one treatment can be utilized by [CONTACT_101940]), 
travel distance, and dissemination (e. g., increased treatment fidelity).56  

EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 10 of 38                                                                      4.20.18   
Some research supp orts that adherence to treatment offered through behavioral 
internet interventions (e.g., for improving depression, physical activity) is as good as 
adherence to face -to face interventions.58,[ADDRESS_112863] important when the 
treatment focus is on providing skills training.60 In addition, the Supportive 
Accountability model suggests that the influence of these interaction factors on 
adherence may be moderated by [CONTACT_101941] “bandwidth” (i.e., 
the number of communication cues a medium can convey). Although some suppose 
that as the bandwidth lessens, the quality of interaction factors lessens, this is not 
always so, people can effectively communicate through various media.  Thus, the 
optimal level of content guidance and communication medium to implement 
behavioral interventions is yet to be determined.56,60 
2.2 Study Rationale  
The proposed Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention adapts 
key elements of a longer intervention (about 10 weeks61) to a shorter format . 
Yoga implemented as traditional (often longer) group classes has demonstrated 
efficacy for reducing pain,31,[ADDRESS_112864] shown that interventions to reduce pain, sleep 
disturbances and psychological distress such as cognitive -beha vioral therapy, 
Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction (Co -I Zeidan), and yoga (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906]) can be 
successfully adapted to be brief.62–[ADDRESS_112865]. Danhauer (Co -
Investigator)61 in a manner that may be easily adapted to other perioperative and 
cancer populations. This approach aims to design an intervention with promise for 
future dissemination.66 
 
The proposed Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB ) intervention is 
implemented perioperatively. Although other yoga studies have been implemented 
in clinical settings, these studies either did not exclusively evaluate yoga67 or the yoga 
interventions were not brief.40,68 The eMMB is designed to improve upon previous 
interventions with its brevity and its adaptation to the acute needs  of patients 
undergoing surgery for cancer. In addition, the eMMB will potentially contribute to a 
shift in the paradigm of yoga, which has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_101907] a complementary medicine modality (a separate practice used toget her with 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 11 of 38                                                                      4.20.18  usual care), to become a component of integrative medicine (incorporated into usual 
care in a coordinated way).[ADDRESS_112866] in perioperative yoga (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906], Co -I’s: Danhauer & Tooze).  To 
investigate patient interest in our proposed study, we surveyed 9 women who were in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101908].70  Of 20 
women approached, 10 (mean age = 51 years; 89% White) agreed to complete the 
survey. Reasons that w omen declined participation included: not interested (n=8); 
non-cancer related health issues (n=1); other (n=1);  plus one screen failure. 
Participants indicated on a scale from 1 (not useful) to 10 (useful) that they expected 
that the described “Yoga Skills Training” (YST) would be useful for reducing pain 
(M=6.7; SD=2.5) and distress (M=6.9; SD=2.0). They also provi ded feedback on the 
intervention name [CONTACT_101958] ‘yoga’ might deter some potential 
participants. The average length of time women reported being willing to participate 
in a YST session was [ADDRESS_112867] popular format 
selected for independent 
practice (n=4), followed by [CONTACT_398] 
(n=2), written material (n=1) 
and other (n=2). Thus, the 
proposed intervention is called 
“Mindful Movement and 
Breathing” and will primarily be implemented via a 20 -minute video.  
 
Perioperative yoga feasibility (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906], Co -I’s: Danhauer & Tooze). “Mindful 
Movement and Breathing (MMB)” describes the gentle physical activity in this 
intervention compared to other typ es of yoga. The MMB was designed for patients 
receiving chemotherapy71 and then tested in this non -randomized trial to determine 
feasibility of the MMB (three 20 -minute in person sessions) am ong women 
undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a suspected gynecologic malignancy (60% 
ovarian; 20% uterine; 20% cervical).65 Type of surgery was the primary reason for 
exclusion (86%) since we did not include less invasive surgeries (e.g., robotic). Of 18 
eligible women approached, 10 (age M = 54.7 years; 90% White) enrolled in the 
study (55% recruitment) . Seven women were retained in the study and no adverse 
events were reported . Only five women received the MMB pre -operatively due to 
scheduling challenges. Participants completed two Visual Analogue Scale items of 
pain and distress immediately before and after each MMB  (average session = 20.6 
minutes) . Pain and distr ess decreased with moderate to large effects  (Table 1 ). On a 
scale f rom 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) patients liked the MMB (M = 4.29, SD = 
0.76), found it helpful (M = 3.71, SD = 0.95), and planned to continue to use what 
they learned (M = 3.71, SD = 1 .11). These data support feasibility of testing the 
MMB in these patients, but revealed challenges to consistent  implementation of the 
in-person MMB before surgery . Therefore, the proposed intervention will utilize an 
eHealth approach to test whether adher ence would be greater. In addition, the 
proposed study will also include women scheduled for less invasive types of Table 1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_101909]

Strategies for di sseminating yoga (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101910]).  Two other prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_101911], depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances.61,[ADDRESS_112869] NCI Community 
Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base  of women undergoing 
chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer (N=40) to investigate the feasibility of 
more broadly implementing this prom ising intervention (Co-I: Sohl) . The primary 
difficulty was the need for specially trained teachers at each site.73 We then pi[INVESTIGATOR_101912], which allowed participants (N=5) to take part 
in study classes from a convenient location and two -way interaction with inst ructors

offered twice weekly during the [ADDRESS_112870] increased their participation or 
otherwise improved their experience; however, participants did like the staying at 
home for the interventions. Participants also wanted more variety in the schedule and 
shorter classes . The proposed research will utilize videoconferencing only when 
participants have assistance from research staff. Home practice sessions will be 
shorter (20 -minutes) and implemented via simpler technology. Future directions for 
the proposed research will employ [CONTACT_101959]’s experience with NCORP 
(U10CA081851) .  
 
Efficacy  of a brief mind -body intervention for reducing pain (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101913]). A 
brief mindfulness meditation intervention (four 20 -minute training sessions)  was 
significantly more effective at reducing pain than two well -validated placebo 
interventions (placebo cream , sham mindfulness mediation).74 Yet, all had 
significantly reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings compared to the 
control group (reading). Sham mindfulness meditation (participants trained to take 
deep breaths and led to believe they were practicing mindfulness) was associated with 
greater reductions in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], demonstrating a mechanistic difference between 
sham and mindf ulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation –related pain relief was 
associated with greater psychological executive -level modulation of pain and, in 
contrast, sham mindfulness meditation –induced analgesia was driven by 
[CONTACT_101942] . Similar instructions 
for nonjudgmental attention to the breath, and instructions for taking deep breaths to 
slow breathing, will be incorporated into the eMMB to optimize the influence of the 
intervention on pain reduction.  
3. STUD Y DESIGN   
The proposed research will field-test implementation strategies  of the Mindful 
Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention that has been adapted to the eHealth 
Format. To accomplish this aim, we  will adopt mixed -methods to iteratively refine 
eMMB  implementation strategies in 10 -15 women who undergo surgery for a 
suspected gynecologic malignancy.   
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 13 of 38                                                                      4.20.18   
We propose a  one-arm feasibility study to iteratively refine the eMMB implementation 
strategies with 10 -15 consecutive participants enrolled . Participan ts will be asked to 
complete a brief usability questionnaire about their confidence in their ability to 
complete the intervention, satisfaction, and concerns. Other study assessments will be 
conducted at four time points: before surgery (baseline), one day  after surgery, two 
weeks after surgery and [ADDRESS_112871] with interventionists, 
adverse events, and completion of assessments. Changes will be made to design of the 
eMMB  based on feedback and then tested in the next 5 patients. No power analysis is 
necessary for this Aim; however, the number of participants will depend on when a 
consensus is reached on a manual for implementing interventions in the next phase of 
the study . 
 
The i n-person MMB intervention investigated in our Preliminary Research will be 
adapted in the proposed research to be implemented by [CONTACT_101938].  The initial dose of the 
eMMB will include a call to invite participants to initiate additional guidance upon 
request prior to surgery and a meeting with the par ticipant via videoconferencing the 
day following surgery. Participants will also be given a self -directed video to be used 
before surgery and daily for two weeks following surgery .  
 
The approximately 20 -minute eMMB will teach: (a) Awareness Meditation - noticing 
the current state of the body, emotions, thoughts, energy, and breath ; (b) Movement –
gentle movements coordinated with the breath; (c) Breathing and Relaxation - placing 
the hands above the navel an d noticing them rise and fall with a focus on slightly 
extending the exhale; (d) Awareness Meditation – 5 minutes of awareness of noticing 
the natural breath without changing it to enhance mindfulness. The intention to 
maintain attention or mindfulness (st hira), comfort and ease (sukha) is highlighted 
throughout the eMMB.  
 
The total length of time each participant will be on study is approximately [ADDRESS_112872] (IRB) prior to 
implementing the proposed study and take precautions to ensure adequate protection 
of human subjects.  Recruitment of women scheduled to undergo surgery for a 
suspec ted gynecologic malignancy at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer 
Center (WFBCCC) will be facilitated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kelly (Co -Investigator). To increase 
homogeneity, only the most prevalent gynecologic malignancies will be recruited (i.e. 
uterine, ovarian) that occur in only women. We chose this target population because

experiencing chronic pain.13 In addition, this sample reduces variability due to sex 
differences in pain tolerance75 and response to pain medication.13 There are multiple 
theories that may explain these differences. Of particular note is the “vulnerability 
theory”, which posits that sex  hormones affect the nervous system’s and 
psychological responses to pain.[ADDRESS_112873] meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.  
 Adult females (≥18  years of age)  
 Scheduled for an abdominal gynecological surgery (i.e. uterine, ova rian) to 
remove a mass that is suspected to be malignant  
 Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 
≤1 
 Cognitively able to complete assessments as judged by [CONTACT_3476]  
 Able to understand, read and write English .  
4.2 Exclus ion Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will 
be excluded from study participation:  
 
 Have schizophrenia or any other psychotic disorder;  
 Have a diagnosed sleep disorder including untreated obstructive sleep apnea, 
periodic limb movement dis order, or restless leg syndrome.  
  
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures   
Individuals scheduled to undergo surgery for suspected gynecologic malignancies 
(i.e., uterine, ovarian) will be recruited from the Wake Forest Bapti st Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (WFBCCC). To identify potential patients, the Project Manager will 
screen appointment lists and communicate with attending physicians regarding 
patients’ potential eligibility for  the trial. Members of the clinical care team will then 
inform patients of the study verbally and share the study contact [CONTACT_3031]. Subject 
recruitment will be documented in a Screening Log including reasons for ineligibility, 
eligible patients approached, number w ho declined participation, and number 
successfully recruited.  
 
If the patient is interested, research staff  will approach or call interested patients prior 
to surgery to explain the protocol, answer questions, determine eligibility, and discuss 
informed co nsent.  After making sure the patient clearly understands the study 
procedures and agrees to follow them, the patient will be asked to sign the informed 
consent form in person  (Appendix A: Informed Consent Document) . A copy of the

5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB)  will be administered individually  via 
telephone and video con ference for initial guidance  and is primarily  intended to be  
self-directed (video).  We considered the style, delivery, components of the 
intervention, specific class sequences, facilitation of home practice, dose, dealing 
with modifications, selection of i nstructors, and measurement of intervention fidelity, 
as recommended in the development of a yoga intervention for a randomized trial.76  
Style.  The content of the eMMB  was informed by [CONTACT_978]’s training from the 
Integral Yoga Academy’s Yoga for People with Cancer Teacher Training and Urban 
Zen Integrative Therapy training, and was refined for this study by [CONTACT_101943][INVESTIGATOR_101914] t radition (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wheeler, 
Consultant) and an expert in instructing mindfulness for reducing pain ([CONTACT_101960], 
Co-Investigator).  Expert yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101915] (e.g., pain) and places an emphasis on daily home 
practice.77,78 Furthermore, the eMMB aims to promote mindfulness and relaxation.   
Delivery components and class sequence . The approximately 20 -minute eMMB 
will teach: (a) Awareness Meditation - 2 minutes of noticing the current state of the 
body, emotions, thoughts, energy, and breath. Brief meditati on has been shown to be 
effective for decreasing pain,79 sleep disturbance80 and psychological distress81 and 
will increase mindfulness to facilitate safe physical movements; (b) Movement  – 10 
minutes of gentle movements coordinated with the breath also aim to enhance 
mindfulness to reduce pain, facilitate bowel movement (to prevent ileus) and blood 
flow (to prevent deep venous thrombosis); (c) Breathing and Relaxation  - 3 minutes 
of placing the hands above the navel (rather than on the belly to avoid discomfort) 
and noticing them rise and fall with a focus on slightly extendi ng the exhale to induce 
relaxation. This practice aims to improve lung capacity (to reduce pulmonary 
compromise) and reduce pain, sleep disturbance and psychological distress; (d) 
Awareness Meditation  – 5 minutes of awareness of noticing the natural breath  
without changing it to enhance mindfulness. The intention to maintain attention or 
mindfulness ( sthira ), comfort and ease ( sukha)  is highlighted throughout the eMMB. 
We also propose that teaching these skills will increase self-efficacy for pain 
managemen t through providing successful pain management experiences.  
Dealing with modifications.  The movements were chosen to be appropriate 
following surgery. Each session contains the same content, but the number of 
repetitions and the magnitude of movements are self-adapted based on how the 
participant is feeling. Any medical restrictions are within the scope of the eMMB.  
Selection of instructors.  Yoga instructors (one primary, two back -ups) will be  
contracted employees, accredited (i.e., certified as at least 200-hour-level  teachers 
with the Yoga Alliance) and experienced teaching patients with medical conditions . 
 
Dose and Implementation of eMMB . A 20 -minute eMMB video will be saved as a 
local file  on study tablets and will be accessible via the internet  (participants will be 
given the option to receive a link to the study video via text message or email) . 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 16 of 38                                                                      4.20.18  Participants will also be given a written description of the eMMB practice. A lthough 
guidance (i.e., supportive accountability60) is important in promoting adheren ce to 
eHealth interventions, one study of a stress -management intervention found that 
adherence -focused guidance (e.g., email reminders, guidance upon request by 
[CONTACT_4317]) was as good as more resource intensive content -focused guidance.[ADDRESS_112874] at any time 
throughout the study and meet with the participant via videoconferencing using Cisco

participants on the eMMB  as described in the prior section  (5.1) .  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions   
5.3.1  Allowed Interventions  
All participants  will continue with routine treatment of medical conditions including 
medications.  
5.3.2  Required Interventions  
No additional interventions are required except for those propose in the protocol.  
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 17 of 38                                                                      4.20.18  5.3.3  Prohibited Inter ventions  
 There will be no prohibited medications  among patients in this study.  Prior approval 
of participation in other behavioral intervention studies is required.   
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence will be assessed by: (1) Completion of the videoconference session; (2) 
any additional contact [CONTACT_101945]; (3) use of the self -directed 
intervention: measured daily for one week before and one week after surgery as 
assessed in anot her yoga study38 and self -reported retrospectively (in the past week) 
at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. Instructors will  directly observe and document 
adherence to the videoconference session . We will consider adequate adherence to 
protocol if 70% participants complete the planned video conferencing session  1 day 
before  and 3 or more days of home practice per week  for the t wo weeks following 
surgery .

participants will be provided a tablet computer to borrow  (unless they already have a 
device tha t they prefer to use)  for the study and receive training on completing 
questionnaires either online or by [CONTACT_756], similar to a training successfully 
implemented in a study of symptom monitoring in this patient population.[ADDRESS_112877] longer -term pain. Daily diaries 
are one method for measuring an experience in a participant’s  natural setting with low 
patient burden.[ADDRESS_112878] demonstrated reasonable 
compliance (86%) with electronic diary assessment89 and daily assessments after 
gynecologic oncolo gy surgery (68% compliance).87 Participants will be prompted to 
complete the surveys (3 -5 minutes) at approximately 6:00pm each evening and can 
complete the survey any time before they go to sleep. A paper guide with response 
options for the questionnaire will be provided to improve comprehension over the 
telephone. Participants will also be given a wrist actigraphy device and instructions 
for its use during this same time period s.  
 
Patient -reported questionnaires wil l be conducted at four time points: before surgery 
(baseline), one day after surgery (only 15 -items to reduce burden), two weeks after 
surgery and 4 weeks after surgery. In addition, demographic data will be patient -
reported at baseline, medical records will be reviewed  to obtain clinical data  and an 
interview conducted at a follow -up clinic visit or by [CONTACT_756]. Participants will be

patient clearly understands the study procedures and agrees to follow them, the 
patient will be asked to sign the informed consent form in person. A copy of the 
consent form will be given to the participant, and the original copy wil l be kept in the 
participant’s file. We will also let participants at the time of consent that it is their 
choice whether or not visitors remain in the room during the intervention and ask if 
they have a preference.  
Screening  
Screening evaluations will begin once a patient is scheduled for a consultation related 
to receiving surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy . The allowable range of 
time for screening is up to one year prior to study entry and baseline assessment. 
Electronic medical records of patients planning to receive chemotherapy will be 
reviewed by a study team member  to identify potential patients that meet enrollment 
criteria. This screening will consist of: 
 Review of medical history  
 Review of treatment plan  
 
Research staff  will approach patients either in person or remotely (e.g., telephone, 
myWake Health , mail ) regarding their interest in study participation . For patients 
interested in the study, research staff will verify eligibility through patient interview 
regarding medical history.  
 
6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
Enrollment is defined as the date all of the screening criteria are met and the 
individual agrees to participate.

Baseline Assessment s 
For participants who have successfully been screened for  eligibility and are enrolled 
into the study, baseline assessments will be performed. The baseline assessment may 
be completed within two weeks prior to surgery.   
 
 Assessment Completion/Retention.  Percent completion of planned standard and 
daily assessmen ts. 
 Pain.  The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS) measure of pain of intensity (i.e., How would you rate your pain on 
average?) , which has been adapted  for assessing pain on a numeric rating scale 
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst  imaginable pain) “in the last day,”90 is the proposed 
primary outcome (at 2 weeks) for the future larger clinical trial that will be 
informed by [CONTACT_74556]. Patient -reported pain is considered the ‘gold 
standard’ for pain assessment since pain is a subjective experience and PROMIS 
is supported by [CONTACT_101946].91,92 Pain interference, 
the affective dimension of pain, and analgesic use will be assessed using  a total of  
9 patient -reported i tems. Pain interference  will also be assessed with a PROMIS 
measure (6 -items).90 The affective dimension of pain  will be assessed with one 
item on a scale from 0 (not bad at all) to 10 (the most unpleasant feeling possible 
for me).84,91,[ADDRESS_112881] -surgery (postoperative day 1 to 7) and converted to a cumulative 
analgesic consumption score for analysis  (2-items) .94 We will also ask 
participants if they are taking any analgesic medication postoperatively.   
 Sleep Disturbance  will be assessed with a PROMIS Sleep Disturbance short -form 
(8-items)95 adapted for daily use.  
 Psychological Distress.  The PROMIS Depression (8 -item) & Anxiety (7 -item) 
adapted short -forms will be used to assess psychological distress “in the last 
day.”90 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 21 of 38                                                                      4.20.18   Pain Sel f-Efficacy  will be assessed with the  pain management subscale of the  
Chronic Pain Self -Efficacy Scale,96 which has been used postoperatively (5 -
items).97 
 Daily Symptoms  will be assessed for  1 week  before surgery starting at the 
preoperative visit and one week after surgery starting on postoperative day 1 
using 4 items on pain  (2), disturbed sleep, and distress. The same  adapted  
PROMIS pain intensity  and affective dimensi on of pain  items will be asked and 
sleep disturbance and psychological distress items will be used from the MD  
Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) , which asks about each symptom  at “its 
worst” in the past 24 hours  from the MDA SI designed to be implemented d aily98 
and used perioperatively.87 
 Sleep Disturbance  will also be assessed with actigraphy , a non -intrusive 
alternative to the traditional polysomnography when monitoring sleep.[ADDRESS_112882]/activity patterns in a 
natural setting, and provides summary measures of daily sleep activity. Sleep 
disturbance will be defined as a dail y ratio of circadian disruption (the ratio of 
nighttime activity to daytime activity; higher scores show greater circadian 
disruptions). A similar device and the same ratio has been used in patients 
perioperatively.100 Participants will also self -report their bed , rising times daily.101  
 Demographic Factors.   Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, ability 
to pay for the basics, distance travelled for care, medical history, previous use of 
mind -body practices , baseline level of mindfulness,  and internet access will be 
self-reported at baseline.  
 Clinical Factors.  Cancer site, type of surgery stratified by [CONTACT_66443],102 date diagnosed, 
other cancer treatments, comorbidities, height, weight, prescription medications 
for pain, sleep, depressive symptoms, and anxiety will be abstracted from medical 
charts at baseline.

Not applicable.  
 
6.2.4 Follow -up Visits  
The timing of study assessments is summarized in Table 1. P ostoperative day 1 
assessments may be completed within 3 days after surgery. The two-week and 4 -
week assessments can be tim ed with in -person follow -up visits, which may be 
scheduled within a week of the scheduled assessment.  Descriptions of additional 
measures not assessed at baseline include:  
 Adherence.  Completion of the videoconference session .  
 Interventionist Communication.  Any additional contact [CONTACT_101945] . 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 22 of 38                                                                      4.20.18   Intervention Home Practice . Use of the self -directed intervention (time and 
duration) will be measured daily for one week  before and one week  after surgery 
as assessed in another yoga study .38 Self-reported time of practice will also be 
assessed retrospectively (in the past week) at postoperative weeks 2 and 4 . 
 Expected Benefit.  The HEAL Treatment Expectancy measure 6 -items)103 will 
assess expected benefit of the intervention following the videoconference session.  
 Usability. Participants will be asked to complete questions about their confidence 
to complete the intervention, satisfaction, and concerns following the 
videoconferen ce section  on postoperative day one or as soon as feasible . 
 Acute Adverse Events.   Participants will also be asked to complete two   Visual 
Analogue Scale  items assessing pain intensity and psychological distress  daily 
with the instructions to report their experience  “right now,” immediately before 
and after the intervention to detect any acute adverse events.65 
 Patient Provider Connection will be measured with a 7 -item short -form from the 
Healing Encounters  and Attitudes Lists (HEAL)103 at the 4 -week follow -up visit.  
 Clinical Factors.  Medications prescribed for pain, length of stay, complications, 
and oth er cancer treatments, will also be abstracted four weeks post -surgery.  
 Acceptability Interview.  This interview will be designed to identify any 
technological issues and maximize the usability of the eMMB by [CONTACT_101947].60 
 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Assessment s to be performed at the participant’s final visit are described in the prior 
section.  Participants who discontinue study the intervention early will require no 
specific evaluations. The reason for discontinuation will be documented. We will 
contact [CONTACT_101280] -up data remotely if they discontinue participation 
due to change in treatment location. Patients terminated from the study will undergo 
no further monitoring once they have stopped the study intervention.   
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Expected adverse experiences for each study intervention are as follows:  
            EMindful Movement and Breathing  
 Emotional discomfort  
 Muscle soreness  
 
Active Control  
 Emotional discomfo rt  
 
Participants will also be asked to complete two items assessing pain intensity and 
psychological distress “right now,” immediately before and after the 
videoconferencing intervention to detect any acute AEs. Each interventionist will 
monitor and note any adverse events experienced during the videoconferencing (e.g., 
patients’ experience of disturbed breath, expression of physical/emotional 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.[ADDRESS_112883] to discontinue the in -person intervention sessio ns). In 
addition, study staff will ask participants if they experienced any problems when 
doing the home practices and review notes from the home practice logs  at follow -up 
visits . Instructors  will have phone numbers for the triage nurse and Cancer Support  
Services available  to give to patients  as referral s if patients tell them about any 
clinical issues  that arise . Study staff will also document in the electronic patient 
records using a telephone note if a referral number was provided.  
  
Two or more advers e events attributable to the interventions will prompt 
modification of the protocol.

of adverse events, some which included participants during the perioperative 
period.40,65 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101917] 10 participants with the 
proposed yoga intervention implemented perioper atively in -person at WFBCCC from 
05/2012 – 05/2013.65 There were no adverse events observed related to the yoga 
practice in this study.  
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.[ADDRESS_112885] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).   
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ f or expedited reporting 
purposes only.   
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly  related  to the study intervention.  
- Probable – The AE is likely  related  to the study intervention.  
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study intervention.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study intervention.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study intervention.  
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.[ADDRESS_112886] on the 
patient. An AE will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the 
patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor inconvenience, and “sev ere” if 
it causes a substantial disruption to the patient’s well -being.  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study 
intervention. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely unrelated, definitely related, 
proba bly related, or possibly related to the study intervention.  
Only AEs and SAEs possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study intervention 
or measures will be captured with the exception of unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 
events, which will also be documented and reported.  
 
Interventionists will document and report solicited AEs including physical or 
emotional discomfort. Research  staff will report AEs according to data safety 
monitoring plan. Events will be documented including date of event whi ch will avoid 
double capture.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101250]’s emotional and physical reactions during all regular study meetings 
with the interventionists and offer referrals by [CONTACT_101948]-Investigators wh en 
appropriate . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101251], probably, possibly or unrelated. AEs reports will be distributed to the 
Independent Monitoring Committee ( IMC) electronically via email.  
 
The IMC will monitor and review adverse events and events that may be related to 
the intervention. This will include verification that, when indicated, these events have 
been reported to the appropriate agencies (e.g. IRB, NCCIH) and that such reports 
have  been made in a timely manner. Non -serious adverse events will be reviewed on 
a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_27904]. The IMC will be notified of serious adverse events 
within 24 hours of occurrence and reviewed within 48 hours.  
 
SAEs that are unanticipated, seriou s, and possibly related to the study intervention 
will be reported to the IMC, IRB, and the National Center for Complementary and 
Integrative Health (NCCIH) by [CONTACT_101283].  The CCC -
WFU Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC ) will also review unexpected 
grade 4 and all grade 5 events regardless of their attribution.  
 
 Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be 
reported to the NCCIH Program Officer within 7 days. Other serious and 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 25 of 38                                                                      4.20.18  unexpected AE s related to the intervention will be reported to the NCCIH 
Program Official within 15 days.  
 Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be 
reported to the Independent Monitor(s), IRB, NCCIH, and other oversight 
organizat ions in accordance with their requirements. In the annual AE summary, 
the Independent Monitor(s) Report will state that they have reviewed all AE 
reports.  
7.5 Followup  for Adverse Events  
AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_101284] [INVESTIGATOR_101252], resoluti on, and ongoing 
toxicities that may be related to the intervention. Documentation and reporting for 
follow -up AEs will occur according to reporting procedures described in Section 7.4. 
The duration for follow -up will be for the length of the study period w hile 
participants are enrolled in the study. If non -serious adverse events are related to the 
interventions, then the protocol will be modified to avoid adverse events. If the 
frequency of non -serious adverse events is higher than anticipated or alters the  benefit 
risk ratio, the study investigators, after conferring with IMC, will also modify the 
protocol.  Two or more specific adverse events among participants will prompt 
modification of the protocol.            
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
The Independent Monit oring Committee (IMC) for this study is comprised of the 
Wake Forest School of Medicine’s Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
members who have expertise in clinical trial methodology and conduct, biostatistics, 
ethics, and clinical research. The  Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
members are not part of the key personnel involved in this grant. They are qualified to 
review the patient safety data generated by [CONTACT_101285], menta l health/ethics and statistics.  
Study progress and safety will be reviewed quarterly (and more frequently if needed). 
Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be 
provided to the Independent Monitor(s) following ea ch of the quarterly reviews. An 
Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In 
addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -
study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; ( 3) whether all participants 
met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that 
additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) 
conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771] . The Annual Report 
will be sent to the Independent Monitor(s) and will be forwarded to the IRB and 
NCCIH . The IRB and other applicable recipi[INVESTIGATOR_101253]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101918](s) or Chair of the IMC to the NCCIH  
Program Officer within 1 month of each monitoring review.

The intervention will be discontinued for a participant if: (1) the intervention is 
associated with an adverse effect for a specific participant ( i.e., participant  does not 
tolerate the intervention ), (2) the participant  no longer is interested or willing to 
receive the intervention or parti cipate in the study, or ( 3) the participant’s healthcare 
provider no longer recommends that the patient receive the intervention for medical 
reasons. The IMC and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101919].  
This study will be st opped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated 
with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty 
in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the 
study e ndpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that 
necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur that might warrant 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101920] N IH and will consult with the study monitors to assess the impact of 
significant data loss due to problems in recruitment, retention,  or data collection.  
 
Participants will be followed with their permission if the study is discontinued. The 
duration of follow -up will be length of the proposed study. We will continue to 
document adverse events during the follow -up period.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
The primary goal of the  analysis of these measures for this Aim will be to iteratively 
refine the eMMB implementation strategies and  inform future study design. No 
formal hypothesis testing will be done.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
No power analysis is necessary for this Aim; however, t he number of participants 
(N=10 -15) will  depend on when a consensus is reached on a manual for 
implementing interventions in the next phase of the study.  We will continually track 
retention throughout the study and modify the protocol as necessary to reduce the 
drop-out rate. If the drop -out rate is >56% in the last 10 participants enrolled (the 
lower bound of a 1 -sided 95% confidence interval is 30%, indic ating that it is 
unlikely the true rate is less than 30%), then we will continue to accrue participants 
and refine the protocol until the drop -out rate falls below 56%.

variables (i.e., recruitment, adherence, data collection, retention, adverse events ) will 
be conducted on a rolling basis as the study progresses. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101922] (IMC) . We anticipate 
recruitment on average of 3 patients per month completing enrollment over 7 months.   
 
Futility analyses for efficacy or safety  will not be conducted in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  SAE’s 
related to the intervention will suspend enrollment and/or the study intervention until 
a safety review is convened (either routine or ad hoc) by [CONTACT_101949], proceed with caution, be further 
investigated, discontinued, or be modified and then proceed. If SAEs events are 
related to the interventions, then the relevant intervention protocol will be modified to 
avoid adverse events.  If the frequ ency of non -serious adverse events is higher than 
anticipated or alters the benefit risk ratio as determined by [CONTACT_101291], the study 
investigators will also modify the relevant intervention protocol. Two or more 
specific adverse events among participa nts will prompt modification of the protocol.     
9.[ADDRESS_112887] 5 participants, Drs. Wagner (CRED  Shared Resource ), Sohl (PI) and 
Danhauer (Co -I) will convene to review the data. Changes will be made based on 
feedback and then tested in the next 5 patients. The number of participants (N=10 -15) 
will depend on when a consensus is reached on a manual for implementing 
interventions in the next phase of the study.  
 
This study will provide quantitative data on recruitment, adherence, assessment 
completion, adverse events and retention rates to guide future study planning . We will 
calculate  95% confidence intervals for each of the feasibility measures to determine 
the range of estimates that are consistent with our data. We will track the number of 
screened participants, those who are eligible, and the percent who agree to participate. 
EHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing, Version 5.0 28 of 38                                                                      4.20.18  For th ose not meeting the eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The 
proportion of participants and corresponding 95% CI for participants who participated 
in the eMMB sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed; 
we will also calc ulate the percent of participants who complete the 4w visit to assess 
retention. In exploratory analyses, we will compare participants who are non -adherent 
or who drop out by [CONTACT_101950], intervention group, and baseline 
scores of the measu res. We  will also  investigate any differences in participant 
recruitment, adherence, assessment completion, retention rates , adverse events  or 
acceptability by [CONTACT_101951] a future study.  
 
Baseline analyses will include descriptive statistics of pain (i.e., intensity, 
interference, affective, analgesic use), sleep disturbance (patient -reported), 
psychological distress,  background characteristics (i.e., demographic) and other 
possible confoundin g variables (e.g., type of cancer, type of surgery, medications) by 
[CONTACT_65237]. The distributions of continuous variables will be examined to 
determine the presence of outliers and whether transformations are necessary for 
analysis. The primary goa l of the statistical analysis of these measures for this Aim 
will be to estimate standard deviations (SD) for use in future studies. No formal 
hypothesis testing will be done. We will also examine the validity of the patient 
report for intervention practic e by [CONTACT_101952] -report 
of MMB practice and the activity level on the accelerometer.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.[ADDRESS_112888] ID numbers , will be stored in a locking cabinet at WFB CCC or in  
the PI’s office building  while on s tudy. Data from these questionnaires , clinical data 
from the medical chart  and data collected via daily automated surveys  will be entered 
into a REDCap database  at Wake Forest University . The actigraphy data, audio 
recor ded semi -structured interviews and videos of the intervention sessions will also 
only be coded by [CONTACT_32221].   
 
All participants will be assigned a study ID number; however, it is necessary for the 
study team to know participants names during time on -study. Names will be 
maintained in a participant tracking database accessible only to approved study staff 
through pa ssword protected files stored on a secure server, not on laptops or thumb 
drives. To protect confidentiality, all data will be stored in a locked file cabinet 
located in the secured office of a study team member  or PI . All computers and data 
files will be password protected.  All data processed will be in aggregate form and 
data collection forms will only be labeled with participant’s unique identification 
number.

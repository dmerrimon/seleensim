  NUMBER OF SITES  [ADDRESS_554931] shown  how the treatment with 
NorFlo® (curcumin -phospholipid (Meriva® 600mg)) 2 tablets  daily  in 
128 patients in combination with  conventional  therapy is capable of 
reduc ing the relapses  in patients with  recurrent anterior  uveitis (RAU)  
by 88%.  The enrolled subjects suffered from uveitis of different 
etiologies, among which were found three main different etiological 
groups: herpetic uveitis, autoimmune inflammatory ocular disease and 
various origin anterior uveitis. Among these three groups, th e most 
sensitive patients to the  treatment were autoimmune RAU (n=56).  
These extraordinary  results  lay the groundwork for further investigating  
the effectiveness  of curcumin -phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_437872] -
B27-associated uveitis , which  represent s the most common type of  
uveitis  (75% of total  uveitis ). NORFLO® ORO  aims at  obtain ing an 
anti-inflammatory effect  that is synergistic  to conventional ther apy to 
counteract  the occurrence of secondary symptoms (as cystoid macular 
edema) of HLA -B27-associated uveitis.  
 
  STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled 
study.  
 
  PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To explore the efficacy of NORFLO® ORO in reducing the number and 
severity  of relapses, when compared to placebo.  The reduction of the 
mean number of relapses per patient between the year before study 
treatment and the study period will also be assessed.

  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis  Mean and standard deviation will be used to describe the number of 
relapses per patient. The mean number of relapse s per patient will be 
compared between the treatment groups using Student’s t -test. 
ANOVA will be used to adjust for predictive/confounding variables.  
In addition, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) will be used to 
assess the effects of the treatment on reducing the number of relapses.  
The average and the maximum intensity will be c ompared between 
treatment groups using Student’s t -test. ANOVA will be used to include 
predictive/confounding variables in the model.   
The mean number of relapses per patient observed during the study will 
be compared to the mean number of relapses reporte d during the 
previous year within each treatment group using paired t -test or 
ANOVA, to eventually adjust for predictive/confounding variables . 
The two endpoints will be assessed in a hierarchical order.  
 
Secondary Analysis  The incidence of side effects associated HLA -B27-associated  uveitis, 
such as IOP, cystoid macular edema, keratopathy and synechia, will be 
compared between treatment groups using logistic regression.  
The changes in BCVA and symptoms measured by [CONTACT_437920], with the baseline 
level included in the model.

Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554943] updated version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary to 
give a preferred term (PT) and a system/organ class term (SOC) for 
each. Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_17673]. Tables will 
include the number of patients who experienced at least one AE, of 
study product -related AEs (defined as definitely, probably, possibly, or 
unrelated), of serious AEs, and the number of patients withdrawn due 
to AE, summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. Comparisons between treatment 
arms will be performed using chi -square test. Concomitant medications 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_437921]. Vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_437922]. 
Compliance to the study treatment will be assessed through the patient 
diary and checked versus the used and unused study product containers 
given back by [CONTACT_13935].  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  With a statistical power of 80%, a significance level (alpha) of 5% and 
a common SD of 0.7, 46 patients are needed to observe a difference of 
0.6 relapses/patients between the two treatment groups (2 
relapses/patient in the NORFLO® ORO treatment group  vs. 2.6 in the 
placebo treatment group). To take into account a potential dropout rate 
of 20% over 1 years, 60 patients will be recruited.  A second primary 
endpoint, i.e. the reduction of mean number of relapses between the 
year before treatment and the s tudy period , will be examined. These 
two endpoints will be assessed in a hierarchical order.

Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554944] human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype association with inflammatory disease s 
was discovered in [ADDRESS_554945] rated, including many ocular diseases and systemic diseases with specific 
ocular manifestations1. These diseases also include reactive arthritis (previously referred to 
as Reiter ’s syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseas e, and psoriatic arthritis.  
In ophthalmology, HLA associations are strongest in diseases of the uvea. Of patients with 
uveitis, 19 -88% have the HLA -B27 phenotype, depending upon the study population cited. 
Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) may occur as a disti nct clinical entity or in conjunction with a 
group of autoimmune rheumatic diseases called ser onegative spondyloarthropathies2. By 
[CONTACT_108], patients with these diseases have a negative rheumatoid fact or, hence the term 
seronegative 3-4.   
An HLA disease association is defined as a statistically increased frequency of the HLA 
haplotype in individuals with the disease compared to the frequency in individuals without 
the disease. This is expressed as a relative risk. For example, HLA -B27 appea rs in 80 -90% 
of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Expressed as a relative risk, an HLA -B27 positive 
individual is approximately 87 times more susceptible to developi[INVESTIGATOR_437877].  
 Disease Pathophysiology  
The HLA system is genetically encoded in humans by [CONTACT_437923] (MHC), which is found 
on chromoso me 6, and plays a determining role in 
immunity and in self -recognition  (autoimmunity)  in 
virtually all cells and tissues, with the exception of 
erythrocytes5.   
Three classes of gene products are encoded within the 
small region of the major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC). Class I MHC molecules include HLA -A, HLA -B, 
or HLA -C (Figure 1 ) and serve as the antigen -presenting 
platform for CD8 or cytotoxic T cells. Cla ss I molecules 
are present on all nucleated cells. Class II MHC molecules, 
the HLA -D region, serve as the antigen -presenting cells for 
CD4 or helper T cells.  Macrophages and dendritic cells are the important class II antigen -
Figure 1- The HLAB gene is located on 
the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 at 
the position 21.3

 Page 16 of 67 
 presenting cells. Class I and class II molecules allow antigen presentation to the specific T -
cell receptor via specific structural groove s in their tertiary structure. 
Autoimmune/inflammatory conditions can occur if mutations in the groove -binding site of 
class I and II molecules occu r, leading to inappropriate binding to self -peptides or certain 
environmental peptides.  
The actual role of HLA -B27 in triggering an inflammatory response causing disease s is still 
not precisely known. The molecular mimicry  is the oldest theory , in which a n autoimmune 
response is mounted initially against a peptide derived from an infectious agent and is 
subsequently directed against self-peptides  due to epi[INVESTIGATOR_437878] -B27. At least two self -peptides have been iden tified in patients with 
ankylosing spondylitis, which supports this hypothesis.  
A second theory, referred to as the HLA -B27 misfolding hypothesis, is based on a peculiar 
biochemical property of the HLA -B27 molecule. Unfolded HLA -B27 proteins accumulate 
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  and trigger a  proinflammatory stress response that is 
called the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ERUPR). As a result, 
interleukin 23 (IL -23) is released, activating a proinflammatory response via interleukin -17-
secreting Th17  T lymphocytes.  
Another potential pathological mechanism of HLA -B27 is called the HLA -B27 heavy chain 
homodimer hypothesis. It is suggested that B27 heavy chains dimerize and accumulate in the 
endoplasmic reticulum. In turn, this initiat es the proinflammatory ERUPR. In addition, B27 
heavy chains and dimers can bind to other regulatory immune receptors such as the natural 
killer receptors (NKRs). This in turn recruites proinflammatory leukocytes and triggers the  
production of proinflammato ry mediators.  
Alternative theories claim the T -cell antigen as the susceptibility factor or other  innate system 
etiolog ical mechanisms that are  unrelated to HLA. Finally, HLA -B27 may simply represent 
a marker locus, closely linked to the yet unidentified immune response gene that is truly 
responsible for the inflammatory response6.  
Several hypotheses to explain the association of AAU and HLA -B27 have been tested in 
animal models . Many cases of uveitis or reactive arthritis follow gram -negative bacillary 
dysentery or chlamydial infection. These gram -negative organisms include Shigella, 
Salmonella, Klebsiella,  and Yersinia  species. Similarities in the gram -negative cell wall 
lipopolysaccharide present in these microbes may explain their immunogenicity. Animal 
experiments with rodents that have been genetically altered to express human HLA -B27 
molecules show that bacterial infection of the gut predis poses the animals to arthritis and to 
a reactive arthritis –like syndrome. In addition, chronic intracellular chlamydial joint or eye 
infection might stimulate, via the HLA -B27 molecule, a CD8 T  cell effector mechanism that 
was activated to kill the infect ed cells but that also indirectly injures the eye7.

subtypes . Some HLA -B27 subtypes are associated with other HLA -B27 inflammatory 
diseases such as an terior uveitis. The HLA -B27 antigen  is present in only 1.4 -8% of the 
general population (higher in certain Native American groups and Scandinavians). Of 
patients with acute anterior uveitis, up to 50-60% of patients are  HLA -B27 positive. Both 
racial backgr ound and country of origin affect th e rate of incidence  of HLA -B27 associated 
acute anterior uveitis  (AAU) . In specific, t he frequency of HLA -B27 anterior uveitis is lowest 
in blacks, intermediate in Asians, and highest in whites8.  
HLA -B27 associated AAU is the most frequent type of endogenous uveitis and it account s 
for 18 -32% of all anterior uveitis cases in western countries and for 6 -13% of all anterior 
uveitis cases in Asia. The relatively lower frequency of AAU in Asia is relat ed to the lower 
frequency of HLA -B27 found in this population. As mentioned, there are varying global 
patterns of HLA -B27 associated AAU that may be attributed to different genetic factors, such 
as HLA -B27 polymorphisms and non -MHC genes. These geographic variations may also 
exist because of yet unidentified pathogenic environmental factors.  
Studies indicate that HLA -B27 associated uveitis is a distinct clinical entity characterized by 
a male predominance and frequent association with seronegative arthritic  syndromes, such 
as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel 
disease9.  
The first epi[INVESTIGATOR_437879] -B27 associated AAU most commonly occurs in patients aged [ADDRESS_554948] 50-60% are HLA -B27 positive. The first AAU epi[INVESTIGATOR_437880] a benign 
non granulomatous unilateral disease presenting as a classic triad of pain, redness, and

keratopathy, characterized by [CONTACT_437924][INVESTIGATOR_2130], may be 
seen in chronic uveitis. The anterior chamber of the eye shows cells and flare, which appears 
as a haze upon  slit lamp examination, and which reflect s 
protein accumulation in the anterior chamber of the eye 
due to the breakdown of the blood -aqueous barrier . In 
severe inflammation, fibrinous exudate in the anterior 
chamber of the eye may cause apposition of the iris to 
the lens or anterior vitreous, preventing aqueous from 
flowing  and occlud ing the pupil, causing iris bombe as

However, there is not trend between u veitis  and spondyloarthritis  i.e. a joint inflammation  is 
not always  associated with  an ocular inflammation or viceversa . 
Different  clinical forms  may be present : 
- Patient has  uveitis  and HLA -B27  + but not ankylosing . 
- Patient has  ankylosing , uveitis  and HLA -B27 -. 
- Patient has  ankylosing  HLA -B27  + and concomitant  exacerbations  or not.  
 
Diagnosis  
A careful history and physical examination usually helps distinguish between the uveitic  
entities associated with a systemic disease and with HLA -B27 from those that are not 
associated with HLA -B27. Disease entities causing AAU are varied and include traumatic 
iritis, postcataract  extraction iritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, herpetic infection (both 
herpes simplex and herpes zoster), syphilis, sarcoidosis, Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, 
glaucomatocyclitic crisis, Behcet disease, and low -grade endophthalmitis11.  
The diagno sis of  HLA -B27 associated anterior uveitis is clinical.  However , blood chemistry  
and diagnostic tests  are necessary for a differential diagnosis : 
- HLA -B27 typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The role of HLA -B27 testing in patients with unilateral AAU is 
important in the differential d iagnosis. The lack of HLA -B27 antigen in unilateral AAU 
may be a clue for the clinician to search for other specific uveitis entities and other 
systemic diseases. It also may be useful in determining the prognosis of AAU, as AAU 
associated with HLA -B27, ev en in the absence of a systemic disease, is less favorable 
when compared with that of patients who are HLA -B27 negative.

Treatment  
Medical management of AAU includes topi[INVESTIGATOR_437882]. Periocular corticosteroid injections are extremely useful in acute, recalcitrant, 
or noncompliant cases, particularly when posterior segment involvement occurs . 
Immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary in refractory cases or in those patients with 
corticosteroid -induced adverse effects. The primary goal of the treatment is to eliminate all 
cells, thereby [CONTACT_437925], cystoid ma cular edema, 
hypotony or glaucoma.  
Cycloplegics help relieve photophobia, secondary to ciliary spasm, and prevent /break 
synechiae formation. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of uveitis therapy, but they should be 
used prudently due to their adverse effect s. The treatment goal is to use the minimum amount 
of corticosteroids necessary to control inflammation and to prevent complications. 
Aggressive initial therapy may hasten recovery and limit the duration of therapy. 
Prednisolone acetate 1% given every hour  is strongly recommended for acute presentations. 
Usually, 2 -3 weeks treatment at maximal frequency is suffic ient to completely eliminate all 
cells. Always discontinue corticosteroids by [CONTACT_437926] . 
Corticosteroids may be administered  by 4 routes, including topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], periocular, intraocular 
(intravitreal), and systemic. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_437883]. The dosing varies 
from hourly to once daily. Occasionally, severe inflammation may not respond and may 
require periocular, i ntraocular, or systemic corticosteroids  treatment , especially if the 
posterior segment is involved. Periocular corticosteroids are usually given as depot injections 
in the sub -Tenon space. Intravitreal corticosteroids by [CONTACT_437927] a 
sustained released device have been shown to be useful in the treatment of both chronic 
uveitis and uveitic cystoid macular edema.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be administered orally or intravenously. These are especially 
beneficial when the systemic disea se requires therapy as well. More potent 
immunosuppression may be required in patients with vision -threatening inflammation 
interfering with activities of daily living, lack of response to corticosteroid treatment, and 
intolerance of corticosteroids12.

future novel therapeutic approaches  should target the specific mechan isms unde rlying the 
immune response and will include utilization of compounds that target cytokines, 
chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and T -cell subsets.  
 
Complications  
AAU generally runs a short course of a few days to weeks and up to 3 months, with a 
tendency to recur in the same eye, especially in individuals who are HLA -B27 positive. 
Complications of AAU include:  
- Posterior  subcapsular  cataracts  
- Open and close angle glaucoma   
- Keratopathy  (Figure 5 ) 
- Posterior synechiae  (Figure 3 ) 
- Cystoid macular edema and retinal vasculitis (Figure 4 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The prognosis of HLA -B27 associated anterior uveitis , either with or without systemic

  Overview of NORFLO® ORO  
NORFLO® ORO is based on curcumin -phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_437885] -
inflammatory and the anti-edema effect s. 
Curcumin is the yellow pi[INVESTIGATOR_437886] ( Curcuma longa L.) , the most popular spi[INVESTIGATOR_437887] a major ingredient of curry powders. In the Western  diet, turmeric is 
mainly used as a food additive to color  dairy products. Because of the different use (spi[INVESTIGATOR_437888]. 
food additive), the dietary intake of curcumin in the Western diet is negligible,  but it can 
reach as much as 150 mg/d ay in the Indian diet 14. 
Turmeric has a long history of medicinal use in India, and because it may be ben eficial for 
many  conditions , turmeric is  a veritable panacea . Modern cellular studies on curcumin have 
validated most of its indications in traditional medicine, even expanding the potential of 
curcumin to genetic diseases associated with  Caucasian s15. Curcumin shows strong anti -
oxidati ve and anti -inflammatory effects . In the past two decades , over [ADDRESS_554954] focused on unravelling the role and the benefits of curcumin in 
various chronic diseases, including diabetes and cancers, as well as autoimmune, 
cardiovascular, neurological and psychological diseases.  
 
Curcumin modulates the inflammatory response by [CONTACT_100276] -regulating the activity of 
cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2), lipoxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) 
enzymes; inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor -
alpha (TNF -a), interleukin (IL) -1, -2, -6, -8, and -12, monocyte che moattractant protein 
(MCP) and migration inhibitory protein; down -regulates mitogen -activated and Janus 
kinases17-18. 
 
Curcumin, just like most dietary phenolics, is sparingly soluble both in water and in organic 
solvents, but has polar groups (two phenoli c hydroxyl and one enolic hydroxyl) that can 
interact via hydrogen bindings  and polar interactions with complementary group, like the 
polar heads of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Phosphatidylcholine has a highly polarized head, the negative 
charge of a phosphate group an d the positive charge of the choline ammonium group . 
Therefore,  the phosphatidylcholine head  can complex a variety of poorly soluble phenolics, 
including curcumin. Phenolic  like curcumin show a high affinity for biological membranes . 
Once formulated with p hospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], curcumin is  embedded into their lipi[INVESTIGATOR_437889] -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554955] 2019  
 Page 22 of 67 
 shield s it from hydrolytic degradation . The rapid exchange of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_437890], allows shuttling curcumin from the 
phospholipid carrier into the biological membranes , increasing curcumin uptake by [INVESTIGATOR_100372] .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NORFLO® ORO contains a patented formulation of curcumin and phosphatidylcholine 
enriched soy lecithin  (Phytosome – Meriva®) 19. Curcumin and phosphatidylcholine  form a 
non-covalent adduct when mixed in a 1:2 weight ratio . Further, t wo parts of microcrystalline 
cellulose are added to improve flowability  of the powder. The  overall content of curcumin is 
around 20% and its bioavailability  is increased  20-21. Phytosome® has been sh own to increase 
the hydrolytic  stability of curcumin and to increase the oral absorption of curcumin by [CONTACT_46431] 
20 folds.  
By [CONTACT_437928][INVESTIGATOR_805], curcumin is 
shielded from water -triggered degradation while, at the same time, the rapid exchange of 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_437891], boosting its cellula r uptake  (Figure 6). The improved 
oral bioavailability of curcumin as Phytosome® has been confirmed by  [CONTACT_437929] . Clinical efficacy of Phytosome® in the treatment of inflammatory 
conditions has been proven at dosages significantly lower than those of unformulated 
curcumin 22 confirming its higher bioavailability  (Figure 7).

 Meriva® 
has shown an improved bioavailability compared to uncomplexed curcumin in rats. 
Male Wistar r ats received 340 mg/kg of either unformulated curcumin or curcumin 
formulated with phosphatidylcholine ( Meriva®) by [CONTACT_16759]. Rats were euthanized 15, 30, 
[ADDRESS_554958] administration  of the compounds . Plasma, intestinal mucosa and 
liver were analyzed  for the presence of curcumin and metabolites using HPLC with UV 
detection. Identity of curcumin and metabolites was verified by [CONTACT_437930]/tandem mass spectrometry. Peak plasma levels and area under the 
plasma concentration time curve (AUC) values for parent curcumin after administration of 
Meriva® were fivefold higher than the AUC of  unformulated curcumin. Similarly, liver levels 
of curcumin were higher after administration of Meriva® compared to unformulated 
curcumin. The results suggest that curcumin formulated with phosphatidylcholine provides 
higher systemic levels of parent agent than unformulated curcumin.  The improved 
bioavailability does not translated into an increased toxicity. Just like curcumin, the acute 
oral toxicity of Meriva ® in rats is higher than 2 g/Kg23.  
Colorectal tumor -bearing mice with oxaliplatin -resistant cells were treated with Meriva® 
alone and in combination with oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin -resistant HCT116 p53wt and p53( -/-) 
cell lines  were generated and the effects of oxaliplatin in combination with curcumin on 
resistance - and proliferation -associated proteins investigated. Eighty nude mice were 
implanted with HCT116 p53wt colorectal cancer cells before randomization into the 
following  treatment groups: control, Meriva only, oxaliplatin only, Meriva® + oxaliplatin. 
Meriva® in combination with oxaliplatin was able to decrease the proliferative capacity of 
oxaliplatin -resistant p53 wt and p53  (-/-) cell lines more effectively than oxalipla tin alone. 
Meriva® in combination with oxaliplatin  also decreased expression of markers associated 
with cell proliferation. After 21 days of treatment in the xenograft model, the order of 
treatment efficacy was Meriva® + oxaliplatin  > Meriva® > oxaliplatin > control. The decrease 
in tumor volume when compared to vehicle -treated animals was 53, 35 and 16%, 
respectively. Meriva® did not adversely affect the DNA -platinating ability of oxaliplatin. On 
the other hand, c urcumin enhanced the cytotoxici ty of oxaliplatin in models of oxaliplatin 
resistance in vitro . In vivo , Meriva greatly enhanced oxaliplatin efficacy, without affecting 
the mode of action of oxaliplatin. Therefore, a ddition of formulated curcumin to oxaliplatin -
based chemotherapy regimen s has the potential for clinical benefit  in colorectal cancer24. 
 Overview of Clinical Studies  
 
The efficacy and tolerability of curcumin -complex was evaluate d as an adjunctive  therapy to 
traditional treatment . Curcumin -phosphatidylcholine complex ( Meriva®/NorFlo ) was 
administered twice a day in recurrent anterior uveitis of different etiologies. The study group 
consisted of 106 patients who completed a 12 -month follow -up therapeutic period. The 
patients w ere divided into three main groups based on the  uveitis origin: group 1 
(autoimmune uveitis), group 2 (herpetic uveitis), and group 3 (different etiologi es of uveitis). 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554959] 2019  
 Page 24 of 67 
 The primary end point was the evaluation of relapse frequency in all treated patients, before 
and after Meriva® treatment, followed by [CONTACT_941] n umber of relapses in the three etiolo gical 
groups. The secondary end points were the evaluation of relapse severity and of the overall 
quality of life. The results showed that Meriva® was well tolerated and could reduce eye 
discomfort symptoms and signs aft er a few weeks of treatment in more than 88% of patients. 
There was also an improvement in symptoms and signs associated with relapses after 
Meriva® treatment, including improvement in ocular pain, blurring of vision, pericorneal 
hyperemia and aqueous or v itreous cells, and flare in 42% of patients. In conclusion, this is 
the first study t hat report s the potential therapeutic potential of curcumin and its efficacy in 
eye relapsing diseases, such as anterior uveitis, and points out that curcumin  treatment ma y 
be beneficial also in other eye inflammatory and degenerative conditions, such as the dry 
eye, maculopathy, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy25.  
The improvement of diabetic microangiopathy and retinopathy was evaluated in 38 diabetic 
patients treated w ith Meriva®. Inclusion criteria for the study were established d iabetes for 
at least 5 years and signs of retinal edema and peripheral microangiopathy. Meriva® was 
administered at the dosage of 2 tablets/day (each tablet containing 500 mg Meriva® 
correspon ding to 100 mg curcumin) for a period of at least [ADDRESS_554960] 
management plan, while the control  group (n = 39) followed the standard management plan 
alone. All subjects (treatment and controls) completed the follow -up period, there were no 
dropouts and Meriva® showed an optimal tolerability. At 4 weeks  after starting the treatment , 
microcirculatory and clinical evaluations indicated an improvement of microangiopathy. In 
terms of peripheral microangiopathy, in the Meriva® supplemented group, there was a 
significant improvement in the venoarteriolar response (p<0.05) and a decrease in the score 
of peri pheral edema (p<0.05), a sign typi[INVESTIGATOR_437893]. At the retinal level, high -resolution duplex scanning, used to measure retinal flow, 
showed improvements in the Meriva® supplemented patients. The evaluatio n of retinal 
edema (Steigerwalt ’s scale) showed an improvement indicated by  [CONTACT_437931] 
(Snellen scale). There were no clinical or microcirculatory improvements in the control  
group . These preliminary observations indicate that curcumin  administ ered in a bioavailable 
form such as Meriva®, is beneficial for  the management of diabetic microangiopathy and 
retinopathy26. 
In addition to its anti -inflammatory activity, Meriva® has been anecdotally reported to 
decrease acute pain in patients with variou s chronic diseases. Curcumin can desensitize the 
transient receptor potential A1  (TRPA1) , a noci ceptor-specific ion channel , which mediates 
the analgesic effect of acetaminophen . Further curcumin can  inhibit and downregulat e the 
expression of cyclo -oxygenase 2  (COX -2), the selective target of nimesulide, a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent . Building on these effects of curcumin , we carried out a pi[INVESTIGATOR_437894] -relieving properties of curcumin com pared to 
acetaminophen and nimesulide . At a dose of 2 g (corresp onding to 400 mg of curcumin), 
Meriva® showed analgesic properties that were  comparable to those  of a standard dose (1 g) 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554961] 2019  
 Page 25 of 67 
 of acetaminophen, but lower than a therapeutic (100 mg) dose of nimesu lide. The analgesic 
activity of lower doses  (1.5 g) of Meriva® was less satisfactory, displaying longer  onset of 
activity than that of nimesulide for both doses. On the other hand, gastric tolerability of 
Meriva® was significantly better than that of nimesulide and comparable with that of 
acetaminophen. Taken together, the se results suggest that the analgesic properties of 
curcumin have clinical relevance, at least at a dose of 2 g when administered in the Meriva® 
formulation. While this dose is signif icantly higher than that used to relieve chronic 
inflammatory conditions (1 –1.2 g/day), its pain -relieving activity could benefit from the 
general downregulation of the inflammatory response induced by [CONTACT_398310], considering that 
the TRPA1 -mediated mechanis ms of anal gesia are  magnified by [CONTACT_437932]. In patients treated with  Meriva, this would also translate into better control of 
acute pain, providing a rationale for the analgesic properties associated with this specific 
curcumin formulatio n27. 
In a three -month study, Meriva® was able to decrease joint pain and to improve joint function 
in 50 patients  with osteoarthritis (OA) . Since OA is a chronic condition requiring prolonged 
treatment, the long -term efficacy and safety of Meriva were inve stigated in a longer (eight 
months) study involving 100 patients  with OA . The clinical end points were complemented 
by [CONTACT_437933] a series of inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL] -1beta, 
IL-6, soluble CD40 ligand [sCD40L], soluble vascu lar cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) -1, 
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]). Significant improvements of both the clinical end 
points and biochemical markers were observed for the Meriva treated group compared to the 
control group. Th ese results , coupled with an excellent tolerability, suggest that Meriva® may 
be beneficial  for the long -term complementary management of OA28. 
[ADDRESS_554962]. Allegri ’s team  has shown  that treatment of 128 patients with NorFlo® 
(curcumin -phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (Meriva® 600mg) 2 tablets/d ay) in combination with  conventional  
therapy was capable of reduc ing the 88% of relapses  in patients with  recurrent anterior  uveitis 
(RAU)  (Figure 8).  The enrolled subjects suffered from uveitis of different etiolo gies. The 
three main different etiological groups  of enrolled subjects were  herpetic uveitis, 
autoimmune inflammatory ocular disease and various origin anterior uveitis. A few months  
after starting the treatment , a significant  improvement in symptoms  associated with relapse , 
like the ciliary  pain,  blurred vision , hyperemia  and the presence  of aqueous  humor  cells was 
observed  in 42% of  the treated patients . Only 8%  of the patients  worsened  and required  other 
treatments , such as  sub-Tenon space  injection s. Among the three groups  of RAU etiology , 
the patients that were most sensitive to the  treatment with NorFlo® belonged to  the 
autoimmune RAU  etiology  (n=56) 26.

Relapse of uveitis is defined as an occurrence of anterior chamber cells of grade 1+ or higher 
according to the Studies of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. In cases in whi ch view of the 
anterior chamber is impaired by [CONTACT_437934], a relapse will be defined as new 
corneal findings of endothelial inflammatory deposits or edema obscuring the anterior 
chamber in the absence of other causes of corneal edema and c ombined with two or more of 
the following features:  conjunctival hyperemia, photophobia, decreased vision, or pain.  
 
These extraordinary  results  provide the rationale to further study  the effectiveness  of 
curcumin -phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_437872] -B27-associated uveitis , which  represent s the 
most common type of  uveitis  (75% of total  uveitis ). NORFLO® ORO  will provide a 
synergistic  anti-inflammatory effect  and will counteract  the occurrence of  cystoid macular 
edema , which is the  most serious  complication s associated with the  HLA -B27-associated 
uveitis . We expect  that treatment with  NORFLO® ORO  will reduce recurrence  of anterior 
uveitis in patients with HLA -B27-associated  uveitis by [CONTACT_437935] , and the side effects  related  to the pathology  (cystoid macular edema, synechia, 
keratophathy ) overall improving  the quality  of life of the treated patients . 
The study will be conducted by [CONTACT_4859] a group of control patients and diagnostic 
ophthalmologic analysis, including a nalysis with  the Kowa Laser Flare Meter instrument 
(LFM ).  
The role of intraocular inflammation in the disruption of the blood -aqueous barrier leading 
to the spreading of proteins and inflammatory cells into the aqueous humor  has been well 
documented . To evaluate and grade this kind of inflammatory leakage (flare) in the anterior 
chamber  (AC)  of the eye the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) is generally 
used. Grading, which ranges between 0 and 4+, is unreliable and not useful to detect and giv e 
a correct measurement of AC inflammation because it relies on the subjectivity of evaluation 
and the nonlinear grading of flare at the slit -lamp , therefore subjected to high variability .  
Currently, the only system that allows to quantitative ly, reproduc ibly and objectively 
measure intra -ocular inflammation is the Kowa Laser Flare Meter (LFM ) instrument . Such 
instrument  includes a photomultiplier that amplifies the intensity of the light scattered by

 small molecules (flare) or larger particles (inflammato ry cells) in the aqueous humor . The 
information is then processed by a computer  and the result is expressed in photon counts per 
millisecond  (ph/ms).  
LFM  instruments can quantify back -scattered light both from small molecules and from 
larger particles such as inflammatory cells.  
LFM  measurements may be unreliable in eyes with extensive posterior synechiae or mature 
cataract due to increased background scattering of light. Seven measurements are usually 
obtained, the highest and lowest values are discard ed and the mean and standard deviation 
of the remaining five readings are automatically calculated. Patients do not experience any 
pain or discomfort during measurements. Aqueous  flare intensity has been found in the range 
of 2.9 –3.9 ph/ms in healthy indiv iduals between [ADDRESS_554965] 
been found to increase slightly with age, reaching 5.0 –6.5 ph/ms in subjects between 70 and 
80 years of age. Flare values < 10 ph/ms are considered normal.  
Effective management of uveitis requires a reproducible and quantitative method to 
determine and monitor intraocular inflammation. It has become evident that clinically 
meaningful changes in flare counts could be achieved both in low and high -flare situations 
because LFM  allows  measur ing flares ranging between 3 and 1000 ph/ms on a linear scale. 
Gonzales et al . reported an inverse relationship between LFM  flare and visual acuity in 
patients with uveitis. While  no relationship was found between complications and anterior 
chamber cell or flare scores at the slit -lamp, a strong relationship was found between LFM  
flare and complications such as posterior synechia and macular edema , highlighting the 
importance of utilized LFM  as diagnostic tool.  
 
HLA -B27-Associated Acute Anterior Uveitis  
The i nflammatory pattern of acute HLA -B27-associated anterior uveitis has been evaluated 
using LFM . In a study o n 44 patients presenting an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_437895] , the mean 
initial flare was 160 ± 22 ph/ms (range: 11 –787 ph/ms). All patients were given standard 
therapy consisting of hourly instillations of 1% prednisolone drops progressively tapered 
after 3 days according to the evolution of inflammation. A 50 % and 90% flare reduction 
occurred after [ADDRESS_554966] therapeutic regim en used. In 15 
out of the 44 patients enrolled, an additional periocular corticosteroid injection was needed 
because of insufficient flare decrease (less than 30% of initial flare) or because of flare 
increase after 48 h. Following periocular injection of 4 mg of betamethasone, a 50% flare 
reduction occurred between 10 h and 24h. The end of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_437896] a  flare level below 8 ph/ms . This  study demonstrates  that LFM  allows meticulous 
adjustment of therapy in patients with HLA -B27-associated uveitis.  
The sensitivity of LFM  in monitoring anterior chamber inflammation in HLA -B27-
associated uveitis has been further evaluated in a recent study that compared LFM  measured

 values to slit-lamp grading system of aqueous cells. In this pro spective masked trial, the mean 
time for a 50% reduction was 3.9 days for LFM  flare and 14 days for aqueous cells . The 
mean time  for a 90% reduction  was 19.[ADDRESS_554968] IVES

Both eyes will be evaluated at each visit.  
 BCVA  
One goal of a complete eye examination is to determine the best corrected visual acuity  
(BCVA ).  Normal visual acuity is generally accepted as 20/20, although many people can 
see 20/15, and a few can see 20/10. If the eye cannot see 20/[ADDRESS_554986] lens 
correction, then a refraction is required to determine the BCVA.   
The vi sual acuity testing protocol s recommended are:  
• Distance acuity with correction (CC)  if the patient needs glasses or contact [CONTACT_437947].  The exception is visual acuity testing after cataract or refractive surgery, 
as these proced ures will likely change the refractive status of the eye.  
• Distance acuity without correction (SC)  if the patient wears  no glasses or contact [CONTACT_13276] 
(default test ). 
BCVA will be measured at baseline  and at each following visit.  
 
 Laser Flare Photometry   
 Anterior Chamber Flare Assessment and Measurement Kowa LFM 600 and  700 
The r ole of intra -ocular inflammation in driving disruption of blood -aqueous barrier and 
leading to the spreading of proteins and inflammatory cells into the aqueous humor  has been 
previously established . The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature  (SUV) system to 
evaluate and grade this kind of inflammatory leakage (flare) in the anterior chamber (AC)  
of the eye , ranging from 0 to 4+, is not useful or unreliable to detect and quantify AC 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554987] depends on  the subjectivity of the evaluation and on the 
nonlinear grading of flare at the slit -lamp.  
Currently, the only available system to quantitative ly and objectively measure (with 
reproducibility) intra -ocular i nflammation is the Kowa Laser Flare Meter (LFM ) instrument . 
Such instrument includes a photomultiplier that amplifies the intensity of the light scattered 
by [CONTACT_437948] (flare) or larger particles (inflammatory cells) in the aqueous humor. The 
informa tion is then processed by a computer and the result is expressed in photon counts per 
millisecond (ph/ms).  
LFM  instruments quantify back -scattered light both from small molecules and from larger 
particles such as inflammatory cells.  Therefore, LFM  measurem ents may be unreliable in 
eyes with extensive posterior synechiae or mature cataract due to increased background 
scattering of light. Seven measurements shall be obtained  with LFM . The highest and the 
lowest LFM  values are discarded and the mean and standa rd deviation of the remaining five 
LFM  readings are automatically calculated. Patients do not experience any pain or discomfort 
during measurements.  Aqueous flare intensity in the range of 2.9 –3.9 ph/ms corresponds to 
healthy individuals between 20 and 40 years of age  and they increase slightly with age, 
reaching 5.0 –6.5 ph/ms for patients between 70 and 80 years of age.  
Effective management of uveitis requires a reproducible and quantitative method to 
determine and monitor intraocular inflammation. Clinically meaningful changes in flare 
counts can be detected  both in low and high -flare values because LFM  allows  measur ing 
flare values that range between 3 and 1000 ph/ms on a linear scale. Gonzales et al. reported 
an inverse relationship between LFM  flare an d visual acuity in patients with uveitis. While 
no relationship was found between complications and anterior chamber cell or flare scores 
at the slit -lamp, a strong relationship was found between LFM  flare and complications such 
as posterior synechia and m acular edema. Intra -ocular inflammation evaluation by [CONTACT_437949].  
 OCT  
Optical coheren ce tomography (OCT) S pectralis® (Heidelberg Egineering, Heidelberg 
[LOCATION_013]) is a non -invas ive imaging test that uses light waves to take cross -section pi[INVESTIGATOR_437901], the light -sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye.  
Cross -sectional visualization is an extremely powerful tool in the identification and 
assessment of retina abnormal ities. The high resolving power (10 µm - Time Domain, 5 µm 
– Spectral Domain) provides excellent detail for evaluating the vitreo -retinal interface, 
neurosensory retinal morphology, and the RPE -choroid complex. The ability to perform 
volumetric and retinal thickness analysis also provides a quantitative and repeatable method 
to evaluate surgical and pharmacological interventions. In dividual high resolution line scans 
are a simple way to identify overt as well as very subtle retinal interface pathologies, such 
as a persistently adherent posterior hyaloid, fine epi[INVESTIGATOR_122428], and vitreomacular 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554988]  Spectralis® examination will be done at baseline  and at each following visit.  
 Slit lamp  
Slit-lamp biomicrography encompasses a wide spectrum of challenging photographic 
techniques for imaging structures and diseases of the anterior segment. Most photographic 
slit-lamps are equipped with two lighting sources, variable flash intensity, changeab le 
magnifications, and changeable angles of illumination. Patients present a wide variety of 
disease entities that have specific textures, colors, transparency, size and depth. The slit lamp 
is a binocular microscope that provides the examiner with a stere oscopic (i .e. three -
dimensional ) view of the eye. The slit lamp allows examin ing the eye  with a beam or "slit" 
of light (versus diffuse light) whose height and width can be adjusted. The slit of light, when 
directed at an angle, accentuates the anatomic st ructures of the eye, allowing close inspection. 
The slit lamp provides greater magnification (10 to 25 times) and illumination than most 
handheld devices ( i.e. the  Wood's lamp), which is necessary to diagnose a number of 
traumatic and non -traumatic disorde rs. 
Slit lamp examination will be done at baseline  and at each following visit.  
 Goldmann tonometry  
Tonometry is the procedure to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP), the fluid pressure 
inside the eye. I OP is an important test in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma.  
[1] Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). 
Goldmann tonometry is considered to be th e gold standard and most widely accepted method  
IOP test. A special disinfected prism is mounted on the tonometer head and then placed 
against the cornea. The examiner then uses a cobalt blue filter to view two green semi circles. 
The force applied to the tonometer head is then adjusted using a dial connec ted to a variable 
tension spring until the inner edges of the green semicircles in the viewfinder meet. When an 
area of 3.06  mm (0.120  in) has been flattened, the opposing forces of corneal rigidity and the 
tear film are roughly approximate and cancel each  other out allowing the pressure in the eye 
to be determined from the force applied.  
Intraocular pressure will be evaluated at baseline  and at each following visit.

13 ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
 Overview  
An Adverse Event (AE) is “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relati onship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including for example an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal product”.  
This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries, exacerbation of pre -existing 
conditions, and adverse events occurring as a result of drug withdrawal, abuse, misuse or 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554996] intake. This also 
includes adverse events which are reported within in the screening phase (since  the patient 
has signed Informed Consent Form).  
Signs and symptoms considered as lack of efficacy and occurring during the study will not 
be recorded on the AEs Section of the CRF  except  on the condition that, in the i nvestigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are cause d by [CONTACT_437953].  
Clinically significant findings at screening (e.g., laboratory findings) are not considered an 
AE/SAE.  
If a clinical significant finding recorded at scre ening worsens (in terms of severity or 
frequency) during the study, it must be recorded as an AE/SAE.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An Unexpected Adverse Event is any experience not previously reported (in nature, severity 
or incidence) in the current package insert for the study product . 
 
 AE Severity  
The international common terminology criteria for Adverse Events should be used to assess 
and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. 
It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE 
is not necessarily serious.  
Table 4 - AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention  or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the 
sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.

Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554997] if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:  
 The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
 The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug or other therapy (Note: 
simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does n ot 
constitute an adverse effect.)  
 The test finding leads to a change in study dosing or exposure or discontinuation of 
subject participation in the clinical study  
 The test finding is considered an adverse effect by [CONTACT_1755] /or Eye Pharma
  
   Events to be reported  
   All adverse Events  
All observed adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless 
of the treatment group, or any suspected causal relationship of adverse event to the 
investigational products  will be reco rded in the subjects’ case histories.  For all adverse 
events , sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit (1) an adequate 
determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event should be classified as a 
serious adver se event ) and (2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse 
event and the investigational treatment . Adverse events or abnormal test findings suspected 
to be associated with the investigational product will be followed until the event (or its 
sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
sponsor -investigator.  
 Adverse Events requiring immediate Notification  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any event that suggests  a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect, or precaution, whether or not it is considered to be associated 
with the study product. A SAE is an AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
 
 Results in death . This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical 
trial, including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study products (e.g., 
car accident).  
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_554998] 2019  
 Page 46 of 67 
  Is life -threatening . This includes any AE during which the patient is, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate  risk of death from the event as it occurs. This definition 
does not include events that may have caused death if they had occurred in a more 
severe form.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].  
 Results in persistent  or significant disability or incapacity . 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
 Other medical events  that based upon appropriate medical judgment are thought to 
jeopardize the patient and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining a SAE.

Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to the study product ).  
The collection period for all SAEs will begin after the informed consent is obtained and will 
finish 2 weeks after the patient has withdrawn study participation ( defined as time passed 
from the last visit). All SAE occurred in that time range must be reported to Eye Pharma 
within 24 hours of learning about its occurrence :

 Evaluation of Causality  
AE Relationship to Study Product  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 5.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
issued,  describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_555001] 2019  
 Page 48 of 67 
 modifications to the analysis plan described below.  SAS 9.4 for windows (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) will be used for statistical analysis.  A level of statistical significanc e 
(alpha) of 5% will be used to evaluate statistically significant differences between the two 
treatment groups, placebo and active treatment.  
 Data Sets Analyzed  
All eligible patients who are randomized into the study and receive at least one dose of the 
study product (the Safety Population) will be included in the safety analysis.  All eligible 
patients who are randomized into the study, receive at least one dose of the study product 
and ha ve at least a post -randomization endpoint estimate (the Intention -to-Treat Population) 
will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographic variables collected at screening will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490] : race, gender, age, height and weight.   
 Analysis of Pri mary Endpoint  
The number and intensity  of relapses  will be assessed through  instrumental  analysis  and 
physical examination. The se endpoint s will be assessed from baseline to end of treatment.   
Mean and standard deviation will be used to describe the number of relapses per patient . The 
mean number of relapse s per patient will be compared between the treatment groups using  
Student’s t -test. ANOVA  will be used to include predictive/confounding vari ables in the 
model .  
In addition, a  generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with Poisson statistical distribution 
and with the number of relapses as dependent variable will be used to assess the effects of 
the treatment on reduc ing the number of relapses , also including in the model other 
potentially predicting /confounding  variables .  
The intensity of relapses will be scored as mild  (either trace to 1+ cell OR flare ≤ 20), 
moderate (2+ to 3+ cell OR Flare > 20 and < 100) and severe  (4+ cell OR Hypopyon OR 
flare ≥ 100). For each patient, the average intensity will be estimated as the mean of the 
intensity observed during each relapse. The average and the maximum intensity will be 
compared between treatment groups using Student’s t -test. ANOVA will be used to include 
predictive/confounding variables in the model.  
The mean number of relapses per patient observed during the study will be compared to the 
mean number of relapses reported the previous year within each treatment group using paired 
t-test or ANOVA, to eventually adjust for predictive/confounding variables . As group means 
can be somewhat deceptive with small number of events, the patients will be classified based 
on the number of relapses before treatment and then on the number  of relapses after 
treatment . The number of patients that change class before and after treatment (for example, 
from a high number of relapses to a low number) will be described and compared between 
treatment groups .  
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_555002] 2019  
 Page 49 of 67 
 The primary efficacy endpoints will be  analyzed in the following hierarchical order: first, 
“the mean number and intensity of relapses  during the study between treatment groups” and 
then “the reduction of mean number of relapses between the year before treatment and the 
study period” . 
The leve l of cell damage and inflammation will be assessed through Laser Flare Meter.  The 
difference between treatment groups will be compared using ANCOVA, with the baseline 
level included in the model.  
An analysis of the number of relapses per eye will be also considered, if appropriate.   
 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The incidence of side effects  associated  HLA -B27-associated  uveitis , such as  cystoid  
macular  edema  (central 1 mm subfield thickness) , keratopathy  and synechia , will be 
compared between treatment groups  using logistic regression.  In addition, the changes in  
IOP, in  central 1 mm subfield thickness  will be compared between treatment groups using 
ANCOVA, with the baseline level included in the model . The presence of keratopathy  and 
synechiae will be compared between treatment groups using logistic regression . The number 
of quadrants involved by [CONTACT_437957], when present, will be described .   
The changes in BCVA and symptoms (ocular pain, blurred vision , floaters  and pho tophobia), 
measured by [CONTACT_8298] , will be compared between treatment groups using ANCOVA, with the 
baseline level included in the model.  
Each information collected through the Quick questionnaire will be compared between the 
two treatment groups  using chi -squar e test .  
 
 Safety Evaluations  
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].    
Clinical evaluations for safety and tolerability assessments will include monitoring AEs, vital 
signs , concomitant medications  and compliance.  
Adverse event will be coded using the last updated version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary to give a preferred term (PT) and a system/organ 
class term (SOC) for each . Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_17673]. Tabl es will 
include the number of patients who experienced at least one AE, of study product -related 
AEs (defined as definite ly, probabl y, possibly , or unrelated), of serious AE s, and the number 
of patients withdrawn due to AE , summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. Comparisons between 
treatment arms will be performed using chi -square test.  
Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_437958].

 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis planned.  
 Sample Size  
In a previous study25, 275 relapses on 106 patients were observed, corresponding to a mean 
number of relapses per patient of 2.6 (Standard deviation , SD: 0.7) while in the post -
treatment group 36 relapses were registered corr esponding to a mean number of relapses per 
patient  of 0.34 relapses/patient. With a statistical power of 80% and a significance level 
(alpha) of 5%  and a common SD of 0.7 , 46 patients  are needed  to observe a difference of 0.6 
relapses/patients between the two treatment groups ( i.e., 2 relapses/patient in the NORFLO® 
ORO treatment group  vs. 2.6 in the placebo treatment group) . To take into account a potential 
dropout rate of 20%  over 12 months , 60 patients will be recruited. Subjects droppi[INVESTIGATOR_437908] b eginning systemic therapy with a nti-inflammatory, 
immunosuppressive, biologic drugs will be replaced.  
A second primary endpoint, i.e. the reduction of mean number of relapses between the year 
before treatment and the study period , will be  examined.  No formal sample size estimate is 
feasible on this endpoint, as it was not tested previously and no reasonable scenario can be 
drawn.   
As the  two endpoints will be assessed in a hierarchical order ( first, “the mean number and 
intensity of relaps es during the study between treatment groups” and then “the reduction of 
mean number of relapses between the year before treatment and the study period” ), according 
to the “Points to consider on multiplicity issues in clinical trials”, issued by [CONTACT_437959] (CPMP - 2002), no sample size adjustment for 
multiplicity is needed.   
  
15  DATA COLLECTION, RET ENTION AND MONITORIN G 
 Data Collection Instruments  
During each patient’s study visit, t he study i nvestigator or designee will collect and report 
study data in the relevant patient’s chart (source documents), documenting all significant 
observations.  
The investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed 
to record all observations and other  pertinent data for each subject treated with the study 
drug.   
Protocol Code NORFLO -ORO -16 Confidential  
 
Version 1 .6 Version Date : [ADDRESS_555004]’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  when the 
information corresp onding to that visit is available.   
Source Data include the clinical findings and observations, the laboratory and test data, and 
other information contained in Source Documents.  Source Documents are the original 
records (and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_63062]); including, but not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1241], physician or office charts, physi cian or nursing notes, subject diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, x -rays, etc.  When applicable, information recorded on the CRF shall match the 
Source Data recorded on the Source Docume nts.   
Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_437960] (or designee), but will be identified by a site number and subject 
number.  
The e -CRF used for this study will compliant with [ADDRESS_555005] of all persons authorized to make entries and/or 
corrections on the CRFs. Each authorized person will be provided with a user -specific ID 
protected by a renewable password. Data entries and corre ctions will be made only by [CONTACT_437961]. The e -CRF system will record date and time of any entry and /or 
correction and the user ID of the person making the entry/correction. The system will keep 
track of all old and new values (audit trial). I t is the responsibility of the i nvestigator to ensure 
that the CRFs are properly and completely filled in. The CRFs must be completed for all 
patients who have b een included in the trial. The i nvestigator will review all CRFs and 
electronically sign and dat e them for each patient, verifying that the information is complete, 
true and correct. All fields on the CRF must be completed as applicable.  
Patients will be provided with paper questionnaires and diaries.  Such documents will be filled 
by [CONTACT_437962], to record data concerning symptoms, evaluation of the 
patient's attitude towards the study treatment, through the Quick Questionnaire , study 
treatment assumption.  
It is responsibility of the i nvestigators to instruct the study participants o n how to fill in the 
questionnaires and diaries in a clear way and preferably in black ball -point pen. The 
questionnaires and diaries are anonymous, the subject is identified through the study code 
assigned. At the end of the study a copy of all questionna ires and diaries will be stored in the 
Trial Center Fil e. It is responsibility of the i nvestigators to correctly enter the data collected 
on the questionnaires and diaries in the relevant sections of the e -CRF. The questionnaires 
and diaries will be consid ered source data.  
Checks to assist during the data entry and to assess the appropriateness and consistence of 
data will be developed on the e -CRF system. After e -CRF pages will be approved an d 
electronically signed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator, they can be reviewed  both on site by [CONTACT_437963] -ORO -16 Confidential

Forms (DCF) will be generated through the e -CRF system, both automatically, through edit 
checks, and manually, by [CONTACT_437965]/or data ma nagers, and the i nvestigator will have to check 
and close them. Occasionally, paper DCF can be sent to t rial sites for resolution. The 
investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all query resolutions.  
 
 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of Eye Pharma , IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency inspectors upon request.  
The investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which 
the information on the CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], Study 
File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of  minimum [ADDRESS_555007] maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, and the r esults of any other tests or assessments.  
All information entered in the CRF must be traceable to these source documents in the 
patient’s file. The physician must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_4677] (a signed copy is given to  the patient). The physician must give Eye Pharma  (or 
designee) access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF 
entries.  
 Monitoring  
Depending on country regulations, formal site monitoring may or may not be performed in 
this study. However, Eye Pharma  (or designee) may perform informal monitoring or auditing 
occasionally and may request additional information on patients from participating 
physicians. The Eye Pharma  data management or designated CRO will assure compliance 
monitoring. Monitoring activity will include reviews of the progress of the study and 
compliance with protocol, SOPs and GPP guidelines.

                 (refraction, right eye, left eye)  
 
 Description  
Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) will be assessed 
and graded using the ETDRS method (Ferris et al 
1982).  
As stated in the ETDRS manual of operation, if the 
subject’s visual acuity is so poor that she/ he cannot 
read the largest chart letters when tested at one 
meter (i.e. the number of letters read correctly at 
one meter is zero), then the subject’s ability to count 
fingers, detect hand motion, or have light perception  
should be evaluated.

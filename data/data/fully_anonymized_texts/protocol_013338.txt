 Background and Rationale  
Sentinel events, such as the attacks on September 11, 2001 (9/11), have focused attention on 
the magnitude of traumatic exposure experienced by [CONTACT_450207] (FRs).11 In the U nited 
States (U.S.) , firefighters and EMT/paramedics respond to more than 50 million emergency calls 
annually.1,2 Although many FRs serve entire careers without responding to events like those of 
9/11, the daily operations and experiences they expect and accept as part of their jobs expose 
them to a myriad of traumatic events  (e.g. fatal vehicle accidents, suicides, school shootings). 
The nature, frequency, and intensity of duty- related traumatic exposures place FRs at significant 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_450190] (MH) problems.3  
An estimated 18 -37% of FRs wor ldwide meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD ),8 a rate similar to that among military veterans (10 -31%),19 and much higher than that in 
general populations (8.7%).4,12,13 MH problems among FRs are not limited to PTSD; prevalence 
rates for other problems are: 7 -22% for depression,14,15 4-22% for anxiety,4,16  34-56% for binge 
drinking,17,18 and 58- 70% for sleep problems.14,19 MH p roblems can emerge in training14 and 
continue long after retirement, with approximately 15% of suicides among FRs occurring in 
retirees.20,21 In one study (n=1027), 15.5% of FRs reported at least one suicide attempt during 
their careers,5 much higher rates than those in general adult populations (1.9- 8.7%).5,8,22  
However, w e were able to locate virtually no published research on rates of help- seeking 
and service utilization among FRs with MH problems. Less than 40% of the general population 
who experience MH problems seek help,6 and help- seeking is expected to be even lower among 
FRs because of the stigma associated with mental illness and the emphasis that FR culture puts

 on strength and self -reliance.5,7 According to published personal accounts, MH problems are 
viewed as signs of vulnerability; acknowledging them can lead to mistrust and raise questions 
about personal safety of others within FR departments.8 There is apprehension about allowing 
“outsiders” into the culture, which creates isolation and inhibits help -seeking.9 Yet, there is 
minimal research to corroborate these personal testimonies. We urgently need to understand 
FRs’ perspectives about accessing and engaging in MH services to guide development of a MH service model they will be willing to access and use.   
Evidence is scarce regarding FRs’ barriers to help -seeking. Two recent studies described 
both structural and cultural barriers, such as cost and availability of resources,
23 perceived 
accessibly of treatment, and concern about stigma.24 Hom  et al. found that firefighters who 
experienced suicidal thoughts/behaviors, but did not utilize services reported more concerns about reputation and embarrassment than those who did use services.
25 The literature on U.S. 
military veterans and law enforcement officers (LEOs), similar cultural groups, provides useful 
clues.8 For instance, veterans report barriers to accessing MH services to include concerns about 
negative consequences of disclosing MH problems, discomfort with help- seeking, and negative 
values/ beliefs regarding MH treatment.26,[ADDRESS_573773] the importance of non- stigmatizing language related to MH, anonymity, 
and peer -to-peer support.28 LEOs are concerned that help -seeking indicates weakness; they also 
fear loss of confidentiality and threats of job loss.29,30 Although literature on veterans and LEOs 
is suggestive, FRs (as defined by [CONTACT_15365]) are unique in structural and cultural ways that may 
influences help -seeking and require tailored approaches to address their MH problems.

 The need for research and reso urces to address MH problems among FRs is well recognized 
by [CONTACT_450208]. The National Fallen Firefighters’ Foundation (NFFF), Initiative 
13: Psychological Support, emphasizes the need for resources to help FRs cope with duty- related 
complica tions, especially regarding emotional and psychological stress. The 2015 National Fire 
Service Research Agenda recommends research to identify individuals who are at high risk for health problems, especially those related to repeated trauma exposures. In particular, the agenda gives high priority to efforts to “identify, develop, and refine evidence -based tools and 
approaches for behavioral health screening, assessment, and intervention” (p.17).
[ADDRESS_573774] variability is supported by a survey conducted by [CONTACT_450209] (n=849). Over 
75% of firefighters indicated greater willingness to utilize a program that was tailored to their 
needs compared to a national suicide hotline.
14 This supports the need for research to develop a 
tailored MH service model to support early identification and treatment of FRs’ MH problems.[ADDRESS_573775] common being Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). However, empi[INVESTIGATOR_450191]. CISDs are in- house debriefing sessions

 5.09).33,34 Qualitative research regarding this topic is limited to one national study (n=423) that 
explored firefighters’ perceptions about CISD; some FRs reported CISD to be beneficial, others 
found it to be intrusive and distre ssing.35 Still, CISD continues to be used by [CONTACT_450210].35 
EAPs are outside agencies contracted to provide MH services to FR departments. Although they are widely used, we were unable to find research on FRs’ perceptions of EAPs or their effectiven ess in meeting FRs’ MH needs.  
Preliminary Studies (PS)  
PS#1:  Funded by a UAMS College of Nursing intramural grant (January,  2017). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450192]’ MH -related issues, including the: Director of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), AR 
Department of Health; Fire and EMS Coordinator, AR Depa rtment of Emergency Management; 
President of AR Professional Firefighters Association, local EMS directors, and multiple fire chiefs statewide (see Letters of Support). They expressed concern about the increased prevalence of MH problems among their FRs, a nd attributed the increase in number of suicides and early 
retirements over the past decade to MH problems. They also reported a lack of help- seeking even 
when MH problems were apparent and EAP and/or CISD were available. All community partners were highly motivated to address MH problems among FRs, but have lacked resources and expertise to do so. For example, the President of AR Professional Firefighters Association reported that they have pushed legislation to address MH issues in the fire service for ye ars, but 
have been unsuccessful. These partnerships will be critical to the successful conduct of the

resulting MH service model for FRs.  
PS#2 : Funded by [CONTACT_450211] 
(March 2017). The specific aims for this ongoing PS are to 1) assess the feasibility of using a community -engaged approach with FRs, 2) characterize the MH profile of Arkansas’ FRs, and 3) 
explore individual FRs’ perceptions of MH problems and use of MH services, including barriers 
and facilitators to help -seeking. To achieve Aim 1 , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450193]#1 community 
partners to refine recruitment methods; these methods will be used in the proposed study (described below). Recruitment was successful and resulted in ample and continued access to this population, including presentations at four FR -related state conferences. To achieve Aim 2 , 
FRs statewide were invited to complete an anonymous online survey that incorporated brief assessments of various MH problems,
42 as well as questions addressing demographics and 
factors that can pose as potential risk/protective factors (e.g., marital status, military service).10,42 
A total of 220 FRs started the survey and 87% completed it. Of completers, 86% were male and 
95% were Caucasian; the average length of time as a FR was 16.2 years; 23% reported a 
previous MH diagnosis and 25% reported previous MH treat ment. The high rates of self -reported 
MH problems found were: 26% for PTSD; 28% for moderate to severe anxiety; 14% for major (moderate -severe to severe) depression; 20% for harmful/ hazardous drinking; and, 34% for 
high- risk for suicidal behaviors, highli ghting the need for the proposed study.  
To achieve Aim [ADDRESS_573777] ed in-depth, ethnographic interviews with individual FRs. 
Thirty -two FRs were interviews; of those interviewed, 36% reported a previous MH diagnosis,

 and 40% reported previous MH treatment. Experience with Aim 3 demonstrates the willingness 
of FRs with MH problems to participate in qualitative research. Grounded theory- informed, 
qualitative ana lytic methods (as described below) were used to identify common themes. The 
main the themes included: knowledge, barriers and facilitators to help -seeking, effects of the job 
and copi[INVESTIGATOR_215405], non- duty stressors, pros and cons of existing MH services a nd delivery 
methods, and novel delivery approaches.  Specific Aims  
Based on preliminary data and current literature, there is crucial need to reduce barriers to 
access and promote engagement in MH services to address FRs’ MH needs. To develop an effective MH service model that will be accessed and used by [CONTACT_450212]- risk group, we must 
understand and incorporate FRs’ preferences for MH service and delivery methods. We propose a two-stage exploratory, qualitative study that will use a statewide community -enga gement 
approach to conceptualize a MH service model that would motivate FRs to be more engaged in 
services. In Stage 1, we will conduct qualitative focus groups (and individuals interviews, as 
needed; see below)  with firefighters and EMTs/  paramedics acros s Arkansas. In Stage 2, w e will 
use a product development process grounded in these findings to conceptualize a MH service model  feasible for implementation in real world settings. (Protocol for Stage 2 will be submitted 
for IRB approval at a later time.)

 Phase 2, Specific Aim 2:  Conceptualize a MH service model, in partnership with FRs statewide, 
that is applicable, acceptable, and feasible for implementation. ( Method: Virtual Delphi group of 
consensus formation)  
Through this multi- phase work, we will generate the scientifi c foundation to develop a 
comprehensive, MH service model that diverse FRs will be willing to access and use. Based on 
FRs preferences and priorities, we expect this model will encompass a range of services, such as education and awareness initiatives, pre vention and screening strategies, and crisis and 
maintenance interventions, to meet their MH needs throughout the course of illness. 
Study Design and Procedures  
This qualitative study will use a statewide community -engagement approach to explore FRs 
preferences for MH service and delivery methods. In a community- engagement approach, 
researchers form collaborative partnerships with key stakeholders; together, they identify areas of interest and concern.

in PS#2; we will seek the same for this study). R ules of confidentiality will also be discussed.  
Following the consent process, participants will be asked to complete a brief form to collect 
data about demographics (i.e., age group, race/ethnicity, gender) and potential risk/protective factors (e.g., time in service, military service, medical problems).  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or RA will facilitate the focus group (FG)  discussions  using a semi -structured 
question guide (Table 2), which will have undergone review by [CONTACT_33748]. (In addition to content, we will ask them for feedback regarding language, ensuring it is non-stigmatizing.)  
To start the group discussion, the  PI/RA will use a PowerPoint presentation to highlight the 
various MH services discussed in the PS interviews. Group participants will be asked to discuss the pros and cons of existing MH services and delivery methods, and novel approaches that 
emerged dur ing the interviews. They will be asked 
to discuss their own experiences related to each; based on their experiences, they will be asked to make recommendations for services/delivery methods that would motivate FRs to be more engaged in services. We will as k them “where to 
start” when implementing a MH service model; follow -up questions will include probes related to

be reluctant to express their views in the group. Participants will also receive a  blank pi[INVESTIGATOR_450195], along with a  web link to an anonymous form in Survey Monkey. Here, they can add 
information they may not be comfortable discussing in the FG; text data from these opti ons will

Sampling and Sample Size. An essential part of grounded theory- informed methods is the 
use of theoretical sampling.
49 In grounded theory research, we do not know the important the mes 
in advance; instead, they emerge and are refined over time as data are collected and analyzed. In general, exploration of a certain theme is stopped when “saturation” is reached, that is, no new themes emerge from the data (discussed below). Therefore,  theoretical sampling does not 
provide a detailed sampling schema or calculation for number of participants beforehand. For this study, we will recruit FRs to participate in up to 25 FGs that will include 5- 12 participants 
per group. Eighteen of these groups will be open to all FRs  from different regions across the 
state. Evidence suggests that call volume and career vs. volunteer service influence FRs’ MH.

volumes and a greater number of career fire/ambulance services than the other 4 regions; the

 latter are more rural and are served primarily by [CONTACT_450215]/ambulance services (Figure 2). 
Therefore, we propose to conduct 1) five FGs in each of the two most populous regions (total=10), and 2)  two FGs in each of the other four regions (total=8).  
Since the majority of FRs are white males,
1,[ADDRESS_573781]  a minimum of 2 of the 25 
FGs with an ethnically diverse group of females only, and an additional 2 FGs with minorities only (males and females) (total=4). This will ensure that at least 10 -15% of participants are 
females and minorities. We will make every effort to recruit these participants from across AR, but due to the distribution of FRs across AR, we expect these FGs will take place in Central and Northwest AR.  
Sample Size  
An essential part of qualitative methods is the use of theoretical sampling. Theoretical 
sampling does not provide a detailed sampling schema or calculation for number of participants beforehand. Instead , exploration of a  certain theme is stopped when “saturation” is reached, that 
is, no new themes emerge from the data (see Analysis section).  Compensation  Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_573782] agreed to encourage participation. However, individuals may also be reluctant to participate. During recruit ment, we will explain

unidentifiable and individual responses will not be shared with employers and administrators.  
Risks and Benefits  
Adult Minimal Risk : Any a ctivity where the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in the research is not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or  tests.  
Participants may experience distress at the time of, or because of the focus group/ interview 
discussions. Prior to starting participation , they will be advised that if this occurs, they can 
choose to stop meet with the PI /RA individually. They will also be advised that the PI /RA may 
ask them to discontinue participation or ask to meet after wards if a significant level of distress is 
observed. In meeting with the participant individually, the PI, an experienced psychiatric -mental 
health nurse practitioner, or RA, a licensed social worker (LCSW) with over 10 years’ 
experience, will briefly evaluate him/her and conduct a suicide risk assessment if indicated. 
Based on the evaluation, the participant may be referred for services, i ncluding (but not limited 
to) a local emergency department (if currently experiencing active suicidal ideations), the locally contracted EAP, or other MH services.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450198], including therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450199], which have agreed to be listed as an available resource for the purposes of this study. This list of compi[INVESTIGATOR_450200], along with a list of phone numbers, will be available at all sites and online at the link provided on the flyer.

assessment, and make referrals as appropriate (as mentioned above). Documentation and follow -
up will also be completed as applicable. This information (available resources and phone 
numbers) will als o be provided upon completion of the group/interview and maintained online at 
the link provided in the email. 
Suicide Risk Assessment and referral . The PI /RA will use the Suicide Assessment Five -step 
Evaluation and Triage (SAFE -T) for Mental Health Profess ionals to assess risk of suicide and 
make referrals  (uploaded in attachments) . SAFE -T is a resource recommended by [CONTACT_450216]. This 5- step assessment guides the 
provider to: 1) identify risk factors, 2)  identify protective factors, 3) conduct suicide inquiry, 4) 
determine risk level/ intervention, and 5) document.  
To reduce risk of breach of confidentiality, audio- recordings of the focus groups/ interviews 
will be stored in a locked filing cabinet and all transcriptions will be electronically documented. 
All electronic data will be maintained on a password -protected server to which only the research 
team will have access. T he HIPAA compliant version of SurveyMonkey will be purchased; o nly 
aggregate data from the surveys will be reported.  
Benefits  
There may be no personal benefits to the individual participants at the time of the study. It is 
possible, however, that participating in this study will increase participants’ awareness of, and decrease stigma related to, mental and substance use disorders, which may prompt some to seek services. Further, findings from this study will guide future studies to develop tailored prevention

Data Analysis  
The RA will enter quantitative participant data (i.e. demographics, risk/protective factors) 
into SPSS (V24).[ADDRESS_573784] statistical techniques to summarize data 
distributions and to model associations among risk and status variables. FGs and interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed verbati m, and entered into a professional software program 
designed to facilitate the data analysis process and produce an audit trail.
54 Data submitted online 
will also be entered.  
We will analyze data using grounded theory -informed methods of content analysis and 
constant comparison.43 Content analysis is  a systematic, objective analysis designed to identify 
key words, phrases, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], which guides top- level coding .55 This process is followed by

 themes by [CONTACT_450218].49 We will also use this process to compare data 
across sub -groups (e.g. urban/rural, male/female). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450201]; 
both co- Is have expertise in qualitative methods; and the RA will be trained in these methods.  
Top-level coding. The PI, co -I (McSweeney), and RA will independently review the 
transcript s from the first [ADDRESS_573785] important to 
answering the key research questions. The research team will meet to compare coding and reach consensus on coding that differs. This process will continue with additional transcripts until they 
reach consensus on a set of initial top- level codes and definitions for each code, which will 
comprise the code book . This process will ensure inter -rater reliability, that is,  consistency in 
coding.
56 Thereafter, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450202]. To ensure coding consistency, they will review each other’s work monthly and meet 
to discuss and resolve any differences. In the event that new th emes emerge after the codebook is 
agreed upon, the research team will meet again to define emerging codes; previously coded transcripts will be recoded to reflect the additions(s).  
Second -level coding. Second- level coding is a process to further refine th e constructs 
indicated by [CONTACT_450219]- level codes. The final codebook will be used to “sub- code” data within each 
code. That is, data within codes will be compared across transcripts to find similarities, differences, associations, and relationships to determine patterns and thematic categories,

establish reliability.  
Saturation. In general, exploration of a certain theme is stopped when “saturation” is 
reached, that  is, when no new concepts or properties emerge from the data after the thematic 
categories are identified. Given the potential size of the overall sample from the FGs (n=132 -
220) and individual interviews (n=44), we will have no difficulty in achieving ove rall saturation. 
Additionally, based on the anticipated diversity of the FGs, we expect to be able to achieve 
saturation for both urban (n=60- 100) and rural (n=48- 80) FRs, as well as for female (n=12 -20) 
and minority (n=12- 20) FRs. We will use standard qua litative guidelines for trustworthiness by 
[CONTACT_450220] (1985) to maximize the project’s validity and reliability.57 A data table will be 
constructed to provide an audit trail that identifies the thematic categories, frequen cies of 
explanations, and examples of raw data that exemplify each theme. The field notes recorded by [CONTACT_450221].  
Phase 2, Specific Aim 2: Conceptualize a MH service model, in partnership with FRs 
statewide , that is applicable, acceptable, and feasible for implementation. 
Product development activity: Delphi technique  
After all focus groups have been analyzed, we will initiate a series of product development 
activities. We will use a virtual Delphi technique of consensus formation to conceptualize a MH service model that is acceptable to FRs and feasible to implement in real world settings. This method has been successful in fostering a sense of ownership and the engagement of diverse stakeholders in an iterative decision -making process.

 Participants  
We will invite individuals from our community partners (i.e., Arkansas Department of 
Health, Professional Firefighters Association, etc.) to participate in these Delphi groups , as well 
as a minimum of 12 diverse FRs who participated in the Phase 1 focus groups. We will aim to 
include participants from all 6 regions across the state (see page 12). In this way, we will capture 
the perspectives of both administrative and in- line FRs.  
Procedures  
Due to ext ended proximities and current COVID related guidelines, all discussions will be 
conducted virtually using Zoom. The initial meeting with be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_52505].  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_450203]’s purpose and procedures, including the proces s, timeline, 
and expectations. Then, the RA will distribute  a handout that briefly describes existing MH 
services and delivery methods ; she will review the Aim [ADDRESS_573786] meeting, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450204] a MH education program. Then, this information will be disseminated to the FR panel for review prior to the next meeting. To allow all individuals to privately agree or dis agree with each, a survey will be distributed via Survey 
Monkey that includes the essential components discussed in the group. Each individual will indicate if they agree or disagree and be able to write additional comments if needed.  
The subsequent meetings will aim at reaching consensus on all components of the program.  
The RA will lead a series of discussions every other week via Zoom, covering the essential components of a MH service model, including (but not limited to) implementation and

 engagement s trategies, feasibility, and outcome measures. They will also discuss how to meet the 
diverse needs within FR populations if differences emerge (e.g. fire vs. ambulance services; 
urban vs. rural communities) so that the service model will be generalizable t o all FRs. 
Following each meeting, we will aim for consensus on the key components discussed during the group using the survey method discussed above. This technique will allow us to confirm and document that we have  reach ed consensus . 
 When employing a Delphi technique, each round of discussion will involve up to three 
iterations of deliberations that will seek agreement on essential components of a MH service model. W e will plan to have a minimum of 5 meetings: one for introduction, thr ee for discussion 
and deliberations, and one for final presentation. Using multiple rounds of deliberation, along 
with a pre -set percentage of agreement, will facilitate a stable and reliable consensus -building 
process. In the remote chance that consensus is not reached, we will schedule an additional 
called meeting to additional to further discuss and deliberate  
We estimate to have a total of 22 -24 participants in the Delphi activities. Upon inviting 
participants, we will ask them to agree only if they can commit to all meetings, with an allowance of 1 absence, to assure quorum . Specifically, w e will use a minimal consensus level of 
75% panel agreement for each component .

A waiver of documentation of consent is also requested . We will use an IRB -approved 
study information sheet to discuss the study and complete the consent process before beginning the focus groups and interview s. All participants will be provided with a n information sheet  that 
describes this study and provides sufficient information in language suitable for them to make an 
informed decision about their participation in this study. The researcher will thoroughly explain 
each element of the document and outline the risks and benefits, and requirements of the study. Questions regarding participation will be answered, no coercion or undue influence will be used, 
and participants can leave the group or stop the interview at any time . The informed consent 
process will be document ed in a process note for each group/interview . 
If at any time
 there is concern that child or elder abuse has possibly occurred, or a participant 
discloses a desire to harm self or others, it will be reported to the appropriate authorities.  
Implications and Dissemination  of Data  
Based on information generated by [CONTACT_450222], we will pursue a multi- stage research 
agenda. Using this study’s findings, the next step will be to develop a tailored MH service model consisting of services and delivery methods that can be generalizable to FRs statewide, and to

through the NIMH Division of Services and Intervention Research. Future research will include 
a full -scale trial of the model statewide, revised based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690], a nd then a hybrid 
effectiveness -implementation trial.  
Results of this study may be used for presentations, posters, or publications. The publications 
will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a participant. Dissemination of findings to FRs  and MH  providers through publications and conferences can extend to 
national arenas to better meet the needs of all FRs . With continued efforts and partnerships, 
findings can be integrated into policy and funding- related decisions to sustain the delivery of 
high- quality MH services for FRs in Arkansas and across the nation.

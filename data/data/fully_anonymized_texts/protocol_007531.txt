	1.0 Introduction 
Delayed graft function (DGF), defined as the need for dialysis in the first 
week after kidney transplant, is estimated to occur in over 20% of deceased donor kidney transplants (1).  Its development is associated with an increased risk of rejection, poorer long-term kidney allograft function, and lower patient and graft survival (2,3).  This association is modified by [CONTACT_745043], as indicated by [CONTACT_745044]-dependence after transplant, where longer periods of dialysis-dependence are associated with 
progressively higher risks  of rejection and graft failure (4).  Not 
surprisingly, kidneys at higher risk for DGF are more likely to be discarded in the [LOCATION_002] despi[INVESTIGATOR_45478]-documented shortage in donor organ supply (5,6). 
 
The predominant mechanism of DGF is ischemia-reperfusion injury.  This is 
marked by [CONTACT_745045]-independent inflammatory response, characterized by [CONTACT_745046]-inflammatory cells early after ischemic injury (7).  Additionally, the complement cascade can be activated in response to ischemia-induced membrane changes (8).  Although the alternative pathway has historically been thought to play the major role in ischemia-reperfusion injury, evidence suggests that the classical and mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathways are also important (9,10).  Damage-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMPs), polysaccharides, and intracellular antigens exposed during 
ischemic injury can activate both the classical and MBL pathways (11).  C4-deficient mice, who cannot activate the classical pathway C3 convertase (C2aC4b), were less susceptible to ischemia-induced injury compared to wild-type mice and antibodies against mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP)-[ADDRESS_1019053] and myocardium (11,12).  Recent data from an animal model of heart transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury demonstrated that ischemia-reperfusion injury was largely prevented in animals that were genetic knockouts for the MBL collectin-11 but not for Factor B (alternative pathway) knockouts (10).  In addition, wild-type mice treated with C1 esterase inhibitor were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury, similar to collectin-11 (-/-). Thus, mounting experimental evidence suggests 
blockade of the classical and MBL complement pathways is a potentially 
attractive approach for prevention or mitigation of DGF caused by [CONTACT_114273]-reperfusion injury. Of interest is recent data linking IRI/DGF to induction of B-cell injury and DSA generation post-transplant. This is discussed below: 
 Evidence for B-cell Activation in Allografts Experiencing IRI/DGF Cippa et al (13) in an elegant article published in Nature demonstrated a 
causal relationship between IRI/DGF and subsequent B-cell activation in the allografts. This clearly differed from allografts not experiencing IRI/DGF as no B-cell signals were demonstrated on protocol biopsies. The authors showed that production of DSAs post-transplant was a late event reflecting 
irreversible organ damage due to IRI/DGF. The authors conclude that their 
findings point to new opportunities for early diagnosis and novel therapeutic interventions that could prevent or alter IRI/DGF induced immune

activation events in the allograft. Here, early ischemic events incite 
innate immune systems (complement activation) that ultimately leads to chronic injury and activation of B-cells through exposure to cryptic antigens resulting in DSAs. Prevention of this early IRI/DGF damage should limit immune activation of B-cells and DSA inducted injury later post-transplant. See Figures 1A and 1B for the data presented in this manuscript.

1.1Criteria for Defining IRI/DGF in Human Kidney Transplants 
Historically DGF has been defined as the requirement for dialysis during the 
first week after renal transplantation, however the postoperative requirement of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is not standardized and the decision to dialyze varies from center to center and among consultants (14). Efforts have been made to scientifically quantify DGF in a more stringent manner with various alternative definitions of DGF including; (14) the number of days to achieve a creatinine clearance of >10 mL/min, 
calculated by [CONTACT_540417]-Cockroft formula (15) a serum creatinine level of >3 
mg/dL on the fifth day post-transplant (16) the need for dialysis within 72 hours after transplantation  (17) serum creatinine level changes, including an increase, remaining unchanged, or decreasing by [CONTACT_21316] 10% per day immediately after surgery during three consecutive days for >1 week (18) a rising serum creatinine level above that before surgery, or urine output of <300 mL within 6 hours of transplantation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_540377] (19) urine output of <[ADDRESS_1019057] 24 hours or a decrease in serum creatinine of <20-30% reflected in a poor glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (20) and calculating the creatinine reduction ratio on day two following surgery  (21). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_745003], the conventional definition of “requirement for dialysis in the first week post-
transplant” remains the most utilized and published definition for DGF, with 
“need for dialysis” being easily measured and clinically relevant. However, recent data from the FDA indicate that more relevant end points for clinical trials of agents aimed at reducing IRI/DGF would be need for dialysis in the first month post-transplant and eGFR at 1year  (https://www.fda.gov/media/103928/download . 
 
1.2 The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) 
Key to the success of any study aimed at evaluating efficacy against IRI/DGF 
is the reasonable stratification of risk for said event. In recent years this has been codified using the KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_632596]. The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) is a numerical measure that combines ten donor factors, including clinical parameters and demographics, to summarize into a single number the

quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered kidneys. The 
KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_745004] (KDRI) for a deceased donor.  
Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI [CONTACT_4007] 90%, for example, have a KDRI (which 
indicates relative risk of graft failure) greater than 90% of recovered kidneys. The KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_745005] a mappi[INVESTIGATOR_745006] a relative risk scale to a cumulative percentage scale. The reference population used for this mappi[INVESTIGATOR_745007] a kidney recovered 
for the purpose of transplantation in the prior calendar year. Lower KDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_745008]. This is shown in  figure 2 below: 
 
 
 
Figure 2 : This figure shows the outcomes of kidney transplants performed 2007-[ADDRESS_1019058] scores (86-100%) 
experienced the worst outcomes over time. This would suggest that kidneys donated from patients with high risk for IRI/DGF are unlikely to provide long-term benefits to patients, thus may be discarded. 
 
 
1.3 Complement as a Mediator of Ischemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI) 
 
The complement system in humans exists as a system of recognition molecules, proteolytic enzymes and receptors for activated complement components that are responsible for host defense. The complement system can be activated in at least 3 separate ways; first, the classical pathway which depends on antibody binding to antigen targets and binding complement components (i.e. C1q) to ultimately activate C3 and initiate terminal complement component activation of C5b-C9 (see figure 3). Binding of lectins (i.e. mannose binding lectin and mannose binding lectin serine protease (MBLSP) activate 
the C3 convertase without activation of C1->4->2 (C3 convertase). In 
addition, the alternative pathway is activated by [CONTACT_745049] H
2O or 
activating surfaces. The deposition of complement on bacteria or sites of injury signal initiation of an inflammatory response and tags complement bound targets for elimination through apoptosis or phagocytosis by [CONTACT_179968]. The complement system also contains a number of receptors that


modify or abate complement-mediated inflammation. Complement also exists in 
two distinct compartments (central and local). The central compartment of complement is produced in the liver and is responsible for all circulating complement factors. The peripheral compartment included complement generated locally in organs such as the CNS and kidneys (22) Activation of complement in the peripheral compartments appears to be regulated primarily by [CONTACT_540420]. Figure 2 below describes the importance of complement activation in initiation of renal tubular cell (RTC) injury with reference to induction by 
[CONTACT_540420]. Briefly, IRI stimulates C3 production in the RTCs that is subsequently 
cleaved by [CONTACT_540421]/MBLSP or alternative pathway (22). C3b generated then activates C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b forms the C5b-C9MAC which induces cell death and cytokine (IL-6) release. C5a interacts with the C5aR to induce apoptosis and cell death. Data from have also shown that kidneys from C3 deficient mice are resistant to IRI. Other investigators have also shown that expression of C3 and other complement components in human donor kidneys before transplantation had a negative impact on graft outcome at 2-3 years (23). Thus there is significant support for a role of complement activation in inducing RTC injury and ultimately DGF and it would be reasonable to assume that administration of complement inhibitors would be of potential benefit in prevention or amelioration of RTC injury and possibly improve outcomes in kidneys at high risk for development of DGF.  
 
As previously mentioned, this field has evolved considerably in the past 2-3 years. Recent data from a small consortium trial examined the utility of eculizumab (anti-C5) for prevention of IRI/DGF in a protocol similar to the one we previously reported with C1INH.(24)  Here, the investigators showed no benefit on prevention of IRI/DGF and no long term benefit in improving eGFR in treated v. placebo patients. This would seem to challenge the findings of our larger study with C1INH v. placebo where significant benefits in reducing IRI/DGF were seen early that translated into long-term benefits in graft survival and renal function (24, 25). The differences seen in the two trials may be explained by [CONTACT_745050]. Data summarizing this information is shown below. Briefly, data from Sacks et al (26) (27) have recently demonstrated that the lectin 
pathway of complement activation is critical to IRI/DGF injury in animal 
models. This finding implicated IRI induced expression of fucose on renal tubular cells that directly binds to the MASP collectin-11. The binding of this serine protease activates complement through the lectin pathway resulting in C5b-C9MAC and C5a induced ischemic injury to tubules. This is shown in Figure 4 below. These authors also found that collectin-11 was critical to the induction of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in experimental models. The conundrum regarding the differences in complement inhibitors used in the two studies discussed above may be resolved by a study reported by (10)  Using a heart transplant model of IRI/DGF injury, these investigators examined the role of complement using specific knock-out mice. Here, Factor B (-/-) animals showed no benefit in prevention of 
IRI/DGF suggesting that the omission of the alternative complement 
activating pathway had no impact on prevention of IRI/DGF (10). This is important since the alternative pathway is best inhibited by [CONTACT_151305]. In addition, the investigators performed similar experiments using collectin-11 (-/-) mice. Here dramatic differences were seen with knock-out of the collectin-11 gene expression resulting in a significant inhibition of

of the interactions of collectin-[ADDRESS_1019059] for IR injury. Further support for this contention was shown when the investigators used C1INH treatment in this model. Here, results recapi[INVESTIGATOR_745009]-11 (-/-) experiments suggesting that C1INH treatment may have unique benefits in preventing IRI/DGF injury to allografts (10). The complement activation pathways and their roles in IRI/DGF are shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1019060] significance in 
prevention of IRI/DGF, specifically, the role in inhibiting collectin-11 binding to fucose moieties on renal tubular cells.   
 
Figure 3: 
This figure shows the impact of ischemic injury on RTCs. Ischemia 
induces complement activation through the lectin pathway (MASP-> Collectin-11) 
binding to fucose moieties expressed on injured tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Complement injury proceeds with damage to RTC epi[INVESTIGATOR_745010]-term implications.

1.4 Evidence for C1INH Prevention of IRI in Animal Models 
Although limited, there are recent investigations which show dramatic 
results in prevention of IRI after C1INH treatment. (28) investigated the ability of recombinant C1INH (rC1INH) to alter tissue injury in a porcine model of controlled hemorrhage. In this model, the administration of 100U/kg or 250U/kg rC1INH significantly reduced IRI injury to kidneys, lungs, intestine and liver. The animals treated with 250U/kg also showed 
significant reductions in TNF- α levels and severity of metabolic acidosis. 
The significant beneficial effects of rC1INH administration were found to be related to the ability of C1INH to reduce IRI induced complement activation in tissue. All treated animals also showed reduced immune cell infiltration and cytokine production. The authors felt that the use of rC1INH would have significant benefits in patients with hemorrhagic shock in prevention of IRI and organ failure (29). In a comprehensive analysis of rC1INH use in an IRI model of kidney injury in the swine model found that IRI was associated with significant C3 activation, primarily through the MBL/MBLSP-[ADDRESS_1019062]. The infusion of rC1INH led to significant reductions in peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] C4d deposition, and C5b-C9MAC. Complement inhibition with rC1INH also reduced the numbers of infiltrating CD163+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Animals

treated with rC1INH had significantly less RTC injury and renal damage. The 
authors conclude that the use of C1INH may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the prevention of DGF that would have particular relevance to kidney transplantation. Data from animal models of stroke induced by [CONTACT_745052] (MCA) occlusion showed that significant benefits in reducing infarct size were obtained with C1INH given at 20U/kg. Here, C1INH was shown to bind to microvasculature in the brains of animal who showed protection, presumable through prevention of IRI induced complement activation. (30), 
C1-inhibitor protects from brain ischemia-reperfusion injury by [CONTACT_745053]-inflammatory and antithrombotic mechanisms.

 1.5 Evidence for Efficacy of C1INH in Preventing IRI/DGF in Human Kidney 
Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
C1 esterase inhibitor was approved by [CONTACT_745054] [ADDRESS_1019064] of complement inhibition on short- and long-term kidney function among allografts with ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Our group recently reported twelve-month outcomes of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study investigating the safety and efficacy of C1 esterase inhibitor among deceased donor kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_745013]-risk for DGF (25).  Salient findings from this study were a shorter duration of DGF and higher 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at twelve months among patients 
treated with C1 esterase inhibitor compared to placebo. From our initial report we showed that C1INH was associated with a ~50% reduction in need for dialysis in the first month post-transplant in high risk patients and a clinically significant improvement in eGFR at 1 year. This is shown in

Figure 6 : This figure demonstrates that giving C1INH 50U/kg at time of transplant 
and @[ADDRESS_1019065]-transplant and a significant improvement 
in eGFR at 1 year compared to placebo. The at risk population was balanced for risk factors associated with IRI/DGF being enriched for the risk. This data would suggest that prevention of early IRI/DGF has long-term implications for improving 
kidney function. 
 
 
We have subsequently assessed the long-term (3.5 year) outcomes of patients 
treated with C1INH v. placebo and saw that the results for improvements in 
eGFR have been sustained over the 3.5 year follow up.(31)This is also associated with an improved graft survival in the C1INH group and is shown in figures 7B and 8 below.  Briefly, in figure7A, we show that in the C1INH 
group, the eGFR is maintained at +0.5 cc/min/1.73m
2/year for 3.5 years. 
However, the placebo group showed a decline of - 4.1cc/min/1.73m2/year 
(p=0.03). We also saw that the graft survival was significantly decreased in the patients receiving placebo (p=0.007), again suggesting that prevention of early IRI/DGF is associated with a beneficial long-term survival and function of the kidney allografts. Although not statistically significant, there was a numerically important reduction in DSA generation post-transplant in the C1INH treated patients. This may be related to benefits in reducing ischemia-related activation of B-cells with subsequent DSA generation.(31) Time Since Transplantation (days)0 2 4 6 8 1 01 21 41 61 82 02 22 42 62 83 0Freedom From Dialysis Probability

AGENT C1INH (Berinert® [human][C1INH]) 
HYPOTHESIS Pre-operative, infusion of C1INH into the renal allograft 
artery 1-[ADDRESS_1019070] on graft 
survival. Poor early graft function and DGF contributes to decreased short- and long-term patient and graft survival, increased incidence of acute rejection, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and higher costs of 
transplantation.  Although multiple factors contribute to 
the impaired graft function, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the underlying pathophysiology leading to poor early graft function and DGF.  A >35% incidence of DGF has remained constant over time despi[INVESTIGATOR_745017].  This may be due to increased use of kidneys from “extended-criteria” and/or non-heart-beating donors, where even greater rates (>60%) of DGF have been reported.

More than 94,653 people are currently waiting for a kidney transplant in the [LOCATION_002] (UNOS.org 9/30/2019).  Of the 19,360 kidney transplants performed in the US in 2018, 20% were from DCD donors and 9% from donors of KDPI>85.    The USRDS reports that more than 50% of patients on the waiting list are willing to accept a kidney from an expanded-criteria donor (KDPI >85). This study will seek to expand the use of high KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_745018] 
C1INH treatment.   
NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND CENTERS 40 patients will be enrolled into the study (20 C1INH and 
20 Placebo). The study will be performed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. In 2018, we transplanted 38 kidneys into patients with KDPI > 85%. We anticipate the rate of offers from OneLegacy will continue at that rate. However, we would propose that 18-20 months will be required to complete study entry given the vagaries of acceptable offers and willingness of individual patients to participate in clinical trials.

the study, including names and contact [CONTACT_264899], monitors, clinical laboratories, technical departments, as well as information on members of additional study committees, will be found in the study files of the sponsor and on site if requested. 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) committee will review safety data. 
Quarterly assessment of AEs & SAEs will be performed and reported to FDA and 
Cedars-Sinai IRB. In addition, DSMB must be informed and may be convened at any time questions about safety arise and/or thromboembolic events occur. Please see appendix E FDA Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors.   
  4. Investigational Plan  4.1Study Design And Plan 
This is a Phase I/II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 
assessing safety and limited efficacy of intraoperative C1INH (500U/kidney) vs. Placebo administered into the graft renal artery 1-2 hours prior to implantation in adult subjects receiving a deceased donor kidney allograft considered high-risk for development of DGF (KDPI>80). Once eligible 
patients are identified, consented, and have an acceptable kidney transplant 
offer, they will be randomized by [CONTACT_451284]-Sinai Research Pharmacy to

 4.1.1Study Drug Administration Timing 
In consideration of the latest time point of treatment application before 
graft reperfusion (ie. beginning of renal vein anastomosis), study 
treatments will be administered pre-operatively, 1-2 hours before graft 
reperfusion. Due to the biologic half-life of C1INH (approximately 2.5 to 
3.8 days), the time difference between early and late intraoperative 
treatment application, is thought to be negligible; however, we will administer the C1INH or placebo product at 1-2 hours prior to implantation for dosing consistency.  This will constitute the entirety of C1INH vs. placebo administration. The study format is shown below in figure 9.

4.3Removal Of Subjects From Study 
A subject who is withdrawn is one who discontinued in the clinical study for 
any reason. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
•At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable 
representative. 
•If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be 
detrimental to the subject's well-being. 
•At the specific request of the sponsor. 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the case report 
form and in the subject's medical records.   
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason without penalty or prejudice.  The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study if he/she feels it is in the best interest of the patient or if the patient is uncooperative or non-compliant.  It is understood by [CONTACT_540425]-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients 
should be avoided.  Should a patient decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations, and early withdrawal procedures, as thoroughly as possible. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_745061] a 
personal visit to determine as completely as possible the reason for the withdrawal.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study.  If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse event or an abnormal laboratory test result, the principal specific event or test will be recorded on the CRF.  For all patients who are withdrawn pre-maturely, every attempt should be made to 
assess the patient’s status (i.e. patient and graft survival, malignancies, 
etc.) at [ADDRESS_1019076] dose of study medication.

The sponsor has the right to close this study at any time, although this 
should occur only after consultation between involved parties. The Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (EC/IRB) must be informed. Should the study/center be closed prematurely, all study materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) will be retained on site by [CONTACT_456]/investigator.  
4.5Treatments 
4.5.1Treatments To Be Administered 
This study is designed with two blinded treatment groups (C1INH vs. 
Placebo). Each group will include 20 patients in a treatment arm and 20 patients in a placebo arm.  
This design is not statistically powered to show significant differences if 
there is a 30-50% reduction in the treatment group but may trend towards positive treatment effect since extensive DGF (40-50%)is expected in KDPI >80 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The dose of C1INH chosen is (500U/kidney) which should be sufficient to bind all endothelial surfaces in the transplanted kidney. This is based on our observations from our experience using C1INH vs. placebo to prevent antibody-mediated rejection in humans.  In those randomized to placebo, an equivalent volume of placebo (0.9% normal saline) will be administered prior to graft reperfusion. Both groups (C1INH or placebo) will 
receive an intrarenal administration of heparinized normal saline before 
study drug administration. 
Patients who fulfill all I/E criteria will be eligible to be enrolled into 
this Phase I/II study.  
4.5.2Identity Of Investigational Product(s)

[IP_ADDRESS] Berinert® (C1INH Dosing) 
For the planned study, subjects will receive C1NH 500U/kidney infused into 
the renal artery pre-operatively 1-2 hours before graft reperfusion. For all dose reconstitutions, Berinert® is provided in single dose vials of 500 units. Each vial will be reconstituted in 10 ml sterile water for injection.  Placebo will be administered in an identical volume. C1INH will be preceded by [CONTACT_745063]. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Placebo Dosing The placebo used in this study will be 0.9% normal saline administered as a 
single dose into the renal artery, 1-2 hours before graft reperfusion. The 
total volume will be identical to that calculated for Berinert® infusions. 
Placebo will be preceded by [CONTACT_745063].

[IP_ADDRESS] Induction Antibody Therapy All patients enrolled into this study will be treated with induction 
antibody therapy with Thymoglobulin® OR Campath 1H. For Thymoglobulin®, the 
first dose will be given immediately after the transplantation procedure to follow with additional doses so that patients receive up to 6 mg/kg (1.5mg/kg/dose) using standard institutional treatment guidelines for use of this agent in this patient population. Campath 1H will be administered in a single [ADDRESS_1019080]-transplant. No induction administration of IL-2 receptor inhibitors is permitted in this protocol.

The C1INH or placebo dose will be preceded by [CONTACT_745062]. 
If a patient is enrolled into the study but the transplant does not occur as 
planned (e.g. transplant is cancelled due to donor organ quality at time of transplant), the patient will be considered a “screening without transplant”. The patient will be maintained on the study ID # that was

For the placebo arm, an equivalent volume of normal saline will be prepared in an identical dispensing medium as the C1INH product, labeled as stated above, and transported to the surgical suite and matched with the matching patient chart. Before the study treatment (Berinert or placebo), heparinized normal saline will be administered to the allograft. This method of drug administration has not been FDA approved and may have unforeseen risks  
In case of a medical emergency, the study drug assignment for a particular

The event must also be documented on the study termination record, the AE page of the CRF, and in source documents. Additionally, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_745031] a written explanation describing the event within [ADDRESS_1019084] approximately

sensation or motor power, or altered consciousness, vision, or speech. Patients will be assessed for evidence of DVT or other TEs per the usual 
standard process. Routine measurements of coagulation factors to evaluate 
DIC (D-Dimers, fibrinogen, PT, PTT) will be performed per standard process. 
  [IP_ADDRESS] Evidence of a Thrombotic Effect of C1INH Administration when Given 
in Supraphysiologic Dosages to Humans: The German Medical Profession’s Drugs 
Committee (AkdÅ) reported on 13 cases of severe thrombus formation after Berinert® infusions. These infusions were given to neonates undergoing cardiac surgery and doses of Berinert® were given at exceedingly high doses (~500U/kg) without control studies (see Appendix C). Nine of these infants died of this complication. The conclusions from this report are as follows:   
•There are no studies to support the use of C1INH outside of those with 
hereditary angioneurotic edema.  
•The use of C1INH in patients who do not have C1INH deficiency may result 
in abnormal coagulation parameters with propensity to thrombosis. 
•There are no controlled studies that suggests a benefit of C1INH therapy 
in conditions other than C1INH deficiency.  
•Any proposed uses outside of C1INH deficiency should be conducted in a 
controlled manner to monitor for unexpected or unanticipated side effects of C1INH therapy. 
 Clearly, this is a serious and unanticipated complication of C1INH therapy that could potentially limit its use in patients with other conditions where complement inhibition would be desirable. This is the case with our proposal.  Inhibition of complement activation post-transplant has great potential for prevention of complement-dependent DGF. In addition, there is an important unmet need for new therapeutics in the prevention and treatment 
of DGF. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], it is important to assess the tolerability and safety 
of C1INH therapy in this patient population. Although the C1INH dosing proposed in our study is much less than that reported to be associated with TE and well below therapeutic dosing recommendations (20-50U/kg) (500U/kidney once on Day 0), and will be administered intra-renally, there is still a possibility that increasing C1INH levels above normal baseline could have deleterious effects and induce coagulation abnormalities. Recent safety data from clinical trials of C1INH for use in C1INH deficiency have not reported TE with one exception of a basilar artery thrombosis in a patient treated for C1INH deficiency (Appendix C). This event was deemed unrelated to C1INH therapy. As previously indicated if significant coagulation abnormalities or TE events are seen in any study patient, the 
study will be terminated. However, data from our recently completed study of 
C1INH in prevention of antibody-mediated rejection ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in a 
randomized placebo controlled study showed no evidence of thrombotic events 
in any patient treated with Berinert® at 20U/kg x [ADDRESS_1019089]-transplant. In addition, recent reports from the FDA 
(Gandhi et al) suggests that thrombotic events do occur with C1INH therapy, 
but most cases are associated with the product (Cinryze®).

7Adverse Events (AEs) 
7.1Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring 
7.2Adverse Event (AE) Definitions 
7.2.1Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered with a pharmaceutical product. The AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related, include the following:  
•An AE occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional 
practice, 
•An AE occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional, 
•An AE occurring from drug abuse,  
•An AE occurring from drug withdrawal.  
CONFIDENTIAL     C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant




•An AE where there is a reasonable possibility that the event occurred 
purely as a result of the subjects participation in the study (e.g. adverse event or serious adverse event due to discontinuation of anti-hypertensive drugs during wash-out phase) must also be reported as an adverse event even if it is not related to the investigational product. 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action 
is not recorded as an AE if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  If, however, the event fulfills any of the criteria for a “serious” AE (SAE), it must be recorded and reported as such. 
 
7.2.2Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
•results in death 
•is life-threatening 
•requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
•results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
•is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
•is an important medical event 
Life-threatening:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an adverse event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  Any AE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330733], UNLESS at least one of the following exceptions are met: 
•The admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study)    
OR 
•The admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., 
social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933])   
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In 
addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more 
stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedent. 
Disability :  a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life’s functions. 
Important medical event : Any adverse event may be considered serious because 
it may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance for determination of important medical events refer to the “ WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical 
Terms List” . These terms either refer to or might be indicative of a serious 
disease state.


Such reported events warrant special attention because of their possible 
association with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on other terms. 
SAE medwatch reports  WILL NOT be filled out for any prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745038]’ primary disease (ESRD).  For example, prolonged admissions for dialysis or readmission for fluid overload as a consequence of ESRD since this this is an expected complication of the patients’ disease state and not 
related to study drug. These events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_978]. 
Otherwise, all SAEs medwatch reports will be submitted to the IRB, and FDA.  
 7.2.3Unexpected Adverse Event (AE) 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure (or Package Insert for marketed products). Also, reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented adverse event constitute unexpected AEs. For example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator Brochure would be considered “unexpected”. Specific examples would be; (a) acute renal failure as a labeled adverse event with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis. 
 
7.2.4Relationship Of Adverse Event To Investigational Product 
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the administration of study 
drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the case report form. 
An assessment of ‘No’ would include: 1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g., mechanical 
bleeding at surgical site; or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the subject is struck by [CONTACT_745073]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_745039]. 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the adverse event 
to study drug include:  
•The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur 
after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event 
•Recovery on discontinuation (de-challenge), recurrence on reintroduction 
(re-challenge): Subject’s response after drug discontinuation (de-challenge) or subject’s response after drug re-introduction (re-challenge) should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question

•Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be 
evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have 
•Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the subject is 
taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in 
question 
•The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The 
pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test drug(s), coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
 
7.2.5Severity Of The Adverse Event (AE) 
The following classification should be used: The severity of AEs should be graded as follows: 
•Mild – usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with 
normal activities 
•Moderate – sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities 
•Severe – prevents normal activities. 
 7.2.6Adverse Event (AE) Documentation 
All AEs occurring after the subject has signed the informed consent must be 
fully recorded in the subject’s case record form. 
Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s file.  A 
laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an AE.  Each event should be described in detail along 
with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational 
product, action taken and outcome. 
 7.3Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Pregnancy 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory test abnormalities 
fulfilling the definition of serious, after signing the informed consent and during follow-up period must immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the person detailed in the study file.  A Serious Adverse Event Form  must also be completed within [ADDRESS_1019093] be reported to the IRB and FDA in accordance

Pregnancy occurring during a clinical investigation, although not considered 
an SAE, must be reported to the IRB within the same timelines as an SAE on a Pregnancy Monitoring Form . The outcome of a pregnancy should be followed up 
carefully and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. This also applies to pregnancies following the administration of the investigational product to the father prior to sexual intercourse.

SECTION  V: RESEARCH PLAN 
 
1. Statement of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, o r the hypotheses to be tested.   
Specific Aims: 
1.Determine the incidence of prostate cancer in men with the BRCa2 gene mutation  as an 
independent indicator for prostate cancer screening . 
2. Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  
 
Prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among men with an 
estimated 230,[ADDRESS_906008] that BRCA2 mutation carriers are at significantly higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_670633],  [1-4
] prospective data is 
lacking. Concern about whether this mutation confers more advanced disease and worse 
survival may contribute to significant anxiety in some men.  A man in England with a BRCA2 
mutatio n, for example,  was so worried about his possible risk of prostate cancer that he had a 
Page 10 of 24 
 prophylactic surgical removal of his prostate[ 5].  This example clearly illustrates the key 
knowledge gaps that exist about the actual risk  of prostate cancer among BRCA2 mutation 
carriers.  
 
We have established a multidisciplinary group of radiation oncologists, urologists, geneticists 
and engineers that is uniquely positioned to address this knowledge gap about the importance 
of the BRCA mutation and risk of prostate cancer.  Our group has developed the Yale School of 
Medicine Fusion Prostate Biopsy  Program. This program uses cutting -edge multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify previously invisible lesions in the prostate. The office -based Artemis platform (Eigen, Grass Valley CA)  then “fuses” these images with 3D 
ultrasound to achieve more precise and accurate prostate biopsies , allowing for better clinical 
staging with a single biopsy.  The Yale Fusion Prostate Biopsy Program has dramatically improved prostate cancer detection to  more than 60%, almost twice that of the current standard 
of care.   Through t he Yale Cancer Center Genetic Counseling program , which  provides genetic 
counseling and testing to people at increased risk for hereditary cancer, we have an established 
cohort of  families with known genetic mutations including BRCA2.  
 
Our study, by [CONTACT_670643] a population of BRCA2 mutation 
carriers, is a novel approach to accurately determine the risk of prostate cancer, adverse pathologic features and abnormal MRI findings among BRCA2 mutation carriers. While it is 
beyond the scope of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_50522], we believe that early identification of men with higher risk 
disease should allow for more rapid treatment and a higher likelihood of cure.  We hypothesize 
that the BRCA -2 mutation is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer incidence, worse 
grade, and abnormal MRI findings compared to patients without this mutation.  To address these important questions, our specific aims are:  
 
1. To prospectively determine the incidence of prostate cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers.    
2. To investigate different characteristics of MRI -detected prostate lesions.    
   
3. To compare pathologic  and clinical  findings to clinically matched controls  using the same 
sensitive MRI -based biopsy technique . 
4.  
Localized prostate cancer is treatable and often curable while metastatic disease is not,  hence 
prostate cancer screening is performed to identify  patients at an earlier stage . Early d etection  
of prostate cancer in this group of younger men at high-risk population may  allow for 
identification while at a lower stage and grade, potentially increasing the number of patients 
able to receive treatment with curative intent.  
 All previous studies in the literature have evaluated the incidence of BRCA2 mutation 
carriers in a population of patients already diagnosed with prostate cancer.  The incidence of prostate cancer in men with a BRCA2 mutation, however, has not been previously described. 
 
3. Research Plan:  Summarize the study design and research procedures using non- technical 
language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to 
distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include 
any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths.  Describe the setting in 
which the research will take place.  
Page [ADDRESS_906009] and prostate physical examination  beginning at age 50 years and if 
either is abnormal an MRI of the prostate followed by [CONTACT_670644]-targeted biopsy of the prostate is performed  (Figures 1 and 2).  Men with genetic risk factors such as African American or 
Caribbean heritage,  a positive family history of prostate cancer, or a BRCA2 mutation, are 
counseled about their increased risk of prostate cancer and that prostate cancer screening (PSA and prostate exam then MRI and prostate biopsy if indicated) should b egin at age 40yr 
but is available to them at any age.  
Study participants will be identified because of their BRCA2 mutation that places th em at 
increased  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_171278].  
Because this is a pre -selected high -risk 
population,  and our goal is to establish the incidence of cancer and association of risk factors 
with developi[INVESTIGATOR_516954],  all men ≥[ADDRESS_906010] PSA testing, prostate examination, Pelvic MRI, 
and Artemis fusion prostate biopsy (Figures 1 and 2).   
Men identified to have prostate cancer will be treated according to current standards of care. 
Treatment for prostate cancer at the Yale Cancer Center is largely based on clinical risk; options include, but are not limited to, active surveillance for appropriate men with low risk 
disease, treatment with curative intent for men with localized intermediate and high risk 
prostate cancer, and systemic therapy for men with metastatic disease.

specific regions in the prostate gland for systematic sampling of the gland. If any areas 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147503] (labeled regions of interest (ROIs)) are identified in the MRI, they are 
outlined using specialized software, and the target is visible on the Artemis device. Targeted 
biopsies will be taken from each ROI  to rule out cancer in these suspi[INVESTIGATOR_187970].

5. Subject Population: Provide a detailed description of the types of human subjects who will 
be recruited into this study. 
 
Men ≥[ADDRESS_906011] classification: Check off all classifications of subjects that will be specifically 
recruited  for enrollment  in the research project.  Will subjects who may require additional 
safeguards or other considerations be enrolled in the study? If so, identify the population of 
subjects requiring special safeguards and provide a justification for their involvement. 
 
 Children    Healthy   Fetal material, placenta, or dead fetus  
 Non -English Speaking  Prisoners    Economically disadvantaged persons 
 Decisionally Impaired   Employees    Pregnant women and/or fetuses 
 Yale Students   Females of childbearing potential 
 
NOTE: Is this research proposal designed to enroll children who are wards of the state as potential subjects? 
 Yes   No (If yes, see Instructions section VII #4 for further 
requirements)  
  
7. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : What are the criteria used to determine subject inclusion or    
exclusion?  
All men ≥[ADDRESS_906012] an MRI, and able to give informed consent will be approached to participate in the study.  If a man has received or is currently receiving treatment for prostate cancer he 
will be excluded from the study. 
 
 
8. How will eligibility  be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]?  
Yale genetic counselors  will determine  initial eligibility from the BRCA2 registry  to confirm 
the presence of a BRCA2 mutation.  Trained physicians will determine clinical eligibility based on medical history.  
9. Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, 
discomforts, or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research.  
Risks of prostate biopsy include: infecti on, rectal bleeding, blood in urine or semen, 
prostatitis,  urosepsis, urinary retention, and potential difficulty with urination.  
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x -
rays, to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_670636] s of various parts of the body.  The [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, and we carefully observe those guidelines.   

Page [ADDRESS_906013] the magnet and hitting the participant .  To reduce this risk we require 
that all people involved with the study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets.  Nothing metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time.  Also, once the participant is  in the magnet, the door to the room will be closed so that no one 
from outside accidentally goes near the magnet.  
 
 
 
 
10. Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above- mentioned risks will be 
minimized.  
Risks will be minimized using standard of care methods to limit prostate biopsy- related 
patient disco mfort and the risk of infection through administration of local anesthetic and 
peri-procedure antibiotics, respectively. 
FDA guidelines for MRI safety are strictly adhered to.  
 
11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitor ing Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24. a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in 
this study?  
 - Moderate risk: participants  will be offered the standard of care fusion targeted 
prostate biopsy that is performed at Yale and offered to other patients at risk for 
prostate cancer .  Some participa nts, however, would not have received a biopsy if not 
participating in the study.  
 1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether th e study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close 
to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  have the authority to stop or suspend the 
study or require modifications.

 2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following 
reasons: (choose those that apply)  
 
1. We do not view the risks associated with the prostate biopsy as minimal given the 
alternative is no biopsy. 
2. Give n the now established safety and validity of the current biopsy procedure in our 
prior work, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk. 
 
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for anticipated and/o r unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur 
since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows: 
      3. Attribution of Adverse Events: 
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to   the study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_670637]: 
 
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).  
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational proce dures(s)/agent(s).  
      4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events: 
 
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during 
the study: 
 
1. Mild adverse event  
2. Moderate adverse event  
3. Severe  
      5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of  Adverse Events:  
      Serious Adverse Events:  
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170560] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it: 
 
1. is life -threateni ng OR  
2. results in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57186]  
3. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity OR  
Page [ADDRESS_906014]’s health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, OR  
6. adversely affects the risk/benefit ratio of the study  
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is important for t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] 
“seriousness” when determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessa ry. 
 
6. Plan for reporting Reportable Adverse Events and other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to the IRB 
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: a) adverse 
events that are serious or l ife-threatening AND unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring 
with a greater frequency than expected ) AND possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
drug/device/intervention; and b) other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. 
 
These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate forms found on the website.  
 
 
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co -investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC),  Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding 
and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision- mak ing bodies.  
 
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be 
notified (choose those that apply): 
 
X All Co -Investigators listed on the protocol. 
 
X Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
□ National Institutes of Health  
□ Food and Drug Administration (Physician-Sponsored IND #_______) 
□ Medical Research Foundation (Grant______) 
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_670638] a review of all adverse events upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_238341] 18 of 24

are required.  
 
d. For multi- site studies for which the Yale PI [INVESTIGATOR_670639]: N/A  
 
12. Statistical Considerations:  Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.  
This is a screening study to establish  the incidence of prostate cancer in a high-risk 
population since it is not currently known.  There is  an estimated  4.6-23 fold increased risk of 
prostate cancer, especially in men < 58 years of age with a BRCA2 mutation. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , 
prostate cancer detecti on in normal risk men correlates  directly with age and ranges between 
0.01 and 6.5% for men in their 30s -60s ( CDC website).  Given these parameters, we plan 
initial evaluation of 100 men.

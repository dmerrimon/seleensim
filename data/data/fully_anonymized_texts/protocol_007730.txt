Context : Reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI) contributes to 
poor clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions.  The incidence, mechanism and 
substantial adverse clinical outcomes of PI [INVESTIGATOR_801422] (CF), and 
the life sustaining role of pancreatic  enzyme medication  in CF care is well established1-3.  Much less 
is known about the incidence and impact of RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801423] (CP).  
Reliable non -invasive screening or diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available 
for RPF/P I. 
Objectives : The objective of this study is to evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool 
coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential screening 
or diagnostic tests for RPF/PI . A further objective is to  determine the test responses  before and 
after pancreatic enzyme medication administration (Creon36TM) in the patients with CP . We will 
also explore the association of specific genotypes with fat malabsorption in the context of CP.  
Study Design:  This is a cohort study of subjects with CP who will be evaluated before and after 
pancreatic enzyme medication  (Creon36TM) administration.  A cohort of healthy subjects will serve 
as a comparison group  and will be evaluated only once . 
Settin g/Participants: This outpatient study will be conducted at CHOP . Twenty four subjects with CP  
and evidence of being at -risk for malabsorption, age [ADDRESS_1106336] die tary or fat absorption will be 
enrolled.  
Study Interventions and Measures:  Subjects with CP will receive Creon36TM, a pancreatic enzyme  
medication , and fat and energy absorption will be evaluated using three methods: MBT, CFA, and 
BC before and after administration of Creon36TM .  Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801424].  Pancreatic enzyme medication  will likely improve clinical 
outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy volunteers will be 
evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to optimize the 
understanding and interpretation of the find ings from the three methods and the RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801425].  There will be no intervention for the healthy cohort.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Diagnosing Pancreatic -Based Malabsorption in Patients with Chronic 
Pancreatitis  
Funder  [COMPANY_013] Inc.   
Clinical Phase  Phase II  – This is an open -label intervention therapeutic exploratory study  
Study Rationale  Reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI) 
contributes to poor clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions.  
The incidence, mechanism and substantial adverse clinical outcomes of PI [INVESTIGATOR_801426] (CF), and the life sustaining role of 
pancreatic  enzyme medication  in CF care is well established1-3.  Much less is 
known about the incidence and impact of RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801427] (CP).  Reliable non -invasive screening or diagnostic tests with 
acceptable patient burden are not available for RPF/P I.  We propose a study to 
evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool coefficient of fat absorption 
(CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential screening or 
diagnostic tests for RPF/PI . In subjects with CP, we also propose to administ er 
pancreatic enzyme medication (Creon36TM) to determine the test responses  
before and after pancreatic enzyme medication administration in these 
patients .  Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801428]. Pancreatic  enzyme medication  will likely improve clinical 
outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy 
volunteers will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential 
comparison data to optimize the understanding and interp retation of the 
findings from the three methods and the RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801429].  
Study Objective(s)  Primary   
Utilizing the MBT, CFA and BC methods to identify RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801430], 
our primary hypotheses  are:  
H1: Subjects diagnosed with CP and not receiving pancreatic enzyme 
medication will have RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801431], CFA and BC fat 
and energy absorption pattern compared to healthy participants.   
H2: Subjects with CP with reduced RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801432], CFA and BC fat and 
energy  absorption pattern will have improved fat absorption after pancreatic 
enzyme medication (Creon36TM) as indicated by [CONTACT_756876], CFA and BC increased 
fat and energy absorption pattern.   
Secondary  
The secondary objective  of this proposal is to utilize these d ata to optimize the 
MBT design and application by [CONTACT_801462].  
H3:  The MBT will be optimized to identify RPF/PI [CONTACT_4490] 3 -4 blood samples (vs 9 
current samples) over 4 -5-hours (vs current 8 -hours).  
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  2 
We will explore the utili ty of the MBT compared to the CFA and BC (both 
require the burdensome 72 -hour total stool and dietary intake collection) in 
identifying differences in fat absorption between subjects with CP and healthy 
comparisons  and within the CP cohort, with and withou t pancreatic enzyme 
medication . We will also  collect saliva for genetic testing, in order  explore the 
association of specific genotypes with fat malabsorption in the context of CP.

Study Design  
 We propose to characterize pancreatic -based fat malabsorption in subjects 
with chronic pancreatitis (CP) compared to a healthy comparison group. 
Furthermore, w e propose a longitudinal study design to assess pancreatic -
based fat absorption before and after pancreatic enzyme medication  in 
subjects with CP .

Study Location  All study visits will occur at outpatient research offices  at the Clinical and 
Translational Research Center  of the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP), 
a pediatric health care center.  
Study Duration  CP subject participation will last  about  four  weeks  
Healthy subject participation will last  about  one week   
Study Phases   Screening : screening for eligibility and obtaining consent  
Visit 1 : First  study visit at CHOP  for CP ( pancreatic enzyme medication -naive) 
and Healthy subjects  
 Visit 2 : One to four  week s after  end of stool collection for first visit , a follow -up 
visit at CHOP  for CP subjects only after three -day pancreatic enzyme 
medication  treatment  
Efficacy Evaluations  The efficacy of pancreatic enzyme medication  administration ( Creon36TM) will 
be evaluated in subjects with CP using MBT, CFA% and BC o utcomes  
Pharmacokinetic  
Evaluations  N/A 
Safety Evaluations  Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_271938]. The frequencies of AEs 
by [CONTACT_24975], body system, severity and relationship to study supplement will be 
summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail.  
Statistical And 
Analytic Plan  The goal of the primary aims is to 1) describe pancreatic -based fat 
malabsorption in subjects with CP using MBT, SFA% and BC outcomes 
compared to  healthy subjects, and 2) compare these outcomes before and 
after pancreatic enzyme medication  administration in subjects with chronic 
pancreatitis.  Descriptive statistics for MBT, CFA% and BC outcomes (mean, 
standard deviation, median, range, 95% CI) will  be calculated for the CP cohort 
and for the healthy comparison  group, and differences between CP and healthy 
groups assessed with unpaired t tests.  For the MBT outcomes, a moment -
based pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be performed based on non -
compartm ental methodology using WinNonLin version 9.1 (Pharsight, Cary, 
NC). Baseline (C 0) and maximum (C max) plasma concentrations are calculated, 
and area under the curve from time zero to eight hours (AUC) is calculated 
using the linear trapezoid method. PK parameters can then be compared 
between treatment groups using a paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as 
appropriate. Alternately, p opulation PK analyses for repeated -measures 
endpoints can be conducted via nonlinear mixed -effects modeling. Descripti ve 
statistics for MBT, CFA% and BC outcomes (mean, standard deviation, median, 
range, 95% CI) will also be calculated for the CP cohort with and without 
pancreatic enzyme medication administration, and the significance of changes 
over time assessed with pa ired t tests. A mixed effects modeling approach will 
be employed to examine the correlation of subject characteristics (age, BMI, 
sex, disease status, etc.) to PA and HA exposure metrics derived from the non -
compartmental analysis to assess change over tim e in MBT response to 
pancreatic enzyme medication  administration in subjects with CP.  
   
  _ 
IRB [ADDRESS_1106337] reproducible estimate of the full 8 -hour MBT ( nine  blood 
samples) in the CP and healthy cohorts. The goal is a shorter sampling scheme 
for the MBT to optimize its use as a clinical diagnostic test.  In exploratory 
analyses, we will compare the methods for detection of fat malabsorption as 
measured by [CONTACT_654378]% and BC with fat absorption as measured by [CONTACT_801464]. A correlation analysis will 
be conducted to evaluate the performance of the MBT relative to that of the 
CFA%. HA and PA C max, AUC, and HA/PA ratios will be plotted against CFA% or BC 
caloric loss to explore the relationship between the two tests.  Any relationships 
observed in the plots will be further explored using correlation analysis and 
appropriate regression analysis as dictated by [CONTACT_801465]. If a reasonable 
model can be developed to describe the response of MBT, CFA% and BC 
response t o pancreatic enzyme medication  treatment within the CP  cohort, 
additional simulation studies will be performed to further examine the 
performance characteristics of both tests.  
MONITORING PLAN The Principal Investigator (PI) ([CONTACT_801491]) is ultimately responsible for

adverse clinical outcomes of PI [INVESTIGATOR_801422] (CF), and the life 
sustaining role of pancreatic  enzyme medication  in CF care is well established1-3.  Much less is 
known about the incidence and impact of RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801423] (CP).  Reliable 
non-invasive screening or diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available for 
RPF/P I.  We propose a study to evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool coefficient of fat 
absorption (CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential screening or diagnostic 
tests for RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801436] -naive status in patients with CP.  Many patients with 
CP are at risk for RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801437].  Pancreatic enzyme medication 
will likely improve clinica l outcomes and quality of life in those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy 
volunteers will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to 
optimize the understanding and interpretation of the findings from the three methods and th e 
RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801429].   All subjects will be seen at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]’s  
outpatient  Clinical Translational Research Center.

CREON (pancrelipase) Delayed -Release Capsules 36,000 USP units of lipase ( Creon36TM), a 
pancreatic enzyme preparation, is a drug that requires prescription for use.  It is approved for use, 
including the current indication and dosage, by [CONTACT_1622].   
1.3 Findings from Non -Clinical and Clinical Stud ies 
N/A – This is an FDA approved drug  
1.4 Selection of Drugs and Dosages  
Subjects with CP will take Creon36TM for nine days, and the daily dose selected is 72,000 lipase units 
per meal  (two capsules)  and 36,000 units per snack (one capsule), with each Creon capsule 
containing  36,[ADDRESS_1106339] demonstrated significant improvement in fat 
absorption from before to after pancreatic enzym e medication  administration15-21. Ramesh et al15 
found an increase in CFA% from 66.7 ±14.0 before pancreatic enzyme medication  to 88.9 ±5.2% 
after pancreatic enzyme medication (a change of 22.7 ±12.2%) in Indian adults with CP.  Also in 
adults from India participating in a placebo -controlled trial, Tho rat et al16 saw CFA% increase from 
66.5 ±14.1 to 86.1 ±7.5% in those taking pancreatic enzyme medication compared to an increase 
from 67.0 ±14.0 to 72.9 ±11.5% for placebo, a treatment  effect of 13.7% (95% CI: 9.1, 18.2) after 
one week of pancreatic enzyme medication . Others have detected similar improvements in 
absorption in pancreatic enzyme medication trials in people with CP living in the US and in Eas tern 
Europe17, 18.  Additional s elected references from the past four years are noted here4, [ADDRESS_1106340] been identified (PRSS1, CTRC, CTFR, SPI[CONTACT_66150]1),44-[ADDRESS_1106341] been implicated 
(CaSR, CEL, CPA1, PRSS2 -3, SBDS, UBR1 and CLDN2).44, 45 The association of specific genotypes with 
fat malabsorption  in the context of CP  remains to be fully explored .   
Patients with CP are rarely evaluated for RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801438] -invasive, clinically 
available, affordable, acceptable and reliable diagnostic tests.  Historically, the CFA is considered 
the gold standard for RPF/PI [CONTACT_637].  However, CFA is almost never used in clinical care in large 
part due to patient burden related to [ADDRESS_1106342] using software that calculates the daily and three day 
average fat intake (g/day).  The multiple stool sample containers are shipped to one of a few 
laboratories that homogenizes and measures stool fat content (g/day).   CFA% is calculated by [CONTACT_801468]. Lastly, reference ranges for healthy 
individuals evaluated with modern techniques for stool and dietary collections, and fat extraction 
and measurement are unavailable.  
The MBT uses the general approach of the commonly utilized  glucose tolerance test, with 
consumption of a beverage containing the nutrient of interest (fatty acid, rather than glucose) 
followed by  [CONTACT_801469].  The 
MBT consists of administering tw o odd -chain  length  fatty acids: pentadecanoic acid (PA), a free 
fatty acid that does not require pancreatic lipase for absorption; and triheptadecanoic acid (THA), a 
triglyceride that requires pancreatic lipase for hydrolysis to three heptadecanoic (HA) fa tty acids. 
These two fatty acids were selected for the MBT for the following reasons: 1) they are found in 
small amounts only in dairy foods; 2) the vast majority of individuals have very low serum 
concentrations of PA and HA; 3) they are safe even in larg er doses than typi[INVESTIGATOR_801439]; 
and 4) they are easily identified in the serum by [CONTACT_10070] -established laboratory methods and 
absorption pharmacokinetics that can be readily described.  Following the ingestion of the MBT 
fatty acids, the pharmacokin etics of the fat absorption for both PA and HA is assessed over an 8 -
hour period and the relative absorption of HA/PA is determined. A moment -based pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis is performed based on non -compartmental methodology using WinNonLin version 9. 1 
(Pharsight, Cary, NC). Baseline (C 0) and maximum (C max) plasma concentrations are calculated, and 
area under the curve from time zero to eight hours (AUC) is calculated using the linear trapezoid 
   
  _ 
IRB [ADDRESS_1106343] as appropriate. To describe HA exposure relative to that of PA, the ratio 
of the HA to PA C max (Cmax HA/PA) and AUC (AUC HA/PA) is calculated for each subject after molar 
transformation and dose -normalization of exposure metrics.  Also, p opulation PK analyses for 
repeated -measures endpoints is  conducted via nonlinear mixed -effects modeling with a qualified 
installation of the nonlinear mixed -effects modeling (NONMEM) software, Version VII, Level 2.0  
(ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD)48. Using this method, population PK modeling is 
conducted by [CONTACT_801470].  
We have shown that the MBT detects pancreatic -based fat malabsorption in healthy subjects using 
a lipase inhibitor medication (Orlistat)[ADDRESS_1106344] fat malabsorption in 
subjects with CP compared to healthy subjects, and the utility of the tests in detecting changes in 
fat absorption before and after pancreatic enzyme medication . The CFA is the “gold standard” for 
documenting fat malabsorption in research and in the regulatory environment.  Currently CFA is the 
only method accepted by [CONTACT_801471]/PI.  Furthermore, a shorter 
sampling scheme for the MB T will be explored to optimize its potential use in clinical research.  
With these data from n = 48 participants  including healthy comparisons  and participants with 
varying severity of RPF/PI, pharmacokinetic methods will be employed to explore the possib ility to 
reduce the time required and number of blood samples needed for the MBT to provide reliable 
classification of RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801440] -RPF/PI.  
It is very likely that some patients with CP have RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801441] . There is no well accepted (non -invasive, acceptable patient 
burden, reasonably informative, and cost effective) approach to support clinical research or clinical 
care, nor are there established general clinical indicators or nutritional  status risk factors to guide 
care of patients. Clinicians may avoid serious consideration of the possibility of exocrine pancreatic 
deterioration or just empi[INVESTIGATOR_801442] . Improved care of patients with 
CP will be supported by [CONTACT_801472]. The proposed study will contribute evidence to support 
future patient care in CP and physician education about RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801443] s group.  
1.6 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance of all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801444] 45 CFR 46 .  All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent , and 
will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The 
Children’ s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. 
Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and 
welfare of research subjects during and after the study.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
3.1.1 Screening Phase  
Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subjects will 
be recruited from regional academic hospit als and gastroenterology, and pancreatology 
subspecialty centers.  Primary recruitment centers will include: 1) University of Pennsylvania 
Medical Center Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ; 2) Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ; 3) Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] ; and 4)  Philadelphia

include : 1) GI Centers at the Jefferson Medical Center ; 2) Main Line Medical Center ( Lankenau and 
Bryn Mawr Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) ; and 3) other regional cent ers.  These outside institutions wil l be involved 
with recruitment of subjects only and will otherwise not be engaged in the research.  W e will 
recruit the healthy subjects from the greater Philadelphia region using general adult practices, 
flyers, and recommendations from subjects with CP regarding healthy f amily  and friends interested 
in participating . The CHOP Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC) will be utilized to recruit healthy 
adult subjects. The Recruitment Enhancement Core provides assistance wit h recruitment plan 
development and may assist in identifying and contact[CONTACT_801473] ( CRU ), the CHOP Recruitment Registry and internal communication resources.  Our 
research team anticipates no difficulty in enrolling well -qualified participants with the proposed 
sample size  and staff ( see Table 2. Study Timeline ).  Informed consent  will be obtained prior to any 
study rel ated procedures being performed , and this will include the discontinuation of pancreatic 
enzyme medication for those participants who are taking this medication at the time of enrollment 
in the study .

4.[ADDRESS_1106352] Completion/Withdrawal  
For subjects with CP who were naïve to pancreatic enzyme medication  at the start of the study, at 
the end of participation in the study ( all collections are complete for Visit 2 ) Creon36TM will be 
discontinued and th ey will and resume  their  usual care without pancreatic enzyme medication .  For 
subjects with CP who were receiving pancreatic enzyme medication  prior to the start of the study , 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  19 
at the end of participation in the study ( all collections are complete for Visit 2 ), Creon36TM will be 
discontinued  and they will resume their usual care and will resume the pancreatic enzyme product 
and dose they were receiving before the study began .  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also 
be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study 
treatment or visit schedules, or adverse events . The Invest igator or the Sponsor may also withdraw 
subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for 
administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical 
study. If the Investigator  becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject 
completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the 
CRF.  
[ADDRESS_1106353] Review  
Variables that will be abstracted from the medical chart (paper or electronic) : 
 Date of birth  - Age 30 -75 years old  
 Sex 
 CP diagnosis:  Participants with CP will be characterized based on the TIGAR -O (toxic, 
genetic, autoimmune,  recurrent, obstructive) etiology system, on pancreatic morphology 
(Cambridge criteria) when available, and on physiological state (exocrine and endocrine 
function) as recommended by [CONTACT_801476]4.   
 History of unintentional weight loss or history of increased stools per week  
 Other clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of fat malabsorption  
 History of pancreatic enzyme use  
 History of allergy to pork, Current diagnosis of gout and treatment w ith allopurinol medical 
therapy, or intestinal blockage or fibrosing colonopathy   
 All m edications , particularly  medications that alter fat absorption (weight loss medications 
or ursodeoxycholic acid)  
5.1.2 Laboratory Evaluations  
Serum 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D  and pre -albumin (vitamin A) will be assessed at CHOP laboratories.  
Serum retinol  and α-tocopherol  [vitamin E]  will be assayed at Craft Laboratories.  PI[INVESTIGATOR_801445] (Sarah 
Booth , Tuft’s University, Medford, MA)  and/or undercarboxylated osteocalcin % (UCOC %) will be 
assessed for vitamin K status (Caren Gundberg , Yale University, New Haven, CT ). Zinc and selenium  
will be assessed at CHOP Laboratories using standard techniques .  This will provide additional 
evidence for vitamin, mineral and essential fatty acid status resulting from pancreatic disease that 
may be improved with pancreatic enzyme medi cation  in subjects with RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801446], 
CFA% and BC response .  For subjects with CP, safety measures include results from serum 
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count with differential (CBC)  performed 
at CHOP Laboratories using standard techniques .  The CMP will provide serum albumin, total 
protein, bilirubin and liver enzymes to provide additional liver and nutritional status information for 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  20 
the CP cohort. Also linoleic acid (essential fatty  acid panel)  will be assessed at ARUP Laboratories 
for the CP cohort only.   All individuals from institutions outside of CHOP will receive only coded, not 
readily identifiable,  samples for analyses and are not otherwise engaged in human subjects ’ 
research.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for pre-menopausal female subjects.   
5.1.3 Other Evaluations and Measures  
Genetic Testing:  Saliva will be collected for DNA sequencing of all exons and intronic junctions of all 
major pancreatitis risk factor genes, including PSSR1, CTRC, CFTR and SPI[CONTACT_66150]1,44-[ADDRESS_1106354] been reported as CP disease associated will also be 
sequenced (CaSR, CEL, CPA1, PRSS2 -3, SBDS, UBR1, and two SNPs near CLDN2). (Ariel Precision 
Medicine, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA).  Saliva samples are stable long term (>2y) and can be stored at room 
temperature to ship in batches.  
 
Fecal Elastase -1:  Pancreatic function will be assessed for the CP group by [CONTACT_756891] -1 to 
determine the level of pancreatic enzyme activity  in the stool51, 52 (Joli Diagnostics, Williamsville, 
NY). Subjects will be provided with the stool collect ion kit and proper instructions and supplies, and 
samples will be collected during the day of the visit if possible, or at home and returned. The stool 
sample will be stored at -20oC, and analyzed with a monoclonal enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay (ARUP Laboratory, Salt Lake City, UT).  
Anthropometric Assessment : Weight, height, and BMI will be assessed. Measures of body 
composition will also be conducted for relative muscle and fat. All anthropometric techniques will 
follow those described by [CONTACT_89869]53. Weight (0.1 kg) w ill be measured on a digital electronic 
scale (Seca, Munich, [LOCATION_013]) and stature (0.1 cm) on a stadiometer (Holtain, Crymych, [LOCATION_006]). 
Skinfold thickness will be measured (0.1 mm) at the triceps, biceps, subscapular, and supra -iliac 
sites with a skinfold cali per (Holtain, Crymych, [LOCATION_006]) to assess subcutaneous fat stores. Mid upper 
arm circumference measured with a non -stretchable fiberglass tape (0.1 cm) (McCoy, Maryland 
Heights, MO). Upper arm muscle and fat area Z scores will be generated54, 55.   
Body Composition : Total body composition, total FFM and FM and percent body fat (%FAT), will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_756892], adolescents, and adults56, 
57. Body composition will also be assessed by [CONTACT_11323] x -ray absorptiome try  
(DXA) whole body scans  (Delphi A, Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA) for subjects with CP only at Visit 1 . 
DXA uses very low -dose x -ray exposures (3 mrem) and measurements are rapid, making this a 
suitable technique for use in children. Standard positioning and clothing techniques are used. 
Quality control scans are performed daily using a simulated L1 -L4 lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_801447], and a whole body composition phantom. A difference of 
>1.5% from the standard will be deemed out -of-range requiring servicing by [CONTACT_3455]. 
Whole body will be assessed by [CONTACT_801477] 1 and Visit 2 . The scans will be analyzed to 
generate traditional DXA measures: whole body Area, BMC and areal -BMD (gm/cm2). In our 
institution, the in vitr o CV is less than 0.6% and the in vivo coefficient of variation in adults is less 
than 1%.  A urine pregnancy test will be performed on female subjects who are pre -menopausal 
prior to the scan. Pregnant subjects will not be scanned and will leave the study .

IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  21 
Dietary Intake :  Three -day weighed food records  will be obtained and calories, macro - and micro -
nutrient content calculated. Subjects will be provided with scales, spoons and all supplies necessary 
for the collection of the dietary data and will be con ducted with assistance from the CTRC staff and 
Bionutrition Unit58, 59. Dietary intake will be analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research 
software version 2012 developed by [CONTACT_659337] (NCC, University of 
Minnesota. Minneapolis, MN)60.   
Disease Classification:  Participants with CP will be characterized based on the TIGAR -O (toxic, 
geneti c, autoimmune, recurrent, obstructive) etiology system, on pancreatic morphology 
(Cambridge criteria) when available, and on physiological state (exocrine and endocrine function) as 
recommended by [CONTACT_801478]4. 
Home Environment  and Health Questionnaire : The questionnaire will be administered via interview 
by [CONTACT_16133], and will consist of two sections. The Health History  section has general 
questions about the subject’s health history including documentation of medical history, recent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133461], medication, history of pancreatic enzyme supplementation, and 
nutrient supplement use. A  Home  Environme nt section describes aspects of environment, such as 
education and income level, whether on Medicaid/Medicare and household size to describe the 
demographic characteristics. In addition to  subjects’  contact  [CONTACT_3031] (name, address, phone 
numbers) ; conta ct information from two additional  contacts will be collected to maintain contact 
[CONTACT_801479].  
Quality of Life Questionnaires : In order to assess the health -related quality of life (QOL ), validated 
questionnaires will be administered to all subjects at Visit 1. For all subjects, the Medical Outcomes 
Study 36 -Item Short -Form Health Survey (MOS SF -36), a standardized, validated healthy survey will 
be administered.  The MOS SF -36 covers physical functioning, bodily pain, general health 
perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional and mental health domains32, 61 -65.  
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMIS):   We will assess patient reported outcomes at every study 
visit using the following NIH developed PROMIS short forms: pain, fatigue, depressive symptoms, 
physical function – mobility, physical function – upper extremity, and peer relationships.  
Adherence:  Adherence to pancreatic enzyme medication  for subjects with CP will be assessed at 
study Visit [ADDRESS_1106355] information on adverse events experienced duri ng the course of the 
study.   
Adverse Events Diary: Subjects will be asked about all adverse events at both  Visit 1 and Visit 2 , and 
asked to rate by [CONTACT_2236] (mild, moderate, severe). Serious adverse events will be reported as per 
various policies in a t imely manner to CHOP IRB, and CTRC.  
5.[ADDRESS_1106356] (MBT) : The MBT primary outcomes consist of parameters from 
pharmacokinetic analyses.  The MBT consists of a simultaneo us oral dose of pentadecanoic acid 
(PA), a free fatty acid, and triheptadecanoic acid (THA), a triglyceride with three heptadecanoic (HA) 
saturated fatty acids requiring hydrolysis by [CONTACT_801480] (Patent # US 74 [ZIP_CODE] B2, July 22, 2008). The MBT with the PA and THA is delivered in a 
breakfast test meal after a [ADDRESS_1106357] and 24 hours without dairy foods. Serum  concentration  
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  22 
levels of PA and HA are assessed by [CONTACT_134276] -liquid chromatography (GC), from serum samples dr awn 
prior to M BT and then hourly for eight  hours.  The MBT test meal is prepared immediately before 
consumption, with 5.0g of PA and 5.5g of THA blended into a test meal composed of 64g vanilla 
Scandishake (Axcan Scandipharm, Birmingham, AL), 6oz silk light  chocolate soy milk, and 10ml 
microlipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (www.nestle -nutrition.com ). The  8oz MBT test meal contains ~550 calories, 32 g fat, 
and 52% of calories from fat. The test meal was designed to be similar to a high f at dinner meal. 
Prior to administration of the MBT test meal, an indwelling catheter is placed for baseline (0 Hour) 
and subsequent blood draws at Hour 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, [ADDRESS_1106358] meal is con sumed within five minutes of the baseline blood draw. 
After the Hour 6 blood draw, subjects consume a 1000 kcal, low fat (12 g) lunch meal, and two 
blood samples will follow this meal (Hours 7 and 8). During the eight -hour protocol period, subjects 
are off ered non -caloric and non -caffeinated beverages ad libitum . The [ADDRESS_1106359] day of the 72 -hour stool collection.

 Each subject in CP cohort will have two MBT, the first on a pancreatic enzyme medication -naïve 
protocol and the second after three days of pancreatic enzyme medication treatment. If subjects 
are receiving pancreatic enzyme medication  at study en rollment, after consultation with their 
medical team, they will be asked to discontinue pancreatic enzyme medication for three days prior 
to the first MBT, the day of the MBT and the five days following the MBT until the end of the 72 -
hour stool collection .  Thus, the total number of days of data collection for the enzyme -naïve MBT 
protocol will be seven for subjects not receiving pancreatic enzyme medication  at Visit 1 , and nine 
for those requiring a washout period from pancreatic enzyme medication  (see Table 3 ). For the 
MBT that will be administered with pancreatic enzyme medication , subjects will take pancreatic 
enzyme medication  for three days prior to the MBT. Each day, the pancreatic enzyme medication  
dose will be 72,000 lipase units per meal and 36,000 units per snack using Creon 36,000 units per 
capsule. They will take two Creon36TM (72,000 lipase units) with the MBT on the morning of the test 
meal. Pancreatic  enzyme medication  dose range for adults with RPF/PI [INVESTIGATOR_801448].  
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  23 
The dose chosen for these short term studies are in the higher range recommended for initial 
treatment5, 6.  Subjects will then continue to take pancreatic enzyme medication  at home for the 
next five days until the 72 -hour stool collection is completed.  The total number of days for the 
pancreatic enzyme medication  MBT protocol is nine (see Table 3 ).  For the healthy individuals , the 
MBT protocol will last one week  since they will be pancreatic enzyme medication -naïve.  
Plasma samples will be analyzed by a GC method  at Wake Forest University (Winston -Salem, NC) .  
Total lipi[INVESTIGATOR_801449] 200µL of plasma following the method of Bligh and Dyer66. Following 
methylation of the fatty acids in the total lipid extract, fatty acid methyl esters are extracted into 
isooctane and 1µL was injected into the GC column f or analysis using a Hewlett Packard 5890 series 
II gas chromatograph with a programmable cool on -column capi[INVESTIGATOR_801450], flame ionization detector 
(FID), and HP7673 auto sampler/injector.  Chromatographic data collection and analysis is via a 
serial connec tion to a computer running ChromPerfect Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040] ™ chromatography data system 
(Justice Laboratory Software, Denville, NJ).  The column used is a CP -Sil 88 for FAME, 100m (L) x 
0.25mm (ID) x 0.25µm (film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with a 1m (L) x 
0.53mm (ID) deactivated precol umn.  Calibration curves are based on injections of methyl 
tridecanoate, methyl PA, and methyl HA injections.  Inter -assay variability (%CV) for the 
measurement of PA in samples with low, medium and high concentrations (1.30, 2.99, and 6.70 
mg/dL) was 2.9% , 2.6%, and 3.1%, respectively.  Inter -assay variability for the measurement of HA 
(0.56, 1.29, 3.05 mg/dL) in the same samples is 2.6%, 4.0%, and 3.9%, respectively.  
     The primary outcomes for the MBT include PA and HA pharmacokinetic analyses includin g 
comparison of absorption curves, C max and AUC, and percent absorption of plasma PA and HA 
concentrations and also the HA/PA ratio 1) between CP and the healthy reference group, and 2) 
with pancreatic enzyme medication  exposure compared with pancreatic en zyme medication -naive 
status in the CP cohort.  
Utilizing the relative absorption of HA to PA, t he MBT has been shown to  respond to changes in fat 
absorption in healthy adult subjects using a lipase inhibitor and in subjects with CF and PI [INVESTIGATOR_801451]49, and is also sensitive to enzyme dose titration50. 
Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA):   The CFA primary outcome , the coefficient of fat absorption 
(CFA%) will be determined by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1106363] collection while consuming a moderate  fat (about 80+ g/day) diet. These stool 
collections will be performed at home a nd returned to CHOP. Subjects will be given a home 
collection kit and detailed instructions.  Specimens will be stored frozen until  analysis of total fat 
content by a gravimetric method (Mayo Medical Laboratories, [COMPANY_002]ster, MN). Total dietary intake 
of fa t during the 3 -day period will be assessed from the 3 -day weighed food records which will 
coincide with the 72 -hour stool collection, and the CFA% will be calculated67.  The CFA% will be 
compared 1) between the CP cohort and the healthy reference group, and 2) with pancreatic 
enzyme medication  exposure compared with pancreatic enzyme medication -naive status in the CP 
cohort.  
 
Bomb calorimetry (BC):  The BC primary outco me for BC is the assessment of energy loss in the 
stool from the 72 -hr stool collection (NIDDK sponsored research unit, Phoenix Indian Medical 
Center, Phoenix, AZ) using bomb calorimetry68-70. Samples will be shipped frozen and the heat of 
combustion (energy) will be measured in a bomb calorimeter, with energy liberated quantified in 
kcal/g stool. The energy loss from the stool will be compared 1) between the CP co hort and the 
   
  _

healthy comparison  group, and 2) with pancreatic enzyme medication  exposure compared with 
pancreatic enzyme medication -naive status in the CP cohort.  
5.3 Safety Evaluation  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_271938]. The frequencies of A Es by [CONTACT_24975], body system, 
severity and relationship to study supplement will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in 
detail.  
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary aim is to utilize the MBT, CFA and BC methods to characterize the fat and energy 
absorption patterns to compare fat and energy absorption from the diet in subjects with CP and 
healthy subjects.  We will also determine if fat and energy absorpti on will improve after pancreatic 
enzyme medication  administration in subjects with CP utilizing the MBT, CFA and BC methods to 
characterize the fat and energy absorption patterns.   
6.2 Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary aim is to utilize the data from the MBT, CFA and BC outcomes to optimize the MBT 
design an d application by [CONTACT_801462].   We will also explore the 
utility of the MBT compared to the CFA and BC (both require the burdensome 72 -hour total stool 
and dietary intake col lection) in identifying differences in fat absorption between subjects with CP 
and healthy individuals  and within the CP cohort, with and without pancreatic enzyme medication . 
We will also explore the association of specific genotypes with fat malabsorptio n in the context of 
CP. 
6.[ADDRESS_1106364] deviations, 
box plots, and scatter plots will be used to assess the normality of the data in terms of the presence 
of skew and/or outliers.  
6.3.1 Efficacy Analysis  
Statistical Analysis:  H1 and H2: Descriptive statistics for MBT, CFA% and BC outcomes (mean, 
standard deviation, median, range, 95% CI) will be calculated for the CP cohort and for the healthy 
comparison  group, and differences between CP and healthy groups assessed with unpaire d t tests.  
For the MBT outcomes, a moment -based pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be performed based on 
non-compartmental methodology using WinNonLin version 9.1 (Pharsight, Cary, NC). Baseline (C 0) 
and maximum (C max) plasma concentrations are calculated , and area under the curve from time 
zero to eight hours (AUC) is calculated using the linear trapezoid method. PK parameters can then 
be compared between treatment groups using a paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as 
appropriate. To describe HA ex posure relative to that of PA, the ratio of the HA to PA C max (Cmax 
HA/PA) and AUC (AUC HA/PA) is calculated for each subject after molar transformation and dose -
normalization of exposure metrics49.  Alternately, p opulation PK analyses for repeated -measures 
endpoints can be conducted via nonlinear mixed -effects modeling with a qualified installation of 
the nonlinear mixed -effects modeling (NONMEM) software, Version VII, Level 2.0 (ICON 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  25 
Development Solutions, Hanover, MD)48. Using this method, population PK modeling is conducted 
by [CONTACT_801481]50.   
        Descriptive statistics for MBT, CFA% and BC outcomes (mean, standard deviation, median, 
range, 95% CI) will also be calculated for the CP cohort with and without pancrea tic enzyme 
medication  administration, and the significance of changes over time assessed with paired t tests. 
HA and PA concentrations will be transformed to molar quantities and the ratios for HA to PA C max 
and AUC and the associated 95% confidence interval will be calculated. A mixed effects modeling 
approach will be employed to examine the correlation of subject characteristics (age, BMI, sex, 
disease status, etc.) to PA and HA exposure metrics derived fro m the non -compartmental analysis 
to assess change over time in MBT response to pancreatic enzyme medication  administration in 
subjects with CP. Metrics to be tested will be CFA%, PA and HA C max, AUC, HA/PA C max and AUC ratio 
and the %HA response compared t o the healthy reference group. A value of p<0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant.  
          H3: Pharmacokinetic modelling will be employed to identify the three  to four  blood samples 
over the first four  to five hours of the MBT that provide th e best and most reproducible estimate of 
the full eight -hour MBT ( nine  blood samples) in the CP cohort  and healthy comparisons . The goal is 
a shorter sampling scheme for the MBT to optimize its use as a clinical diagnostic test.    
          In exploratory  analyses, we will compare the estimates of percent fat absorption from the 
MBT with both the CFA% from the 72 -hour fecal fat and diet analysis and the BC results (energy loss 
in the stool). We will compare the methods for detection of fat malabsorption as  measured by 
[CONTACT_654378]% and BC with fat absorption as measured by [CONTACT_801482]. A correlation analysis will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the MBT relative to that 
of the CFA%. HA and PA C max, AUC, and HA/PA ratios will be plotted against CFA% or BC caloric loss to 
explore the relationship between the two tests. Any relationships observed in the plots will be 
further explor ed using correlation analysis and appropriate regression analysis as dictated by [CONTACT_801483]. If a reasonable model can be developed to describe the response of MBT, CFA% and BC 
response to pancreatic enzyme medication  treatment within the CP  cohort, additional simulation 
studies will be performed to further examine the performance characteristics of both tests.  
6.3.1 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_271938]. The frequencies of AEs by [CONTACT_24975], body system, 
severity and relationship t o study supplement will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in 
detail.  
6.4    Sample Size and Power  
Sample Size Considerations : The primary hypotheses of this study: 1) the MBT, CFA and BC methods 
will detect differences in fat absorption between healthy subjects and subjects with CP when they 
are pancreatic enzyme medication -naive; and 2) the MBT, CFA and BC methods will detect  changes 
in fat absorption with pancreatic enzyme medication  administration in the CP cohort. For the MBT 
method, t he sample size selected for the CP cohort (n=24) and the healthy comparisons  (n=24) is 
based upon our previous experience in CF with detectin g differences in C max and AUC for HA and 
the HA/PA ratio49, and in detecting the percent change in HA absorption (from pharmacokinetic 
modeling) compared to healthy subjects50.  For the CP vs . healthy comparison, [ADDRESS_1106365] 80% power to detect a difference in means of 0.60 (the difference in C max (in AUC) 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  26 
HA/PA ratio between health group mean of 1.62 (1.30) and CP group mean of 1.02 (0.70)), which is 
37% decrease in C max and 46% decrease in AUC from health group to CP group, assuming that the 
common SD is 0.[ADDRESS_1106366] with α =0.05.  
   For the CFA% outcome, our experience has been in CF and PI, with average CFA% of 81±14% in 
one study67 and 83±10% in an other71 when subjects were on pancreatic enzyme medication . In 
comparison, in healthy subjects, CFA% is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ≥93%.  From the literature for CP, a number of 
clinical trials have used CFA% to describe fat malabsorption in subjects with CP and confirmed 
pancreatic insufficiency before and after administration of pancreatic enzyme medication .  Ramesh 
et al15 found an increase in CFA% from 66.7±14.0 before pancreatic enzyme medication  to 
88.9±5.2% after pancreatic enzyme medication  (change of 22.7±12.2%) in adults with CP from 
India.  Also in adults from India participating in a placebo -controlled trial, Thorat et al16 saw CFA% 
increase from 66.5±14.1 to 86.1±7.5% in those taking pancreatic enzyme medication  compared to 
an increase from 67.0±14.0 to 72.9±11.5% for placebo, a treatment  effect of 13.7% (95% CI: 9.1, 
18.2) after one week of pancreatic enzyme medication . From this combined experience with 
variability of the CFA% in both CF and CP, [ADDRESS_1106367] 80% power to detect a 
difference in means of 10% (the difference in CFA% between health group mean of 95% and CP 
group mean of 85%) assuming that the common SD is 11% using a t -test with α =0.05.   
For the BC method, there is limited information for typi[INVESTIGATOR_801452]. Using 72 -hour stool assessments, 
Wierdsma et al70 has recently reported  average daily energy loss of 213±66 kcal in 23 healthy 
adults.  This loss was less in those >50 years old (197±49 kcal).  If we assume that approximately 
200 kcal/day are lost in the stool of healthy subjects, [ADDRESS_1106368] 80% power  
to detect a difference in means of 50 kcal (the difference in BC between health group mean of [ADDRESS_1106369] in stool) assuming that the common SD is [ADDRESS_1106370] with 
α =0.05.   
     For the paired comparisons within the CP co hort before and after pancreatic enzyme medication  
use, [ADDRESS_1106371] 80% power to detect a difference in means of 0.44 (Cmax HA/PA ratio 
changes from 1.02 to 1.46 or AUC HA/PA ratio of 1.7 to 1.14), assuming a SD of differences of 0.68, 
using a pa ired t -test with α =0.[ADDRESS_1106372] demonstrated that 
differences of this magnitude in MBT outcomes (exposure metrics) indicating the degree of fat 
absorption between groups and with varying treatment regimens, are significant w hen samples of 
[ADDRESS_1106373] been compared. We acknowledge that PA and HA absorption is moderately 
variable within subjects with CF and PI49, 50. Between -observation variability was estimated to be 
45.3% and 31.9% for PA and HA, respectively50.  Fo r CFA%, from the literature on CP, the change in 
CFA% for subjects with CP and confirmed PI [INVESTIGATOR_801453] 8 to 23% with the SD of that change ranging from 12 to 18%, but 
averaging at 14%. For C FA%, [ADDRESS_1106374] 80% power to detect a difference in means of 9% 
(increase in CFA% from 85 to 94% after pancreatic enzyme medication  administration), assuming a 
SD of differences of 14% , using a paired t -test with α =0.[ADDRESS_1106375] 80% power to detect a difference in means of 36 (decrease from 250 to 214 
kcal/day in the stool), assuming a SD of differences of 56, using a paired t -test with α =0.[ADDRESS_1106376] no more than 10% attrition in this study given a relatively short time period between 
first and second protocol visits. By [CONTACT_79323] 24 subjects in each group (CP and healthy), we can 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  27 
account for attrition and also allow for the possibility of greater variability in the MBT, CFA% and BC 
outcomes within the CP cohort for which we have had no previous experience.

9.4.[ADDRESS_1106383] common side effects associated with taking the pancreatic enzyme Creon36TM in clinical 
trials were abdominal pain , hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, frequent abnormal bowel movements, 
flatulence, vomiting, dizziness, sore throat and cough.  Irritation of the inside of the mouth may 
occur if Creon36TM is not swallowed completely. Increase in blood uric acid levels (hyperuricemia), 
and severe allergic reactions (pork allergy) including trouble with breathing, skin rashes or swollen 
lips, although rare, may occur. Although it has never been reported, it is possible for a person to 
get a viral infection from taking pancreatic enzyme products that come from pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  Fibrosing

Creon36TM prescribed for this study is a maximum of 324,000 LU/day.  For an adult weighing 60 kg, 
this dose is 5,400 LU/kg/day or about half this amount. For an adult weight 40 kg, this daily dose is 
8,100 LU/kg/day, still well below.  An adult would have to weigh <33 kg (73 lbs.) to match or 
exceed the 10,000/kg/day dose that is considered excessive.  
There are risks associated with discontinuing pancreatic enzyme medication  for people with 
pancreatic insufficiency or reduced pancreatic function resulting in fat malabsorption .  These 
include feelings of indigestion, stomach c rampi[INVESTIGATOR_801456], gas, foul smelling, floating stools, 
   
  _ 
IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  32 
light -colored, orange or yellow stools, frequent or loose stools, or weight loss. Some participants 
in the study may be at increased risk for these symptoms . 
 The p articipants  receiving pancreatic en zyme medication  prior to enroll ing in the study  
who will discontinue use prior to the first study visit  (Visit 1)  may be at risk for signs and 
symptoms of fat malabsorption (described above) for nine days of the study. These nine 
days include the three  days prior to study Visit 1 (washout period), the day of Visit [ADDRESS_1106384] 
and dose.  
 
 The participants who are naïve to pancreatic enzyme medication prior to entering the 
study, will take Creon36TM for the ni ne days encompassing Visit [ADDRESS_1106385] 
increased risk for the signs and symptoms of fat malabsorption upon discontinuation of 
Creon36TM at the end of the study. If their pancreatic function and fat absorption is 
normal, withdrawal f rom Creon36 ™ at the end of the study will not increase their risk for 
these symptoms.  
 The procedures in this study involve the potential risks related to the drawing of blood.  The risks 
of drawing blood are rare, and minimal.  There is a small risk of pain, infection and local irritation 
associated with insertion of an intravenous heplock catheter. However, this is considered a 
minimal risk and skilled research staff will insert the intravenous catheter. Each subject with CP 
will have approximately 100cc  (approximately 6-7 Tbsp. ) of blood drawn at each study visit.   Each 
healthy subject will have approximately 88cc (approximately 5 -6 Tbsp. ) of blood drawn at their 
visit.    
There is minimal risk associated with the low radiation e xposure from the DXA scan. Radiation 
exposure is estimated to be no more than  3.0 μSv (depending on age and size)  per visit, well below 
everyday background exposure (approximately 8.2 μSv). DXA instruments are regularly monitored 
for safety, and only exper ienced pediatric research personnel will conduct these tests.        
There is minimal risk associated with collection of saliva for genetic testing. Potential risks related 
to genetic analyses can be to individuals or groups. These harms include stigmatiza tion and 
insurability. To reduce this risk, no samples will be stored or used for future research. Information 
about this study will not be recorded in subjects’ medical record.  The genetic tests are being 
performed in a CLIA -certified lab, therefore results will be returned to subjects upon request. These 
results will not be included in the medical record.  Any results that are clinically significant will be 
returned to the subj ect and included in their medical record. The likelihood of this happening is 
low.

IRB 16 -013001_  05052017  33 
Anthropometric measurements  and pregnancy testing pose minimal risk to the subjects. There is 
minimal risk associated with sharing dietary intake, demographic information,  health history and 
medical information.   
Collection and storage of stool is associated with a small risk of fecal contamination. However, for 
safety and convenience, subjects will be provided with proper stool collection instructions and 
supplies (gloves , disposable collection containers, storage freezer container).  
Private health information will be collected, accessed and stored according to HIPAA guidelines, 
including the use of multilevel password protection and enforcement of system user privileges o n 
the database. To minimize the risk of disclosure, all direct identifiers will be removed as soon as 
possible and codes will be substituted for personal identifiers. Records of individuals are stored 
with ID numbers and a code with no discernible personal  identifiers. Code lists and data files will 
be stored in separate, secure locations. Data will be accessed and stored on password -protected 
computers. To maintain confidentiality, codes will be used in the database, presentations and 
publications.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1106386] of mouth an d at the recommendation of 
the subjects ’ CP Care Team. Healthy subjects will be recruited using  general adult practices, flyers, 
use of the CHOP Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC), and recommendations from subjects with 
CP of healthy family and friends int erested in participating.  
9.[ADDRESS_1106387] via telephone and  continue the introduction of the study to subjects. Verbal 
consent and HIPAA authorization for phone screening will be obtained prior to the collection of  
health information to determine eligibility. If screening occurs in person in the clinical care sett ing, 
participants will sign the screening consent prior to the collection of any health information to 
determine eligibility. A HIPAA Authorization form from the subjects ’ institution s for obtaining non -
CHOP medical records, will be signed in person or obt ained by [CONTACT_2319]/fax/email. All members of the 
team will be available (in person, by [CONTACT_61529]) to discuss the details and answer any study 
related questions as they arise. Once interest and eligibility are determined, procedures to set up 
enrollment wil l begin .  At entry into the study, all subjects will be asked to review the study consent 
form.  The Project Coordinator  or other member of the clinical research team will meet with the 
subject  to confirm the subject understands the study, and to answer an y questions that the subject 
might have.  A physician -level study team member will be available in person, by [CONTACT_31303] 
   
  _ 
IRB [ADDRESS_1106388] Coordinator  or member of the 
clinical research team will obtain fully informed, written consent from the adult subjects .  The 
consent will be signed in the presence of a team member. Subjects will be given a printed cop y of 
the signed, informed consent.     
9.6.1 Waiver of Documentation of Consent / Alteration of HIPAA Authorization  
A waiver of documentation of consent will be sought for the verbal screening component of the 
study  when potential participants are approached by [CONTACT_648] . The rights and welfare of the subject 
will not be adversely affected because during the verbal consent process it is explained to the 
subject that we are recording their health information to determine eligibility for the study. The 
research could not pr acticably be carried out without this waiver as it is not practicable to approach 
and screen all potential participants in person. An alteration of HIPAA authorization will be sought 
for the screening component of the study. The use and disclosure of prote cted health information 
for the purposes of screening for eligibility involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of 
participants , as the identifiers will be protected from improper use and disclosure, identifiers will 
be destroyed at the earliest op portunity consistent with the conduct of the study, and protected 
health information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required 
by [CONTACT_801488].  The research could not practica bly be 
conducted without access to and use of the protected health information collected during 
screening to determine eligibility.   
 Study staff stress during the verbal consent that the screening is voluntary, but necessary if they 
wish to participate, and that they can decline and stop the process at any point.  Screening may also 
take place in person in which case the participant will sign the screening consent  prior to the 
collection of health information to determine eligibility , and a waiver of docum entation of consent 
will not apply . A written informed consent will be obtained prior to study entry and before any 
study procedures are performed , and this will include the discontinuation of pancreatic enzyme 
medication for those participants who are taking this medication at the time of enrollment in the 
study.  
9.[ADDRESS_1106389]   
All participants are adults (30 -75 yr.) and will be compensated  $200 for each visit  for time and 
effort associated with each study visit: Visit 1 Visit  2.  Subjects with CP  will receive a total of $400 
($200 for each visit), while healthy subjects will receive $200 (one visit only) .  Subjects living outside 
of the Philadelphia area will receive reimbursement for travel expenses (mileage, tolls, e.g.).  
10 PUBLICATION  
The research data obtained through the study outlined in this protocol  will be shared with the 
research community, both through oral presentation at scientific meetings, and in written form, as 
published manuscripts.  Reported factual material (primary data on which summary statistics and 
tables are based), commonly accepted  in the scientific community as necessary to document and 
support research findings, will be provided in a timely fashion upon request by [CONTACT_801489] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a period of three  years following acceptance 
for publication. The CHOP investigator will have access to the complete study data.

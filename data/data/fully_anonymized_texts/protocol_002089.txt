Page [ADDRESS_1139313] prevalent blood cancer (10%) after non- hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. It represents approximately 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. 
Although the peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is [ADDRESS_1139314] plasma cell disorders includes regimens such as low -dose 
melphalan (32 mg/m
2/month) with prednisone.  For patients with multiple myeloma, this 
regimen results in a 40% overall response rate, but few patients achieve a  complete 
remission and the median duration of response is only 2 years.  The median survival is in 
the range of 3 years and few (<15%) survive 5 years.  More aggressive chemotherapy regimens, including VAD, VBMCP and M2, induce remissions more quickly but  overall 
survival rates are not substantially improved (Alexanian and Dimopoulos, 1994). 
These poor outcomes led many investigators explored high- dose chemotherapy regimens.  
In 1983, McElwain used melphalan 140 mg/m
2 without stem cell support as a salvage  
therapy in nine patients with refractory myeloma and noted all patients responded to 
treatment with five patients achieving complete biochemical and bone marrow responses (McElwain and Powles, 1983).  This observation of dose -response led to a series of p hase 
I/II trials with and without stem cell support in both newly diagnosed and refractory disease (Attal et al., 1992; Harousseau et al, 1995).  
A matched -pair analysis by [CONTACT_822015] -intense with 
standard -dose therapy demons trated the benefit of autologous HSC transplantation for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma (Barlogie et al., 1997).  Event -free (49 vs 27 months) and 
overall survivals (62+ vs 48 months) were improved for patients treated with dose -intense 
therapy as part of the initial treatment.  
1.3 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma  
High -dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
 is an integral 
component of the myeloma treatment for patients considered eligible for the procedure. The majority
 of the randomized clinical trials demonstrated a superior progression- free and 
overall survival among patients undergoing ASCT compared with those treated with only 
conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Currently, the “novel” agents of thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib appear
 best suited to be used as first -line therapy, enhancing the quality of 
responses prior to proceeding to ASCT and diminishing early mortality from the disease. 
Tandem transplantation has been shown to improve the event -free survival and overall 
survival of patients with myeloma (4,5). A study of 399 previously untreated patients with 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 8 of 41  myeloma  randomized these patients to receive either single or double transplantation. The 
probability of surviving event -free for seven years after the diagnosis was 10 percent in the 
single -transplant group and 20 percent in the double -transplant group (P=0.03). The 
estimated overall seven -year surv ival rate was [ADDRESS_1139315] been performed for multiple myelomas since the 1980’s (6). The initial rationale in performing these transplants was to administer high- dose 
chemotherapy to eradicate myeloma cells and provide the patient with a disease- free 
marrow. It soon became apparent that a graft -versus -myeloma effect exists(7). Although 
the relapse/progression rates appeared lower, the initial enthusiasm for performing allogeneic transplantation in MM was tempered by [CONTACT_822016] -related toxicity, 
approaching 40% in trials involving total body irradiation or busulfan based myeloablative regimens.  In an EBMT retrospective case -matched analysis of 378 patients, the overall 
survival was inferior compared to autologous transplantation as a result of this high risk transplant -related mortality(8). Ablative regimens were used in these original transplants 
and the main causes of death were severe infections often combined with severe GVHD.  The EBMT database and the US Intergroup trial s howed a plateau at approximately 25% 
indicating a probable cure for an otherwise incurable disease.  
1.5 Transplant regimen intensity  
Based on the idea that the graft -versus -myeloma (GVM) effect is more important than the 
intensity of the conditioning regimens, the Seattle group developed an allogeneic transplant modality using considerably lower intensity in the conditioning regimen(9). Transplant -
related mortality was reduced significantly but relapses after transplantation remains a major concern with this approach. In a recent retrospective study by [CONTACT_617219], reduced intensity conditioning was compared to myeloablative conditioning(10). A dose of melphalan less than 140 mg/m2, a busulfan dose of 8 mg/kg or less and a cyclophosphamide dose less than 120 mg/kg was considered to be reduced intensity. If total body irradiation was used, a dose of radiation less than 6 Gy or up to 6 Gy fractionated was accepted as reduced intensity. With this definition, reduced intensity conditioning was associated with lower non- relapse mortality but a higher relapse rate 
compared to myeloablative conditioning. The progression- free survival was superior with 
myeloablative conditioning but there was no significant difference in overall survival. It is therefore concluded that the i ntensity/activity of the conditioning regimen does have an 
impact on relapse -free survival. New supportive treatment modalities in recent years and 
better GVHD prophylaxis, has lead to a reduction in mortality for patients receiving 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 9 of 41  ablative regimens. The EBMT data has shown a significant reduction in mortality for 
patients transplanted after 1994(11).  
Most recently, a strategy using high dose melphalan with autologous ASCT for maximal cytoreduction followed by [CONTACT_822017]- myeloablative regimen to allow for erad ication of 
residual disease by [CONTACT_822018]. Response rates usually exceed 50% with transplant -related mortality in the 10 -15% range. When this approach was 
compared directly to tandem ASCT, the auto- allo patients had superior PFS and OS 
compared to tandem ASCT. A similar prospective randomized US trial which enrolled [ADDRESS_1139316] for maximal cytoreduction and a tandem reduced intensity a llogeneic transplant for eradication of minimal residual disease, patients 
continue to relapse, even in the setting of GVHD. Thus, we believe the major limitation to improving outcomes is disease relapse after the allogeneic transplant.  
1.6 Fludarabine - melpha lan conditioning regimen for multiple myeloma  
The combination of fludarabine and melphalan has been studied as a preparative regimen for allogeneic transplantation for patients with multiple myeloma  (12). Twenty- two patients 
with multiple myeloma between 1 996 and 2000 received the combination of fludarabine 
and melphalan. Eighteen patients received fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for 5 days with melphalan 140 mg/m2 as a single dose and 4 patients received fludarabine 25 mg/m2 for 5 days with melphalan 90 mg/m2 daily f or 2 days. The actuarial overall survival and progression- free 
survival at 2 years was 30% and 19% respectively. Non- relapse mortality was 19% at day 
100. Similarly, Kroger et al. reported on the fludarabine -melphalan combination (13). The 
treatment -related mortality at day 100 was 11%. Fifty- five percent of the patients obtained 
a complete remission and 27% a partial remission, giving an overall response rate of 82%. 
The updated overall survival and disease -free survival was 68% and 42%, respectively. 
Krog er et al have recently published their collective results of salvage therapy after 
allogeneic transplant. Patients were treated with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) with one or more novel agents (bortezomib; thalidomide). High response rates were observed with prolonged progression- free survival indicating that post -transplant novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822009]- myeloma effects which may enhance the efficacy of DLI (to 
induce GVM). Furthermore, this study showed the feasibility and toxicitie s of post -
allogeneic novel therapy administration. 
1.7 Bortezomib  
Bortezomib is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by [CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US FDA) and it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. By [CONTACT_61670] a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affect s multiple signaling pathways.  The anti -neoplastic effect 
of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that control cell ular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the mechanisms 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page [ADDRESS_1139317] is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ. B ortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl -2, a genetic trait 
that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear 
factor  κB (NF -κB) activation, its attenuation of interleukin -6 (IL -6)-mediated cell growth, 
a direct apoptotic effect, and possibly anti -angiogenic and other effects. Bortezomib has 
shown synergy when combined with various chemotherapeutics in pre -clinical and 
clinical models  (14,15).  
We are conducting a phase I/II clinical study of bortezomib with dose -intense melphalan 
with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with disease 
progression or less than partial response after a prior PBS CT (tandem 
transplant).  Primary exclusion criteria are active infection at time of PBSCT, cardiac 
amyloid deposition, and creatinine clearance of <20 ml/min. Peripheral neuropathy of less 
than grade 4 is not an exclusion.  Bortezomib is given on days - 4 and -1 with melphalan 
200 mg/m
2 (actual weight) given on day - [ADDRESS_1139318].  For the phase I study, 
bortezomib was given at rising doses of 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 mg/m2.  Three patients were to 
be enrolled at each dose level, with an additional 3 patients enrolled in case of a serious toxicity event at any level. An additional 20 patients are being enrolled in the phase II 
portion of the study with 15 patients enrolled as of 12/1/09 (patient accrual will be 
completed before enrollment into this study).  
Twelve patients (median age, 58 yrs) were treated in the phase I study with 6 patients treated at the 1.0 mg/m
2 level after 1 patient experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of 
prolonged diarrhea, and 3 patients treated at each of the subsequent levels. Eleven patients had 1 prior and 1 patient tandem prior cycles of dose -intense melphalan. All patients 
experienced the expected pancytopenia requiring red cell and/or platelet support.  Ten patients had febrile neutropenia with bacteremia identified in [ADDRESS_1139319] with melphalan alone. All patients engrafted at a median time to ANC>500/uL of 11 days (range, 9 -19) and platelet>20,000/uL of 14 days (range, 11- 27). 
No other SAEs occurred in the phase I study beyond the usual events of high- dose 
therapy. No neurological SAEs, including severe peripheral neuropathies, were observed. A bortezomib dose of 1.6 mg/m
2 was chosen for the phase II study.  
Fifteen patients (median age, 56 yrs) are now treated in the phase II study. Six patients had disease progression and 9 patients had less than a partial response (PR) after a prior 
PBSCT. All patients experienced pancytopenia and evaluable patients engrafted with 
median time to ANC>500/uL of 10 days (range, 8 -13) and platelet>20,000 of 11 days 
(range, 9 -65).  Eleven patients had febrile neutropenia with 3 patients with positive blood 
cultures and 1 patient with RSV bronchitis.  Three SAEs are reported in the phase II 
portion: 1 patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_822010] 1 of MRSA 
sepsis (before ANC recovery).  A third  patient developed tumor lysis requiring dialysis. 
One patient had a dysphoric reaction to anti -emetics and did not receive the 2nd 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page [ADDRESS_1139320] definitions. Three patients underwent subsequent allogeneic PBSC and 2 patient ss died of transplant -related complications and are not evaluable for response. Two 
patients succumbed to progressive disease. The remaining 20 patients are in ongoing follow -up. Eight patients including 6 of 11 patents with stable disease or minimal 
respo nse after prior dose -intense melphalan achieved a CR. Six patients remain in 
continuous CR at 11+ to 23+ months (median, 15+ months) after PBSCT with [ADDRESS_1139321] of adding bortezomib to dose-intense melphalan. .  
1.8 Bortezomib in allogeneic transplantation  
Bortezomib exerts numerous biologic effects that include blocking the activation of the 
transcription factor, nuclear factor -κB. NF -κB is implicated in the regulation of many 
genes that code for mediators of the immune and inflammatory responses. Bortezomib has 
been used as an immunomodulatory agent in the context of allogeneic transplantation. The Dana- Farber gro up used a GVHD prophylaxis regiment of bortezomib, methotrexate and 
tacrolimus in a study of patients undergoing related,unrelated donor transplantation for malignancies.(16). The incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD was 13% and the incidence 
of chronic GVH D was 41%.  These results appear to compare favorably to standard 
prophylactic regimens. In addition, numerous reports of bortezomib for the treatment of graft versus host disease have been published.

3.9 Study Medications  
3.9.1  Bortezomib (VELCADE)  for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for 
reconstitution and is supplied in vials containing VELCADE and mannitol at a 
1:10 ratio.  For exam ple, vials containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE contain 35 mg 
of mannitol. Vials containing lyophilized VELCADE for Injection should be stored according to the label requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC (77ºF ); excursions permitted from 
15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF).  For Europe, do not store above 30ºC (86ºF).  To date, 
stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_1139328] be kept of all disposed materials. The drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE.  Each vial of VELCADE for Injection should be reconstitu ted under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) within eight hours 
before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted solution contains VELCADE at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.   Prior to reconstitut ion the vials should remain in the cartons to 
protect them from light.   Dissolution is completed in approximately [ADDRESS_1139329] pharmacy 
purchasing criteria. Melphalan will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_5131], in accordance with usual pharmacy practices, immediately before patient i nfusion. 
Melphalan is a bifunctional alkylating agent that acts principally through covalent reactions with DNA, resulting in the formation of drug- DNA adducts 
with cross -linking of DNA strands.  Melphalan’s cytotoxic effects are related to 
its concentrati on and the duration of exposure to melphalan of the cell.  
Enhanced repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks may be a mechanism of resistance that develops after prior exposure to this drug. Melphalan is actively 
transported into cells by [CONTACT_62891]- affinity L -amino acid transport system; 
glutamine and leucine compete for carrier uptake and high levels of these amino 
acids can reduce drug uptake.  Other drugs such as tamoxifen, chlorpromazine, and indomethacin can also impair melphalan uptake and accumulation.  S tudies 
of the pharmacokinetics of oral melphalan were complicated by [CONTACT_822022].  Moreover, studies of intravenous melphalan have also showed considerable  inter -patient variability in plasma clearance.

undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation. The medians time to neutrophil and platelet recoveries were 16 and 14.6 days, and the majority of patients (80%) developed WHO grade 3/4 stomatitis.  Plasma concentration profiles were biphasic and fitted with a two -compartment model.  The maximal 
concentration at the end of infusion averaged 7.94±3.73 mg/l (range, 1.65- 14.5).  
The mean elimination half -life and the mean residence time were 83.1±27.1 
minutes (range, 51.6- 166.81) and 98.7±26.9 minutes (range 59.5- 166.9), 
respectively.  The volume of distribution averaged 1.00±0.62 l/kg (range 0.46-3.12) and total plasma clearance 5 48.3±300.0 ml/min/m
2 (range, 218.6- 1378.8).   
Plasma levels were below the limits of detection for all patients by 24 hours after melphalan administration.  These authors noted large inter -individual 
variability of these pharmacokinetic parameters.  Total clearance of melphalan 
was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance (r=0.49, p<0.05).   A 
relationship between melphalan clearance and renal function was also described 
by [CONTACT_822023]., but this relationship did not explain the large variation in inter-individual overall clearance of the drug (Kergueris et al., 1994).  Similar 
pharmacokinetic results were reported for 20 pediatric and 10 adult patients 
treated with melphalan 140 mg/m
2 as a single agent.  For the adult patients, the 
elimination  half-life (t½β) was 50±7 minutes for patients treated with 140 
mg/m2 dose and 41±12 minutes for the higher dose of 180 mg/m2.  Plasma 
clearance averaged 525 ml/min/m2 at 140 mg/m2 and 532 ml/min/m2 at 180 
mg/m2.  
3.9.3  Fludarabine: Fludarabine  is a fluorinated nucleotide analogue of the antiviral 
vidarabine. It acts as a purine antagonist antimetabolite. Synonyms: 2- F-ara-
AMP. Bone -marrow suppression from fludarabine  is dose -limiting, manifesting

fever, chills, cough, Dyspnea, pneumonia, gastrointestinal disturbances, 
stomatitis, edema, the tumor lysis syndrome, skin rashes, auto- immune 
hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic cystitis. Neurological disturbances include peri pheral neuropathy, agitation, confusion, 
visual disturbances, seizures, and coma; high doses have been associated with progressive encephalopathy, blindness, and death.Dosage should be reduced in renal impairment and fludarabine  should not be given if crea tinine clearance is 
less than 30 mL/minute. Intravenous fludarabine  phosphate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_822012], which is taken up by [CONTACT_822024]. Peak intracellular concentrations of fludarabine  triphosphate are seen about 4 hours after a dose. 
Fludarabine  has a bioavailability of about 50 to 65% after doses of the 
phosphate by [CONTACT_1966].Clearance of fludarabine  from the plasma is triphasic with 
a terminal half -life of about 20 hours. Elim ination is mostly via renal excretion: 
60% of a dose is excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of fludarabine exhibit considerable interindividual variation. 
3.9.4  Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)  
 
 
Antithymocyte globulins are antibodies, which act against lym phocytes, and in 
particular against T -cells, to produce suppres sion of cell -mediated immunity  
Common adverse reactions include fever, chills, and skin reactions including rash, 
pruritus, and urticaria, which may be manifestations of hypersensitivity. Dyspnea, hypotension, chest, back or flank pain may indicate anaphylaxis, which can occur in up to 1% of patients. Rashes and arthralgia may represent serum sickness, especially in patients with aplastic anemia. Use with other immunosuppressants may reduce the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity but increase the risk of acquired systemic infections, such as CMV or herpes simplex. Enhanced immunosuppression may also increase the incidence of post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease or other malignancies. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are also common. Although usually transient, dosage adjustment may be necessary if they become severe or prolonged, and if unremitting, they may warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374]. Other adverse effects include headache, abdominal pa in, 
gastrointestinal disturbances, hypertension, peripheral edema, asthenia, hyperkalaemia, and tachycardia. Nephrotoxicity has been reported.

Page 22 of 41  4 Adverse events  
4.1 Definitions  
4.1.1  Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with the treatment.  
An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug, whether or not it is 
considered to be drug related.  This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug. 
4.1.2  Serious Adverse Event Definition 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality 
that: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in death. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is life -threatening.  Life -threatening means that the patient was 
at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have 
caused death h ad it occurred in a more severe form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the 
illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the 
trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected 
manner during the trial (eg, surgery performed earlier than 
planned).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in persistent or significan t disability/incapacity.  
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal life functions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is an important medical event.  An important medical event is 
an event that may not re sult in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 23 of 41  that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
Clarification should be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” since they ARE NOT 
synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(as in mild, modera te, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and are usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A severe adverse event 
does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of several hours 
duration may be considered severe nausea  but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in 
only a minor degree of disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as an SAE based on 
the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
4.[ADDRESS_1139334] report all serious adverse events (SAE) regardless of 
relationship with any study drug or expectedness to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_8236].  
Intensity for each adverse event, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by [CONTACT_431260], version 3.0 (or later version) , as a guideline, wherever possible.  The criteria are available 
online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  
4.3 Assessment of Toxicity  
4.3.1  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used for 
the assessment and grading of all toxicities experienced by [CONTACT_822026] ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAE_Index.pdf
) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  If the nature of the adverse experience is listed in the CTCAE,  
the maximum grade and time of maximum grade will be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  If the adverse experience is not listed on the NCI CTG Expanded Toxicity Criteria Appendix D, report the toxicity grade using the following criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Grade 1 = Mild: an adverse experience which  is easily tolerated by 
[CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Grade 2 = Moderate: an adverse experience which is sufficiently 
discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Grade 3 = Severe: an adverse experience which is incapacitating and 
prevents normal everyday activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Grade 4 = Life Threatening: an adverse experience which places the 
patient at immediate risk of death.  
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 24 of 41  4.4 Assessment of Causality  
4.4.1  Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_822027], if any, to study drug treatment. Causality 
should be assessed using the following categories: Not Related, Unlikely, Suspected ( Reasonable Possibility) , Probable . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Not relate d: The adverse experience is definitely not related to 
the test drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unlikely:   There are other, more likely causes and the drug is 
not suspected as a cause.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected (reasonable possibility):  A direct cause and effect 
relationship between the drug and t he adverse experience has 
not been demonstrated but there  is a reasonable possibility that 
the experience was caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Probable:  There probably  is a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the adverse experience and the study 
drug. 
4.4.2  The degr ee of certainty with which an adverse experience is attributed to drug 
treatment (or alternative causes, e.g. natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, etc.) will be determined by [CONTACT_822028]:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Known pharmacology of the drug 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reaction of similar nature being previously observed with this 
drug or class of drug.  The experience having often been reported in literature for similar drugs as drug related e.g. skin rashes,  blood dyscrasia.  The experience being related by [CONTACT_822029] 
(dechallenge) or reproduced on rechallenge  
4.5 Follow -up of Adverse Experiences  
4.5.1  Patients with grade ¾ adverse experiences will be actively followed until  the 
event has subsided (disappeared) or until the condition has stabilized. 
4.5.2  Adverse events, both serious and non- serious, and deaths that occur during the 
patient’s study participation will be recorded in the source documents.  All 
SAEs should be monitore d until they are resolved or are clearly determined to 
be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 25 of 41  5 Statistical Evaluation  
This is a phase II study to determine if allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using the 
fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib regimen is superior to historical controls that received fludarabine and melphalan as the conditioning regimen.  
5.1 Endpoints  
5.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The main primary endpoint of this study is two- year 
progression free survival. Patients are considered a failure with 
respect to PFS if they die or experience disease progression or 
relapse.  The time to this even t is the time from transplantation  
to relapse/progression, initiation of non- protocol anti -myeloma 
therapy, or death from any cause.  Subjects alive without 
confirmed disease progression will be censored at the time of 
last disease evaluation.  Deaths without progression are  treated 
as failures no matter when they occur.   
5.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include:  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall survival (OS):  Defined as time from the first dose of 
adminis tration to death from any cause  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall response rates: Defined as the composite endpoint of 
response to treatment which includes Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), stable disease (SD) as defined in International Response Criteria. We will also analyze Complete Response rate  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Univariate analysis of the risk of progression/relapse and 
mortality: In addition, multivariate analysis of the risk of progression/relapse and overall mortality will be conducted to assess influence of variables measur ed after the start of 
treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regim en-related toxicity:  Graded and presented in a 
descriptive nature.  
5.2 Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics and demographics in this study will 
be performed in the following manner. Continuous measurements will be 
summarized as mean (SD) or median  (inter -quartile range) based on whether or not 
the data come from a normal distribution as validated by [CONTACT_167672][INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilks test of 
normality. Categorical measurements will be summarized as frequency (percentage). Proportion of overall survival will be estimate d by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier

related mortality (TRM) will be calculated using cumulative incidence function.  
5.[ADDRESS_1139336] two years 28 multiple myeloma patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) used the fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib (FluMelVel) conditioning regimen. After eligibility is established, subjects will be enrolled into the single arm us ing FluMelVel as a conditioning regimen. It is assumed that patients 
will enroll into the study uniformly over the accrual period. All subjects will be “on -study” 
for three years post -transplant, during which they will be monitored for the effects of 
treatment through regular clinic.  With four years of planned accrual, and a minimum of 
three years of additional follow -up post -transplant, subjects will be followed for 
progression- free survival for at least [ADDRESS_1139337] -transplant ranging from 35% to 55%.  
The standard FluMel conditioning regimen is assumed to have PFS of 35%. It is posited that the FluMelVel conditioning regimen will increase the two year PFS to 5 5%. Thus, to 
detect the 20 % difference in PFS between the two groups using a desired power of 80%, for this one -side log rank test at 5% level of significance, four year accrual, 2 year follow -
up  and dropout rate of 10%, 55 patients on FluMelVel are required. This calculation achieved power of 80.06%. This calculation from PASS 2008 was obtained by [CONTACT_822030]. Since the subjects in this arm were historical controls on FluMel conditioning regimen, the method of Simon and Dixon (17) was also used to derive the sample size. Further, it was assumed that there are 50 patients on FluMel available for comparison with outcomes of the new conditioning regimen.  Assuming an accrual rate of 1 patient per month, 80% power target, 5% level of 
significance and ratio of FluMel hazard rate to FluMelVel hazard rate of 1.7557, 50 
patients on the FluMelVel regimen are required. Furthermore, adjusting the sample size of 
the singe arm for a dropout rate of 10 % yielded a size of 55, which is the same as the 
sample obtained in PASS 2008.  
5.5 Efficacy analysis  
In this Phase II study, we wish to ascertain if allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation using the fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib regimen is superior to 
historical controls that received fludarabine and melphalan as the conditioning regimen.  
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 27 of 41  5.6 Statistical Hypothesis  
The null hypothesis is that the two- year progression free survival rate in treatment 
arm A is 35%. The alternative hypothesis for this study posits that the treatment plan 
consisting allogeneic transplantation with fludarabine, melphalan- bortezomib 
(experi mental arm) will increase the two -year progression free survival to 55% which 
is 20 % more than PFS in the historical arm.  
Thus, we will evaluate the hypotheses  
 HO: SC(2) ≥S E(2)  
 HA: SC(2) < S E(2)  
where S C(2) = the two -year progression free surviving proportion of historical control 
(FluMel), which is assumed to be 0.35, S E(2) = the two -year progression free surviving 
proportion of the experimental arm (FluMelVel). The patients in the FluMelVel 
conditioning regimen will be matched with patients in the FluMel by [CONTACT_822031] 
(CMV) PCR status. To account for heterogeneity of outcome due to risk status of patients 
in the treatment arms, the comparative analysis will be stratified on risk status. Thus, a one -
sided log- rank test stratified on risk status will be conducted to determine if allogeneic 
transplantation with fludarabine and melphalan -bortezomib improves the progression free 
survival  over that observed in the historical controls using fludarabine and mephalan alone 
at the 5% level of significance.  
5.7 Primary endpoint  
To compare the two- year PFS between the historical con trol (FluMel) with the single arm 
(FluMelVel) consisting of [ADDRESS_1139338] transplant arm using FluMel is 35% at 2 years (CIBMTR data).  
The primary analysis will in clude all eligible allogeneic transplantation subjects that 
receive the FluMelVel conditioning regimen and historical control using FluMel conditioning regimen. The single arm trial subjects will be matched to historical controls by [CONTACT_822032].  The tr eatment arms will be compared using a one -sided log- rank test. 
All tests will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
 
5.8 Secondary endpoints  
5.8.1  Response to Treatment  
The rates of complete remission (CR) and very good partial remission (VGPR) according t o the International Uniform Response Criteria (Section 3.2) will be 
calculated at two years after transplantation.  The analyses of the two -year response 
rates are planned as soon as those data become available in all subjects, at one and two years after t he close of accrual.  The comparison of the response rate to the 
transplant with respect to the overall and CR component will be performed using Fisher’s exact test at the 5% level of significance.  
 
 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page [ADDRESS_1139339] will be conducted at the 5% level of 
significance, analogous to the analysis of PFS described above .   
5.8.3  Association of Prognostic Factors and Risk of Progression/Relapse and 
Mortality  
A comparative analysis of risk outcomes relapse/progression, TRM, and overall 
Mortality will be conducted while adjusting for imbalance in other risk factors 
using a Cox pr oportional hazards model (18). To fit the multivariate model, a 
stepwise backward selection procedure will be used while considering the type of conditioning regimen (FluMelVel versus FluMel), relapse risk status ( low risk, high risk),  age at transplant and  Karnosfky performance score (<90 versus ≥90 ) , donor -gender, CMV, HLA match grade, and stem cell source as covariates. Graft -
versus host disease (GVHD) will be entered as a time-  dependent covariate.  Both 
acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be consider ed as subtypes of GVHD.  An 
examination of the goodness -of-fit will be performed using Grambsch- Therneau 
and Martingale residual plots (19) and lowess smooth of Cleveland (20). Covariates yielding a p- value of 0.[ADDRESS_1139340], and whether or not the patient is in CR at transplant are collinear only one variable will be used in single model fitting attempt.  Thus, three different models will be considered when examining the association risk factors and PFS and OS. This analysis will be presented in terms of relative risks (RR) along with the corresponding p values for each covariate.  
5.[ADDRESS_1139341] 100 days after transplantation will be considered possibly related to the transplant for this analysis.  Regimen -related toxicity will be graded and presented in a descriptive nature as 
incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
5.9.1  Safety Monitoring Endpoints  
The incidence of toxicities of grade 3 or higher toxicities (CTCAE version 3.0), the incidence of probable viral fungal and bacte rial infections, and the incidence of 
treatment -related morality, i.e., from causes other than relapse or progression, will 
be recorded for each patient at set intervals over the course of the study.  Safety data will be described in a variety of ways, bot h graphical and tabular, and incidence

Page [ADDRESS_1139342] transplantation exceeds 20% then the study will be stopped. It is assumed that non- relapse mortality in the 
standard regimen is 10%.  Resumption of patient accrual will only be permitted after review of interim results by [CONTACT_822033].
 Operationally, using 10% as the acceptable r ate of NRM 
and 20% as the unacceptable, Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), the 
accrual will be halted for death occurring in:

8 Body Surface Area and Creatinine Clearance Calculations  
Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated using a standard nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
BSA =  
or 
BSA = 3600)( )( kgWt cmHt× 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft -Gault equation as follows:  
 CrCl (ml/min) =  (140- age) (actual wt in kg)               
      72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)  
For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value.  
Note: In markedly obese patients, the Cockroft -Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine clearance. ( Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creatinine requiring renal clearance.)

Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page 35 of 41  10 Declaration of Helsinki 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki:  
Ethica l Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_1139349] the health of the people.  The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Associ ation binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might h ave the effect of weakening the physical and 
mental condition of the patient."  
4. Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving human subjects.  
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations relat ed to the well -being of the 
human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.  
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and protect their health and rights.  Some research populations are vulnerable and need special protection.  The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be recognized.  Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving 
consent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research is combined with care.  
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory 
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page [ADDRESS_1139350], the confidentiality of the patient's information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed 
of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional 
affiliations o f the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and 
the discomfort it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If 
the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written consent must be f ormally 
documented and witnessed.  
14. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship.  
15. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be 
performed on legally competent persons.  
16. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
17. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental con dition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population.  The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the exper imental protocol for 
consideration and approval of the review committee.  The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
Protocol, Amendment 5, 08Nov2019  
Page [ADDRESS_1139351] be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research,  designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, 
new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

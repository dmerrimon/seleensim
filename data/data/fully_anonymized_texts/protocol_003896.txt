Title of Study: A Two-Period, Two-Treatment, Randomized Crossover Study of the 
Pharmacokinetics of Nalmefene by [CONTACT_391119]: Phase I (Healthy Volunteers)  
Protocol Number: OPNT003-PK-001  
Study Design: Open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2- treatment, 2-sequence, crossover 
study in [ADDRESS_490789] will receive 2 treatments during the 2 
dosing periods: Intranasal (IN) dose of 3 mg nalmefene hydrochloride and 
intramuscular (IM) dose of 1.[ADDRESS_490790] 
period. Subjects will be called 3 to 5 days after discharge to inquire 
concerning Adverse Events (AEs) and concomitant medications since 
discharge.  
All subjects who have given their written informed consent and who 
satisfy all of the relevant inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be screened for eligibilit y to participate in the study including 
medical history, demographics, concomitant medications, physical 
examination, height, weight, body  mass index (BMI), nasal passage 
examination, smell test, clinical chemistry, coagulation markers, 
hematology, serum Follicle Stimulat ing Hormone (FSH) levels (females 
postmenopausal only), infectious dise ase serology, urinalysis, urine drug, 
urine cotinine and urine alcohol toxicology screen, serum pregnancy test 
(females only), vital signs an d electrocardiogram (ECG).  
On the day of clinic admission (Day -1) the following procedures will be 
performed to review eligibility, update on medical history, update on 
concomitant medications, physic al examination, nasal passage 
examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, urine pregnancy test (females only), 
urine drug, urine cotinine and urine alcohol toxicology screen. 
After eligibility of established an d admission procedures complete,  
patients will be randomized.  
On the day after admission subjects, in  a fully supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], will be 
administered the IN or IM dose randomized to a sequence order of 
receipt. Subjects should be instructed to hold their breath during 
administration of the nasal spray into the nose. Blood will then be 
collected prior to dosing (within 15 minutes) and approximately 2.5, 5, 
7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 
hours after drug administration. Actual  blood collection times can vary as 
follows: ± 1 minutes for the 1 to 30 minute samples, ± 2 minutes for the 
45 to 90 minute samples, and ± 5 minutes for the 120 minute or greater 
samples. Actual sampling times will be recorded.

Study Objectives: The primary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 3mg 
nalmefene hydrochloride IN compared to a 1.[ADDRESS_490806], route of administration and dosage: Nalmefene hydrochloride 3mg nasal spray  
Nasal (IN) 
1 spray in 1 nostril delivers 0.1 mi llilitres (mL) of 30mg/mL nalmefene 
hydrochloride 
Reference product, route of administraction and 
dosage: Nalmefene hydrochloride 1.108 mg/m L solution given intramuscularly 
(IM) 1.[ADDRESS_490807] venipuncture or 
through an  Intravenous (IV) catheter in the forearm. Four mL of blood will 
be collected in a K2EDTA-containing vacutainer tube for each time point 
for determination of nalmefene. 
Blood samples will be taken at Screening and after last blood draw prior 
to Final Discharge (or early termin ation) after the second dosing for 
clinical chemistry, coagulation markers and hematology. 
Urine samples will also be taken at  screening and clinic admission for 
urinalysis, urine drug, urine cotinine and urine alcohol toxicology screen. 
Urine sample will also be taken at discharge for urine cotinine.  
Female subjects of child-bearing potential will be asked to provide a 
blood sample at screening, a urine sa mple prior to each dose and a blood 
sample prior to study discharge (or early termination) after the second 
dosing for a pregnancy test. 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: The following plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for nalmefene will be 
calculated using non-compartmental analysis:
 maximum plasma 
concentration (C max), time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), area 
under the curve to the final time with a concentration equal to or greater 
than the lower limit of quantitation [AUC (0-t)], to infinity [AUC (inf)], and 
during the first 30 minutes [AUC 0-2.5 mins , AUC 0-5 mins , AUC 0-10 mins , AUC 0-15 
mins, AUC 0-20 mins  and AUC 0-30 mins ], terminal ĞůŝŵŝŶĂƚŝŽŶƌĂƚĞĐŽŶƐƚĂŶƚ;ʄǌͿ , 
half-life (t ½), clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vz/F) 
uncorrected for bioavailability (F). 
Safety Endpoints: Adverse events will be elicited by a verbal probe. Any events 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_70579] t or observed by [CONTACT_391122] 
(physical examinations and nasal cavi ty examinations) will be recorded.

Version: 5.0 11th November 2020 Page 15 of 56 Protocol No.: OPNT003-PK-001 Vital signs, clinical laboratory re sults and ECG abnormalities will be 
reported as an adverse event if co nsidered clinically significant. 
Objective evaluations of nasal irritation will be assessed after each 
administration of study drug using a 6-po int (0 to 5) score. A NRS will also 
be used to assess acute nasal pain fo llowing each administration of study 
drug. 
Statistical Analyses: Individual subject plasma concentrations, actual sampling times, and 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed by [CONTACT_110367].  
Descriptive statistics will be calcul ated by [CONTACT_391123].  Individual 
subject and mean plasma concentrations  will be displayed on linear and 
semi-logarithmic axes. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters C max and AUC (inf), AUC 0-2.5 mins , AUC 0-5 mins , 
AUC 0-10 mins , AUC 0-15 mins , AUC 0-20 mins  and AUC 0-30 mins  for nalmefene will be 
compared between the treatments usin g an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model with treatment, period, sequen ce, and subject within sequence as 
the factors using the natural logarith ms (ln) of the data.  Confidence 
intervals (CI) (90%) will be constr ucted for the geometric mean ratios, 
nalmefene intranasal (test formulations) to intramuscular on a dose 
adjusted basis, using the log-transformed data and the two one-sided 
t-tests procedure.  The point estima tes and confidence limits will be 
exponentiated back to the original scale.  Comparability between the 
nalmefene intranasal (test formul ation) and nalmefene intramuscular 
(reference formulation) will be asse ssed from the geometric mean ratios 
and 90% confidence intervals. 
Adverse events will be coded usin g the most recent version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and will be grouped by [CONTACT_57501], orga n, class (SOC) designation. Adverse 
events will be presented as a listin g including the start date, stop date, 
severity, relationship, outcome, and dura tion. Vital signs, ECG, and clinical 
laboratory parameters will be presented as summary statistics.

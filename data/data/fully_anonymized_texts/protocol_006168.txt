Study Objectives:  To determine the potential of MC2 -01 (Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
0.005/0.064 w/w%) Cream to cause a phototoxic reaction  when topi[INVESTIGATOR_49174] . 
Study Design:  On Day  1, MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle will each be applied to 2 sites on the 
infrascapular area of the back under semi -occlusive patches for approximately 24 (±2) 
hours .  This will be the only application during the study.  Minimal erythema dose 
(MED) irradiation will also be performed for each subject on Day  1.  After patch 
removal on Day 2, all application sites will be evaluated,  and one application site of 
each study  product will be irradiated with 16  J/cm2 of Ultraviolet A (UVA) followed 
by 0.5  times the MED of UVA/Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation.  An additional site will 
also be irradiated with 16  J/cm2 of UVA followed by 0.5 times the MED of UVA/UVB 
and will serve as an untreated control.  On Day  3, approximately 24 hours (±4  hours) 
after irradiation and Day  4, approximately 48 hours (±4  hours) after irradiation, all 
application sites and the untreated control site will be evaluated.  
Planned Sample Size:  30 evaluab le subjects  
Study Population:  Healthy adult ma le and female volunteer subjects  
Investigational Products:  Each study product, MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle , will each be applied in an 
amount of 0.2  g under semi -occlusive patch conditions to 2 sites  (2 cm x 2  cm each) on 
the infrascapular area of the back once for approximately 24  hours (±2  hours).  
Control:  An untreated irradiated control site.  
Efficacy Evaluation  
Criteria:  Not applicable  
Safety Evaluation  
Criteria:  Phototoxic potential of the study products will be evaluated for all subjects completing 
the study.   
All local and systemic adverse events (AEs) observed by [CONTACT_49219].  The intensity, duration, and causal relationship 
to the investigational  products (IPs) are to be rated for all AEs.

MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  1. INTRODUCTION 
This study evaluates  the potential of  MC2 -01 (Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
0.005/0.064 w/w%)  Cream  to cause a phototoxic reaction using a controlled photopatch test 
design .  Because MC2 -01 Cream is formulated for topi[INVESTIGATOR_49177] (290- 400 nm) , it is necessary to determine the potential of 
this product to cause a phototoxic reaction after topi[INVESTIGATOR_49178].   
The study will be conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulations, the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki concerning medical research in 
humans (Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human 
Subjects, Helsinki 1964 and amendments 2013), the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines as currently amended, and all applicable 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of TKL Research, Inc. (TKL).  
1.1. Background Information  
MC2 -01 Cream contains two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs): the vitamin D3 analogue 
calcipotriene 0.005% as anhydrate (CAL) and the glucocorticosteroid betamethasone 0.064% as 
betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (BDP).  Use of the combination of vitamin D and corticosteroids for 
the treatment of plaque psoriasis has proven very effective and safe both for acute treatment and 
for long- term maintenance therapy.1,2  This combination is toda y approved in different 
formulation worldwide, including an ointment, a gel -topi[INVESTIGATOR_49179] a foam, under 
different brand names.  A combination of CAL/BDP is recommended by [CONTACT_49220]3-5, the Canadian Dermatology Association6, and by t he American Academy of 
Dermatology7 as a first line treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.8   
This Phase I study will assess the phototoxicity  potential of MC2 -01 Cream . 
1.1.1. The MC2 -01 Cream Formulation  
The currently marketed products of this drug com bination are restricted to non- aqueous oil -based 
formulations that are sticky and inconvenient to many patients9, as it has not previously been 
possible to co- formulate CAL and BDP in an aqueous formulation due to very different pH 
requirements for long- term stability of the two compounds.  
The MC2 -01 Cream is an aqueous formulation designed for patient -friendly tre atment of 
psoriasis vulgaris.  The cream has been developed using the Polyaphron Dispersion Technique™ 
(PAD™) Technology which protects the drug substances from degrading during storage.  The 
MC2 -01 Cream is easy to apply, and the cosmetic appearance is th at of a white, easily -
spreadable cream that absorbs completely into the skin a few minutes after application.  
The concentrations of CAL and BDP in the MC2- 01 cream are identical to the concentrations in 
already -marketed CAL/BDP medicinal products, which ha ve been found to be efficacious and 
safe.8

MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  1.1.2. MC2 -01 Cream – Non -clinical Data  
The safety profiles of topi[INVESTIGATOR_49180], in numerous preclinical studies, been 
found benign.  The systemic absorption of CA L and BDP through intact skin of rats, m inipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], 
and humans from the marketed products is very small.  The main adverse local effects identified 
in non- clinical toxicology studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_49181] L component and skin atrophy due to the BDP component.  
In vitro skin penetration studies comparing MC2- 01 Cream with the marketed Daivobet® 
Ointment (in US marketed as Taclonex® Ointment) and Daivobet® Gel (in US marketed as 
Taclonex® Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182]) indicate that the transdermal penetrat ion of CAL and BDP from 
the MC2 -01 Cream is in the same range as that seen with Daivobet® Ointment and Daivobet® 
Gel.   
A 4-week local tolerance study conducted with MC2- [ADDRESS_51728] to the local skin tolerance between MC2 -01 Cream and the reference Daivobet® 
Gel.  
In an 8- week study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], the toxicological profile, safety, as well as the pharmacokinetic 
profile of MC2 -01 Cream and Daivobet® Ointment was investigated after daily applications on 
10% of the surface area of the animals.  None of the animals showed signs of systemic toxicity, 
and the study showed that the MC2- 01 Cream had a higher local tolerance compared to 
Daivobet® Ointment.  Very few samples had quantifiable plasma concentrations of the parent 
compounds BDP and CAL.  The majority of animals had measurable levels of the BDP 
metabolite betamethasone 17 -propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (B17P), and the pre -dose plasma levels of B17P at Day 
22 were essentially similar between the two treatment groups.8  
1.1.3. MC2 -01 Cream – Clinical Data  
The marketed formulations of the CAL/BDP combination are known as efficacious and safe 
drugs for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. According to the USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_49183]® Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49184], only a limited number of adverse reactions has been reported. There were no 
adverse reactions reported that occurred in ≥1% of subjects treated with Taclonex® Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49185] a rate higher than in subjects treat ed with vehicle. Similar safety profiles are 
reported with Taclonex® Ointment and Enstilar® Foam.  
Available data on MC2 -[ADDRESS_51729] that MC2 -01 cream displays a similar safety profile as 
the approved CAL/BDP topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186]. A Phase 3 trial with MC2- 01 cream has been 
completed. The Phase 3 trial including 794 subjects was a randomized, investigator -blind, 
multicentre, vehicle and comparator controlled, parallel -group, 3 -arm trial, designed to show 
therapeutic non -inferiority of MC2 -01 cream to Taclone x® Suspension in subjects with mild- to-
moderate psoriasis vulgaris. The primary objective of demonstration of non- inferiority of MC2 -
021 compared to Taclonex® Suspension was met. The PGA treatment success was higher in the 
MC2 -01 cream group (40.1% of subjects achieved treatment success; 95% CI 34.5, 45.6) 
compared with the active comparator group (24.0% of subjects achieved treatment success; 95% 
CI 19.0, 29.0). A subsequent post hoc analysis of treatment efficacy of MC2- 01 cream compared 
to active comparator was performed on the PGA and other disease activity measures based on 
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential  Page 14 
Clinical Study Protocol MC2 -01-C9 
Date 10- January -2019 Final v1.0 
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Study Protocol  the ITT popul ation. The PGA treatment success rate was found to be statistically significantly 
higher in the MC2-01 cream group compared to the active comparator at Weeks 4 (24.18 vs. 
12.9, p=0.0001), Week 6 (32.95 vs. 20.16, p<0.0001), and Week 8 (37.38 vs. 22.75 p<0.0001). 
Similar s tatistical superiority of  MC2-01 cream over Taclonex® Suspension was demonstrated 
for the modified PASI score (excluding the face). 
The type and incidence o f AEs were as expected based on the known safety profile as the 
marketed products containing CAL/BDP at identical concentrations (w/w 0.005%/0.064%). 
The in cidence of treatmen t emergent adverse ev ents (TEAEs), related TEAEs, and lesional and 
lesional/perilesional A Es w as low and com parable be tween M C2-01 cream and Taclonex® 
Suspension. TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC “infections and infestations” but 
with no di fference in i ncidence between M C2-01 cream, T aclonex® Suspension, and vehicle. 
Furthermore, most of these TEAEs were judged not to be related to trial medication. Also, the 
incidence of  TEAEs r elated t o “General di sorders and  adm inistration  site reactions” were low 
and similar be tween th e three trial arms. F inally, t he trial did not  indicate a significant  effect of  
MC2- 01 cream o r Taclonex® Suspension on calcium homeostasis.  
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51730] comparison 
study of the  investigational products (IPs), MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle in healthy 
volunteer subjects .  MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle will each be applied to 2 sites , one 
which will be irradiated and one which will remain non- irradiated.  The irradiated and non-
irradiated sites will be compared with each other and with an untreated irradiated site  
A total of 4 application sites (2  cm x 2 cm each) will be marked on th e subject’s infrascapular 
region  of the back :  [ADDRESS_51731] will be applied according to the randomization scheme in an amount of 0.2 g  under 
semi -occlusive patch conditions once during the study.    
Approximately 24 (±2) hours post study product application, the patches will be removed by 
[CONTACT_464].  The sites will then be graded for cutaneous reactions by a trained evaluator and the 
designated sites, including the untreated site, will be e xposed to irradiation. One set (MC2 -01 
Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle patches ) on the back will be designated for irradiation and the other 
set will remain non -irradiated.  An additional site on the back will be marked  which will receive 
no treatment but will re ceive irradiation to serve as an untreated irradiated control.  The sites will 
be examined at approximately [ADDRESS_51732] irradiation and graded for reactions.  
Cutaneous reactions at the application sites will be evaluated using a visual scale that  rates the 
degree of erythema, edema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation (see Table  3 and Table 4 ). 
Safety evaluations include collection of AEs . 
3.2. Discussion of Design  
Results are interpreted according to working criteria which are based upon published works, as 
well as the clinical experience of TKL.  These working criteria are periodically reviewed and 
amended subject to new information which becomes available.  
This phototoxicity study is designed to detect the ability of the MC2 -01 Cream and its vehi cle 
(MC2 -01 Vehicle)  to cause topi[INVESTIGATOR_49187].  Each subject is to 
receive applications of the IPs to [ADDRESS_51733] ( MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle) under both irradiated and non-
irradiated conditions.   
3.3. Study Population

Investigator should seek to obtain the reason and record this on the case report form (CRF).  
If at the time of  refusal,  a study product has already been administered, the subject should be 
advised on follow -up safety investigations. If a subject withdraws from the study, all efforts will 
be made to complete a final evaluation if possible. Subjects discontinued for  having experienced 
an AE will be followed until the AE is resolved, a reasonable explanation is provided for the 
event, or the subject is referred to his/her own primary medical doctor (PMD). The specific AE 
in question will be recorded on the appropriate  CRF.  
If a subject develops a serious adverse event (SAE), his/her termination from the study will be 
considered by [CONTACT_737].  Similarly, if the subject develops conditions over the course of 
the study which would have excluded his/her entry in the  study according to the safety -related 
medical exclusion criteria, he/she must be withdrawn immediately.    
The subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for 
medical reasons and/or due to non- adherence to the  treatment scheme and other duties stipulated 
in the study protocol.  The reasons are to be documented on the CRF.  
In addition, the Sponsor retains the right to end the study at any time if the study cannot be 
carried out as agreed upon in the protocol.  I n case of premature termination or suspension of the 
study, the Sponsor’s study manager will promptly inform the Investigator/institutions and 
regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension and the reason for that.  It is the 
responsibility of the  Principal Investigator (PI) to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in 
the case of premature termination/suspension.  
3.3.4. Withdrawals  
The following medical and other reasons justify a premature termination (by [CONTACT_1130] o r 
Investigator) of any of the study IPs.  
• Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event  
• Death  
• Protocol Violation (e.g. non- compliance)  
• Investigator Judgment

3.4. Treatments 
3.4.1. Investigational Products and Control 
Investigational Products: 
MC2 -01 Cream  
MC2 -01 cream contains 0.005% w/w CAL (as anhydrate) and 0.064% w/w% BDP and is filled 
in sealed, collapsible aluminum tubes as primary packaging material.  The MC2 -01 cream 
formulation contains 70% oil and 30% aqueous external phase at approximately neural pH.  The 
oil fully so lubilizes the drug substances and provides semi-occlusiveness important for skin 
penetration, while the aqueous external phase contributes to the skin feel.  The cosmetic 
appearance is a white easily spreadable cream with high oil content that absorbs comp letely into 
the skin within few minutes of application.[ADDRESS_51738] will be applied to 2 sites (one irradiated site and one non- irradiated site) on the lower thoracic area of each subject’s back  for approximately 
24 (±2) hours.  An amount of IP sufficient to cover an area of the back  approximately 2  cm x 2 
cm will be applied  (approximately 0.2 g).   
Lot numbers will be given in the clinical study report.

application  visits .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_49189] . 
3.4.5. Assignment to Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomization  
Each subject who signs an informed consent form (ICF) will be assigned a screening number. If 
the subject meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and successfully completes 
the screening procedures , they will be enrolled in the study.  Upon enrollment, each subject will 
be assigned a unique subject number  and receive a ran domization code, indicating application 
placement of the study materials.  Each subject in this study will serve as his or her own control. 
For each subject, one  set of patches ( MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle) will be designated for 
irradiat ion and the ot her set will remain  non-irradiated. In each  set one application site will be 
assigned to MC2- 01 Cream  and one will be assigned to MC2 -01 Vehicle according to the 
randomization schedule.  One additional site will be assigned to serve as the untreated irradi ated 
control. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinding  
The treatments (IPs and control) will not be blinded to investigative personnel involved in the 
preparation/application and removal of treatments.

Clinical Study Protocol MC2 -01-C9   
Date 10- January -2019   Final v1.0  
 
MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  Investigative personnel who are involved in the preparation/application and removal of the 
treatments will be unblinded and will not perform the evaluation of skin responses.  The subjects 
and the trained evaluator who will be evaluating skin responses will be blinded to IPs and the 
treatment allocation; however, because of the demarcatio ns/skin coloration remaining on the skin 
following patch removal, complete blinding of the evaluators cannot be completely assured.  
Investigative personnel  who are blinded, including the Investigator and the trained evaluator 
involved in the evaluation of responses, will remain blinded during the course of the study until 
Database Lock and finalization of the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
In the event of an emergency, if possible, the Investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_49221].  If it is 
not possible to notify the Sponsor prior to the unblinding, the Investigator or designee will contact 
[CONTACT_49222] a written notification 
to document the exact manner in which the code was broken and the justification for the 
unblinding. The Investigator will communicate the treatment identification to only the 
investigative personnel who require the information to manage the emergency.  Unblinding will 
happen on site at TKL.  
3.4.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including over the counter (OTC) drugs and vitamins, taken within [ADDRESS_51740]’s CRF.  
The following prohibitions will apply for the duration of the study:  
• There will be no use of systemic/top ical anti -inflammatory analgesics which in the

All patches will be applied and removed by [CONTACT_49224].  Whereas bathing will be 
allowed (low tub bath/frontal showers), the patched areas are not to be soaked and are to be kept 
as dry as possible, per the instructions to be given to each subject.  Subjects will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_49225], including OTC remedies.  In the case of 
an emergency treatment, the Investigator must be informed as soon as possible.  A trained, 
experienced evaluator will assess study compliance.

the exclusion criteria, he/she will be allowed to participate  in the study.  Concomitant 
medications and AEs will be reviewed and recorded at this visit.  
Upon enrollment, each subject will be assigned a unique subject number and receive a 
randomization code , indicating application placement of the study products.  
A baseline evaluation of the patch sites will be performed immediately prior to application of the 
patches to ensure that no conditions, markings, or coloration of the skin will interfere with 
interpretation of the study results.  
A total of 4 application si tes (2  cm x 2 cm each) will be marked on each subject’s back, placing 2 
sites for MC2 -01 Cream  and 2 sites for  MC2 -01 Vehicle. One set ( MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 
Vehicle)  will be designated for irradiation and the other set will remain non -irradiated  under 
semi -occlusive conditions. The distance between the patches will be no less than one centimeter.  
The numbering of the test sites will remain the same throughout the study.  The sites will be 
marked with an indelible, surgical marker.  
Minimal Erythema Dos e Determination  
On Day 1, subjects will have an area of skin on their back, approximately 50 cm2, divided into 
6 equal sites marked with a surgical marker.  The duration of UVA/UVB irradiation for minimal 
erythema dose ( MED ) exposure will be calculated bas ed on subjects’ Fitzpatrick Skin Type and 
the output of the solar simulator.  The solar simulator output will be measured prior to each 
irradiation.  Details of the UV irradiation including output of the simulator, time of exposure, 
equipment used, and sta ff performing irradiations will be documented. Each of the sites will be 
irradiated with full spectrum UV light (UVA/UVB) , with each exposure differing from the 
previous  by a factor of 1.25  (ie, each irradiated site will be exposed to a  25% greater dose of  UV 
irradiation than the previous site).[ADDRESS_51742]. To determine the MED the sites are read and scored by [CONTACT_49227]. There will be a main evaluator for the study; a backup evaluator will also 
be assigned  in the event that an emergency occurs,  and the main evaluator is unable to attend the 
study visit. The lowest exposure dose of the 6 irradiated sub- sites showing an erythema response 
is selected as the minimal erythema dose (see Section 3.5.7 for scoring scale).  
The clinical staff will remove the patches approximately 24 ( ± 2) hours after application and 
evaluate the application sites according to the criteria in Table 3 and Table 4 (Section 3.5.7).  
Evaluations will be recorded on the appropriate source document .  The duration of the UVA and 
UVA/UVB irradiation will be calculated based on the output of the solar simulator.  The solar 
simulator output will be measure d prior to each irradiation.  Details of the UV irradiation 
including output of the simulator, time of exposure, equipment used, and staff performing 
irradiations will be documented.  The sites designated for irradiation  will receive 16 J/cm2 of 
UVA radiation followed by 0.5 times the MED of UVA/UVB (full spectrum) irradiation, using a 
filtered light source (see Section 3.5.4).  One additional site (untreated) will be irradiated with 
16 J/cm2 of UVA radiation followed by 0.5 times the MED of UVA/UVB radiation, using a 
filtered light sou rce and will serve as an untreated control.   
In addition, AEs and concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded, as appropriate.  
Day 3 
On Day 3, approximately 24 (±4) hours after irradiation (ie, approximately 48  (±4) hours following 
product appli cation) , all application sites  (MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle) and the untreated 
control site will be evaluated.  In addition, AEs and concomitant medications will be reviewed and 
recorded.  
Day 4/End of Study  
On Day 4, approximately 48 (±4) hours after irradiation (ie, approximately 72 ( ±4) hours 
following product application), all application sites  (MC2 -01 Cream and MC2 -01 Vehicle) and 
the untreated control site will be evaluated .   
An EOS examination will be conducted and consist of the following : 
• Concomitant medication  
• AEs 
• UPT in females of childbearing potential  
Concomitant medications and AEs will be reviewed and recorded during the whole study.  For a 
detailed listing of scheduled study time points refer to the Visit Schedule and Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
Retest 
Although not all observations of erythema and edema are associated with phototoxicity, 
erythema and edema must be observed for a reaction to be suspected of being a positive 
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51743] sites (ie, if contact [CONTACT_49228]), the reaction upon retest 
must be at least one grad e more intense at the irradiated site than at the non -irradiated site for the 
reaction to be suspected of being a phototoxicity reaction (refer to Section 3.5.7 for response 
grades and notations).   
 
If it is determined by [CONTACT_49229] a retest sh ould be performed, then the retest patches 
will be applied as soon as the original reactions ha ve resolved.  The Investigator will determine 
the patch conditions to use during the Retest (see Section 3.4.3).  The study material will be 
applied to naive sites on the back, using appropriate patches to further discriminate a phototoxic 
reaction from an irritation reaction.  Identical patches will be applied to sites previously 
unexposed to the study material. Approximately 24 ( ± 2) hours later one site will be irradiated 
with full spectrum UV light ( UVA/ UVB ) using a filtered light source. An additional untreated 
site will be irradiated with UV light  (UVA/ UVB ) using a filtered light source and serve as an 
untrea ted irradiated control.  All sites will be evaluated upon patch removal a t approximately [ADDRESS_51744] may be done on the individual ingredients of the pr oducts.

Date 10- January -2019   Final v1.0  
 
MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  3.5.3. Definition of M inimal E rythemal D ose 
Minimal erythemal dose is defined as the length (in time) of light exposure required to produce a 
minimal erythema reaction 16 -  24 hours after irradiation using a standardized filtered UV light 
source that emits UVA/ UVB ( full spectrum ) irradiation as part  of its emission spectrum.12 
3.5.4. Light source 
The light source will be a Xenon Arc Solar Simulator (150 W), with UV -reflecting dichroic 
mirror, UVC -blocking filter, and visible/infrared blocking filter to generate a continuous 
emission spectrum in the UVA and UVB range (290 to 400 nm).12  An additional filter is added 
during irradiation of the application sites to block UVB radiation allowing only UVA irradiation 
of the sites.  The output is measured daily prior to irradiation using a radiometer/photometer.  
3.5.5. Background I nformation  
Date of birth, gender, race, Fitzpatrick skin type (see Table 1 ), and a significant medical history 
of each subject will be recorded at Screening.  
3.5.6. Efficacy Assessments  
No efficacy will be assessed in this study.  
3.5.7. Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patch Test Site Evaluations  
Assessment of the study material application sites will be done once daily, Days 1- 4.  Assessment 
of the untreated irradiated control site will be done once daily on Days 2, 3 and 4.   
The symbols listed in Table 3 and their respective numerical equivalents will be used to express 
the response observed at the time of examination. Additional response notations are presented in 
Table 4 . The same evaluator (where possible) should perform the assessment throughout (from 
Day [ADDRESS_51745], if necessary ) the study.

MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  Because of the relatively small number of subjects evaluated in this study, it will generally not be 
possible (except in extreme cases) to categorize a product as having mild, moderate or severe 
phototoxic potential. 
The readings will be made under a standardized white light source.  The numerical equivalent 
scores will be used for calculations. 
3.6. Adver se Events  
3.6.1. Method of Determining Adverse Events  
Safety assessments will include recording AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_49231].  Adverse events will be collected during the period from the time of the 
signature [CONTACT_49258] -related activity performed until the end of 
the trial.  Adverse events  will be recorded at each visit throughout the study on the  appropriate 
CRF.  Every attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear 
diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they 
represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], i n which case they should be 
reported as separate events.   
Subjects should be asked whether, since the time of the last observation or visit, they had any of 
the following:  
• Experience any changes in well -being;  
• Used any new medications  other than those permitted in the inclusion criteria ; 
• Changed medication regimens (both prescription and OTC); and/or  
• Were admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49198].  
All questions should be of a general nature and should not suggest symptoms.   
When an  AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be carried out and appropriate treatment 
provided.  Additional follow -up will be done as necessary ( Section 3.6.4) and recorded in the 
subject’s source documents, and the results will be provided to the Spons or.   
For AE definitions and reporting requirements refer to Section 3.6.2 and Section 3.6.3.  
Note:  Any observed response which can be denoted using the irritation criteria summarized in 
Table 3  and Table 4 will not be considered an AE.  Likewise, any ta pe-related irritation will only 
be noted as an AE when all patches are discontinued due to tape reaction around all sites (see 
Section 3.6.6).  
3.6.2. Adverse Event Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Information about all local and systemic AEs, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_3433] e subject, discovered by 
[CONTACT_49232], or detected through other means, will be collected and recorded on the 
AE CRF and followed as appropriate.   
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51747] (or cosmetic product), which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal IP, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal IP.   
Any AE that is considered related to the IP must be followed by [CONTACT_49233]; all relevant follow -up information will be 
reported to MC2 or designee.  
Adverse Events will be coded using the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are considered AEs only if 
they worsen after starting study treatment (any study procedures specified in the protocol).  Any 
AEs occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the ICF are recorded on the Medical 
History/Current Medical Conditions CRF.  
To the extent possible, each AE w ill also be described by:  
1. its duration (start and end dates),  
2. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) ,  
3. its relationship to the study drug,  
4. the action(s) taken, and  
5. as relevant, the outcome.  
Note:  Any observed response which can be denoted using the irritation criteria summarized in 
Table 3 and Table 4 will not be considered an AE.  Likewise, any tape -related irritation will not 
be noted as an AE.  
The outcome of an AE will be classified as re covered, recovered with sequelae, 
recovering/resolving, ongoing, or death.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
A “SAE” is any AE that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it 
occurs, puts the subject at im mediate risk of death.  It does not refer to an AE that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49199] (not including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition that h as not increased in severity or 
frequency from the subject’s underlying medical condition prior to entry into the 
study).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.  
• Is another serious (important medical events) event.

Clinical Study Protocol MC2 -01-C9   
Date 10- January -2019   Final v1.0  
 
MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
(Note: Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based on the appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardi ze the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convul sions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is to classify the severity (intensity) of an AE according to the following 
definitions : 
• Mild – The subject  was aware of the signs and symptoms , but the signs and 
symptoms were easily tolerated and do not interfere with daily activity.  
• Moderate – The signs and symptoms were sufficient to restrict, but did not prevent, 
usual daily activity for the subject. The s ubject is still able to function.  
• Severe – The subject was unable to perform usual daily activity.  
The maximum intensity of an AE (mild, moderate, or severe) will be assessed taking into 
account the possible range of intensity of the symptom(s). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relations hip of Adverse Events to Study Treatments  
The Investigator is responsible to assess the relationship of an AE to the IP treatment using good 
clinical judgment and definitions outlined in Table 5.  
Table  5: Relationshi p of AE to Study Drug  
Association  Definition  
Not related  The AE is clearly explained by [CONTACT_49234]; the 
temporal relationship of the AE to IP administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, 
or, concomitant medication, therapeutics interventions, or underlying condition provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed AE  
  
Possibl y Related   The AE and administration of IP are temporally related, but the AE can be explained 
equally well by [CONTACT_49235] y Related   The AE and use of IP are temporally related, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_49236], and a direct association can be 
demonstrated. Concomitant medication, therapeutics interventions, or underlying 
conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed AE  
3.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur from the time of informed consent through completion of the last 
study visit should be reported.   
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51748] is referred to his/her own PMD.  The Investigator and the Sponsor will 
decide if longer follow -up is appropriate on a case -by-case basis.  Subjects who experience any 
clinically significant AE will remain under medical supervision until the Investigator or the 
Sponsor’s Medic al Monitor deems the AE to be resolved, stabilized, or no longer serious enough 
to warrant follow -up.   
3.6.5. Pregnancy reporting  
Prior to study enrollment, females of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of 
avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy.  
A UPT will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at Day 1 (day of first patch 
application) and EOS.  All women of childbearing potential will receive a UPT prior to the first 
study drug administration and the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory 
pregnancy testing a re available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive any 
study drug and must not be enrolled in the study.  
Pregnancy follow -up should be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_51749] be reported immediately (i.e., not later than [ADDRESS_51750] knowledge).  The SAE or pregnancy report should be e- mailed or faxed to 
United BioSource Corporation (UBC) using the following e- mail or fax -number: 
Email: [EMAIL_907]  
Fax: [PHONE_866] 
3.7.2.
 Reporting Responsibility 
Any death, SAE, pregnancy, (see Section 3.6), or unusual frequency of AEs, must be reported 
immediately (i.e., not later than [ADDRESS_51751] learning of its occurrence) to the Sponsor’s 
study manager by [CONTACT_737], even if the event(s) appear to be unrelated to study treatment.  Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE or pregnancy must also be reported to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of receiving it.  If the SAE has not been previously documented 
(i.e., is a new occurrence) and it is thought to be related to the IP, the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_49237].  If warranted, an investigator alert may be issued to 
inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same product (or therapy) that this SAE has been reported.   
The IRB should also be notified of SAEs or pregnancies and of any follow -up information in 
writing, as is practical, and depending on local regulations/IRB reporting requirements.   
3.7.3. Reporting procedures  
For each SAE, the Investigator will complete a SAE Report Form in English and assess the 
relation ship of each SAE to study treatment.  The completed form(s) should be sent by e- mail to 
the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_51752] knowledge of the SAE (as outlined in Section 3.7.1 and Section 3.7.2).  The initial SAE should be reported immediately, even if onl y preliminary 
information is available.  Follow -up information should be sent by [CONTACT_49238], 
restating the date of the original report.  Either a new SAE form is sent (stating that it is a follow -
up), or the original one is resent (with the new information highlighted and a new date provided).  The follow-up should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was 
treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or discontinued 
study participation.  The form confirmation will be retained. 
Pregnancy follow-up (as outlined in Section 3.6.5) should be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_51753] safety measures in clinical trials.

Clinical Study Protocol MC2 -01-C9   
Date 10- January -2019   Final v1.0  
 
MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  4. STATISTICAL METHODS  
4.1. General Considerations for Data Analysis  
The focus of the statistical analysis will be the comparison with controls of the phototoxic 
response to the study products.  The parameter for phototoxicity will be the mean of Da y 3 and 4 
scores (sum of erythema and edema).  
The statistical analyses described below will be supplemented by a comprehensive SAP  which 
will be finalized before the database is locked.  Any changes to the statistical plans will be 
described and justified in the final report.  
All statistical processing will be performed using the SAS® system (version 9.2 or higher ).  No 
interim or subgroup analyses are planned.  
4.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The sample size of [ADDRESS_51754] Populations for Analysis 
All subjects who receive treatment will be evaluable for AEs.  The evaluation of phototoxicity 
potential of the study products will be assessed for all subjects completing the study.  
4.3.1. Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, gender, 
Fitzpatrick skin typ e, and race) and background characteristics for the randomized subject 
population.  Past/coexistent medical history information for all randomized subjects will be 
presented in a by -subject listing.  
4.3.2. Study Product/Visit Compliance  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize study product compliance for the randomized 
subject population. 
4.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medication information for all randomized subjects will be presented in a 
by-subject listing.  
4.5. Efficacy Evaluation  
This section is not applicable to this study.

MC2 Therapeutics   Clinical Study Protocol  4.6. Safety E valuation  
4.6.1. Local Tolerability Assessment  
All assigned scores during the study for subjects who complete the study will be summarized using 
frequency counts by [CONTACT_49239] 2, 3 and 4. Selected pai rwise comparisons will be 
performed on the mean of the Day 3 and Day  4 response scores (sum of erythema and edema 
scores) in the context of the analyses of variance  (ANOVA) .  Pairs to be compared are: each study 
product irradiated versus non- irradiated and  all pairwise comparisons o f each set  (MC2 -01 Cream  
versus MC2 -01 Vehicle  on both the irradiated and non- irradiated si tes and MC2 -01 Cream  versus 
untreated and MC2 -01 Vehicle versus untreated on the irradiated si tes).    
4.6.2. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will  be summarized as an overall incidence of at least one event, incidence 
within body systems only, incidence by [CONTACT_49240], and by [CONTACT_49241].  
Each subject will contribute only once (e.g., the first occurrence) to each of the rate s, regardless 
of the number of occurrences (events) the subject experiences.   
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) will be summarized and tabulated by [CONTACT_49242], by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe) and by [CONTACT_49243] ( not related, possibl y related , probabl y related , and definite ly related ).   
Treatment -emergent will be defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the first study 
product administration date.  Any event with a missing onset date will be included as a 
treatment -emergent AE.  
Deaths and SAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
4.7. Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_49201].  
4.8. Interim analyses  
No interim analyses are anticipated.  
4.9. Special M ethods

in it and thereby [CONTACT_49244]. 
5.2. Institutional Review Board  
Before implementing th is study, the protocol, the ICF and other information to subjects, must be 
reviewed by a properly constituted IRB.  A signed and dated statement that the protocol and 
informed consent  have been approved by [CONTACT_49245].  This committee must also approve any amendments to the protocol, other than 
administrative ones, and a signed and dated statement of approval must be sent to the Sponsor 
prior to initiation of the amendment procedures.  The name [CONTACT_49259] . 
5.3. Informed consent  
The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject the nature of the study, its purpose, the 
procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks a nd benefits involved, and any 
discomfort it may entail.  Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary, that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and that withdrawal of consent 
will not affect his/her subsequent medi cal treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
This informed consent  should be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non-
technical language.  The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and 
dating it, and he/she should be given a copy of the signed document.  No subject can enter the 
study before informed consent  has been obtained from him/her. 
The ICF is considered to be part of the protocol  and must be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_49203].  An y changes to the proposed ICF suggested by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_49204] a copy of the approved version must be provided to Sponsor

MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51756]  
5.5.1. Protocol amendments  
With the exception of changes in the visit schedule and/or administrative changes, any changes 
or additions to this clinical study protocol require a written protocol amendment that must be 
approved by [CONTACT_49246] [INVESTIGATOR_49205].  Amendments significantly affecting the 
safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study, require 
additional approval by [CONTACT_19821].  A copy of the written approval of the IRB, which 
becomes part of the protocol, must be given to Sponsor .  Examples of a mendments requiring 
such approval are:  
1. an increase in study product dosage or duration of product exposure of subjects, 
2. a significant change in the study design ( e.g., addition or deletion of a control group),  
3. an increase in the number of invasive procedur es to whi ch subjects are exposed, and  
4. addition or deletion of a test procedure for safety monitoring. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by [CONTACT_49247].  If an immediate change to the protocol is fe lt to be necessary by [CONTACT_49248]/her for safety reasons the study Sponsor  should be 
notified, and the IRB should be informed within [ADDRESS_51757] be kept informed of such administrative 
changes.  Examples of administrative changes not requiring formal protocol amendments and 
IRB approval that can be treated as administrative amendments i nclude:  
1. changes in the staff used to monitor studies, and  
2. minor changes in the packaging or labeling of the study product.  
5.5.2. Other changes in study conduct  
Deviations from the planned study conduct are not permitted; any unforeseen changes in study 
conduct must be reported to the Sponsor and noted in the final clinical study report.  
5.5.3. Termination or suspension of study  
Both the Sponsor and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49206].  If 
study termination is necessary, the procedures  will be arranged on an individual study basis after 
review and consultation by [CONTACT_49249].  It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49207]2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page 38

5.6. Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
5.6.1. Recording of data 
Case report forms will be designed to identify each subject by [CONTACT_49250], where 
appropriate, subject's  initials, the product being evaluated, and the results observed.  All entries 
to the CRFs must be made as instructed by [CONTACT_49251].  Data on 
subjects collected on CRFs during the study will be documented in an anonymous fashion, and 
the subject will only be identified by [CONTACT_49252], and by [CONTACT_5657]/her initials, if also required.  
If, as an exception, it is necessary for safety or regulatory reasons to identify the subject, both the 
study Sponsor  and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49209] t his information confidential.   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_49210](s) of the CRFs, thereby [CONTACT_49253]/she takes 
responsibility for the accuracy of the data in the entire case record book.  All records will be kept 
in conformance to applicable national laws and regulations.  
The original signed ICF will be attached to each subject’s file.  When the study treatment is 
completed, the ICF will be kept in the appropriate file folder; otherwise a note indicating where 
the records can be located will be made.   
5.6.2. Retention of documents  
Storage is maintained for [ADDRESS_51758]. Suite 
1101/1201, Fair Lawn, NJ [ZIP_CODE] in a secured room accessible only to TKL employees, or at an 
offsite location that provides a secure environment with burglar/fire alarm systems, camera 
detection, and controlled temperature and humidity.  Originals or copi[INVESTIGATOR_49211], source 
documents, correspondence, IRB documents, study reports, etc. will be available for the 
Sponsor's review on the premis es of TKL or at a secure location off -site.  All database 
management activities can be found in the data management plan (DMP).   
5.7. Product handling and accountability  
All product supplies are to be used only for this clinical study and not for any other pur pose.  
Study product supplies must be kept in an appropriate, secure area ( e.g., locked cabinet) and 
stored according to the conditions specified on the product labels.   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designee must maintain a full record of the shipment and application of s tudy product 
in a product accountability ledger.  This log must be kept current and should contain the 
following information:  
• identification of the subject to whom the  study product was dispensed,  
• date(s) of the  study product dispensed to the subject, and  
• initials of the study site representative(s) dispensing study product.  
MC2 Therapeutics  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_51759] -inventory and 
storage -facility inspection will be conducted at appropriate time intervals throughout the clinical 
investigation, depending on enrollment and the length of the study.  Any discrepancy and/or 
deficiency must be accounted for by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_49212], or any partly used or unused product supply.  At the 
conclusion of the study and, as appropriate, during the course of the study, all study product 
supplies, including partially used or empty containers, must be returned according to the 
designation of the Sponsor.  Any missing supplies will be indica ted on the inventory; the original 
inventory list will be retained in the PI’s records for this clinical study.  
5.8. Quality control and quality assurance  
5.8.1. Monitoring procedures  
During the study, the Sponsor may visit the site regularly to check the completeness  of subject 
records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to ICH -GCP 
guidelines, the progress of enrollment, and also to ensure that study product is being stored, 
dispensed and accounted for according to specifications.  Key investigative personnel will be 
available to assist the field monitor during these visits.  
The data required by [CONTACT_49254].  The CRFs and any 
source documents will be available to the study monitor who will pe rform a 100% data check 
(comparison of the data recorded in the CRF with those in the source documents).  The CRFs 
and source data will also be available for an audit by [CONTACT_49255].  
The Investigator will give the monitor access to relevant clinical records, to confirm their 
consistency with the CRF entries.  No information in these records about the identity of the 
subjects will leave the study center.  Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with 
the CRFs are perfor med according to the study -specific monitoring plan.  
5.8.2. Auditing procedures  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a study center may be audited in depth for 
study quality assurance by  [CONTACT_1034], an external auditor on behalf of the Sponsor, and/ or by 
[CONTACT_12721].  This audit may include a review of all source documents, drug records, 
and original CRFs the study site used in this study.  Subject  confidentiality will be maintained at 
all times and consent for this will be obtained before  entry of the subject  into the clinical study 
(see Section 5.3).  If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49213].  
5.9. Confidentiality and publication policies

The validity of the proportional hazards assumption will

Pancreas  
Title of Study:  
A Randomized  Controlled, Open label, Adaptive Phase -3 Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of 
EndoTAG- 1 Plus Gemcitabine versus Gemcitabine alone  in Patients with Measurable Locally 
Advanced and/or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas  Failed on FOLFIRINOX Treatment  
Study Center(s): Up to 100 multinational centers  
Planned Number of Subjects:  
A total of 218 (109 per arm) subjects will be randomized.  Study Development Phase:  Phase  3
 
Indication for Use: Lipid Complexed Paclitaxel (EndoTAG-1) , in combination with gemcitabine , 
is indicated for the c ombination regimen in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  who are eligible for second- line therapy after failing first -line 
therapy w ith FOLFIRINOX . 
Study Rationale:  
EndoTAG- [ADDRESS_972556] to conventional chemotherapy aiming at tumor -cell toxicity, EndoTAG -1 specifically 
displays antivascular and antiangiogenic activity. 
Based on the results of preclinical studies and clinical phase 1/2  studies and its new therapeutic 
concept,  EndoTAG- 1 represents a promising candidate for the treatment of solid malignancies, 
both for taxane- sensitive and taxane- insensitive tumors.  
Pancreatic cancer, which is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] (Jemal et al. 
2008), is an indication with high need for improvement of systemic therapy. Less than 20% of 
pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable and potentially curable disease while the vast majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis with  a median survival of 
approximately [ADDRESS_972557] decade, though 1- year survival rates ranging around 18% are still unsatisfactory (Burris et al. 1997;

Moore et al. 2007). Numerous trials have aimed to demonstrate superiority of combinations of 
gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutics or targeted agents with disappointing results.  
Results of a controlled , randomized Phase 2  clinical trial comprising 200 patients indicate a 
considerable survival benefit for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with EndoTAG -
1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. 
The aim of this  adaptive Phase 3  trial is to show a statistically significant superiority of EndoTAG -
1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with locally 
advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer  after FOLFIRINOX  failure . 
Objectives:  
The objective of the study is to assess the safety  and efficacy of a combination therapy  of 
EndoTAG- 1 plus gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with locally advanced 
and/or metastatic  adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  eligible for second- line therapy after failing first -
line therapy w ith FOLFIRINOX . 
Efficacy  Objectives:  
To assess the efficacy of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 with weekly infusions of  
gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy according to: 
• Assessment of survival (overall  survival [OS] , progression -free survival [PFS ]) 
• Tumor response evaluation via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 
(RECIST v.1.1) 
Safety  Objectives:  
To assess the safety of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 with weekly infusions of  
gemc itabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy according to: 
• Incidence and percentage of subject s with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Laboratory abnormalities (hematology, coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry) 
• Dose reductions, pausing, and/or discontinuation of EndoTAG-1 and/or gemcitabine 
Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s: 
• Overall survival (OS) 
Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause or last 
day known to be alive.  
• Progression Free Survival (PFS)

on single -agent E ndoTAG- 1 alone. However, subjects in Treatment A rm A who require 
discontinuation of EndoTAG -1 due to toxicity may continue on gemcitabine monotherapy. 
Subjects on A rm B ( gemcitabine alone) will not be offered treatment with EndoTAG -1 at the time 
of discontinuation (no cross- over allowed).  
Statistical Considerations:  
Sample Size Determin ation and Rationale :  
A total of 21 8 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (EndoTAG-1 plus 
gemcitabine) and Arm B (gemcitabine monotherapy). The sample size is event -driven to collect a 
pre-specified number of primary efficacy outcomes. Based on the  sample size calculation, the 
primary endpoint analysis for overall survival will require 16 7 events (deaths)  for 196 subjects . 
The primary endpoint analysis for progression- free survival will require 169 events (disease 
progression) from [ADDRESS_972579] a 40% reduction in the risk 
of death in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.60) using a 2- sided log- rank test with 
90% power and an overall significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_972580] a 35% reduction of progressive free survival in the risk of disease progression 
in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.647) using a 2- sided log- rank test with more 
than 80% power and an overall significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_972581]. Sample size estimation is 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_90850] 9-1  and Figure 9-2, total sample size requirement vs. the median survival time 
(month) in the treatment arm.  
A dropout rate of 10% is factored in the sample size calculations  for a total sample size of 218 
subjects. Sample size is estimated using PASS ( 15) sample size software.  
The overall survival assumption for the sample size are based on published literature data 
comparing therapeutic effect of gemcitabine monotherapy and gemcitabine combination regimen 
on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after previous FOLFIRINOX treatment. The hazard 
ratio for death of 0.60 with median overall survival of 4.4 months for gemcitabine monotherapy 
(Conroy et al. 2011) and 7.3 months for gem citabine + paclitaxel combina tion (Portal et al. 2015) 
was used for the sample size calculation.  The progression- free survival assumption for the sample

size are based on hazard ratio of 0.647 with median progression -free survival of 3.3 months for 
gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et a l. 2011) and 5.1 months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel 
combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the sample size calculation. 
Randomization and Stratification:   
Prior to randomization, subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_152056] (subjects with locally 
advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status ( ECOG performance status 
0 and 1).  Then they will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio. 
Analysis Populations:  
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population  is defined as all subjects ran domized regardless of actual 
treatment received. The ITT population will be the primary population for the analysis of primary 
and secondary endpoints.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the ITT population 
requirem ents, and were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be 
identified before the database lock.  
The Safety population is defined as any subject receiving the treatment after randomization. This 
population will be used for the a nalysis of safety parameters.  
Analysis Considerations:  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ) accompanies the protocol and any amendments to the 
SAP will be finalized prior to final database lock. Any significant changes to the analyses described 
in this protocol will be highlighted in the SAP and the Clinical Study Report. 
Analysis of time -to-event parameters ( OS, PFS) : times to event will be estimat ed together with the 
respective 95% CIs for each treatment group using the  Kaplan -Meie r method. The log- rank test 
(stratification factors ECOG and TNM) will be calculated for comparison of OS and PFS for the 
combination therapy treatment versus the gemcitabine monotherapy group. 
Tumor response : Fo r each  subject , the overall response to treatment after the initial [ADDRESS_972582] s 
with CR, PR, OR, SD, PD, disease control ( CR, PR or  SD), at the end of cycle 1, as well as the 
overall response to treatment, will be calculated  for each treatment group and presented with exact 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
Change from baseline in CA 19-9: The proportion of subjects with a change from normal to 
abnormal, no change, or a change from abnormal to normal, and the proportion of subject s with a 
response w ill be calculated. Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for the proportion of subject s with a  
change from abnormal to normal and for the proportion of subject s with a response.  
Change from baseline in QLQ -C30 and PAN -26: Differences in proportions between treatment 
groups will be estimated and exact 95% CIs will be calculated for these estimates. These analyses 
will be performed  for al l individual QoL score s, QLQ -C30 Global  Health score and for the PAN -
26 score at the end of t reatment cycle 1 and  also for the full treatment course.

1.1 Background Information 
Pancreatic cancer, which is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] 
(Jemal et al. 2008), is an indication with high need for improvement of systemic therapy. 
Less than 20% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable and 
potentially curable disease while the vast majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis with a median survival of approximately [ADDRESS_972602] decade, though 1 -year survival rates ranging around 18% are still 
unsatisfactory (Burris et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2007). Numerous trials have aimed to demonstrate superiority of combinations of gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutics or targeted agents with disappointing results.  
Results of a controlled, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial comprising 200 patients indicate a considerable survival benefit for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with EndoTAG -1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine 
monotherapy. 
The aim of this adaptive Phase 3 trial is to show a statistically significant superiority of EndoTAG- 1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy 
in patients with locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer after FOLFI RINOX 
failure.

membranes embedded with paclitaxel are assembled.

Furthermore, EndoTAG -1 was shown to be effective in paclitaxel -resistan t tumors in 
animals.  
An increased anti -tumor activity in animals was observed when EndoTAG -1 was 
combined with other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents. Combination therapy (e.g. EndoTAG-1 + gemcitabine) showed enhanced tumor regression, reduction of lymph 
node metastases and absence of liver metastases compared to either monotherapy. In vitro, combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_714206] -1 with chemotherapeutics showed complete 
or concentration-dependent additivity, thus supporting the in vivo data. 
Mode-of- action studies in rodents demonstrated the neovascular targeting properties of  
EndoT AG-1. A strong decrease of the endothelial proliferation index in the tumor 
periphery as well as a reduction of the tumor perfusion index and an increase of 
endothelial cell apoptosis was observed. These results indicate a potential dual mode -
of-action of  EndoTAG- 1 by [CONTACT_441852] -neovascular and anti -tumor effects 
(Eichhorn et al 2010, Strieth et al 2008, Strieth et al 2004, Schmitt-Sody et al 2003). 
Toxicology 
The t oxicological profile of EndoTAG -1 has been evaluated in single - and repeated -
dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs covering treatment periods of up to 26 weeks.  
In an acute toxicity study in mice mortality was observed at 5.4 mg/kg BW liposomal 
paclitaxel.  The same m ortality was reported in the control group using empty liposomes 
and was most likely due to the large volumes of injected suspended lipid complexes. No other findings were reported in the acute toxicity studies. 
In subchronic toxicity studies in rats the high dose EndoTAG -1 group (1.5 mg/kg BW 
liposomal paclitaxel) showed slight weight loss and reduction of white blood cells. The 
main histopathological finding was hypocellularity of the hematopoetic bone marrow in about one third of the rats in this dose gr oup. The effects were reversible and resolved 
during recovery. 
Acute, subchronic and chronic repeated dose toxicity studies have been performed in 
dogs. In the 14- day and 28 -day studies liposomal paclitaxel doses up to 1.7 mg/kg BW  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 40 of 125 and 1.5 mg/kg BW , respectively,  per application were given daily or every other day. 
At higher doses reduced food uptake accompanied by a moderate but continuous 
reduction in body weight was observed and lesions were found in the gastrointestinal tract - findings which are attributed to the action of paclitaxel. With daily treatment, 
lethal toxicity was observed in all dose groups. When dosed at 2- day intervals, 
treatment was tolerated better and only some animals of the higher dose groups died. In the 90- day and 180- day studies, doses up to 1.2 mg/kg BW were applied twice a 
week, resulting in a total of 22 to 27 and 46 applications, respectively. Due to severe 
toxicities including mortality observed in the high dose group, treatment was interrupted and, in part, reduced to one application per week.  
A "no observed adverse effect level" (NOAEL) could not be established in studies covering a treatment period of [ADDRESS_972605] and the testes. Based on acute findings (hemorrhagic pulmonary edema) observed in a number of animals that died prematurely in the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in dogs, the lung represents an additional target organ.

A linear pharmacokinetic relationship was determined for the administered EndoTAG -
[ADDRESS_972607] identical at lower doses (1.1 mg/ kg BW liposomal paclitaxel), whereas at higher doses (5 mg/ kg BW liposomal paclitaxel) Cmax and AUC values of paclitaxel from EndoTAG -[ADDRESS_972608] concentration of paclitaxel was found 
in the liver, but marked concentrations were also observed in kidney, lung, heart, spleen

was almost completed after [ADDRESS_972609], liver, kidneys and spleen s howed a gradual increase of DOT AP levels up to 
6-24 hours. DOTAP was mainly excreted in the urine (78% of dose) and excretion 
occurred rather slowly. After 5 days, 9.2% of the dose was still present in the body. Consequently, accumulation of DOT AP was observed in the plasma of rats and dogs 
when EndoTAG -[ADDRESS_972610] been treated with EndoTAG -
1 during participation in clinical studies.  
Nine clinical studies (phase 1/2) were initiated by [CONTACT_714220] 
(MBT), which originally started the development of EndoTAG -1. Various doses (2.63 
- 66 mg/m
2 liposomal paclitax el), infusion speeds (up to 2.5 m L/min) and schedules 
(daily to weekly, for up to nine weeks) were examined in these studies. In these studies, a total of [ADDRESS_972611] s were treated with EndoTAG -1. EndoTAG -1 was usually given 
as a monotherapy except for one  study in NSCLC (combination with carboplatin) and 
one study in gastrointestinal cancer (combination with 5- FU). 
At MediGene AG, three phase [ADDRESS_972612] been conducted:  
• CT4001, an open- label, randomized, controlled Phase [ADDRESS_972613] s with 
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination therapy of gemcitabine (Gemzar
®) and EndoTAG -1 
at three different dose levels (corresponding to 11, 22 and 44 mg/m2 paclitaxel) 
versus gemcit abine monotherapy. EndoTAG -1 in combination with gemcitabine 
was generally well tolerated, corroborating the favorable safety profile observed in the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_972614] s receiving EndoTAG- 1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to 
gemcitabine alone, both for progression-free and overall survival.

efficacy and safety of treatment with infusions of EndoTAG -1 monotherapy 
(44mg/m² paclitaxel) twice per week or weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m²

paclitaxel monotherapy (90 mg/m² weekly) in [ADDRESS_972615] s with locally relapsed 
and/or me tastatic triple receptor -negative breast cancer (TNBC). Treatment with 
EndoTAG- 1 alone or in combination was well tolerated with manageable adverse 
events. The PFS rate at week 16, the primary efficacy endpoint, was 59.1% on combination therapy, 34.2% on E ndoTAG- 1 and 48.0% on paclitaxel. Exact one -
sided 95% CIs revealed that the hypothesis H0 (PFS rate ≤ 30%) could be rejected 
for the EndoTAG -1/paclitaxel combination group only. For a subgroup of subject s

• CT4003 was an open- label, uncontrolled Phase [ADDRESS_972617] s with a carcinomatous 
primary tumor other than hepatocellular (HCC), biliary or bile duct carcinoma.  
An investigator initiated trial (IJBNeoEndoTAG -1) was conducted at the Institute Jules 
Bordet in Brussels, Belgium. This study was an open- label, uncontrolled, single - center 
trial in [ADDRESS_972618] s with TNBC. The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy 
and safety of neoadjuvant EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m² paclitaxel) in combination with 
standard paclitaxel (70 mg/m²) administered as 12 weekly infusions, followed by [CONTACT_714221] (500mg/m
2), epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] (100mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m2) 
(FEC) administered every 3 weeks for a total of 9 weeks. The safet y results were as 
expected from previous trials. Treatment with EndoTAG -1 plus paclitaxel resulted in 
significant reduction of MRI -estimated tumor volume and linear tumor size compared 
with baseline. Overall, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved in 33% of the subject s. Of the [ADDRESS_972619] s suffering from various solid tumors are available from phase 
1/2 studies. 138 (84.6%) subject s experienced one or more adverse events (AEs),  [ADDRESS_972620] of these events were assessed as being causally related to study medication by [CONTACT_093] (668 of 902, or 74%) and were classified as non-serious (830 of 902, or 92%). The majority of these non- serious adverse drug reactions 
(ADR's) were of transient nature. Only 20 (2.2 %) AEs were assessed as serious and drug- related by [CONTACT_093].  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972621] 4001, AEs were reported in 92% to 100% of subject s in each treatment 
arm. No unexpected toxicities have been observed. During the first treatment cycle, 
severe hematological toxicities (grade 3/4 NCI -CTC) related to any study medication 
occurred in 22, 32 and 40% of subject s in the different GEM+Endo groups (11, 22 and 
44 mg/m2, respectively) compared to 24% on Gem mo notherapy. Combination of 
EndoTAG- 1 and Gem resulted in a dose  dependent increase of grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia reaching up to 16% and 14% in the two higher dose levels, albeit without clinical symptoms or bleeding complications. At the highest EndoTAG -1 dose 
level (44mg/m
2 twice weekly), increased rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia (22%) and 
anemia (12%) were observed. During the first cycle, a total of 7 cases of febrile neutropenia were reported in the two higher GEM+Endo dose levels, including 4 cases of grade 3/4. During additional cycles with GEM+Endo therapy, none was observed. Infusion- related reactions, predominantly pyrexia and chills, were found to a higher 
extent in GEM+Endo groups, whereas the addition of EndoTAG -1 to Gem did not 
increase the known liver toxicity of Gem. In the GEM+Endo44 arm, one case of neuropathy was reported in a subject  with diabetes, but was considered unrelated to 
study medication.  
AEs resulting in discontinuation of study medication were reported in 4 subjects (8%) 
in the GEM +Endo11 and [ADDRESS_972622] s (14%) in each of the GEM+Endo22 and 
GEM+Endo44 group. During the first cycle, [ADDRESS_972623] s (4%) in each of the 
GEM+Endo 11 and GEM+Endo22 group, and [ADDRESS_972624]  (2%) in the GEM+Endo44 
group died, but deaths were considered not related to study medication. During additional cycles, another [ADDRESS_972625] s of the GEM+Endo11 group had SAEs with fatal 
outcome. Both events, Staphylococcal sepsis and death from unknown cause, were considered unlikely to be related to study medication. 
In study CT4002 safety analysis revealed qualitatively and quantitatively the known 
toxicities of EndoTAG -[ADDRESS_972626] paclitaxel. AEs were reported in 91% to 100% 
of subject s in each treatment arm. No unexpected toxicities have been observed. 
EndoTAG- 1 showed a simila r safety profile to paclitaxel. On combination treatment, a 
slight increase in grade 3/[ADDRESS_972627] among subj ects on combination therapy (40%), 
whereas anemia was predominantly observed in the standard paclitaxel study arm (36%). Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities, especially neutropenia and leucopenia, occurred more often in the combination arm (20% and 7%) compared to either agent alone (4% and 2% for  EndoTAG- 1 monotherapy, 7% and 0% for standard paclitaxel, 
respectively) (Awada et al , 2010).  
As was observed in CT4001, infusion- related reactions, predominantly pyrexia and 
chills were fo und to a higher extent in EndoTAG- 1 treatment arms and increased at 
higher doses. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed in 13% of the combination treatment arm compared to 9% and 14% of subject s on EndoTAG -1 monotherapy and 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972628]  (4%) 
of the standard paclitaxel treatment arm.  
In study CT4003 all [ADDRESS_972629] one AE, with a total of 330 AEs 
reported. 33 AEs of grade 3/4 and 21 SAEs were observed and reported from 11 (55%) 
subject s. The most frequent AEs were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue in 
[ADDRESS_972630] s (50 -70%). Hypersensitivity and hyperhidrosis occurred in [ADDRESS_972631] s 
each (40%) and were mostly of mild to moderate severity. Hematological toxicities were observed  in [ADDRESS_972632] s (20%), including 3 events of anemia and 1 event each of 
neutropenia and leucopenia (both of grade 3 severity). Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported for 3 subjects (15%). No AE with a severity of grade 4 was reported. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic properties of EndoTAG -1 were determined in three phase 1/2 
dose escalation studies ( CTLP01 , CTLP05 and CTLP06) exploring several dose levels 
(2.63- 66 mg/m2 paclitaxel) and application regimen (2 -5 times per week) and in study 
CT4003. 
Results of studies CTLP01, CTLP05 and CTLP06 revealed that the maximum plasma 
concentrations and extents of  exposure of paclitaxel and DOT AP, administered as 
EndoTAG-1, increased with the dose. Data were too limited to assess whether the 
increase is proportional. The clearance of paclitaxel and DOTAP remained constant with increasing doses, with higher clearance levels observed  for paclitaxel compared to 
DOT AP. There was no indication for paclitaxel accumulation in plasma at any dose 
level or application regimen studied. Although DOTAP is cleared from the plasma slowly, there was also no evidence for accumulation of DOTAP. 
In study CT4003 reliable PK -profiles were obtained for paclitaxel and DOTAP after 
single dose and in steady state following intravenous infusion of  EndoTAG -1 (22 
mg/m
2 twice weekly for 25 days). The pharmacokinetic parameters observed for 
paclitaxel and DOTAP confirmed previous results with 22 mg/m2 EndoTAG- 1 from 
early clinical trials (CTLP05, CTLP06). The mean maximum plasma concentration of 
paclitaxel was comparable after single dose and in steady state. The extent of exposure showed a small increase from the first to the last dose. The mean maxim um plasma 
concentration of DOT AP increased from the first to the last dose and the extent of 
exposure increased more pronounced compared to paclitaxel. Distribution and elimination kinetics of EndoT AG-[ADDRESS_972633] to the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and DOT AP (Fasol et

Efficacy 
In their phase 1/2 studies, Munich Biotech AG included patients with hormone -
refra ctory prostate cancer (CTLP 01), unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
gastrointestinal (CTLP 05) or colorectal cancer (CTLP10) and metastatic breast cancer 
(CTLP09) applying doses between 2.63 and 66 mg/m2 liposomal paclitaxel in various 
regimen of up to [ADDRESS_972634] s were evaluated for overall tumor response 
only, survival data were not collected. Complete responses were not reported. Partial 
responses were observed in 3 (8%, CTLP09) and 1 (3%, CTLP 010) subject s, stable 
disease was seen in 13 (36%, CTLP09), 3 (8%, CTLP 010) and 4 (14%, CTLP05) of the 
subject s. Accordingly the clinical benefit rate was 44% and 11% in CTLP09 and 
CTLP10 , respectively. The effect on tumor stabilization was most distinct in subject s 
with metastatic breast cance r (CTLP09) with a dose -dependent effect on the rate of 
subject s with non- progressive disease (33% at 22 mg/m2, 56% at 44 mg/m2). In study 
CTLP01 , PSA levels remained stable in the majority of subject s during treatment, but 
increased during the follow -up period. 1/12 (8.33%) of subject s showed stable disease 
(reduction of PSA levels > 50%) after [ADDRESS_972635] numbers were small and studies were conducted without 
comparator(s). Phase II studies of MediGene AG were conducted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (CT4001), triple receptor -negative breast cancer (CT4002) 
and hepatic metastases from a carcino matous primary tumor (CT4003). 
In study CT4001, 3 different dose levels of EndoTAG -1 (11, 22 and 44 mg/m

liposomal paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine (GEM+Endo) were compared to gemcitabine monotherapy (GEM) in [ADDRESS_972636] s ([ADDRESS_972637] s in each s tudy arm) 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. At the time of analysis [ADDRESS_972638] died. Median overall survival was 7.2 months on 
GEM monotherapy compared to 8.4, 8.7 and 9.4 months in the GEM+Endo cohorts (11, 22 and 44 mg/m

PFS was 4.[ADDRESS_972643] line therapy revealed an overall 
survival of 17.8 months on combination of EndoTAG-1 and paclitaxel versus 12.5 and 10.1 months on EndoTAG-1 and paclitaxel monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], respectively. However, the study was not powered for intergroup comparisons. 
Study CT4003 was conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m

liposomal paclitaxel, twice a week) and its effect on blood supply and angiogenesis of 
hepatic metastases in [ADDRESS_972644] of EndoTAG -1 on target liver metastases perfusion assessed by [CONTACT_714222], inflow coefficients showed a great intra -individual variability and

trans, iAUC60, 
iAUC90 and iAUC 120, supporting the hypothesis of a vascular targeting mode of 
action of EndoTAG- 1 (Fasol et al , 2011). 
In conclusion, EndoT AG-[ADDRESS_972645] when EndoTAG -1 was administered in combination 
with other chemotherapeutics. Notably, both in pancreatic cancer  and advanced TNBC ,

3.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized controlled, open label, adaptive phase  3 study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of a combination regimen of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -
1 (Lipid Complexed Paclitaxel)  with weekly administration of gemcitabine compared 
with gemcitabine monotherapy in subjects with measurable locally advanced and/or 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are eligible for second -line therapy 
after failing first- line therapy with FOLFIRINOX.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms: 
 Arm A:  Treatment with EndoTAG -1 22 mg/m2 twice weekly plus gemcitabine 
1000mg/m² once weekly, for 1 cycle (8 weeks) consisting of [ADDRESS_972648] until any one of the following 
occurs:  progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  Subjects will be eligible for continuing treatment beyond first cycle in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subsequent Treatment Cycles (8 weeks/cycle) will be administered as [ADDRESS_972649]. 
 Arm B:  Treatment with gemcitabine 1000  mg/m² once weekly, for 1 cycle (8 weeks)  
consisting of [ADDRESS_972650] until any one of the following occurs:  progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent . Subjects will be eligible for 
continuing treatment beyond in absence of disease progression of unacceptable 
toxicity. Subsequent Treatment Cycles  (8 weeks/cycle) will be administered as [ADDRESS_972651]. 
The randomization will be stratified by  
• Subjects with locally advanced vs metastatic pancreatic cancer  
• Subjects with ECOG performance status [ADDRESS_972652] (version 1.1; Eisenhauer et al . 2009) will be 
evaluated on a scheduled basis every 8 weeks (±3 days) from randomization (regardless 
of the timing  of treatment cycles) until disease progression is documented or until the 
cut-off date of the study, whichever comes earlier. Subjects will be monitored regularly 
for safety parameters  and quality of life (EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC PAN-26).  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 51 of 125 After completin g treatment, subjects who are not diagnosed with progressive disease 
(PD) will attend up to 6 Follow -up Visits every 8 weeks for 48 weeks, following which 
subjects will be followed -up by [CONTACT_119570] 8 weeks for survival. Subjects who 
experienced PD dur ing Treatment Phase will undergo only one safety follow -up visit 
(4-8 weeks after the EO T visit), and then enter phone follow -up directly. Follow -up 
visits will be performed for the evaluation of survival status, safety parameters, QoL 
(EORTC QLQ -C30 and E ORTC PAN-26) and administration of other anti -tumor 
treatment until death or end of the study, whichever comes first. 
Anti-tumor therapy after termination of study treatment will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  A single, pre -planned Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_972653] died (60% of the expected 167 events). The cut -off date for the final  analysis will be [ADDRESS_972654] (DSMB ), composed of independent 
representatives, will be in charge of reviewing the accrual, baseline, and safety data at 
periodic intervals. Representatives of the Sponsor will serve only as coordinating members of the committee, without having full member responsibilities or privileges.

The study is divided into three phases: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.  
• Screening Phase (Screening to Baseline):  Up to 14 days 
• Treat ment Phase:   
o First Treatment Cycle:  
 T reatment Group A : 8 weeks or potentially longer in the event of 
postponements ( a total of 6  weekly infusions of gemcitabine and 12 twice 
weekly infusions of EndoTAG- 1). 
 Treatment Group B : 8  weeks or potentially longer in the event of 
postponements ( a total of 6  weekly infusions of gemcitabine).  
o S ubsequent Treatment Cycles: Subjects will be eligible for continuing treatment 
with [ADDRESS_972663] until any one of the following occurs : progressive disease or 
unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  
• Follow- Up Phase:  Follow -up visits will be performed every [ADDRESS_972664] (or Legally Acceptable R epresentative (LAR)) will sign and date the 
informed consent form ( ICF) and Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 
(HIPAA ) authori zation (according to site policy and practices) prior to any study -
related procedures. A unique identification number (screening number) will be assigned 
to each subject who has provided written informed consent. The subject screening 
number will incorpora te a two-digit region code (01, 02 or 03...), a three -digit Study 
Center number (001, 002 or 003….) and a three- digit numeric ID assigned in successive 
order of entering the study after signing the ICF at each center, beginning with 001 at 
each site (e.g. 01-001-001).  
 
Subject Screening 
#: XX - YYY  - ZZZ  
 XX=Region   YYY=Study Center   ZZZ=Subject Numeric ID  
All study centers will be instructed to maintain the study -specific pre -screening, 
screening and enrollment logs at their sites. If a subject initially fails to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and is later reconsidered for participation, the subject will be re-consented and assigned a new screening  number at the time of re -screening.  
Subjects who fail their first screening attempt may be re -screened a maximum of once 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972665] answer all questions by [CONTACT_714223]/her be st knowledge and must give the patient ample time to consider 
his/her participation. If – after that - the patient wishes to participate in this trial, he/she 
must first give written informed  consent. Only then may the investigator proceed with 
the screening procedure.  
The following evaluations and examinations have to be done within 14 days prior to  
randomization, if not stated otherwise: 
• Signed informed consent 
• Eligibility criteria  
• Demographic data, including date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin

acceptable.  
• Evaluation of detected lesions according to RECI ST (version 1.1; Eisenhauer 
et al. 2009)   
• Electrocardiogram  
• Quality of Life Questionnaires  
All screening information will be fully documented in the subject’s medical records 
(i.e., source documents). If the patient fulfil s all of the inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria the patient may be randomized.  
• F or consented subjects who do not meet  eligibility criteria , a Screen Failure 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) will be completed.  The Screen Failure 
eCRF will contain the following details : the subject identification number, the

LipoPac and MBT -[ADDRESS_972692] (IP) is a powder for solution for infusion that appears as a 
white caked powder. It is reconstituted with water for injection prior to application . The 
resulting solution consists of small liposomal vesicles with an intensity weighted 
average particle size <300 nm.  
The aqueous phase is a solution of trehalose and citric acid as stabilizer. Trehalose is a natural, non- reducing disaccharide at about i so-osmolal concentration (284 mosmol, 98 
mg/mL), which needs to be taken into consideration when treating diabetic patients (insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM). Citric acid is used at a concentration of 
60 µM in solution in order to maintain a low pH and therefore to increase the chemical 
stability of the API [INVESTIGATOR_714208]. The IP contains less than 0.5% (w/w) ethanol and has a pH of 3 to 5.

6.4 EndoTAG -1: Dose Justification 
Preclinical safety data obtained so far justify multiple administrations of EndoTAG -1 
up to a dose of 44 mg/m2 lipid complexed paclitaxel to patients. EndoTAG -1 has been 
investigated in several clinical studies and a favorable safety profile without major 
safety concerns at a dose of 44 mg/m2 lipid complexed paclitaxel has been assessed. 
Because of this and because of the complementary anti -neovascular mode of action of 
EndoTAG- 1, it is expected that there is no interference in  respect to safety and 
tolerability between EndoTAG-1 and gemcitabine.

hours when stored at 25°C ± 2°C.  
Prior to application, EndoTAG-[ADDRESS_972697] undisturbed at 2- 8°C to allow complete reconstitution. 
The required application volume is calculated from the subject 's body weight and the 
dose schedule. A sufficient number of reconstituted vials have to be prepared to cover 
the application volume. For large application volumes, the preparation is split into 
portions, which can be used one after the other and stored at 2- 8°C until needed. The 
maximum volume for  one portion should not exceed [ADDRESS_972698] not exceed 90 mL /hour = 1.5 mL/min and at the 
beginning of intravenous infusion the  rate should be accelerat ed slowly from 0.5 
mL/min to 1.5 mL/min over a period of [ADDRESS_972699] s (if not already present) to facilitate 
administration of  study medication.  
The investigator or pharmacist must maintain accurate records of the receipt of all  
investigational medicinal product provided by [CONTACT_456], including date recei ved, 
batch  number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], subject  number, amount received and disposition 
(dispensation date, amount of investigational medicinal product dispensed and subject  
identification  number). 
All remaining unused investigational medicinal product has to be returned to the supplier after study termination or destroyed at the site's pharmacy after the written 
permission of the  sponsor according to standard operating procedures. Destruction of

will be reimbursed by  [CONTACT_456]. 
For reconstitution of the lyophilized gemcitabine please follow these instructions: 
• Calculate the amount of gemcitabine needed for administration of 1000 mg/m2. 
• To reconstitute, add 25 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to each required 1 g 
vial or 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to each required 200 mg vial. 
• Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each yield a gemcitabine concentration of 38 
mg/ml. The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 ml or 26.3 m l, 
respectively.  
• Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine,  
respectively.  
• Check that the solution is free from visible particles and that it is clear and colorless 
to light straw -colored.  
• Transfer the appropriate amount of reconstituted gemcitabine to an infusion bag. The drug may be administered as prepared or further diluted with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection to concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/ml. 
• Administer the gemcitabine solution as an intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes.  
• Chemical and physical in -use stability of gemcitabine solution has been 
demonstrated  for 24 hours at 30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the 
product should be  used immediately. If not used immediately, in -use storage times 
and conditions prior  to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not 
be longer than [ADDRESS_972701] infusion (Arm A: Visit 1, Arm B: Visit 1 G), the subject  has to 
receive 100% of the trial medication (A rm A: EndoTAG -1 and gemci tabine ; Arm B: 
gemcitabine).  If, for any reason it is clear that the subject  will not be able to receive the 
full dose of trial  medication at the first infusion, the treatment should not be initiated 
and the subject  should be immediately withdrawn from the  study.  
Important: For the purpose of dose adjustments due to clinical chemistry results

values are: A ST, AL T and creatinine. The remainder of clinical chemistry will be 
assessed for safety issues, but not considered for the decision of dose adjustment.  
In case of hematological, non- hematological and special hematological toxicities, 
treatment  might be reduced or postponed (during continuation of treatment: reduced or 
omitted) as  specified in the following. In case of postponement, all examinations of the 
respective visit  will be repeated one week later and study medication will be 
administered  according to the specifications given in  Section 6.7.1 and 6.7.2.

Concomitant radiotherapy 
Concomitant radiotherapy (given together or ≤7 days apart): Toxicity associated with 
this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine, frequency of gemcitabine administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. Details and recommendations 
for use can refer to SPC of gemcitabine. 
 Live vaccinations  
Yellow fever vaccine and other live attenuated vaccines are not recommended in 
patients treated with gemcitabine due to the risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease, 
particularly in immunosuppressed patients. 
 Fertility  
Men being treated with gemcitabine are advised not to father a child during and up to  
[ADDRESS_972705] received any chemotherapeutical treatment ( except 
FOLFIRINOX  as the first -line therapy) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma prior to

7.7 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed to include a review of all systems. 
Each body system will be classified as being either normal or abnormal, with abnormalities for each body system noted. Subsequent physical examinations will identify chan ges from the baseline examination with both positive and negative changes 
being noted.  
The complete physical examination will include routine examinations for the following:  
• General Appearance  
• Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat (HEENT) 
• Lymph Nodes 
• Heart/ Cardiovascular abnormalities  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  
• Abdomen 
• Genitourinary 
• Musculoskeletal and Extremities   
• Neurologic abnormalities  Dermatologic abnormalities  
• Any other body system for which an abnormality is noted and which, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is relevant to the safety of the subject or could impact safety or efficacy results for the subject; i.e., the abnormality is clinically significant (CS).  
7.8 BSA Calculation 
BSA will be calculated on dosing days, using the formula (Mosteller, 1987) below: 
BSA (m
2) = [Height (cm) x Body Weight (kg)/3600]½ 
The total dose (mg) will be calculated as:  
Total Dose 1/Dose 2 (mg/m2) x BSA  (m2) 
7.9 Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including  
• Height (cm) (only performed at screening ) 
• Weight (kg) at each visit before a study treatment infusion 
• Blood pressure (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]),  
• Heart rate, and  
• Body temperature (oral,  axillary, tympanic or rectal)

al. 2009) . At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable 
Tumor lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is  to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than  5mm).  
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measur ed with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X- ray. 
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and me asurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15mm in  short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow- up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  < 10mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15mm  short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. 
Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by  [CONTACT_714229].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Special considerations regarding lesion measurability 
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particula r comment: 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 84 of 125 Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_87416]. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferre d 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated  progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable. 
7.14.[ADDRESS_972714] to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at screening, at end of treatment and during follow-up. 
Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). 
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of 5 mm or less 
in slice thickness, if possible [minimum measurable lesion size: long axis  ≥ 10 mm (CT 
+ MRI) and 2 x slice thickness, if the slice thickness is > 5 mm].  
Ultrasound may only be used as a possible alternative to clinical measurements for superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.

 Confidential   Page 85 of 125 7.14.3 Baseline docum entation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
Only subjects with measurable disease at baseline should be enrolled in this study. For 
evaluation of tumor response, lesions present at screening will be separated into target and non-target lesions according to the following criteria:  
Target Lesions : 
• A maximum of five (5) target lesions in total (up to two (2) per organ)  
• Select largest reproducibly measurable lesions. If the largest lesion cannot be measured reproducibly, select the next largest lesion which can be measured   
• Add up longest diameters (LD) of non- nodal lesions (axial plane) and short axis 
diameters of nodes. This is the “sum of the longest diameters” (SLD) 
Non-Target Lesions  
• All other lesions present at screening. Measurements of these lesions  are not 
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -
up. 
• It is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a 
single item on the eCRF (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”)  
7.14.4 Evaluation of target lesions 
• Measure LD (axial plane) for each target lesion  
• Measure short axis for target lymph nodes  
• Add these measurements to get the SLD  
• If too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm is assigned. If the lesion disappears 
completely, the measurement is recorded as 0 mm.  
• Splitting or coalescent lesions  
o If a target lesion fragments into multiple smaller lesions, the LDs of all 
fragmented p ortions are added to the sum  
o If target lesions coalesce, the LD of the resulting coalescent lesion is added to the sum

are the extent of disease (subjects with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status (ECOG performance status 0 and 1). Within each stratum, subjects will be allocated with equal probability to either treatment in Arm A or treatment in Arm B and the randomization system will be set up in such a way that there is a 1:1 balance between the treatment groups from the different strata.

  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 89 of 125 8 Adverse Events  Definitions and Repor ting 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting 
the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when there is a safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be  responsible 
for detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this Section of the protocol.  
8.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject  administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of an IP, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (definition per ICH E2A and E6 R1). 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, 
must be recorded using medical termi nology on the AE eCRF page. Whenever possible, 
diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions. 
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormality in 
physical examination findings or laboratory res ults that the investigator believes is 
clinically significant to the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study treatment will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as a n AE.  
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to both determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see Section on SAEs) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be 
obtained by [CONTACT_357785]. 
Interventions for pre -treatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrolment are not considered AE. Laboratory results, which are out of range at the screening assessment (up to 14 days 
prior to randomization) do not fulfill the definition of an AE since these results 
represent the baseline inf ormation. 
Progression of the disease under investigation as well as an increase in CA19- 9 values 
will not be regarded as adverse event during the course of this trial. Death due to disease  
progression has to be reported to the sponsor via the "Death due to Disease Progression"  
form.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972716] the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, study 
treatment interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. The “not applicable” assessment will be us ed only when the subject is no longer in the treatment 
phase of the protocol or died. 
8.1.2 Intensity Assessment  
The severity of the AE will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) Grading Scale Version 4.03 (Publish Date: June 14, 2010, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html).  
The maximum severity (intensity) of the AE will be categorized by [CONTACT_73951]: 
Table 8-1:  CTCAE v4.03 General Guidelines 
Grade  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL†.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.‡  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
†Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
‡Unlike the AE outcome assessmen t (see section 8.1.5 ), a su bject  may have more than one Grade 5 event. 
 
-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.03: June 14, 2010 
For AEs not covered b y NCI CTCAE, the  seve rity will be cha racterized as “mild,” 
“mode rate,” or “seve re” a ccordin g to the foll owing  definitions: 
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities  
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject  
and may interfere with daily activities  
• Severe events interrupt the subject ’s usual daily activities.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the 
maximum intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separat ely (with distinct 
onset dates). All AEs, due to any cause that occurs during the investigation, whether or not related to the study drug, should be reported to the Safety Coordinator. 
  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 91 of 125 8.1.3 Causality Assessment  
The investigator will assign a relationship to the study drug (i.e. causality) for all AEs 
that occur during the study using the definitions below:  
• Unrelated:  The AE is clearly related to other causes such as participant’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]. 
• Unlikely to be related:  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study drug administration; could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_714230]’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]; does not follow a known response pattern to the study drug.  
• Possibly related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_714231] a s the participant’s clinical state, 
environmental factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Probably related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
drug administration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; cannot be reaso nably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, 
environmental factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]; improvement upon cessation of test drug.  
• Definitely related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
drug a dministration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]; improvement upon cessation of test drug or reappears upon repeat exposure (if rechallenge occurs).  
8.1.[ADDRESS_972717] in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, non- drug therapy administered, surgery performed, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
other (with a specification).  
8.1.5 Outcome Assessment  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death. Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are multiple causes of death for a given subject, only the primary 
cause of death will have an outcome of death. 
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs occurring during the study (from the time of the first study treatment until 
[ADDRESS_972718] dose of study t reatment) observed by [CONTACT_714232] (whether or not attributed to study drug), will be reported on the e CRF. 
Clinically significant AEs considered related or non- related to the IP by [CONTACT_714233]: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972719] be provided:  description; dates of onset and resolution; 
severity; assessment of relatedness to IP;  whether treatment was given as a result of the 
event  and the outcome of the event. The investigator may be asked to provide follow -
up information. 
All AEs, serious or not, that result in the subject ’s permanent withdrawal of IP or from 
the study will be discussed between the investigator and medical monitor. The e CRF  
for EOT /Early Withdrawal Visit should be completed including reason of withdrawal. 
It will be the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the subject ’s removal from study treatment. A subject may also 
voluntarily withdraw from study treatment due to what he or she perceives as an 
intolerable AE. If either of these occurs, the subject  must undergo EOT assessment and 
be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition be comes stable.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A and 
E6 R1):  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
This means that the subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered 
SAEs if the y are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining a SAE. 
Since SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems, 
it is important to take into a ccount both the Investigator’s and the sponsor’s assessment. 
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor or sponsor designee immediately after the 
Investigator becomes aware of the event, along with a determination as to whether it is associated with the IP or any other study procedure. 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE or SAE term; instead, signs and 
symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression will be reported if they fulfil l the SAE definition.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972720] be reported within 24 hours of t he 
Investigator knowledge of the event to Covance Patient Safety Services  within 24 hours.

Fax:          + [PHONE_14070] 
Phone:     +61 -2-88792000 (SAE hotline) 
A written SAE reports must include a full description of the event as described in 
Section  8.[ADDRESS_972721] additional supporting documentation as 
it becomes available, such as lab reports, electrocardiogram [ECG] reports, discharge summary, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], etc, if applicable.  
Relevant medical records should be provided to the Sponsor or CRO as soon as  they 
become available; autopsy reports should be provided for deaths if available. Should an 
Investigator be made aware of an SAE occurring any time after the reporting period, it must be promptly reported.  
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for maintaining documentation in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject 's participation in the study, must be followed until any of 
the following occurs:  
• The event resolves.   
• The event stabilizes.  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available.  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the IP or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct.  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained ( subject  or 
health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up 
after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_972722] be closely 
followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further improvement expected, or death).  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972723] completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow -
up report with updated information. 
8.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactio ns (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event or adverse experience for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the adverse event. Inherent in this definition, and in the requirement to report them, is the need for the sponsor to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the likelihood that the drug actually caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.  
Unexpected  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity tha t has 
been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepati c 
necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
8.7 Expedited Reporting of S[LOCATION_003]R  
Sponsor (or designee) will provide written notification to the regulatory agencies i.e. FDA and all participating investigators of any suspected adver se reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected. Each notification should be submitted as specified below, depending on the type of event. Each written notification may be submitted on FDA form 3500A and/or CIOMS- I. 
• 7-Day Expedited Report: any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
that is fatal or life -threatening will be reported as soon as possible and no later than 
7 calendar days after the sponsor’s (or designee’s) initial receipt of the information. 
• 15-Day Expedited Report: any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
that is not fatal or life -threatening will be reported as soon as possible and no later 
than 15 calendar days after the sponsor (or designee) determines that the event qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32). 
8.8 Pregnancies  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; [ADDRESS_972724] be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the 
Investigator knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy form.  
For IP, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if:  
• A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed (e.g., environmental exposure) to the IP, or the female becomes, 
or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to the IP (m aternal exposure) for [ADDRESS_972725] dose of or exposure to IP.  
• A male partner of a pregnant female has been exposed to the IP, either due to 
treatment or environmental exposure, within 3 months prior to the time of 
conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure).  
If any study subject  or study subject ’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during 
the study subject ’s treatment with the IP or exposure as defined above, the Investigator 
must submit this information on a Pregnancy form to the Sponsor (or its designated representative). In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to an IP in a pregnant woman (e.g., a subject  reports that she 
is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Pregnancy form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see following information related to induced termination of pregnancy). 
Follow- up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all exposure  
during pregnancy reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator will follow the 
pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (e.g., induced abortion) and then notify the Sponsor or its designated representative of the outcome as a follow -up 
to the initial Pregnancy form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the st ructural integrity of 
the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure 
test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
SAE (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the In vestigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting SAEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_972726] to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be

exposure to IP.  
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by [CONTACT_737]. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and 
any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required.

EORTC QLQ- C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, 
and social), global health status (GHS), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, 
nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most  questions used 4- point scale 
(1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7- point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 
'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0- 100 scale; higher score=better 
level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms. Change from baseline=Cycle/Day score minus baseline score.

to 4='very much' and subsequently transformed into scales that range from 0-100; 
higher scores= greater degree of symptoms or treatment side effects and emotional issues.  
 
9.3 Sample Size Determination and Rationale  
A total of 218 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A 
(EndoTAG-1 plus gemcitabine) and Arm B (gemcitabine monotherapy).  
The sample size is event -driven to collect a pre -specified number of primary efficacy 
outcomes. Based on the sample size calculation, the primary endpoint analysis for 
overall survival will require 16 7 events (deaths)  from the 196 subjects . The primary 
endpoint analysis for progression- free survival will  require 169 events (disease 
progression) from [ADDRESS_972728] a 40% reduction  
of overall survival  in the risk of death in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 
0.60) using a 2- sided log- rank test with 90% powe r and an overall significance level of 
0.[ADDRESS_972729] a 35% reduction o f 
progression free survival in the risk of disease progression in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.647) using a 2- sided  log- rank test with more than 80% power 
and an overall significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_972730]. Sample size estimation  for 
overall survival is depi[INVESTIGATOR_90850] 9-1, total sample size requirement vs. the median 
survival time (month) in the treatment arm. Sample size is estimated using PASS (15) sample size software.  
Sample size estimation for progression- free survival is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 9-2, total 
sample size requirement vs. the median survival time (month) in the treatment arm. Sample size is estimated using PASS (1 5) sample size software.  
It is anticipated that there would be about 10% dropout in this study, to accommodate 
for the dropouts a total of [ADDRESS_972731] ratio for death of 0.60 w ith median overall 
survival of 4.4 months for gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et al. 2011) and 7.3 
months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the 
sample size calculation.  The progression- free survival assumption for t he sample size 
are based on hazard ratio of 0.647 with median progression- free survival of 3.3 months 
for gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et al. 2011) and 5.1 months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the sample size calculation.

9.4 Randomization and Stratification  

  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 101 of 125 This study will be conducted at approximate ly up to 100 sites. A total of 218 subjects 
are planned to be enrolled. All eligible subjects will be centrally randomized to receive 
either Arm A (EndoTAG -1 and gemcitabine) or Arm B (gemcitabine alone) in a 1:1 
ratio using a stratified block randomization scheme. The stratification variables are the extent of disease (subjects with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status (ECOG performance status 0 and 1). Within each stratum, subjects will be allocated with equal probability to  either treatment in Arm A or 
treatment in Arm B and the randomization system will be set up in such a way that there is a 1:[ADDRESS_972732] knowledge of the treatment assignments after randomization and throughout the study. To avoid any susceptible selection bias, a stratified block randomization scheme with a mixed block size will  be 
used and the blocks will be blinded until trial closure to all research personnel except the block generating statistician. The master randomization lists containing the treatment assignments will not be released to any study personnel prior to final d atabase 
lock except for the DSMB meetings and at the time of the interim analysis.  
 
9.6 Interim Analysis  
A single, pre -planned Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_972733] died (60% of the expected 167 events  for the overall survival primary 
endpoint ). 
The procedures for this IA will be based on a standard operating procedure (SOP) that 
has a well -established a firewall to protect the integrity of the trial. The IA will be 
performed by [CONTACT_55467], who is not ot herwise associated with the 
conduct of this trial. Details of the firewall will be outlined in the SOP.  
The results of the IA will be reviewed by [CONTACT_379928]  (DSM B) who would assess the data for both safety (for the purp oses of 
continuing the trial) and efficacy  (for the purposes of sample size re -estimation) . The 
DSM B responsibilities will be further elaborated in the DSM B charter.  The DSM B will 
approve continuation of the study and recommend the sample size for remainde r of the 
study.  
Goals:   
The objectives of this interim analysis are: 
• To evaluate the safety and efficacy of EndoT AG-1 plus gemcitabine in 
prolonging Overall Survival  (OS) and Progression Free Survival  (PFS) of 
subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas eligible for second- line therapy after failing first- line therapy with

to ma intain study power. 
9.6.1 Metrics to be Calculated for the Interim Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Data for Safety Review  
At the time of the interim safety data review, all the data to be used along with the 
treatment assignment of each randomized subject will be given to the independent statistician. Using this data, the independent statistician will prepare descriptive summary and by [CONTACT_714234], adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory findings, physical examinations, vital 
signs, and ECG.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Data for Efficacy Interim Analysis based on Overall Survival  (OS) and 
Progression Free Survival  (PFS) 
At the time of Interim Analysis, all the data to be used in the interim analysis along 
with the treatment assignment of each randomized subject will be given to the independent statistician. Using this data, the independent statistician will calculate the following metrics in addition to all the safety data that is to be prepared for the safety review:  
1. 
For the calculation of the conditional power: 
a. Proportion of subjects randomized to each Arm at the time of interim analysis  
b. The test statistic computed from the observed data using Cox proportional hazards 
model outlined in the Primary Efficacy Analysis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
c. The number of events at the time of the interim analysis  
2. For the re -estimation of the sample size, if necessary per Section 9.6.2:  
a. The median overall  survival (OS) and  median  progression free  survival ( PFS) in Arm 
A and the observed number of subjects in the group, calculated using the Kaplan- Meier 
method, in months 
b. The median overall survival (OS) and  median progression free   (PFS) in Arm B and 
the observed number of subjects in the group, calculated using the Kaplan- Meier 
method, in months 
3. The Conditional Power (CP) of the trial at the time of the IA based on items 1a. – 1c. and 
the formula provided below  for both OS and PFS. 
 
Conditional Power (CP) using Differences in Overall  S urvival and  Progression 
Free  Survival 
The CP will be calculated  for each primary endpoint (i.e., OS and PFS)  according to 
the formula [Jenninson and Turnbull (2000) pages 205 to 208] per the metrics 
  Protocol No: CT 4006

Where 
𝜃𝜃 =the observed treatment effect at t he time of the interim analysis  [log (HR)  
using OS and PFS data at the time of the IA ] and: 
k=an interim stage at which the conditional power is computed  
K=the stage at which the study is terminated and the final test is computed  
Zk=the logrank test statistic calculated from the observed data that has been 
collected up to stage k, [ 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘�𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘�⁄ ], where S k is the logrank score statistic 
computed from the obser ved data]  
Ik=the information level at stage k; Ik= [Ek*Pc*(1-Pc); where E k is the number of 
events at stage k and P c is the proportion of subjects assigned to the control 
group (Arm B)]  
IK=the information level at the end of the study; IK= [E*P c*(1-Pc); where E is 
the total number of events and P c is the proportion of subjects assigned to the 
control group (Arm B)] Z
1-α=the standard normal value for the test with at type I error rate of α  
The resulting Conditional Power (CP) from the two primary endpoints will be used to 
determine whether the sample size needs to be increased or remains unchanged.  
9.6.2 Rules and Methods for Decisions at the Time of the IA  
The re -estimation of the sample size plan will be performed while preserving alpha 
according to Mehta and  Pocock (2010).  
The sample size for the study will be adjusted only if the Interim Analysis CP  for at 
least one of the primary endpoints OS or PFS is  less than 90%  and greater than 35%  
(i.e., if CP for at least one of the primary endpoints is  in the promi sing zone) . In the 
event that both the CP from OS and PFS are in the promising zone, the lower CP will 
be used for adjustment of the sample size. The adjustment would be an increase in the 
target number of events (i.e., deaths  or PD ) needed in the study in order to bring the CP 
to at least 90% up to a maximum increase of 4 36 subjects (218 per group), using the 
observed effect size at the time of the interim analysis.  
If and only if the interim analysis CP is less than 90% and greater than 35% then the sample size will be re -estimated up to 436 subjects by [CONTACT_714235] 3.2. The sample size calculations will be performed under the same assumptions as the initial sample size calculations with the exception of inserting

PFS and median progression f ree survival in the treatment and control groups at the 
time of IA.       
The DSMB will make recommendations to sponsor on the continuation/modification/ 
termination and relevant comments based on the interim results.  
 
9.6.3 Rule and Method for Protection of Type I Error Rate  
Per the Mehta and Pocock (2010) paper, if one increases the sample size only when 
interim results are promising, a conventional hypothesis test can be performed without 
inflating the type -1 error.  By [CONTACT_714236] (2010), if 
the conditional power at the interim analysis is greater than 35%, performing an unblinded IA and sample size re -estimation will not have an effect on alpha and the 
overall type I error at the end of the study will be preserved. The cutoff value of 33 % 
chosen based on the guidance from Mehta and Pocock (2010) with a maximum allowed re-estimation of two times the original sample size, an interim look when 60% of 
expected events occur, and a targeted conditional power of 90%.

11.1 Monitoring Requirements  
In an effort to fulfil the obligations outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
Part 312 and ICH guidelines which requires the Sponsor to maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of a study, the Sponsor's designated  monitor will visit the 
center(s) during the study as well as maintain frequent telephone and written communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to  ensure that 
data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
The Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or designated CRO to inspect all e CRFs and corresponding study subject original medical records (source 
documents) at regular intervals throughout the study. Subject original medical records and other relevant data must be available to support all data recorded in the e CRF. In 
addition to the original medical records, these da ta may include but are not limited to, 
study, laboratory and diagnostic reports, quality of life questionnaire, etc.  
Site inspections serve to verify strict adherence to the protocol and the accuracy of the 
data being entered on the case report forms, in accordance with federal regulations. A Monitoring Log will be maintained at each study site which the monitor will sign, date and state the type of visit.  
The Investigator should be aware that the study site and subject records may be 
inspected by [CONTACT_424166], FDA or other regional regulatory authority. 
For the IA, a cut -off date for data collection and monitoring will be determined and 
sites will be requested to provide current information up to the cut- off dat e. 
11.2 Acceptability of electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs)  
eCRFs must be completed for each subject who has signed an informed consent form. 
For subjects who are screen failures, this would be limited to the screen failure e CRF 
page. All source documents and eCRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the 
subject's visit. Corrections to data on the e CRFs will be documented. The Investigator 
will review e CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete and 
accurate. e CRFs will be reviewed b y the Sponsor’s or designated CRO’s monitor, who 
will make a decision as to their acceptability.

be managed  in conformance with the  FDA  guidelines for DSMB independence, 
management, and oversight. 
The D SMB will monitor the safety of the trial from the beginning and at 
approximately six month intervals based on enrolment thereafter.  
The D SMB will consist of three members and will review all unexpected AEs, all 
related AEs, all SAEs, and all deaths during the Treatment and Follow -Up Phases. 
All expedited safety reports will be provided in real time to the D SMB chair upon 
being reported to FDA. At each meeting, the D SMB will be authorized to unblind the 
study upon unanimous vote in the event of any concerns about safety or lack of 
efficacy. Unblinded CRO personnel, separate and independent of the blinded CRO personnel, will supply the D SMB with all necessary tables and listings to perform 
their independent review. The Sponsor will be invited to attend open sessions where data remain blinded, but will not attend closed sessions where data are discussed in more detail with potential unblinding. The  DSMB will make the following 
recommendations at each safety evaluation:  
 Continue the study as planned; 
 Assess a specific aspect  of safety  that is not conclusive; 
 Gather  more  data to address a specific safety  issue; and 
 Stop the study due to safety  concern s.

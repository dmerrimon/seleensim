Sound Quality Comparisons with Different Hearing Aid Couplings and Venting Systems  
 
[ADDRESS_965468] to manipulate 
coupling to adapt to patient's complaints. For example, more occluded coupling allows for less 
direct sound, al -lowing for a heavier balance of the HI's DSP algorithms relative to the 
environment. However, this occlusion often comes with client com -plaints of an unsatisfactory 
perception of their own voice. When the ear canal is occluded, it el iminates the ability for sound 
to transfer out of the ear canal, altering the ear canal acoustics and creating a change in 
perception of the user's own voice. This change in perception is often described as the user's 
voice being too loud, "boomy", or "hol low" (Winkler et al. 2016). Commonly, this becomes a 
process of trial and error for HCPs. A dynamic vent  offers a potential solution for these 
situations. The mechanical operation of a dynamic ve nt allows for an occluded coupling in 
situations such as medi a streaming, but allows for an open coupling in situations where a more 
open coupling will suffice. The dynamic nature of a dynamic vent  allows for the ear canal 
acoustics to adapt to the environment. For example, when streaming media, a closed position 
does not allow low frequencies to transfer out of the ear canal as they would with open fittings. 
Contrarily, in quiet environments, a vent that  remains open  allow s for a more natural perception 
of the user's own voice.  
 
Research has been conducted at NAL ( sponsored by [CONTACT_661321]) as well as internally, to 
investigate sound quality and occlusion of a dynamic vent compared  to other coupling options. 
However, previous research has investigated custom earmolds with various degrees of venting 
as comparators to a dyn amic venting system . In the [LOCATION_002], it is customary to use 
universal domes (open, closed, vented, power, etc.), assuming gain is not a limiting factor and 
domes provide adequate retention. This research intends to identify significant perceptual 
difference in terms of sound quality, and occlusion, when a dynamic venting system  is 
compared to universal open domes and vented domes.  
 
2 Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate an active venting system  across domains of 
sound quality and occlusion. More specifically, researchers hypothesize that a  dynamic venting 
system  will provide better streaming sound quality than coupling achieved with an open dome. 
Additionally, researchers hypothesize that a  dyna mic venting system  will provide better quality 
of their own voice (less occlusion effect) than with coupling achieved with vented domes.  
 
[ADDRESS_965469] 3 conditions across two tasks. One task will be investigating 
streaming sound quality and the other will investigate ow n voice perception (occlusion effect). 
The sample population will be of [ADDRESS_965470] hearing ability associated with participation in 
this study. All sounds used in this study will be presented at safe listening levels. While using 
hearing aids, the following are possible occurrences:  
 •Cerumen impaction  
 •Ear discomfort, pain or soreness  
 •Sweat or moisture accumulation in the ear canal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_24277]  
 •A feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear  
 •Itching, blisters, or sores in the ear canal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_24277]  
 •Headache  
 •Redness of tissue  
The research personnel will r eview these risks with the subjects and answer any questions they 
have. Hearing aids are not a significant risk investigational device as defined in the FDA 21 CFR 
812.3(m).  
 
6 Endpoints  
 
Primary endpoint: Subjective ratings of the coupling conditions, for both streaming sound qual -
ity and own voice perception (occlusion effect). These will be administered via a 100 point scale, 
from 0 to 100 (0 = least preferred, 100 = most preferred). For streaming sound quality, 
participants will be presen ted with a pop song and will be asked to adjust the volume to their 
most comfortable level before making a rating. For the own voice perception portion, partici -
pants will be asked to read the Rainbow Passage prior to making a rating.  
Secondary endpoint: Analysis of audio recordings of participants reading the Rainbow Pas -sage 
(for occlusion investigation). Given the Lombard effect, researchers believe there to be a 
possibility that subjects will adapt certain qualities of their voice depending on the leve l of 
occlusion. This secondary measure may give insight to such phenomenon and supplement 
further understanding of the primary objective.

INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
This randomized control study will include male and female youth between [ADDRESS_271172] a 
confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by a clinical psychologist, pediatrician or psychiatrist with 
expertise in ASD and based on the DSM -V (APA, 2013) and corroborated by [CONTACT_225556] - 
Generic (ADOS -G; Lord et al., 1999). Participants whose diagnosis is not confirmed will not be eligible to con tinue the 
study. We will recruit participants without confirmed diagnoses but will perform diagnostic testing as described above 
and if diagnosis is not confirmed participants will not be eligible to continue the study. The ASD group will be high -
functioni ng (intelligence quotient IQ > 70).  
 
In addition to these criteria, a participant must communicate using complete sentences and have fluent speech.  If it 
appears that the participant does not understand some of the verbal or written information, the exam iner will use 
follow -up questions using simple language to ensure the participant understands the purpose and task demands of the 
study. After clarification, if the participant is unable to demonstrate understanding, respond to questions or willing to 
comp lete the questionnaires or protocols, the study team will consult with [CONTACT_225584] or the site- PI [INVESTIGATOR_225538].  
 Exclusion Criteria  
Youth with ASD and comorbid intellectual impairment will be excluded fr om the study, as it is unclear if they will 
comprehend the activities and benefit from the intervention. In order to maintain the safety all participants, youth with current, frequent, and uncontrolled aggression toward other persons or property in the pas t 6-months will be excluded. 
This information is obtained during the initial phone screen and during the pre -treatment assessment visit. Participants 
whose diagnostic testing does not confirm a diagnosis of ASD will not be eligible to continue the study. A dditionally, 
children who are unable to complete significant portions of the research protocol with be excluded. If a participant 
evidences features of suicidality based on parental report, self- report, or clinical judgement, an immediate referral to 
Child  and Adolescent Psychiatry will be made, and the participant will not be enrolled.  
 For verbal competence, participants are evaluated for verbal and nonverbal intelligence using the Wechsler Abbreviated 
Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler, 2nd Edition, 2011).  Moreover, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS, 2nd 
Edition; Lord et al., 2012) Module [ADDRESS_271173]. Corbett or the site- PI [CONTACT_156869] i f the 
participant should be excluded from the study.  
 The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) is a self- report questionnaire consisting of questions related to affective states.  
Item number 8 explicitly asks, if the child think about or wants to kill him/herself.  If a participant endorses this item, it 
will immediately trigger a response. Specifically, [CONTACT_225584] or the lead clinician will be contact[CONTACT_225557] (see full crisis plan below).  
 
 
Version Date | 3.4.2022  Page  | 5 
  
After enrollment in the study, if the participant endorses suicidal ideation (i.e., endorsing suicidality on item #8 on the 
Child Depression Inventory), [CONTACT_225584] or another study clinician will be contact[CONTACT_225558]. Options for addres sing the concern may include contact[CONTACT_90803]'s outpatient mental health 
care provider, prompt consultation with pediatric providers within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral 
Sciences, or referral for urgent psychiatric evaluation and treatment. If the threat is determined to not be imminent, the 
participant may stay enrolled within the study under careful observation. If determined necessary, the parent will be 
provided with local mental health resources. The clinician will also inform t he participant and parent of the importance 
of going to the Emergency Room should thoughts and feelings intensify. Finally, the participant will be notified that the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_225539] o rder for them to prioritize and 
receive the necessary care.

 Additional information about the screening procedures  
 
The following questions will be asked of participants who endorse suicidal ideation.  The y are derived from the National 
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Ask Suicide Screening Questions.  
https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research -conducted -at-nimh/asq -toolkit -materials/asq -tool/asq -screening-
tool.shtml  
1. In the past few weeks, have you wished you were dead?  Yes  No  
2. In the past few weeks, have you felt that you or your family would be better off if you were dead? Yes  No  
3. In the past week, have you been having thoughts about killing yourself?  Yes  No  
4. Have you ever tried to kill yours elf?  Yes  No  
If yes, how?  
When?  
 
If the patient answers yes to any of the above, ask the following question:  
5. Are you having thoughts of killing yourself right now?  Yes  No  
If yes, please describe:  
Next steps: If patient answers "No" to all questions  1 through 4, screening is complete (not necessary to ask question 
#5). No intervention is necessary (*Note: Clinical judgment can always override a negative screen).  
If patient answers "Yes" to any of questions 1 through 4, or refuses to answer, they are considered a positive screen. Ask 
question #5 to assess acuity:  
"Yes" to question #5 = acute positive screen (imminent risk identiﬁed)  
Patient requires a STAT safety/full mental health evaluation. Patient cannot leave until evaluated for safety.  
Keep pati ent in sight. Remove all dangerous objects from room. Alert physician or clinician responsible for patient's care.  
"No" to question #5 = non -acute positive screen (potential risk identiﬁed)  
Patient requires a brief suicide safety assessment to determine if a full mental health evaluation is needed. Patient 
cannot leave until evaluated for safety.  
Alert physician or clinician responsible for patient's care.

MISCELLANEOUS  
• VUMC SITE ONLY: iMotions  Software Analysis  
o These analyses  use videos of participants’ faces and  are done using iMotions, a well -established 
computer program that measures how the face moves and computes deidentified values for various 
emotional facial expressions. This is accomplished statistically, comparing the actual appearance of 
the face and the configuration of the features numerically with normative databases provided by 
[CONTACT_225579]. The program only identifies expression of emotion; it  does not use facial 
landmarks or any other means to identify who is in the video nor does it store recordings to improve its internal database and algorithms.  
o After initial upload  to the iMotions program , videos will be deleted from the program, at which 
point de -identified numerical data will be used for the remainder of analyses.

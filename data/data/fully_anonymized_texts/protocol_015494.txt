Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 3 of 19 Introduction – Background 
Neuropathic pain  (NP), defined as ‘pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in 
the nervous system’ according to The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), 
affects up to 8% of the population (IASP Task Force; Dieleman et al  2008).  Compared to other 
chronic pain conditions, NP is associated with higher pain severity, poorer health, and greater disability (Smith et al  2007).  In addition, depression and anxiety are common comorbidities of NP 
(Radat et al 2013).  As NP affects more women than men (Dieleman et al  2008), women’s health 
practitioners need to be familiar with both acute and chronic neuropathic pain conditions.  Acquired 
nerve compressions are common in pregnancy, and consensus exists regarding their 
management (Sax and Rosenbaum 2006).  However, knowledge regarding chronic NP (and other 
chronic pain conditions) in pregnancy is scarce.  The overall goal of this project is to better 
define the course, management, and obstetrical/neonatal outcomes of chronic neuropathic pain in pregnancy and the acute postpartum period.  
 Acquired nerve compressions peak in the third trimester and the majority resolve by [CONTACT_848841].  The trend  of chronic NP as well as chronic pain in pregnancy is unknown.  This study 
will characterize the course of neuropathic pain in pregnancy and the postpartum period 
using longitudinal measures of pain characteristics.  
 Pharmacological management of NP is suboptimal as those with NP report greater disability and 
less effective pain relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_848808]- neuropathic pain (Torrance et al  2007; Smith et al 2007).  In addition, pharmacological 
treatme nt fails to relieve symptoms at the costs of side effects (e.g., constipation, dry mouth, 
sedation, risks of falls).  Thus, alternative pharmacological treatments or non- pharm acological 
options are needed.  
 Neurostimulation modalities are efficacious in the management of NP but are not included in 
current treatment guidelines (O’Connor and Dworkin 2009; Attal et al  2010; Moulin et al  2007).  In 
particular, rTMS is one technique that has shown effectiveness in the management of NP and is 
recognized as having level B evidence (Hosomi et al  2013; Khedr et al  2005; Mhalla et al  2011; 
Passard et al 2007; Onesti et al 2013; Cruccu et al 2007).  Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses 
electromagnetic induction to influence underlying cortical neurons and trigger action potentials.  
This non- invasive and localized mechanism of action makes it attractive for use in special 
populations, such as pregnancy.  
 
Pain management in pregnancy relies on conservative strategies and pharmacological 
monotherapy to minimize the risk to benefit ratio of fetal exposure; thus, the management of NP 
in pregnancy is challenging as evidence of teratogenicity limits options.  In addition, little is known 
of other treatment options, such as pregabalin and duloxetine (Hoog et al 2013; Winterfield et al 
2015).  Also, pharmacological monotherapy is always recommended to minimize fetal exposure 
in pregnancy, and this limits the use of combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation may be an acceptable alternative to pharmaceuticals for the management of NP in pregnancy.  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is acceptable as a 
treatment option for depression in pregnancy (Kim et al 2011).  Two studies effectively applied 
rTMS in pregnancy for depression with no adverse fetal or obstetrical outcomes (Sayar et al  2014; 
Kim et al 2011).  According to a follow -up study, rTMS is not associated with poorer cognitive, 
motor, or language development in children of mothers who were treated with rTMS in pregnancy

Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 4 of 19 for depression (Eryilmaz et al 2014).  This will be the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_848809] . 
 
The application of rTMS in pregnancy for the treatment of depression has resulted in two cases 
of inferior vena cava compression syndrome (also referred to as supi[INVESTIGATOR_848810]) 
and one epi[INVESTIGATOR_848811] (Kim and Wang 2014).  This condition typi[INVESTIGATOR_848812] 24 weeks gestation and is managed by [CONTACT_848842][INVESTIGATOR_848813].  Thus, it has been 
recommended to avoid the supi[INVESTIGATOR_848814] (Kim and Wang 2014).  To decrease the likelihood of inferior vena cava compression syndrome, all subjects 
beyond [ADDRESS_1180240] pregnancy, and the use of high frequency stimulation, defined as 
greater than or equal to 10- Hz, in rTMS increases the risk of seizures. The general risk of seizures 
with rTMS is low (1/10,000), and rTMS has been used in pregnancy at high frequency (I.e. 25 -
Hz) stimulation without any adverse effects ( Sayar et al 2014). The proposed study will utilize 5-
Hz as it is the lowest, eff ective frequency stimulation reported for the treatment of neuropathic 
pain (Hosomi et al 2013) . We believe this  will minimize s eizure risk, and in efforts to further 
decrease seizure risk with rTMS, the study is applying rTMS in trains of pulses intersper sed with 
periods of rest and excluding those with risk factors for seizures.  The results of the current study 
will provide data supporting the acceptability and feasibility of rTMS of the treatment of 
neuropathic pain in pregnancy and will support larger studies to determine the most effective and 
safe frequency stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain  in pregnancy . 
 The management of chronic pain conditions in pregnancy has a direct effect on neonatal 
outcomes through fetal exposure. For example, neonatal abstinence syndrome is a drug 
withdrawal disorder of neonates that is secondary to in utero exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
antidepressants, and muscle relaxants – all which are used to treat NP.  Given the current limited 
knowledge of teratogenicity regarding pharmacological agents, we aim to better define the 
association of neonatal outcomes with chronic neuropathic conditions in pregnancy.  We aim to 
compare obstetrical  and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with neuropathic pain, 
non- neuropathic pain, and no pain.  
 
Objectives 
To further define the impact of NP in the peripartum period , we propose the following objectives:  
I. Characterize the course and pharmacological management of neuropathic pain in 
pregnancy and the postpartum period.  We will define descrip tive statistics of the use of 
analgesic medications in pregnancy and the postpartum period for the treatment of 
neuropathic pain.  
II. Compare obstetrical and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with chronic neuropathic pain, non- neuropathic chronic pain, and p regnant women without chronic pain.  
III. Determine the acceptability  and tolerability  of rTMS for the treatment of neuropathic pain in 
pregnancy , and describe the impact of rTMS on neuropathic pain in pregnancy.  
 
Subject  Selection  
Subjects will be enrolled through the Women’s Mental Health Program (WMHP) at the University 
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) at the following  clinical spaces : Psychiatric Research 
Institute (PRI) ; UAMS Women’s Clinic (UWC) ; the Psychiatric Research Institute (PRI) inpatient

Investigational Plan  
The study will involve two phases - initially focusing on identification and course, followed by 
[CONTACT_848844] (Part A) , and culminating in a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_848815] (Part B).  
 Part A : 
Study visits will occur approximately every 4- [ADDRESS_1180241] Questionnaire (PDQ), for diagnostic 
purposes (written permission for use of PDQ has been obtained and is available upon request) . 
The PDQ  has been validated and shown high sensitivity (85%), specificity (80%), and positive 
predictive value (83%)  (Freynhagen et al 2006 ). At study entry, subjects will complete the PDQ . 
Based on their  scores, subjects will be separated into three groups: Group 1) subjects with NP  in 
pregnancy (score ≥13); Group 2) subjects with non- neuropathic pain in pregnancy (1≥score≤12; 
and Group 3) subjects without any type of pain in pregnancy (score=0).  
 Other measures collected at entry include a general biographical form  (WMHP Intake Form ). 
Subjects will complete pain measures and the B eck Depression Inventory (BDI) ( Beck et al 1960) 
at study entry and at each study visit.  Pain measures include the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) ( Sullivan et al 1995), and measures of pain intensity, pain 
interference, pain behavior - all three derived from Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) ( Amtmann et al 2010; Revicki et al  2009; Cella et al 2010) . At each 
visit, the exposure tracking form will record the timing (weeks of gestation) and dosage of all

Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 7 of 19 prescription and non- prescription medications used in pregnancy and the postpartum period.  A 
urine drug screen will also be obtained at each visit testing for the presence or absence of the 
following : amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbitur ates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], THC, cocaine, 
methadone, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], PCP, and cotinine. For all visits following entry visit, subjects will complete 
the Patients’ Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC) (Hurst and Bolton 2004); and the clinician 
will complete the Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement scale (CGI -I) (Guy 1976).  At all 
study visits, weight and vital signs will be collected.  For all subjects who delivered at UAMS, 
medical records for labor  and delivery and neonatal outcome will be obtained following birth.  All 
subjects will participate in Part A. All subjects will receive treatment as usual within each group.  
 Part B : 
Subjects in group 1 will be invited to participate in part B of the study following their enrollment in 
part A . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_848816] 10 subjects (of Group A ). 
 
Subjects will undergo daily rTMS, defined as Monday through Friday, for a total of 10  consecutive 
sessions  with the exception of weekends and holidays (i.e., Monday to Friday only) . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a 
stimulation period will start on Monday (day 1) and end on Friday (day 12).  In the case that a 
stimulation period does not start on Monday, day [ADDRESS_1180242]’s first rTMS 
session.  Subjects  will be followed daily until day 29, following their last session of rTMS (day 12).  
Table 2 provides an overview of study procedures.  For each session (days 1 -5 and 8- 12), subjects 
will complete a VAS prior, immediately following, and [ADDRESS_1180243].  Adverse events will also 
be recorded prior to and immediately following and 60 minutes after each session.  They will 
complete a BDI on Days 1, 5, 12, 22, and 29. Subjects will complete VAS also on days 22 and 
29. For days 5, 12, 22, and 29; subjects will complete the PGIC; and clinicians will complete the 
CGI-I. Subjects will have a maximum of 12 visits for Part B (10 rTMS sessions plus days 22 and 
29). Either study visit  for days [ADDRESS_1180244] one visible muscle twitch.  At each 
rTMS treatment, study staff will determine resting motor threshold by [CONTACT_848845] (functional assessment of the primary motor cortex).  To find the optimal  stimulation 
site, study staff will measure the halfway distance between the nasion and inion and the halfway 
distance between the right tragus and left tragus.  From the intersection of these two points, the 
optimal stimulation site is approximately 5cm lateral on the contralateral side.  Study staff may 
need to adjust positioning to find the optimal site by [CONTACT_848846] 1 cm. 
To begin, study staff will set the TMS intensity to 35% stimulator output and deliver a single pulse over the optimal site with handle [ADDRESS_1180245].  Intensity will be increased 
progressively by 5% increments until a muscle evoked potential is seen as determined by [CONTACT_848847].  Study staff will wait 6 -10 seconds between stimuli to avoid cumulative effects.  
Once a muscle evoked potential is seen as determined by [CONTACT_848848], s everal 
stimuli will be delivered to ensure a consistent respon se. The stimulus intensity will then be 
lowered in 1% stimulator output until 50% positive responses are recorded (5 out of 10).  This 
stimulus intensity plus 1% is then defined as  the restin g motor threshold.

Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 8 of 19 An rTMS session consists of 10 trains at 90% intensity of resting motor threshold . One train 
consists of 50 pulses at 5 Hz for a 10s duration. There is a 50s intertrain interval.  A total of 500 
pulses are applied in a session for a cumulative exposure of 5000 pulses over 10 sessions.  Each 
session lasts about one hour . 
 
All rTMS treatments will be administered  by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_346230] -Griffith)  or study staff who have been 
adequately trained to perform rTMS . [CONTACT_346230] -Griffith will receive traini ng for rTMS through the 
intensive course in TMS offered by [CONTACT_349496]- Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation 
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center – a teaching facility of Harvard Medical Center  and 
device specific training from the device manu facturer, Neuronetics, Inc . Device specific training 
from the device manufacturer , Neuronetics, Inc., will also be provided for study staff.  If potential 
adverse events occur during the treatments, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_848817], 
as stated below.  All participants will receive prompt medical treatment.  As treatments are 
completed in an outpatient setting, emergency services will be utilized in the event of a series adverse event prompting emergency medical treatment.

Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_848849] . Once referred, initial screening by [CONTACT_848850] (as described in Eligibility Criteria)  discuss ing the study, obtaining 
informed consent , completing the TASS questionnaire  and initiating  enrollment . These 
assessments and health related information will be collected on a paper  form. All personnel will 
be qualified to administer all questionnaires.  
 
Access to Medical Records: As a part of the  informed consent for this protocol, individuals will 
allow the investigative team access to medical records.  Any information acquired from medical 
records will be de- identified ( no PHI , only subject ID code) and stored with the de- identified 
records obtai ned for this study . 
 
The medical record will be utilized to gather obstetrical information regarding gestation and 
delivery of the infant, which may include but not limited to infant weight, height, APGAR scores, gender, head circumference, method of delivery and maternal or infant complications. Collection 
of health information will occur shortly following delivery of infant . Infants will only be assessed 
via medical records. There will be no direct assessment of infants within the scope of this study.  
 Questionnaires and Surveys  for Part s A and B : 
• Pain Interference Scale- Short Form  4a (Part A) : This [ADDRESS_1180247]’s life. It includes impairment in the subject’s social, cognitive, emotional, physical , and recreational activities. It also incorporates 
items about sleep and enjoyment of life. The short form is not disease specific and assesses 
pain interference over the past 7 days.  
• Pain Behavior Scale- Short Form  7a (Part A) : This 7 -item, self -report scale measures 
behaviors that typi[INVESTIGATOR_848818]. These 
measures include observations (sighing, crying), behaviors (resting, guarding, facial 
expressions, asking for help) , and verbal reports of pain. The short form is not disease specific 
and assesses pain interference over the past 7 days.  
• Pain Intensity Scale- Short Form  3a (Part A) : This [ADDRESS_1180248] to rate their pain intensity “right now .” The shor t form is not disease specific.  
• Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)  (Part A) : The PCS is a 13- item self -report scale. It asks 
subjects  to reflect on past  painful experiences, and to indicate the degree to which they 
experienced each of 13 thoughts or feelings when experiencing pain, on 5- point scales with 
the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS yields a total score and three 
subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification, and helplessness.  
• painDETECT  Questionnaire (PDQ)  (Part A) : This self -report questionnaire consists of [ADDRESS_1180249] questions are not counted in the total score.  
• Exposure Tracking Form  (Part A) : This is a customized form used by [CONTACT_848851] a weekly basis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.  
• General Biographical Form ( WMHP Pain Intake Form ) (Part A) : All subjects  will complete a 
WMHP -Pain intake packet, which will be composed of several sections including: 1) general

5) current/most recent pregnancy; 6) surgical history; 7) drug and alcohol history; 8) family 
medical history; 9) medical history; and 10) current status.  The intake form is used at baseline 
and may be updated as appropriate at follow up visits.  
• Beck Depression Inventory  (BDI)  (Part A and B) : The BDI is a widely used instrument that has 
been used in both clinical and non- clinical setting measuring depressive symptoms.  It is a [ADDRESS_1180250] overt behavioral manifestations of depression.  The instrument has both a 
high degree of reliability and validity (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock & Erbaugh, 1961).  This 
scale will be performed at every subject visit.  
• Patient’s Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC)  (Part A and B) : The PGIC gives a global 
rating of change in symptoms, activities, emotion, and overall  quality of life related to the 
subject’s pain condition. This is a self -rated scale.  
• Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement Scale (CGI -I) (Part A and B) : The CGI -I gives 
a global rating of the improvement/change in the symptoms since the last study visit. This is 
administered by [CONTACT_96137] . 
• Visual Analog Scale  (Part A and B): [ADDRESS_1180251] visit.  
• TASS: TASS is the Transcranial magnetic stimulation Adult Safety Screen that is used to alert 
investigators to factors in potential subjects that may be predisposed to adverse events during rTMS.  The decision to proceed with rTMS is entirely up to the investigator’s judgment.  TASS 
compliments history -taking and is not meant to exclude or replace the investigator’s judgment.  
 
Maternal Labs  
We will obtain maternal urine collection for research analy sis at every subject visit  for urine drug 
screen and cotinine analysis . Urine  will be collected and processed in a designated research 
space at PRI /UWC  or in the subject’s room in PRI /UAMS  and will b e sent to an outside laboratory . 
WMHP research per sonnel process the research lab.  All research samples will be  temporarily 
stored in a dedicated -20 degrees freezers in the Psychiatric Research Institute (PRI) 4th floor 
laboratory. Access to the samples will be restricted to WMHP  research personnel.  
 
Cotinine/N icotine  
Many women may continue to use tobacco during pregnancy and may or may not inform their 
obstetrical care about such use.  Given the well documented untoward effects on pregnancy

programs in their geographic area and encouraged to discuss tobacco use with their obstetrical 
care provider.  Obstetricians will not be informed of a positive cotinine/nicotine screen by [CONTACT_81056].  
 
Illicit Drugs  
Urine drug analysis is important in identifying exposure to substances; however, they are not done 
routinely during pregnancy.  In reference to the current study, the urine drug screen is important 
to confirm exposure to prescription and non -prescription medications that may confound study 
results.  Not surprising, some women taking medications choose not to inform their obstetrical 
care about such use or the extent of such use.  These medications may include both prescr iption 
medications, medications obtained through other sources (e.g. internet) , and illicit substances . 
We view this as highly problematic and not indicative of a collaborative clinical care plan to

Statistical Methods and Data Management  
All data will be kept either in locked file cabinets or password- protected computers accessible to 
only investigators or designated study staff.  Trained study staff will enter data and original source 
documents will be stored in locked file cabinets in offices with limited access.  A database will also 
be created to input subject information  and only designated study staff will have access . Periodic 
reviews wi ll occur to ensure that data is accurately entered and if needed, corrections can be 
made.  The database will generate queries to account for missing information.  Every subject  
enrolled in this study will be given a unique ID number that will be used for tracking purposes. The key linking the unique study ID number to identifiable information will also be stored in the 
password- protected computers accessible to only investigators or designated study staff.  
Each subject’s name, SSN, birth date, address, phone  number, and email address will be 
obtained for purposes of payment and follow -up. We will ask for each subject’s drug use history, 
medical  history, and current drug use.  
 
Part A : 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated  for all measures obtained. 
 
For the first hypothesis, primary outcome measures  include VAS and pain assessments. 
Secondary outcome measures include BDI, PGIC, and CGI -I. For each outcome measure, scatter 
plots will be constructed for visual inspection across time  by [CONTACT_19313] . As outcome measures will be 
obtained at multiple time points , mixed models will be used to account for the correlations among 
the measurements within the subjects.

Part B  (rTMS) : 
We will determine the acceptability of rTMS as a treatment option by [CONTACT_848854].  Tolerability  will be determined by [CONTACT_848855].  The primary outcome measure is VAS.  Secondary outcome measures include 
BDI, PGIC, and CGI -I. For each outcome measure, scatter plots will be constructed for visual 
inspection across treatment.  Using p revious studies of rTMS for the treatment of neuropathic pain, 
we will determine an effect size and complete a power analysis.  This information will help guide 
future studies of the effectiveness of rTMS in the treatment of neuropathic pain in pr egnancy.  
 Neonatal outcomes will be analyzed between the following groups:  1. Subjects participating in 
rTMS (Part B); 2. Subjects with neuropathic pain who participated in Part A but did not participate 
in Part B; 3. Subjects with chronic non -neuropathic pain who participated in Part A; and 4. 
Subjects without chronic pain who participated in Part A. Specific endpoints of interest include 
neonatal intensive care unit admission, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], birth weight and length, and [ADDRESS_1180254] th e difference among the groups.  
 
Neonatal outcomes will be scrutinized after each delivery and neonatal period.  The investigator 
team will convene and review all neonatal outcomes to determine if any complication occurred that could be attributed to the study, participation in the study, and/or treatment received.  If any 
complication is identified (i.e. preterm delivery with all subjects who participated in rTMS), we will 
cease all current and potential study procedures related to  part B of the study . 
 All statistical analysis will be completed using SAS 9.4.  Significance will be set at p<0.05.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
A trained study staff member will perform the consenting in a quiet and private room . This person 
will review the consent with  the subject  and aid in the discussion. The consent discussion time 
will be determined based on the subjects’  questions and understanding of the consent form . 
Subjects  will be informed of their rights and that by [CONTACT_848856]. It will be emphasized that the research is voluntary.  
The person obtaining consent will carefully explain each element of the document and outline the

[INVESTIGATOR_848831] : 
An adverse event is defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, whether or not it is considered drug/devi ce-
related by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events occurring during the course of the study, whether related to Part A or Part B or otherwise, will be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  For all adverse events, 
the Investig ator will provide an assessment of the adverse event, its treatment and resolution, 
and its relationship to the study . Special reporting procedures are required for certain adverse 
events.  
 
Relationship of Adverse Events to the Investigational Device 
The i nvestigator will assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational device. 
The relationship will be assessed using the following categories: 
• Definitely Related : A direct cause and effect relationship between the investigational drug 
or device/experimental treatment and the adverse event exists.  
• Possibly Related : A direct cause and effect relationship between the investigational drug or 
device/experimental treatment and the adverse event has not been clearly demonstrated, 
but is likely or v ery likely.  
• Unlikely Related : A direct cause and effect relationship between the investigational drug or 
device/experimental treatment and the adverse event is improbable, but not impossible.  
• Unrelated: The adverse event is definitely not associated with the investigational drug or 
device/experimental treatment.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects   
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety, or any life -threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or application (including supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare 
of subjects.”  If an unanticipated adverse effect occurs, the investigator will promptly notify the 
sponsor of such an event within [ADDRESS_1180256] learning of the event using the  FDA MedW atch 
3500A form. The form can be found online at: https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download

Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 15 of 19 Serious Adverse Events  
Each adverse event will be assessed for its seriousness using the criteria outlined below. The 
term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse event, which may be used 
to describe the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423]. An adverse event will be 
classified as serious if it meets any of the followi ng criteria:  
• Results in, or contributes to, a death  
• Life-threatening (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at risk of death at 
the time of the event, but it does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death)  
• Results in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or 
quality of life.  
• Results in permanent disability or incapacity (i.e., permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure)  
• Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908]  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude a permanent disability or 
incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Non-serious adverse events are all events that do not meet criteria for a “serious” adverse event.  
 If serious adverse event occurs, the investigator will promptly notify the sponsor of such an event within [ADDRESS_1180257] learning of the event using the FDA MedWatch 3500A form. The can be 
found on -line at: https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download
 
 The investigator will also promptly notify the IRB of such an event as soon as possible, but no 
later than ten (10) working days after first learning of the event.  
 
Severity  
Each adverse event will be assessed for  its severity, or the intensity of an event experienced by 
[CONTACT_423], using the following.  
• Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
• Severe: Inability to work  or perform normal daily activity.  
 
Deaths  
The investigator will notify the sponsor and IRB as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_1180258]’s death, regardless of whether the death 
is related or unrelated to the investigational drug or device. The investigator will attempt to 
determine, as conclusively as possible, whether the death is related to the drug or device. The cause of death and the investigator’s discussion regarding whether or not the death was drug- or 
device- related will be described in a written report.  
 
Pre-existing conditions  
Pre-existing conditions will not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a 
substantial increase in the severity or frequency of the problem , which has not been attributed to 
natural history.

The investigator will assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events at each study visit.  All 
adverse events (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_848858].  
 
Abuse of illicit or licit substances during pregnancy poses a potential risk to the subject and their 
pregnancy that their obstetrical and pediatric care provider should be aware. As a policy, we 
strongly encourage subjects to communicate this information to their obstetrical and pediatric care 
providers.  We will only share this information with other care providers with subject’s signed 
release of information.  To the best of our knowledge, participation in par t A of this  study poses no 
risk to pregnancy and/or the infant.  There may be risks, discomforts , or side effects that are not 
known yet.  There is also the possibil ity of loss of confidentiality.  
 
Risks Associated with Part A  
No real risks are associated with Part A of this study other than possible loss of confidentiality.  
Subjects may decline to answer any questions that may make subjects uncomfortable.  
 
Risks Associated with rTMS (Part B)  
Likely : Subjects may feel anxious about participation.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_848832].  
 
Less likely : Subjects may experience minor discomfort associated with head and hand muscle 
twitching, headache, local (head and neck) , and dental pain.  Head and neck pain related to 
stimulation of underlying muscle and nerves occurs in approximately 10% of subjects. The 
incidence and severity is a function of stimulus site and intensity but is most common over frontal -
temporal regions. The symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_848833].  Subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_848834]’s progress.  The coil position is adjusted if pain occurs. Subjects will be advised to take 
acetaminophen for treatment if necessary.  The study phys ician or nurse will monitor subjects 
during and after  each  rTMS for  twitching  of a hand muscle, such as the abductor pollicis brevis or 
the first dorsal interosseous muscle, on the side of the body that is contralateral to the rTMS treatment site . 
 
Rare : Seizure and hearing loss.  The risk of having a single seizure is small, estimated at 
≤1/10,000 (Rossi et al 2009).  In order to decrease this risk, subjects with preeclampsia, brain 
lesions, head trauma, a history of seizures (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), or taking medications known to lower 
seizure threshold are precluded from participating in rTMS.  Study staff administering rTMS are  
trained in the treatment and management of an acute seizure.  Life-support equipment is also 
readily available.  All subjects will be visually monitored for signs of a seizure and/or muscle 
twitching throughout each rTMS treatment.  
 Another risk is hearing loss (temporary or permanent).  To minimize this risk, subjects will wear 
ear plugs during rTMS.  Subjects will be asked to immediately report any loosening or detachment 
of an earplug during treatment.  Study staff will immediately stop rTMS if a subject reports or if an 
investigator observes that a subjects’ ear pl ug has loosened or has fallen out. 
 
Rare : A specific, but rare, risk of rTMS in pregnancy is inferior vena cava syndrome (or supi[INVESTIGATOR_848835]).  This syndrome happens in pregnancy after 24 weeks pregnant and 
usually occurs after laying down for about 5- 10 minutes.  Common symptoms are feeling dizzy

Version 10, 03.30.2021  Page 17 of 19 and/or upset to your stomach and having low blood pressure and/or high heart rate.  The 
symptoms do not last long and usually go away when you change your position, such as lay on 
your left side.  To decrease the chance of this happening, you will have a cushion placed under 
you right  side during treatments when you are  24 weeks pregnant or greater.  
 
Temporary changes in vision may be noticed immediately after rTMS.  These visual changes are 
not thought to be actual problems with the eyes, but, rather changes in brain functioning as a 
result of rTMS.  Things like blurred vision and/or eye floaters normalize in time.  The risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_848859].  
Facial numbness and facial nerve stimulation may also occur.  Some sources estimate that 1 out 
of 3 in dividuals experience “facial twitching” during and/or after rTMS sessions.  This twitching in 
the facial muscles is caused by [CONTACT_848860].  We will 
minimize this risk by [CONTACT_848861].  
 
Some patients may have fainted (syncopal/convulsive syncopal) or become lightheaded and 
nauseous during rTMS. We would stop  TMS  in case of suspected syncope.  Such symptoms have 
been brief and resolved complet ely. In order to minimize risks the study doctor or nurse will use 
the following procedures to minimize the risks of convulsive syncope:  
• Request information regarding a history of syncope during your screening process  
• Monitor blood pressure during rTMS  
• Monitor you for signs and symptoms of syncope appearing during rTMS and stop 
stimulation if signs and/or symptoms occur  
• Immediately place you in a reclining position elevating your legs if signs or symptoms of 
syncope appear  
 
Temporary changes in mood, such a s mania and hypomania, have been caused by [CONTACT_848862].  There are no reports of lasting changes in mood using the rate of 
stimulation that will be used in this study.  To minimize this risk, subjects with a history of bipolar 
disorder have been excluded from parti cipation in the study.  In addition, subjects will be assessed 
clinically by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_848836].  If 
they develop during the study, the subject  will be withdrawn from  the study and referred for 
appropriate treatment as indicated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_848837].  
 
Ferromag netic pi[INVESTIGATOR_848838], and some forms of eye make -up, 
especially eyeliner, eye shadow and mascara, may contain ferromagnetic pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639].  To minimize 
this occur rence, all subjects will be asked to remove all forms of eye makeup before each rTMS 
treatment.  
 The long- term effects of rTMS ar e unknown.  
 There may be benefit to subjects  in this study who are participating in rTMS. For all others, t aking 
part in this research study may not benefit the subjects personally, but we may learn new things 
that may be of benefit to women and children in the future.

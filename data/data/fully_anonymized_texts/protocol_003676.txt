PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/2020 
 
 6 BACKGROUND 
 
Problem Adaptation Therapy for elders with major or minor depression and mild 
cognitive impairment (PATH-MCI) is a non-pharmacological intervention that facilitates 
problem-solving and adaptive functioning. The goals of PATH-MCI are to reduce 
patients’ depression, disability, and stress through emotion regulation.  
 
PATH-MCI aims to reduce negative emotions and promote positive emotions 
associated with depression, including depressed mood, hopelessness, helplessness, 
guilt, anxiety, and anhedonia. The tools to achieve emotion regulation are: a) a hands-
on problem-solving approach, simplified from Problem Solving Therapy (PST); b) 
compensatory strategies and environmental adaptations to by[CONTACT_384890], due to depression or physical disability; 
c) careful integration of significant other involvement; and d) engagement in pleasurable 
activities. Using these tools, PATH-MCI can create an environmentally friendly 
“ecosystem” that decreases everyday stressors, empowers patients, instills hope, and 
promotes emotion regulation.  
 
A simplified problem-solving approach from PST was chosen because: a) PST has 
been found effective in cognitively-intact depressed elders and in depressed elders with 
mild executive dysfunction; b) PST creates a forum within which patients and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384864], and it provides the structure and the process for 
patient problem-solving pertinent to decreasing depressive symptoms and functional 
limitations; and c) problem-solving strategies can be appropriately modified, and when 
this is done, they can help remedy behavioral limitations resulting from depression and 
mild cognitive impairment. Because solutions of problems may not necessarily reduce 
depression, the focus of PATH-MCI’s problem-solving approach is to reduce negative 
emotions and promote positive emotions that are associated with the specific problem. 
To achieve emotion regulation, the PATH- MCI therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384865], if the solution is not satisfactory.  
 
Consistent with the NIMH Objective [ADDRESS_481391] 
demonstrated that PATH-MCI reduces depression and disability in elders with major or 
minor depression and mild cognitive deficits. PATH-MCI is not designed for patients 
with dementia as these patients may require additional assistance.

 7 STUDY AIMS  
 
The goals of the study are: 
MONTHS 1-3: 
 
1. Finalize the PATH-MCI Manual and establish feasibility of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73775]. We 
will train 4 LMSW/LCSWs: 2 will be trained in the PATH-MCI therapy, 2 will be 
trained in Supportive Psychotherapy. We will determine the success rate of 
training and number of hours needed to achieve PATH-MCI certification.  
 
MONTHS 4-60 
 
2. Assess PATH-MCI’s reach, feasibility and acceptability: We will assess across 
conditions:  
a. Reach: Number of patients screened, and those who meet inclusion 
criteria;  
b. Feasibility: Number of patients who receive PATH-MCI or ST for mental 
health care and research procedures (timely referrals, assessments);  
c. Acceptability: Patient’s treatment satisfaction at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 52 
weeks.  
 
Benchmarks of the study progress: Feasibility: At least 75% of PATH-MCI 
participants will complete PATH-MCI. Acceptability: We will obtain treatment 
satisfaction score at the end of PATH-MCI treatment.  
 
3. Preliminary Effectiveness: Over the course of [ADDRESS_481392] better global 
cognition and greater (effect size) and clinically significant reductions in disability 
and depression. Furthermore, better epi[INVESTIGATOR_384866]-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL

 9 RECRUITMENT PROTOCOL  
1. Patients are assessed and recruited from [LOCATION_001] City Locations and 
Westchester. 
 Patients in NYC will be seen at [ADDRESS_481395]., Penthouse Floor.  
 Patients in Westchester will be seen at [ADDRESS_481396], White Plains, 
Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. 
 Patients at Montefiore will be seen at [ADDRESS_481397], Bronx, NY.  
 Note: There is no compensation for transportation expenses for patients. 
Any special cases must be discussed with [CONTACT_73802] and Laurie Evans. 
 Patients who are not able to meet in person may be assessed by [CONTACT_87085]. 
 
2. Study staff may recruit using flyers, posters and referrals. 
 Flyers 
NYC 
- Flyers for the study are placed in the waiting room of doctor’s 
offices at [ADDRESS_481398], as permitted by [CONTACT_106224]’s office. RAs 
must talk to the front desk before leaving flyers. Preferred floors are 
the 11th and 12th floors. 
- Flyers also can be placed in the elevators of the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384867] 72nd Street. Permission for this has been granted. 
WP 
- Flyers can be placed in the waiting room of the Institute of Geriatric 
Psychiatry. 
- Flyers also may be distributed at events, eg. Salute to Seniors, etc.  
 Posters 
- A poster version of the flyer can be placed in the lobby [CONTACT_17008] [ADDRESS_481399] communicate at all times with the building manager, Kim 
Canazi: [EMAIL_7421].  Inform her that we will be 
placing a poster in the lobby. Confirm with her the schedule for this, 
and that the easel obtained is the correct one to use.  
- Order posters through Marcella Sanchez or Andrei Gangal. 
 Referrals 
- We obtain referrals from different doctors. I.e. [CONTACT_384909]. 
- Make sure to follow up with the referral sources and to update 
referral sources about the patients they referred to us (meet criteria, 
did not meet, did not reach out to us, etc.). 
- We may also obtain referrals from sources, like the 4331 line at the 
Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry, and outside sources like JASA. 
-  
3. Phone screens 
 When calling a potential patient, RA makes sure to first explain the study 
(quick overview) and answer any questions. 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 10 Proceed with the phone screen, if a patient is interested in the study and 
agrees to the phone screen. Phone screens must be conducted with 
patients prior to scheduling a screening appointment 
 Phone screen form for PATH-MCI study can be found at 
I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\Phone Screens  
 RAs must conduct phone screens on days and times that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384868]. In case of an emergency, ie. a 
patient endorses suicidal ideation, the RA must communicate this 
information immediately to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384869]. RA 
must follow the suicide risk protocol. (See comprehensive SRA protocol at 
end of this document.) 
 If the patient seems eligible from the phone screen (i.e. endorses some 
depression and low mood and some memory problems), schedule a 
screening session with the patient.

 11STUDY PROTOCOL 
1. RAs obtain potential patient information from various referral sources.  
2. RA contacts a potential patient to complete a phone screen about 
memory/neurological problems, mood/depressive symptoms, current involvement 
in treatment, and medical illnesses.  
3. If the individual is interested in participating in our study and does not appear to 
meet exclusion criteria, the RA will invite the individual to come to our offices in 
White Plains or NYC, or to schedule a video or phone appointment, depending 
on the circumstances.   
4. At the onset of the screening interview, the RA will conduct the informed consent 
process.  If the patient has capacity to consent, the RA will conduct the screening 
assessment.  
5. The RA will discuss the results of the assessment with [CONTACT_73802]. 
6. If the patient is eligible, the RA will email the data manager with the individual’s 
information.  
7. The data manager will randomize the patient to either PATH-MCI or Supportive 
Therapy.  
8. The data manager will notify [CONTACT_73802] and the supervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (not 
administering the intervention) about the randomization.  
9. The supervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55045] a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384870] (to take place 
following the baseline assessment). 
10. The RA will schedule the baseline assessment with the patient and study partner. 
The patient will receive $30, and the study partner will receive $20 for the 
baseline assessment.  
11. Team weekly meetings: 
 Review recruitment (specifically the numbers of positive screen patients)  
 Referrals 
 Tracking of all patients; we will discuss:   
- The status of assessments 
- The status of therapy sessions  
 The data manager will generate charts with recruitment progress. 
12. The RA will conduct assessments with patients and their study partners at the 
following time points: 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks after the baseline assessment. 
Patients will receive $30 (cash, check or gift card) for each set of assessments. 
Caregivers will be compensated $20 (cash, check, or gift card) for each set of 
assessments. 
 Note: Genetic testing does not have an additional compensation. 
13. If the caregiver does not come in person for assessments and they agree we can 
give their compensation to the patient, they must first sign the reimbursement 
form stating that it’s okay for the patient to receive the money on their behalf. 
(See form I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Reimbursment 
Forms) 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 1214. If the caregiver reimbursement can’t be given to the subject, then we can do a 
payment requisition through WBG (during COVID-19), send a gift card, or send a 
money order.  If possible, for money orders, send the caregiver a reimbursement 
form and self-addressed stamped envelope, so they can sign and mail the form 
back to us. Once the form is received, send a money order for the amount of the 
reimbursement. 
15. All technology lent to patients will be returned to study staff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 13Montefiore Medical Center Site  
1. Patients will be recruited from Montefiore.  When a patient is identified (by 
[INVESTIGATOR_332802]) and agrees to be contact[CONTACT_384891], a WCM RA will call the 
patient to schedule a screening appointment at the Blondell Site ([ADDRESS_481400], Bronx, NY). 
2. RAs will schedule Montefiore patients for Tuesdays, when there is space and [CONTACT_384910] is there to supervise. There is room for one RA; if more than one RA 
needs to go, email [CONTACT_174983] to see if she can find more room.  Montefiore 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384871]. Patients must sign 
both the Montefiore and WCM consent forms. 
3. If a Montefiore subject signs the Genetics consent form, we will pay for 
transportation to Cornell for the blood draws. Blood draws can only be done at 
Cornell (White Plains or NYC), not Montefiore. 
4. If RAs are there for the entire day, we will not pay for transportation, except for 
the cost of the parking garage. 
5. If the RA is going to both the Montefiore and White Plains offices in the same 
day, we will pay for the transportation between the two sites (mileage for those 
driving, Uber/Lyft for those without a car). 
6. RAs should bring data/work with them to Montefiore, regardless of how many 
patients they have scheduled, as there may be downtime if a patient screens out 
early. If only one patient is scheduled (am or pm), RAs should plan on being in 
White Plains the other half of the day. 
7. Scheduling Patients at Montefiore: To aid the front desk in managing the patients 
coming in, please email [CONTACT_174983] (and [CONTACT_384911], so she can troubleshoot if [CONTACT_384912] is away) every Friday the schedule of patients you are seeing the following 
week. These can be individual emails (ie. the RA’s cases do not have be on the 
same email as the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s cases).  Please use the following format:  
 
Schedule for [insert date]    Email Sample: 
9am- [patient name]     Schedule for 12/10/2019 
10 am- [patient name]    10am- Erica Weiss 
11am- [patient name]    2pm- Mirnova Ceide 
1pm [patient name] 
2pm [patient name] 
3pm [patient name] 
 
In addition to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_384872], this will facilitate locating the RA 
when a patient calls to confirm their appointment or if they come on the wrong day.

PATH-MCI Adverse Events – Safety Report Form 
1. The Safety Report form is in RedCap.  
2. RAs will keep this form with each research assessment they do and ask the 
patient at each visit whether they’ve experienced any new health or medical 
problems since their last visit (At Baseline, the time frame is since 
screening/consent.).   
3. If the patient says yes, then complete the form (date of onset, severity, medical 
care received, etc.).  The guidelines for assessing what constitutes an AE, the 
severity level, etc. can be found in the NIA guidelines (saved on the I drive: 
(I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Adverse Events )   
4. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384875].  If the patient 
spontaneously says something in a session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384876], so that the RA

SUICIDAL IDEATION/ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL 
 
When a patient reports passive suicidal ideation on the MADRS Suicide Ideation item or 
the Scale for Suicide Ideation:  
 
1. Complete a Suicide Risk Assessment  
2. Reach out to the patient’s study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. If the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_38541], reach 
out to [CONTACT_73802] or another attending psychologist at the Institute.  
3. The clinician will speak to the patient and assess the situation. 
 
When a patient reports active suicidal ideation or any kind of suicidal behavior (suicide 
attempt, self-injurious behaviors, interrupted or aborted attempts, preparatory acts) on 
the MADRS Suicide Ideation item or the Scale for Suicide Ideation: 
 
1. Complete a Suicide Risk Assessment. 
2. Reach out to the patient’s study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. RA or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384877]. Kiosses and inform him about the situation and ask him to assess the 
patient.  If [CONTACT_73802] is not available, contact [CONTACT_384895] ([CONTACT_73802] needs to be informed later on about the situation.)  
3. Preferably, the assessment by a clinician is done during the same phone call or 
when the patient is still in the office.

 19RESEARCH ASSESSMENTS 
 
The RA will describe the study, ask potential patients to sign consent, and administer a 
screening assessment to evaluate eligibility. Once this is confirmed, the RA will 
administer a baseline assessment. At this assessment, the RA will explain that follow-up 
assessments will be administered at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks after the baseline 
assessment. The RA also explains that patients will be compensated $30 for each set of 
completed assessments. Caregivers will be compensated $20 for each set of 
assessments.

 20INTERVENTION 
 
PATH-MCI :  
PATH-MCI follows the process model of emotion regulation. According to this model, 
emotions such as those associated with depression, can be regulated with five broad 
strategies: situation selection (selecting the situations a person is exposed to), situation 
modification (changing potentially emotion-eliciting situations), attentional deployment 
(shifting one’s attention within a situation), cognitive change (changing how one thinks 
about a situation), and response modulation (utilizing direct efforts to alter one’s 
emotional responses). In conjunction with these strategies, PATH-MCI incorporates a 
simplified problem-solving approach, compensatory strategies, environmental 
adaptations and significant other involvement to achieve emotion regulation. At the end 
of treatment, PATH-MCI therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73783] a personalized summary of 
treatment that highlights the problems that were addressed and the successful 
techniques that were used to solve them.  
 
Comparison Condition : Supportive Therapy:   
ST is a control intervention not aimed to improve emotion regulation. The ST therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384878] a positive alliance with the patient by [CONTACT_384896]-specific 
therapeutic interactions and techniques that convey to the patient, interest, concern and 
understanding. For the purposes of this study, an effort will be made to avoid all 
emotion regulation techniques that relate to PATH-MCI.  
 
FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 
Follow-up assessments are conducted by [CONTACT_384897] 6,12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks 
after the baseline and include measures of mood, cognition and suicidal ideation. 
Patients will receive $30 (cash, check or gift card) as compensation for assessment 
completion at each time point. Study partners will receive $20 (cash, check or gift card) 
as compensation for assessment completion at each time point. 
 
 
PROCEDURES FOR TREATMENT AFTER STUDY COMPLETION  
Patients whose follow-up assessments indicate a need for continued mental health 
services will be provided with mental health referrals.  
 
 
 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/[ADDRESS_481407]. Kiosses will train two LCSWs in PATH-MCI (or more if needed). Training will consist of a 
one-day workshop with didactics, role-play and review of previously audiotaped sessions. 
After the workshop, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_38556] [ADDRESS_481408] achieve a score of 
greater than or equal to 4 (very good) out of 5 on the PATH-MCI Adherence Scale.

patient has access to Internet.  The consenting process would be the same as in-person 
consent, with a member of the study team speaking with the patient over the phone or 
videoconference to explain the consent in detail.  The consent form may also be mailed to the 
potential participant with a self-addressed stamped envelope to return to the study team.  
Research assessments and both interventions (PATH-MCI and ST-CI) can take place over the 
phone and/or videoconference.  Therapy visits will be conducted in a private room (home or 
office) and sessions will be recorded only if subjects have consented to that.   
Research assessments will also take place in a private room with no one else present; if 
patients do not have access to video, some assessments may not be able to be completed in 
full.  Please reference most recent Assessment Grid for list of assessments that can be done 
remotely and via which method (phone and/or video).  
 
If the study is being conducted remotely, the genetics blood draws cannot be done.

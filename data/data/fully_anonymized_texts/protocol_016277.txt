1.1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
 
Patients with recurrent or persistent  endometrial adenocarcinoma  with the following histologic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_662432]: endometrioid  adenocarcinoma,  serous adenocarcinoma, 
undifferentiated   carcinoma,   clear cell adenocarcinoma,   mixed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_362897],  
adenocarcinoma  not otherwise  specified (N.O.S.), mucinous  adenocarcinoma,  squamous cell 
carcinoma,  transitional  cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma. 
 
Patients  must have had at least one but no more  than four prior chemotherapeutic   regimens   for 
management  of endometrial  carcinoma (including adjuvant chemotherapy).  Initial treatment  may 
include   chemotherapy,   chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy,  and/or  consolidation/maintenance  
therapy, and chemotherapy administered  in conjunction  with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer 
WILL  be counted  as a systemic   chemotherapy  regimen.  
 
Patients must have PI3K pathway activation defined  as EITHER of the following: 
 
1. Genomic  alteration resulting in loss of PTEN function including a) whole or partial gene 
deletion,  frame shift mutations,  or non-sense mutations.  Missense mutations  in PTEN will 
not be considered  qualifying.  
2. A previously  characterized   activating  mutation   in any component  of the pathway  including:  
PIK3CA,  AKT1,  PIK3R1,  PIK3R2,  mTOR  
 
Patients must also not have a known concurrent activating  RAS/RAF mutation  or loss of function 
alternation in NF1 of NF2 resulting in MAP kinase pathway activation.  Any mutational  profiling 
performed  in a CLIA  laboratory  either  as routine  standard  of care or as part of a dedicating  
genomic   profiling  study  such as MSKCC  IRB#  12-245 will be accepted.  
 
LY3023414  will be administered   orally  at the Recommended   Phase  2 Dose  (RP2D)  of 200mg  BID 
on a continuous  basis. One cycle equals [ADDRESS_893987]  1.1.

2.2 SECONDARY  OBJECTIVES  
 
The secondary  objectives  of this study  are as follows:  
 
1. To determine  the clinical benefit  rate (CBR) of LY3023414  therapy, defined as the 
percentage  of patients  with complete  response  (CR)  + partial  response  (PR) + stable  
disease  (SD) ≥12 weeks  from the start of treatment.  
2. To determine  progression free survival  (PFS), defined  as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of recurrence, progression,  or death due to any cause, whichever  occurs 
first. . 
3. To determine  overall survival  (OS), defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
until the date of death  due to any cause.  
4. To determine   the duration  of response  (DOR)  of LY3023414  therapy,  defined  as the time 
from which measurement  criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever  status is recorded first) 
until the first date of documented  disease  progression.  
5. To assess  the safety  profile  and tolerability  of LY3023414  therapy  in patients  with PI3K  
activated   recurrent/persistent   endometrial   cancer.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_893988]  platform,   pretreatment   archival  tumor  tissue  will be obtained  for this 
purpose.  Consent  for this testing,   to be performed  in the CLIA  laboratory,  will be 
obtained  through  a companion  study  MSKCC  IRB#  12-245. 
2. Serial  pre-, on- and post-treatment  blood  samples  will be collected  for cell-free tumor  
DNA analysis  and the results descriptively correlated to clinical outcome. 
3. Patients  who respond  to therapy  and then progress  will be offered  consent  to MSKCC  
IRB#  12-[ADDRESS_893989]-progression  material  for molecular   profiling  
in order  to determine   the mechanism(s)   underlying  acquired  resistance.  
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
The phosphatidylinositol   3-kinase/mammalian  target  of rapamycin  (PI3K/mTOR)  pathway  has 
been reported  as activated  in >70%  of human  cancers  and has emerged  as a promising  target  for 
anticancer   therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   PI3K/mTOR  signaling  plays  a central  role in regulating  physiological  
processes such as growth, survival,  proliferation,  and metabolism,  and in the development  of 
malignant  disease (Bjornsti and Houghton 2004;  Samuels and Ericson 2006 ).

PI3K  phosphorylates   phosphatidylinositol -4,5-bisphosphate   (PIP2)  to generate  
phosphatidylinositol -3, 4, 5-trisphosphate,   a lipid second  messenger,  which  binds  the 
serine/threonine   kinase  AKT,  and its activating  kinase,  3-phosphoinositide -dependent   kinase  1 
(PDK-1) (Corvera and Czech 1998 ), which partially activates AKT.  AKT controls cell survival, 
proliferation,  and invasion via numerous  downstream targets, including mTOR (Stahl et al. 2004; 
Cheng  et al. 2005;  Meier  et al. 2005).   The mTOR  kinase  exists  in 2 complexes,   mTORC1  and 
mTORC2.  The mTORC1 complex is activated downstream of PI3K/AKT signaling,  stimulates 
protein  translation  by [CONTACT_17906]  p70S6 kinase  and eIF4E,  and is disrupted  by [CONTACT_662446]  (rapalogs).  The mTORC2 complex completes the activation of AKT by 
[CONTACT_662447]-473 residue.  Pharmacological  inhibition of 
PI3K/mTOR blocks tumor growth and survival  signaling in a variety of different  tumor xenograft 
models (Courtney et al. 2010 ).  Inhibition of PI3K/mTOR also blocks the metabolic  actions of 
insulin,  including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis,  resulting in increased blood glucose 
and compensatory  release  of insulin  (and C-peptide) from pancreatic  cells (Katso  et al. 2001).  
Hence,  it is important   to evaluate  in the clinic   the adverse  events  (AEs)  on such metabolic  
pathways when novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitors  are being investigated. 
 
Targeting  the PI3K/mTOR  pathway  represents  an attractive  strategy  in patients  with tumor  types  
harboring  an activating  alteration  of the PI3K/mTOR  signaling  pathway.   There  are several  
mechanisms  that lead to aberrant activation of this pathway including mutations  of growth factor 
receptors,  PIK3CA,  or loss of the tumor  suppressor,  PTEN  (Stambolic   et al. 1998;  Courtney  et al. 
2010).  In addition,  PI3K  amplification  and activating  mutations   in AKT,  PDK1,  RAS,  tuberous  
sclerosis  protein  1 and 2 (TSC1/2),  and mTOR  have been identified   as mechanisms   of 
PI3K/mTOR pathway activation (Samuels  and Ericson 2006 ). Frequent activating aberrations of 
PI3K/mTOR  signaling  have been reported  amongst  others  for breast  cancer,  mesothelioma,   non-

small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC),  and endometrial   cancers  (Opi[INVESTIGATOR_662433]. 2008;  Courtney  et al. 2010;  
Miller  et al. 2011;  Varghese et al. 2011 ).   To date, no dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor  has been 
approved  for therapy.   However,  several  molecules   are currently  under  investigation  in Phase  [ADDRESS_893990] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Monotherapy with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors  is of interest in tumor types with a particular  high 
incidence  of aberrant PI3K pathway activation. 
 
Endometrial   Carcinoma   Background  
 
Endometrial cancer is the second leading cause of death from gynecologic  cancer with an 
estimated  8,590 women  dying  in the United  Stated  annually  (Siegel  et al. 2014)).  Carboplatin  and 
paclitaxel is the standard first-line  treatment regimen (Miller  et al. 2012)  for advanced recurrent or 
persistent  disease.  There  are no FDA  approved  treatments   for patients  who progress  on first line 
therapy. Response rates for commonly used off label therapi[INVESTIGATOR_662434], 
topotecan,  weekly  paclitaxel,   and bevacizumab   range  between  approximately  0-10%  (Muggia   et 
al. 2002;  Miller   et al. 2002;  Lincoln  et al. 2003;  Aghajanian  et al. 2011).  As a result,  there is 
tremendous   opportunity  for the development   of rationally  therapeutic   agents  in the 
recurrent/persistent   endometrial  cancer  space.  Detailed   genomic   characterization  of endometrial  
cancer  has identified   the phosphatidylinositol   3-kinase/mammalian  target  of rapamycin  
(PI3K/mTOR)  pathway  as central  to endometrial  cancer  pathogenesis.   The TCGA  found  the PI3K  
pathway  to be activated  in 84% of primary  surgical  endometrial   cancer  specimens   (Figure   2, 
Cancer  Genome  Atlas  Research  Network,  2013).  
 
 
 
 
 
Inactivation of the PTEN tumor-suppressor  gene is the most common genetic defect in endometrial 
cancers  and is present  in 30−83%  of tumors  (Mutter  et al. 2000;  Oda et al. 2005).  Mutations  in the 
catalytic   p110α  subunit   of PI3K  are found  in approximately  30-40% of endometrial  cancers,  and 
these mutations  are most frequent in tumors that also bear phosphatase and tensin homolog  
(PTEN) mutations  (Hayes et al. 2006;  Salvesen et al. 2009 ).  With regard to endometrial  cancer 
subtypes, PIK3CA mutations  are found in 15% of serous cancers (Hayes et al. 2009 ). Somatic 
mutations  in the PIK3R1 have been found in 43% of endometrioid  (Type I) endometrial cancer  
and 12% of non-endometrioid   (Type  II) endometrial  cancer  (Cheung  et al. 2011;  Urick  et al. 
2011).  The PIK3R2  (p85α  is also frequently  mutated  (Cheung  et al. 2011).  Mutant  p85 α  proteins  
are believed  to activate  the PI3K  pathway  as five of seven  different   p85 α  mutants   expressed  in 
cell lines were associated  with increased  p-AKT  levels   compared  to cells expressing  wild- type 
p85α  (Urick  et al. 2011).

Dual  PI3K/mTOR   Inhibition   Endometrial   Cancer:  
The results  of a single   arm phase  II study  of GDC -0980  were presented  at the ASCO  2014 Annual  
Meeting (Makker et al. 2014, Abstract 5513). MSKCC lead enrollment  to this multicenter  study. 
Anti-tumor  activity was observed in a high proportion of evaluation  subjects with the majority of 
subjects with tumor regression harboring an identifiable  mutation in PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT1, 
PIK3R1,  or PIK3R  (Figure  3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of PI3K pathway activation among all enrolled subjects was 67%, approximately 20% 
lower  than the rate reported  by [CONTACT_662448]   a high proportion  of patients  who are 
likely  to be surgically  cured.  Moreover,  7/56 (12.5%)  of patients  harbored  concurrent   KRAS  
mutations  which would be predicted to confer resistance to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.  The 
observations  of a lower rate of PI3K pathway activation in recurrent endometrial cancer patients as 
well as concurrent KRAS mutations  support the need to prospectively screen patients with a 
comprehensive  genomic  assay prior to clinical trial enrollment.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high proportion of 
objective responses in evaluable  patients, clinical  benefit to GDC-0980 in this study was limited 
by [CONTACT_662449].   Rates  of Grade  ≥3 hyperglycemia   were 9/13 (69%)  and 15/43  (35%)  in

diabetics  and non-diabetics,   respectively.   As a result,  the median  duration  of treatment   for 
diabetics  on study  was only 36 days.  Poorly  crafted  eligibility  criteria  likely  played  an important  
role in this outcome  as diabetics  with an HgA1c  ≤ 8.5 g/dL were permitted  to enroll.  Of note, the 
frequency  of severe  hyperglycemia   observed  to date in the first-in-human  Phase  I study  of 
LY3023414  has been much  lower  than GDC -0980 (see Investigational   Brochure),  suggesting  
LY3023414  will be better  tolerated  in this patient  population.  
Tumor  Genetic Profiling   at MSKCC  
In January  2014 MSKCC  received  New  York  State  CLIA -approval  for a next generation  Ilumina  
HiSeq  exon-capture  based  platform  (“MS K-IMPACT”)  which  offers  complete  coverage  of [ADDRESS_893992]  translocations   (see gene list in supplied   Appendix  for IRB 12-245). Importantly,   MSK - 
IMPACT covers all genes relevant to the PI3K pathway including PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, 
PIK3R2, AKT1, and mTOR as well as genomic  alterations  which would be expected to confirm 
resistance to PIK3CA/mTOR inhibitors  including those in the MAPK pathway (RAS, RAF, 
MAP2K,  NF1,  NF2). All metastatic   endometrial  cancers  are consented  to an IRB-approved  center  
wide genomic   profiling  protocol  and screened  via the CLIA -approved  MSK -IMPACT  and the 
results entered into the medical record. As a result, MSKCC is uniquely positioned  to 
prospectively  identify  PI3K  pathway  activated  endometrial  cancer  patients  early in their disease  
course.  
LY3023414  Summary  
 
LY30234 14 is an orally available,  potent selective  inhibitor  of the class I PI3K isoforms,  mTOR, 
and DNA -PK. LY3023414  binds  the adenosine   triphosphate   (ATP)  active  site of PI3K  to  
competit ively inhibit  phosphorylation of phosphatidylinosito l-4,  5-bisphosphate at low nanomolar 
concentrations.    LY3023414  has demonstrated  inhibitory  activity  against  PI3K  and mTOR,  
antiproliferat ive  activity,  and cell-cycle  effects in cultured  cancer cells.   LY3023414  achieves 
good oral exposure and displayed in vivo target inhibit io n in xenograft  tumors, as well as efficacy 
in 3 tumor  xenograft  models,  a transgenic  mutant PI3K-driven leukemia  model,  and multiple 
patient derived xenografts,  including  mesothelio ma  and squamous non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC).  In the transgenic  mutant PI3K-driven leukemia  model, combination  studies with 
LY3023414  and standard of care agents, demonstrated  synergy  with LY30234 14 plus 
gemcitabine  or paclitaxel.   Combinat ions  of LY3023414  with rapamycin  were synergistic  in 
U87MG  and NCI-H1975 xenograft   models.  
 
Safety Pharmacology  
Nonclinical  Toxicology  
LY3023414  was evaluated   in nonclinical  toxicology  studies  up to 1 month  in duration  using  
daily oral dosing  in rats and dogs to characterize   the toxicity.   Based  on results  from nonclinical  
studies in the rat and the dog, toxicities  patients  may experience  include  (but are not limited  to) 
gastrointestinal  toxicity,  bone marrow and lymphoid  organ toxicity (decreases in lymphocytes), 
and sores/scabbing of the skin. Pharmacologic effects of PI3K/mTOR inhibition related to glucose 
metabolism have also been observed, including hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and QT interval 
prolongation   in nonclinical  studies.    In a rat embryo -fetal developmental  pi[INVESTIGATOR_662435]: 15 -079 A(12)

LY3023414,  embryo -fetal lethality  was seen along  with an increase  in fetal and litter  incidence   of 
external,   visceral,  and skeletal  malformations.  
 
For additional  details  on nonclinical  toxicology  data, see Section  5.2.1 of  the Investigator’s  
Brochure   (IB). 
Nonclinical  Efficacy  Pharmacology   Summary  
LY3023414  is a potent selective  inhibitor  of the class I PI3K isoforms  mTOR and DNA-PK, with 
selectivity in kinase enzyme  assays as an ATP competitive  inhibitor  of PI3K (Ki 8.5nM). 
LY3023414  demonstrated  inhibitory activity against PI3K/mTOR pathway targets in vitro and in 
vivo as measured  by [CONTACT_662450].   LY3023414  
showed  antiproliferative   and cell-cycle   arresting  effects  in cultured   cancer  cells, and anti- 
angiogenesis  activity via inhibition of in vitro vascular cord formation.   LY3023414  has excellent 
solubility  and oral bioavailability  across  a wide pH range,  allowing  for simple   suspension  
formulations  to be used for oral administration in nude mice.  In xenograft  tumor models, 
LY3023414  demonstrated  dose- and time-dependent  target inhibition,  as well as antitumor  efficacy 
in a wide range of tumor models (including renal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma 
[NSCLC]).   The mouse  pharmacokinetic   (PK)/pharmacodynamics   (PDx)  model  indicates   a direct  
inhibition of downstream target phosphoproteins  (such as, phospho Akt [pAkt], phospho 70S6K 
[p70S6K]).   LY3023414  has potential  for combination  with standard  of care agents  to produce  
synergistic   effects  in cell culture  and in vivo xenograft   models.  
 
 
Nonclinical  Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics  
The nonclinical  PK profile   of LY3023414  was characterized   in mice,  rats, and dogs.   Data from 
these  studies  were used to predict  human  PK via allometric   scaling.   The predicted  mean  human  
clearance  (CL)  is 16.3 L/h (90%  CI: 13.5 to 19.9)  and the predicted  central  and peripheral  volumes  
of distribution  (V) are 61 L (90%  CI: 53 to 70) and 1200  L (90%  CI: 0 to 12,000),  respectively.  
The predicted effective  half-life  (t1/2) in humans  is 2.6 hours with a terminal elimination  t1/2 of 600 
hours,  reflecting  <8%  of the dose.   The predicted  bioavailability  (74%)  allows  for once daily (QD)  
or twice  daily (BID)  oral dosing.   Bioavailability  was constant  across  preclinical   species  tested,  
and the predicted efficacious  doses in humans  are below the predicted maximum absorbable dose. 
The in vitro  metabolism  of LY3023414  was evaluated  in rat, mouse,  dog, and human  liver 
microsomes   and in cryopreserved  hepatocytes.   LY3023414  was the major  in vitro  component  
observed  in each species,  based  on the mass  spectrometry  (MS)  signal.    Metabolism  was primarily  
oxidative  (O-desmethyl,  N-desmethyl, and parent + O) in both animals  and humans. No Phase II 
conjugates  were identified.  
 
 
Preliminary  studies  were conducted  to evaluate   in vivo metabolism   of LY3023414  in rat plasma,  
bile, urine,  and feces  and in dog plasma.    In vivo LY3023414  appears  to be predominantly  cleared  
by [CONTACT_662451], urine,  and 
feces.   LY3023414  was the largest  circulating  entity  in both rat and dog plasma  along  with 
oxidative   and conjugative   metabolites.    The in vivo results  qualitatively  correlated  well with the in 
vitro  results.

Ongoing  Studies  and Clinical  Safety  
 
One Phase  I study  I6A-MC-CBBA  (Study  CBBA)  of LY3023414  is ongoing.    Study  CBBA  is a 
multicenter,   nonrandomized,   open-label,  First-in-Human   dose escalation   study  followed   by [CONTACT_662452]3023414  in patients  with advanced  and/or  metastatic  cancer.   Study  CBBA  
was designed  to evaluate   the safety  and tolerability  of LY3023414  administered   orally  over 21 
days (one cycle).  
 
 
As of [ADDRESS_893993]-human -dose 
Study  CBBA.   Of these  patients,  a total of 40 patients  (83%)  experienced   at least 1 possibly  study  
drug-related,  treatment -emergent   adverse  event  (TEAE).    The most common  possibly  LY3023414 - 
related  AEs reported  in at least 10% of patients  included   nausea  (37.5%),  fatigue   (31.3%),  
vomiting  (27.1%),  diarrhea  (16.7%),  decreased  appetite  (14.6%),  anemia  (14.6%),  stomatitis  
(12.5%),  and asthenia  10.4%).  Most  of these  events  were graded  as mild or moderate  by [CONTACT_4520].  
 
 
Dose -limiting  toxicities   for LY3023414  QD dosing  have been reported  at 450 mg LY3023414  in 3 
out of 3 patients, including 1 case each of thrombocytopenia  (Grade 4), hypotension (Grade 3), and 
hyperkalemia   (Grade  3).  Therefore,  a dose of 325 mg LY3023414  was defined  as the maximum  
tolerated  dose (MTD)  for QD dosing.    For BID dosing,   Dose -limiting   toxicities   (DLTs)  were 
observed  in 3 out of 4 patients  at the 250 mg BID LY3023414  dose in the form of 
hypophosphatemia   (Grade  4), fatigue,   and  mucositis   (Grade  3; all n = 1).  At the next lower  dose 
level of 200 mg BID, 1 out of 6 patients  experienced  a DLT in the form of nausea  (Grade  2; n = 
1).  Therefore,  a dose of 200 mg LY3023414  was defined  as the MTD  for BID dosing.  
 
 
At doses up to and including the MTD for QD and BID dosing (n = 31 p atients), no study drug 
related  Grade  [ADDRESS_893994] been observed  in 
those patients, including 1 case each of fatigue,  hyperglycemia,  hypokalemia,  neutropenia, 
hypomagnesemia,   and anemia  (anemia   occurred  in a patient  entering  the study  with Grade  2 
anemia).  
 
 
Initial clinical LY3023414  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD) data showed that 
LY3023414  maximum  plasma  concentration   (Cmax) and area under  the plasma   concentration -time 
curve  (AUC ∞) increased  approximately   dose-proportionally  from 20 to 325 mg QD (that is within  
the QD dose range  determined   to be safe).   However,  the Cmax and AUC ∞ increase  was greater  than 
dose proportional  at 450 mg QD (i.e., that is at the dose exceeding  the MTD).   LY3023414  PK 
data following  repeated  BID dosing  (dose  range  of 150 to 250 mg BID)  were consistent   with PK 
data following  20 to 325 mg QD. The oral clearance  (CL/F)  ranged  from approximately  77 to 130 
L/hour across the 20 to 325 mg dose range associated with an oral volume  of distribution (V/F) 
ranging  from 185 to 315 L in that same  dose range.   This clearance  and volume   lead to mean  half- 
life (t1/2) of 2.07 hours (coefficient  of variation  [CV] = 45%, n = 35), consistent  with the 
prediction.

The relative   contribution  of microsomal  CYP -mediated  clearance  of LY3023414  was studied  in 
vitro using  human  liver  microsomes.    Based  on a substrate  depletion  approach,  CYP  3A4 and 
CYP1A2  are responsible   for 82% and 18% of hepatic  CYP -mediated  clearance  of LY3023414,  
respectively.   No in-vivo  data are yet available. 
 
 
The recent data from study CBBA indicate  that LY3023414  is a weak inhibitor  of CYP3A4. 
Concomitant  administration of LY3023414  and midazolam lead to increase in midazolam 
exposure  (fold increase:  mean  1.459 [CV 30.5 %] [90%  CI 1.21 – 1.76]).   Hence  LY3023414  may 
lead to increase  in exposure  of CYP3A4  substrate.   Considering  that CYP2C8, not CYP3A4,  is the 
most relevant  and major enzyme  responsible  for enzalutamide  clearance and that the inhibitory 
effect  of LY3023414  on CYP3A4  is weak,  it is not anticipated   that enzalutamide   exposure  will be 
significantly  increased  (i.e. > 1.5 fold change)  after coadministration  with LY3023414.  
 
 
Biomarker assessment  demonstrated target inhibition as measured by p4EBP1 inhibition in 
peripheral  blood  mononuclear   cells (PBMC)  at LY3023414  dose levels  greater  or equal  to [ADDRESS_893995] to anti-tumor  activity,  clinical benefit  was observed in 
patients treated on both schedules of LY3023414,  including 1 patient with a confirmed  partial 
response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and 10 additional 
patients  (26.3%)  who demonstrated   a decrease  in their tumor  target  lesion  as best response  to 
LY3023414  monotherapy  in the dose-escalation  part of Study  CBBA.  
Based  on the safety  and tolerability,   pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic   (PK/PD),  and preliminary  
activity  data outlined   above,  the recommended   dose for LY3023414  is 200 mg BID. 
 
Based  on results  from this study,  the safety  data for this protocol  has been updated.  One patient  
was treated  until Cycle  2 Day 10 when  she presented  with coronavirus,   unrelated   to protocol  
treatment.  Following  this, on Cycle  2 Day 16, the patient  was admitted  with grade  4 fever,  grade  3 
hypokalemia  and acute decline in mental status – treatment  with intravenous  Vancomycin,  Zosyn, 
and Acyclovir   was started.  Grade  3 hypokalemia   was attributed   to drug versus  secondary  to 
malignancy.  Throughout  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  patient was continuously febrile  (grade 1-2) for [ADDRESS_893996] day in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],   thrombocytopenia   was grade  4. Hemolytic  
Uremic Syndrome /TTP and hemolysis  were ruled out. Etiology was felt secondary to infection, 
cancer  or possibly  trial drug related.  
New  onset  of grade  3 hypertension  occurred  while  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662436].  
Etiology  of mental  status  change  remained  unclear.  The neurology  team  was consulted.   EEG was 
negative   for seizure.  MRI of the brain  was positive   for white  matter  changes  raising  concerning  for

a demyelinating process such as Multiple  Sclerosis, but overall this did not explain patient’s 
clinical presentation.  EMG and Anti N-methyl-D-aspartate  were negative  and no evidence of 
neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome was found. Patient was treated with empi[INVESTIGATOR_662437] 3 doses of Methylprednisolo ne,  which ultimately led to resolution of the fevers and 
improvement  in mental status. Based on all tests and results, the source of fevers and altered 
mental  status  was felt to be paraneoplastic   versus  virus -mediated   versus  possibly  related  to trial 
drug.  
Patient was discharged  to an inpatient  rehabilitation center on 12/4/[ADDRESS_893997]  Investigator’s   Brochure  (IB). 
 
Rationale  for LY3023414  in PI3K -Activated  Endometrial   Cancer  
 
MSKCC  has been instrumental   in the early phase  development   of this molecule   and was one of 
only [ADDRESS_893998]-in-human  Phase  I study.  During  the dose escalation  portion  of 
this study  2/4 endometrial   cancer  patients  treated  at ≥50%  of the MTD  experienced  RECIST  tumor  
regressions   of ≥20%  (personal  communication,   V. Wacheck , Lilly).   Representative   images   and 
tumor  marker  trends  for one patient  are shown  in Figure  4. This patient  has both PTEN  loss and 
PIK3R1 mutation and remains on therapy after 7 cycles. MSKCC’s early experience with 
LY3023414  will also help ensure  that this early phase  asset is managed  safely  in the context  of an 
investigator  initiated  trial

Study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied per section 6.0. Enrolled  patients 
will take LY3023414  200 mg orally  twice  a day. Each  cycle  will be 21 days in duration.  
Patients will receive study treatment  until disease progression,  intolerable  toxicity, 
elective  withdrawal from the study, study completion,  or study termination 
 
Efficacy  assessments will be performed every 2 cycles from initiation of study 
treatment  until disease  progression.   Safety  will be evaluated   in this study  through  
the monitoring  of all serious  and non-serious   AEs, graded  according  to the current  
version  of the National  Cancer  Institute   Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  
Events.  
 
Each  dose should  be taken  with a minimum   of 8 ounces  of water.  Patients  should  take the 
morning  and evening  doses  of LY3023414  approximately  12 hours  apart  (preferably  within  
a 10- to 14-hour range).  
 
Patients  should  not consume  food for approximately  1 hour before  taking  the dose of 
LY3023414.  If a dose is vomited  within one hour of ingestion,  it will be replaced. If 
vomiting  occurs  more  than 1 hour after dosing,  it will be considered  a complete  dose and 
will not be replaced.  If a patient  misses  a dose,  the patient  should  skip that dose and resume  
dosing  with the next scheduled  dose.

7.1 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential  research  subjects  willl      be identified   by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator   or research  team  within  the Gynecologic   Medical  Oncology  Group  at 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Patient recruitment  will  occur in the 
Gynecologic   Medical  Oncology  clinics   at MSKCC.  The investigator   will discuss  the study  with 
suitable   participants,   and should  the patient  consent  to proceed  with protocol  therapy,  will enroll  
their patient’s in the research study. Based on historical accrual rates in similar  populations,  we 
anticipated  successful enrollment  of [ADDRESS_894013] activation defined  as EITHER of the following:

1. Genomic  alteration resulting in loss of PTEN function including a) whole or partial gene 
deletion,  frame shift mutations,  or non-sense mutations.  Missence mutations  in PTEN will 
not be considered  qualifying.  
2. A previously  characterized   activating  mutation   in any component  of the pathway  including:  
PIK3CA,  AKT1,  PIK3R1,  PIK3R2,  mTOR  
 
Patients must also not have a known concurrent activating RAS/RAF mutation  or loss of function 
alternation in NF1 of NF2 resulting in MAP kinase pathway activation. 
 
Any mutational  profiling  performed  in a CLIA  laboratory  either  as routine   standard  of care or as 
part of a dedicated  genomic   profiling  study  such as MSKCC  IRB#  12-[ADDRESS_894014] not had mutational  profiling performed in a CLIA laboratory or as part of a 
prior genomic   profiling  study,  formally  consenting  to MSKCC  IRB#  12-[ADDRESS_894015] activating mutation as detailed above. 
 
Patients  who respond  to therapy  and then progress  will be offered   a consent  to MSKCC  IRB#  12- 
[ADDRESS_894016]-progression  material  for molecular   profiling  in order  to 
determine   the mechanism(s)   underlying  acquired  resistance.   Participation  in this companion  study  
is optional  for enrolled  patients.   IRB#  12-245 Part B is a separate  consent,  but it is similar   to IRB#

9.1 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.2 Treatment  
 
LY3023414  200 mg will be dosed  orally  twice  a day. Each  cycle  will be 21 days in 
duration.   Patients will receive study treatment  until disease progression,  intolerable  
toxicity,  elective  withdrawal from the study, study completion,  or study termination.  In 
limited   circumstances   patients  may be treated  beyond  progression  if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_662440],   the patient  is benefiting  from treatment.   Approval  from Eli Lilly will 
be required  in these  circumstances.  
 
LY3023414  should  be taken  approximately  12 hours  apart.  Patients  should  not consume  
food for approximately  1 hour before  taking  the dose of LY3023414.  If a dose is vomited  
within one hour of ingestion,  it will be replaced. If vomiting occurs more than 1 hour after 
dosing,  it will be considered  a complete  dose and will not be replaced.  
 
Concomitant   medication   and treatment  
 
Concomitant   medication  is defined   as any prescription   or over-the-counter   preparation,  
including  vitamins   and supplements.   Patients  may continue   their baseline   medication(s).  
All concomitant   medication(s)   must be recorded.  Any diagnostic,   therapeutic   or surgical  
procedure performed  during the study period should  be recorded, including  dates, 
description  of the procedure(s) and any clinical  findings. 
 
LY3023414  is a weak inhibitor  of cytochrome P450 3 A4 (CYP3A4) in patients and 
thereby  [CONTACT_662459]  (decreases)  the metabolic   clearance  of drugs  that are metabolized   through  
CYP3A4 (See also IB Section 6.1.2 ). The clinical implications  of this risk have yet to be 
determined.   Patients should avoid taking concomitant  medications  that are CYP3A4 
substrates (for example,  midazolam). 
 
Investigators  should  monitor patients  for unexpected clinical adverse effects as a result of 
unexpected high exposure to LY3023414  due to any potential interaction of concomitant 
medicat ions  with LY3023414.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
The dose delay  and reduction  instructions   provided  in Tables  11A and 11B are intended  to 
serve as guidelines  to allow ongoing treatment  for patients experiencing clinical  benefit 
without   signs or symptoms   of progression  while   ensuring  patient  safety.  Patients  may 
temporarily  suspend  dosing  of LY3023414  for up to 14 days if they experience   toxicity  that 
is considered  related  to LY3023414  and requires  that a dose be held. Patients  who miss ≥ 
[ADDRESS_894020] clinical  benefit  for the patient. 
Exceptions   may be made  after discussion  with the approval  by [CONTACT_45822].  
Patients  may suspend  dosing  of study  drug for radiation  therapy  or surgery  that is 
considered by [CONTACT_662460]. After 
completion of the intervention,  patients may restart the study drug as long as all criteria for 
dosing  are met and there is no evidence  of disease  progression   (unless  approved  by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_662441]).

12.0  CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated   in this study  using  the new international  
criteria  proposed  by [CONTACT_28637]  (RECIST)  
guideline   (version  1.1) [22]. Changes  in the largest  diameter  (unidimensional  
measurement)  of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant 
lymph  nodes  are used in the RECIST  criteria.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_894023] their response  
classified  according to the definitions  stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit  objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable  Non-Target Disease Response. Patients who have lesions  present at baseline that 
are evaluable  but do not meet the definitions  of measurable  disease, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease reevaluated  will be considered evaluable 
for non-target  disease.  The response  assessment  is based  on the presence,  absence,  or 
unequivocal  progression  of the lesions.  
 
 
 
 
 
12.2 Disease  Parameters  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -079 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_894024] one dimension (longest  diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_894025] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_894026] scan, or >[ADDRESS_894027] be recorded  in millimeters   (or decimal  fractions   of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions   that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area will not be considered  
measurable   unless  progression  is documented   or a biopsy  is obtained  to confirm  persistence  
at least [ADDRESS_894028] be >[ADDRESS_894029] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness   recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline   and in follow -up,  only the 
short  axis will be measured  and followed.  
 
Non-measurable  disease. All other lesions  (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest   diameter  <10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis),  
are considered  non-measurable   disease.  Bone  lesions,   leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal  masses  (not followed   by [CONTACT_462]),  are considered  as non-measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic  lesions   that meet the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts should  
not be considered as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable nor non-measurable)  since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108],  simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic  lesions’  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  as measurable  
lesions,  if they meet the definition  of measurability  described  above.  However,  if non- 
cystic  lesions  are present  in the same  patient,  these  are preferred  for selection  as target  
lesions.  
 
Target  lesions.  All measurable   lesions  up to a maximum   of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 
lesions  in total, representative   of all involved   organs,  should  be identified   as target  lesions  
and recorded  and measured  at baseline.   Target  lesions   should  be selected  on the basis  of 
their size (lesions   with the longest  diameter),   be representative   of all involved   organs,  but 
in addition  should  be those  that lend themselves   to reproducible   repeated  measurements.   It 
may be the case that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does not lend itself to reproducible  
measurement  in which circumstance  the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly  should  be selected.  A sum of the diameters   (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  
short  axis for nodal  lesions)   for all target  lesions  will be calculated   and reported  as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included  in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added  into the sum. The baseline  sum diameters  will be used as reference  to further  
characterize  any objective  tumor regression in the measurable  dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions  (or sites of disease) including any measurable  lesions 
over and above  the 5 target  lesions  should  be identified   as non-target  lesions  and should  
also be recorded  at baseline.   Measurements   of these  lesions   are not required,  but the 
presence,  absence,  or in rare cases  unequivocal  progression  of each should  be noted  
throughout  follow-up.

12.3 Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
 
All measurements   should   be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline  evaluations  should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment  and never  more  than 4 weeks  before  the beginning  of the treatment.  The same  
method  of assessment  and the same  technique   should  be used to characterize   each  
identified   and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  followup.   Imaging -based   evaluation  is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_662461](s)  being followed  cannot 
be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
Clinical  lesions: Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial   (e.g.,  skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes)  and 10 mm diameter  as assessed  
using  calipers  (e.g.,  skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions,   documentation  by [CONTACT_105950],  including a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions  on chest  x-ray are acceptable  as measurable  lesions   when  they are 
clearly  defined  and surrounded  by [CONTACT_28638]. However,  CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI:  This guideline   has defined  measurability  of lesions   on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_894030] slice 
thickness   greater  than 5 mm, the minimum   size for a measurable   lesion  should  be twice  the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations  (e.g. for body  scans), but NOT 
lung. 
 
Use of MRI remains   a complex  issue.  MRI has excellent   contrast,  spatial,  and temporal  
resolution;  however,  there are many image acquisition variables  involved  in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality,  lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934],  and measurement.  Furthermore,  the 
availability  of MRI is variable   globally.   As with CT, if an MRI is performed,  the technical  
specifications   of the scanning  sequences  used should  be optimized   for the evaluation  of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore,   as with CT, the modality  used at follow -up  should  be 
the same  as was used at baseline  and the lesions  should  be measured/assessed   on the same  
pulse  sequence.  It is beyond  the scope of the RECIST  guidelines   to prescribe  specific   MRI 
pulse  sequence  parameters  for all scanners,  body  parts,  and diseases.  Ideally,   the same  type 
of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely 
as possible  to prior scans.  Body  scans  should  be performed  with breath -hold scanning  
techniques,   if possible.  
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- 
CT is not always  of optimal  diagnostic   CT quality  for use with RECIST  measurements.  
PET-CT scans  are not always  done  with oral and IV contrast.  In addition,  the PET portion  
of the CT introduces   additional  data which  may bias an investigator   if it is not routinely  or 
serially  performed.  For these  reasons,  the GOG  will not allow  PET-CT use for RECIST  1.1 
response  criteria.  
 
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment  of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measurement.  Ultrasound  examinations  cannot be reproduced in their entirety 
for independent   review  at a later date and, because  they are operator  dependent,  it cannot  
be guaranteed  that the same  technique   and measurements   will be taken  from one 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -079 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_894031] in selected  instances.  
 
Endoscopy,  Laparoscopy:  The utilization  of these  techniques   for objective  tumor  
evaluation  is not advised.  However,  such techniques   may be useful  to confirm  complete  
pathological  response  when  biopsies  are obtained  or to determine   relapse  in trials where  
recurrence  following  complete  response  (CR)  or surgical  resection  is an endpoint.  
 
CA125 (Ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_321853]): CA125 alone cannot 
be used to assess response. If CA125 is initially above the upper normal limit,  it must 
normalize  for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific  guidelines 
for CA-125 response  (in recurrent  ovarian  cancer)  have been published   (23) In addition;  
the Gynecologic   Cancer  Intergroup  has developed  CA-[ADDRESS_894032]-line  trials in ovarian  cancer  
(24). 
 
Cytology,  Histology: These techniques  can be used to differentiate  between partial 
responses  (PR) and complete  responses  (CR)  in rare cases  (e.g.,  residual  lesions  in tumor  
types,  such as germ  cell tumors,  where  known  residual  benign  tumors  can remain).  
 
The cytological  confirmation  of the neoplastic  origin  of any effus ion that appears  or 
worsens  during  treatment   when  the measurable   tumor  has met criteria   for response  or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate  between response or stable disease (an effusion 
may be a side effect  of the treatment)   and progressive   disease.  
 
FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments  need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement  CT scanning in 
assessment  of progression  (particularly  possible  'new'  disease).  New  lesions  on the basis  of 
FDG -PET imaging  can be identified   according  to the following  algorithm:  
 
a. Negative  FDG -PET at baseline,   with a positive   FDG -PET at follow -up  is a sign of PD 
based  on a new lesion.  
 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive  FDG- 
PET at follow -up  corresponds  to a new site of disease  confirmed   by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the 
positive   FDG -PET at follow -up  is not confirmed   as a new site of disease  on CT, additional  
follow -up  CT scans  are needed  to determine   if there is truly progression  occurring  at that 
site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the 
positive   FDG -PET at follow -up  corresponds  to a pre-existing  site of disease  on CT that is 
not progressing  on the basis  of the anatomic  images,   this is not PD. 
 
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade  a response  to a CR in a manner  similar   to a biopsy  in 
cases  where  a residual  radiographic   abnormality  is thought   to represent  fibrosis   or scarring.  
The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance  should be prospectively described in the protocol 
and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific  medical literature  for the indication.  However, it        
must be acknowledged   that both approaches  may lead to false positive   CR due to  
limitations  of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

Note:  A ‘positive’   FDG -PET scan lesion  means  one which  is FDG  avid with an uptake  
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
12.4 Response  Criteria  
 
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.   Any pathological  lymph  
nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must have reduction  in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters   of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
 
Progressive   Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters  of target  
lesions, taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this includes  the baseline  sum if that 
is the smallest   on study).  In addition  to the relative   increase  of 20%,  the sum must also 
demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progressions).  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient   shrinkage   to qualify  for PR nor sufficient   increase  
to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest   sum diameters  while  on study.  
 
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions   and normalization  of 
tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must be non-pathological  in size (<10 mm short 
axis).  Note:  If CA125  is initially  above  the upper  normal  limit,  it must normalize   for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical  response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)   and/or  maintenance   of 
CA125  level above  the normal  limits.  
 
Progressive   Disease  (PD):  Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or  unequivocal  
progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  Unequivocal   progression  should  not normally  
trump  target  lesion  status.  It must be representative   of overall  disease  status  change,  not a 
single   lesion  increase  
. 
 
Although  a clear progression  of “non-target”  lesions  only is exceptional,   the opi[INVESTIGATOR_662442],  and the progression status should 
be confirmed   at a later time by [CONTACT_28639]  (or Principal  Investigator).

Progression  can be based  upon  serum  CA-125, only during  the period  following  
completion of cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  if one of the three conditions  is met: 
 
1. Patients  with elevated  CA-[ADDRESS_894033] response  recorded  from the start of the treatment   until 
disease  progression/recurrence   (taking  as reference  for progressive   disease  the smallest  
measurements  recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend  on the achievement   of both measurement   and confirmation  criteria.

Duration  of Response  
Duration  of overall  response:  The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from the time 
measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent  or progressive   disease  is objectively  documented  (taking  as reference  for 
progressive   disease  the smallest   measurements   recorded  since the treatment   started).  The 
duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement  criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive   disease  is objectively  documented.  
 
Duration  of stable  disease:  Stable  disease  is measured  from the start of the treatment  until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest  measurements  recorded 
since the treatment  started, including the baseline measurements. 
 
Progression -Free Survival  
Progression-Free Survival  (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
to time of recurrence,  progression,  or death, whichever  occurs first. 
 
 
Survival  
Survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death or the 
date of last contact  
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Patients  may withdraw   from the study  at any time.  Any patient  who withdraws  will be 
encouraged to return to the study center for a treatment  completion visit.  Patients who accepted  as disease  progression.  
 
Note :  Patients  with a global  deterioration  of health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of 
treatment  without   objective   evidence  of disease  progression  at that time should  be reported  as 
“symptomatic  deterioration.”   Every  effort  should  be made  to document  the objective  
progression  even after discontinuation  of treatment.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -079 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_894034].  
 
Patients  may be withdrawn  from the study  if they experience  any of the following:  
• Disease  progression,   per investigator   assessment  
• Intolerable   toxicity  of LY3023414  
 
Other  reasons  for patient  discontinuation  may include,   but are not limited   to, the following:  
• Change in patient eligibility 
• Non-compliance  
• Patient  decision  
• If the patient  becomes  pregnant  
• If patient  requires  more  then 2 dose reductions  of LY3023414  
• If treatment  is delayed  for more  than 28 consecutive   days 
 
The investigator   has the right  to discontinue   a patient  from the study  for any medical  
condition  that the investigator   determines   may jeopardize  the patient’s  safety  if he or she 
continues   in the study;  for reasons  of noncompliance   (e.g.,  missed  doses,  visits);   or if the 
investigator   determines   it is in the best interest  of the patient.  
 
 
14.[ADDRESS_894035] 
overall  response  of CR or PR versus  not, a sample  size of 25 patients  provides  90% power  to test 
the hypothesis   that the response  rate is promising  (defined   as 30% or higher)   against  a non- 
promising rate of 10% or lower. This calculation  is based on historical  data from studies with 
ineffective  agents in a similar  patient population,  which have ORR < 10%  and PFS rate at 6 
months  < 20%  (Fracasso  et al, 2006,  Schilder  et al. 2004,  Garcia  et al. 2008  Aghajanian  et al, 
2011 ), and uses an exact, one-sample test for binomial  proportion, with Type I error=10%. At the 
end of the study,  if at least 5/25 responses  are observed  then this will be considered  a positive  
study  (i.e. conclude  that RR is >10%).  
 
Based  on historical   accrual  rates in similar   populations,   and with the increased  prior lines  of 
therapy that will not be allowed for eligibility,  we anticipate  successful enrollment  of 2 patients per 
month  yielding  a total accrual  time of 12 months.   Accrual  will continue   until 25 evaluable   for 
response  patients  are treated  (evaluable   patients  are defined  in section  12.1)  
 
 
In addition  we will report  the following  statistics:  
1. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) of LY3023414  therapy, defined as the percentage of 
patients  with complete  response  (CR)  + partial  response  (PR) + stable  disease  (SD)  ≥12

weeks  from the start of treatment  will be reported  and the 90% confidence   interval  will 
be estimated using exact binomial  proportions 
2. Progression   free survival  (PFS),  defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment  
to time of recurrence,   progression,  or death  due to any cause,  whichever   occurs  first. 
Patients  will be censored  at last follow   up date. The Kaplan  Meier  estimate   of median  
PFS will be reported.  
3. Overall survival  (OS), defined  as the duration of time from start of treatment until the 
date of death  due to any cause.  Patients  will be censored  at last follow   up date. The 
Kaplan  Meier  estimate   of median  OS will be reported.  
4. Tthe duration  of response  (DOR)  of LY3023414  therapy,  defined  as the time from 
which measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  status is recorded first) 
until the first date of documented  disease  progression,   will be estimated  using  the 
Kaplan  Meier  method.  Patients  without   documented  progression  will be censored  at last 
follow   up. 
5. Adverse  events  by [CONTACT_498285]  4 (CTCAE  v4.0)  will be tabulated  in order  to assess  the safety  profile  
and tolerability  of LY3023414  therapy  in patients  with PI3K  activated  
recurrent/persistent   endometrial  cancer.  
In addition  the study  will analyze   the following  variables  as part of assessing  exploratory  aims 
in a subset  of patients  who consent  to 12-245: 
1. For patients  who have not already  had their tumors  molecularly  profiled  using  the 
MSK -IMPACT  platform,   pretreatment   archival  tumor  tissue  will be obtained  for this 
purpose. Genomic alterations  defined by [CONTACT_245412]-IMPACT testing performed on this 
pretreatment   archival  tumor  tissue  will be correlated  to objective  responses  outcomes  in 
an exploratory  manner.   Consent  for this testing,   to be performed  in the CLIA   
laboratory,  will be obtained  through  a companion  study  MSKCC  IRB#  12-245. 
Genomic   alterations   will be binary  and Fisher's  exact  test will be used to assess  the 
correlation  between  genomic   alterations   and response  (binary).  
 
2. Serial  pre-, on- and post-treatment  blood  samples  will be collected  for cell-free tumor  
DNA analysis  and sequenced using continuous  quantitative  methods (digital droplet 
PCR  or hybridization  capture  next-generation   sequencing)   for the PI3K - pathway  
alterations   identified   by [CONTACT_094]-treatment  archival  tumor  testing  and descriptively  
correlated to clinical  outcome. Pre and post treatment samples will be assessed 
graphically   and pre treatment  archival  tumor  testing  will be assessed  graphically  with 
clinical outcome. 
 
3. Patients  who respond  to therapy  and then progress  will be offered  optional  consent  to 
MSKCC  IRB#  12-[ADDRESS_894036]-progression  material  for molecular  
profiling  in order  to determine   the mechanism(s)   underlying  acquired  resistance.  
A subset  analysis   of patients  who progress  and have post progression  material  for 
molecular   profiling  will be performed  in order  to determine   the mechanism(s)  
underlying  acquired  resistance.   Specifically,   we will be looking  for presence  of genetic  
alterations  which based on their understood biological  mechanism  may explain 
acquired  resistance  (for example,  second  “hits”  on the PI3K  pathway).

16.0  DATA   MANAGEMENTISSUES 
 
A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to study.  The responsibilities   of the RSA  
include  project compliance,  data collection,  extraction and data entry, data reporting, 
coordination of the activities  of the protocol study team and, and of the flow of regulatory 
paperwork.  
The data collected  for the study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (CRDB).  All routine  
blood  test results  required  per the protocol  will be captured  in CRDB  in addition  to 
baseline medical conditions  and disease informatio n,  response assessments, off-study 
documentation,  and toxicity grade and attribution.  Source documentation will be available 
to support  the computerized   patient  record.  
MSKCC  will hold the IND and will be responsible  for all safety  monitoring.  All SAEs  will 
be reported  to the MSKCC  IRB. The safety  of the study  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_662462].  
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  by [CONTACT_662463] [INVESTIGATOR_662444]. Routine   data quality  reports  
will be generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored 
periodically throughout  the study. Recurrent lapses in data collection,  deviations  or

violations will be discussed with the study team and a corrective plan will be generated. 
Accrual  goals  and factors  impacting  accrual  goals  will be discussed  at the weekly  New  
Patient/Protocol  meetings.  
 
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  was 
approved  by [CONTACT_483851]  2001. The plan addressed  the new 
policies   set forth by [CONTACT_362996]   "Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for data and safety monitoring of clinical  trials" which can be found at 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice - files/not98 -084.html.   The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  
were  established   and are monitored   by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  data 
and safety  monitoring  plan can be found  on the MSKCC  Internet  at 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC   Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans.pdf.  
There are several different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_662464], 
safety  and quality.    There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol monitoring,  compliance  and data verification audits, therapeutic  response, and 
staff education on clinical  research QA) and departmental procedures for quality 
control,  plus there are two institutional  committees   that are responsible   for monitoring  the 
activities  of our clinical  trials programs. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has set 
up three distinct  monitoring processes for our clinical  trials program. There are two sub- 
committees  that have the responsibility of data and safety monitoring.  These are joint sub- 
committees  with dual-reporting responsibilities.  The Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee   (DSMC)  is the sub-committee   responsible  for monitoring  all Phase  1, 2, 1/2, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase clinical trials. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is the 
sub-committee  responsible  for monitoring Phase 3 randomized  clinical  trials. The 
Therapeutic   Response  Review  Committee   (TRRC)  is the sub- committee   of Research  
Council  responsible   for the independent   therapeutic   response  review  for participants   in 
IRB/PB approved clinical trials where therapeutic  efficacy is a stated primary  objective; 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_362933]  2 and 3 trials.  Formal  monitoring  of such studies  is designed  to ensure  that 
the interests  of the participants   are being  scrutinized   on a regular  basis,  and that the trial is 
progressing  in a satisfactory  manner.  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee   (DSMC)  convenes  once per quarter  and 
monitors   the risk participants   are exposed  to, the progress  of the study,  the adequacy  of the 
data storage and whether sufficient  data are being entered into the CRDB. The DSMC 
monitors   phase  1, 2, 1/2, pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase  trials that are not being  monitored  by [CONTACT_662465], and which meet the NCI definition of a Clinical Trial. This trial will 
qualify  for monitoring  by [CONTACT_6802].  
During  the protocol  development   and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be

established   at the time of protocol  activation.   A detailed  description  of the data to be 
collected, process of data collection (i.e., data manager  and/or data management  office), 
database  that will be utilized   for data collection  and storage  (e.g.,  Clinical  Research  
Database  (CRDB),  user-supported  software),  reporting  requirements   of the data to the 
institution  (IRB),  the sponsor  and/or  governing   agency.

17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
 
 
17.1 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may alllow the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure   of 
protected health information will be limited  to the individuals  described in the Research 
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]   [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event(SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse event that results in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
• A persistent or significant  incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life  functions 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,   or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed   in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a planned procedure/disease  treatment is not considered an SAE. 
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon as the participant   signs consent.   SAE reporting  is required  
for 30-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment or intervention.  Any events 
that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  
must be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious 
Adve rse Events’,  the SAE report  must be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires a Clinical  Research Database (CRDB) SAE report be submitted 
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include   a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
[EMAIL_440] .   All other  reports  should  be sent to saemskind@  mskcc.org .

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Multicenter, Open -Label, Parallel -Group Clinical Study 
Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of MYL -1601D with NovoLog® in Type 1 
Diabetes Mellitus Patients.  
Background 
and Rationale  Mylan’s Insulin Aspart,  MYL -1601D,  injection [rDNA origin] is a rapid -acting 
human insulin analog used to lower blood glucose. MYL -1601D  is homologous 
with regular human insulin except for a single substitution of the amino acid 
proline by [CONTACT_399842] B28, and is produced by [CONTACT_399843][INVESTIGATOR_349539] (yeast). The current marketed US Insulin 
Aspart injection, NovoLog®, is homologous with regular human insulin except 
for a single substitution of the amino acid proline by [CONTACT_399844] i n position 
B28, and is produced by [CONTACT_399845] (baker's yeast) as the production organism.  
MYL -1601D is being developed as a biosimilar to US-licensed NovoLog® and 
EU-approved NovoRapid®. 
The aim of this tr ial is to demonstrate the equivalence in the safety and efficacy 
profile between MYL -1601D and NovoLog® in patients with T1DM. The trial 
design is an open -label since the two products have distinct packaging. To avoid 
any bias in the evaluation of the crit ical endpoints, immunogenicity , 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and F asting plasma glucose (F PG) will be 
analyzed at a central laboratory in a blinded manner. In addition, study personnel  
(Sponsor and select CRO  staff) will be blinded to the randomized assigned 
treatment arms.  
Primary 
Objectives  To demonstrate that immunogenicity as assessed by [CONTACT_399846] (TEAR) rate with MYL -1601D is equivalent to that of 
NovoLog® during 24-week treatment.   
The TEAR rate will not be assessed in isolation but will be part of totality of 
evidence including changes in HbA1c, F PG, insulin dose, neutralizing antibodies 
and injection site reactions to ensure that changes in TEAR rate, if any, are 
clinic ally meaningful.  
Primary 
endpoints  The TEAR rate during 24-week  treatment period is the primary endpoint for this 
study. TEAR is defined as either one of the following:  
1) subjects who are anti-drug antibody (ADA) negative at baseline and become 
positive at any timepoint post baseline  
2) Subjects who are ADA positive at baseline and demonstrate [ADDRESS_503842] baseline visit.  
Methodology 
and 
treatments  This is a multicenter, open -label , randomized, parallel -group phase 3 study  in 
subjects with T1DM comparing the safety and efficacy  of MYL -1601D with 
NovoLog®. 
After up to  3-week screening period, all subjects will be titrated on NovoLog® 
during a 4-week run -in period, and will be shifted from their current basal 
insulin to study insulin  Lantus®. After run -in period, subjects will be 
randomized; one group will re ceive MYL -1601D , while the other group will 
receive NovoLog® for [ADDRESS_503843] dose of MYL -1601D.  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 6 of 71

Sample size  Approximately 500 subjects with type 1 diabetes will participate in this trial. The 
sample size estimation is based on primary objective –  “to demonstrate that 
immunogenicity as assessed by [CONTACT_399851] -1601D is equivalent to 
that of NovoLog® during 24-week treatment ” as recommended by [CONTACT_1622].    
The 80% power will be achieved with 250 subjects per treatment arm to 
demonstrate that 90% confidence interval of treatment difference (MYL -1601D 
minus NovoLog®) is within prespecified ±  margin (Table 5) .  
Statistical 
Methods  The 90% confidence interval of treatment difference in TEAR rate will be 
established using Wald confidence limit method.  TEAR rate  with ADA of MYL -
1601D is equivalent to that of NovoLog® during 24- week treatment if 90%  
confidence interval of treatment difference is within pre-specified margin , the 
specific margin will be determined by [CONTACT_399852] ( Table 5) . For secondary continuous variables, a 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) -effects model will be performed.

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Indication  
MYL -1601D  is being developed as a follow -on biologic (US terminology) to the US -licensed 
NovoLog®. 
2.[ADDRESS_503863] -prandial surge. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by 
[CONTACT_394510]- producing beta -cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to 
a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of beta -cell loss is a T -cell mediated autoimmune 
attack  (de Graaff LC et al, 2007 ). The principal treatment of patients with T1DM is initiation 
of insulin and diet control and careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.  
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and other trials (Reichard P et al, 1993 ) 
provide conclusive evidence that maintaining tight glyc emic control can prevent or delay 
microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with T1DM. A number of 
different insulin regimens have been proposed for treatment of patients with T1DM. It is generally accepted that the so -called basal -bolus insulin regimen; 1 or 2 daily injections of 
long/intermediate -acting insulin covering basal insulin requirements in combination with 
3 daily injections of short -/rapid acting insulin to cover meal -related insulin requirements , 
generally yields the best glyce mic control in diabetes. Clear targets for plasma glucose levels 
have been recommended for basal -bolus insulin regimen s (American D iabet es 
Association  2019) .  
Different insulin preparations are available for management of b olus insulin requirements, 
includ ing; Api[INVESTIGATOR_27976]® (glulisine), Humalog® (lispro), NovoL og® (aspart) . Rapid -acting insulin 
analogs have proven efficacy and offer good glucose control via regimen of 1 to 3  
dose/injections per day . Insulin aspart  is a rapid -acting insulin analogue administered once to 
three times a day to cover bolus insulin requirements  per day.  
MYL -1601D ( Mylan insulin aspart) is a rapid -acting human insulin analog. The primary 
activity of insulin aspart is the regulation of glucose metab olism, it binds to the insulin 
receptors on muscle and fat cells, and it  leads to a decrease in blood glucose by [CONTACT_399854]. MYL -1601D is produced by [CONTACT_399855][INVESTIGATOR_349539]  
(yeast). The primary structure is identical to endogenous insulin, except for replacement of a single proline amino acid at position 28 in the C -terminal area of the insulin B -chain with an 
aspartic acid residue. This substitution weakens the natural tendency towards self -association 
between insulin monomers, thereby [CONTACT_399856]- cutaneous injection. 
The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the equivalence in the safety and efficacy profile between MYL -1601D and NovoLog
® in patients with T1DM  with primary focus on 
assessment of immunogenicity and its potential clinical impact on safety and efficacy .  
In case of prandial insulins like aspart, PK -PD study using a n euglycemic clamp is a very 
sensitive and robust tool to assess potential differences in efficacy between biosimilar 
products versus traditional endpoints like HbA1c . This approach of  using PD parameters 
 Protocol MYL -1601D -[ADDRESS_503864] that limited data is available from the innovator NovoLog
® 
studies.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_399828] s based on feedback from FDA, Mylan is proposing to use differences 
in treatment emergent antibody response (TEAR) rate as the primary endpoint for this study. 
However, given that TEAR rate is not available from innovator clinical studies and that the 
assay formats might be different, formal hypothesis testing to demonstrate that the incidence of specific end point falls within a predetermined equivalence margin is going to be challenging and a generalized equivalence margin approach suggested by [CONTACT_399857] [ADDRESS_503865] packaging. To avoid any 
bias in the evaluation of the critical endpoints, immunogenicity, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) a nd FPG will be analyzed at a central laboratory in a  blinded manner. I n addition, 
study personnel (Sponsor and CRO)  will be blinded to the randomized assigned treatment 
arms, this will be documented to ensure transparency and proper study conduct.  
To ensure that both treatment arms are comparable at baseline with respect to drug -induced 
immune responses and other parameters, only subjects who have been on a stable dose of  
multiple daily insulin injections  bolus  NovoLog® or Humalog® and once daily basal Lantus® 
or Toujeo® for at least 3 months prior to screening will be included . 
During the 4 -week  run- in period with NovoLog® and Lantus®, the dose of insulin will be 
titrated (if required) to ensure diabetes control and pa tients who are receiving basal insulin 
other than Lantus® will be switched to this b asal-bolus combination (Lantus®-NovoLog®). 
The run- in period ensures  comparable drug exposure for  all subjects, and increases the 
likelihood of comparable immune responses at the start of the treatment period. The run- in 
period also serves as an approach to single transition, wherein all patients ente ring the run-in 
period will be receiving NovoLog® for 4 weeks and following randomization to the treatment 
period patients will receive either NovoLog® or MYL -1601D allowing for asses sment of 
switch from reference, NovoLog®, to the test product, MYL -1601D. A [ADDRESS_503866] differences in HbA1c  and safety parameters of the

Rescue criteria based on HbA1c are defined  based HbA1c measurement performed on

perform early termination visit as subject proc eed with the scheduled visits) . The site 
should request the subject consent to follow -up as per the SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES  until the  Week 28 (Follow -up visit).  
4. At the I nvestigator’s discretion (following discussion with the S ponsor medical 
monitor), in certain situations such as lack of compliance, significant  illness, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101985], or an SAE. In this case subjects can be discontinued from the study (early termination visit is done immediately) or discontinued from the study treatment and con tinue with the study visits and procedures with marketed treatment 
(no need to perform early termination visit as subject proceed with the scheduled visits) .   
5. Sponsor terminate the study due to safety issues. In this case subjects  should be 
discontinued f rom the study (early termination visit is done immediately).  
Subjects who decide to discontinue from treatment and agree to remain in the study, on marketed treatment, are required to adhere to the study protocol, thus perform all activities 
and procedure s such as SMBG measurements, completing diary entries, participating in their 
regularly scheduled study visits for completion of all assessments and procedures as outlined 
in the Schedule of Activities until the  Week 28  (Follow -up visit ).  
If the subject w ithdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected. The S ponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdr awal of consent.  
The site should explain the subject the importance of data collection and make every effort to consent the subject to continue follow up per the  SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES  until Week 
28 (Follow -up visit).

• Females who are [ADDRESS_503882] a serum FSH level >30 IU/L in the absence of hormone 
replacement therapy.  
2. Females who have a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. 
All other females will be considered to be of childbearing potential.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_503883] use an acceptable, highly effective method of 
contraception (i.e. a method with a failure rate <1% when used consistently and c orrectly) 
starting from screening through to at least [ADDRESS_503884] one of the following : 
• Abstinence (periodic abstinence is not acceptable).  
• Tubal ligation. 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) of intrauterine system (IUS).  
• Condom  with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . 
• Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 6 months. Male partners with 
vasectomies of <6 months are NOT considered protected.  
• Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected, transdermal or implanted) with the exception of low dose gestagens, i.e. only containing lynestrenol or norethisterone, since they do not inhibit ovulation and are therefore not considered as highly- effective. The subject 
must remain on the hormonal contraceptive throughout the study and must have been 
using hormonal contraceptives for an adequate period prior to the study to ensure effectiveness (e.g., 3 months).  
4.4 Pregnancy Testing  
Serum or urinary pregnancy testing will be p erformed on all females of childbearing potential 
as described in the schedule of activities (results will be reviewed and must be negative prior to dosing). In the event of a urine positive test, serum test will be done to confirm the result, 
following  the subject will be withdrawn from the study (or will not enter the study if during 
screening).

5.2 Study Medication/Device Complaints  
In the event the subject  has a complaint/concern during study participation regarding the 
medication /device  supplied, they should contact [CONTACT_779].  
In the event of a complaint/concern regarding any medication/device  provided by [CONTACT_399865] s tudy, a t a minimum the following information should be sent by [CONTACT_67896] e -mail to  
[EMAIL_7557]  
• Study number.  
• Principal Investigator [CONTACT_2300].  
• Subject ID.  
• Date of occurrence of incident/complaint.  
• Description of incident/complaint (facts).  
• Confirmation if the complaint caused or resulted in a SAE? If “Yes”, 
confirmation that the SAE has been reported.  
 
Additional information and potentially the return of study medication may be requested by [CONTACT_399866].  
5.[ADDRESS_503885] s are stored in a secured area under recommended sto rage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the Investigator site.  
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by [CONTACT_399867].  
Temperature of storage facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using validated devices that record maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labeled  storage condition this 
must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee.  At sites where, daily monitoring and 
recording is not possible  on weekends, the temperature record (e.g. max/min thermometers) 
should be checked immediately for any temperature excu rsions  on the next working day after 
the weekend . Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly calibrated. 
Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion has been assessed and confirmed by [CONTACT_399868] e. 
The I nvestigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. D rug accountability forms must be used. Alternatively,  Mylan 
may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the f orms must identify the 
 Protocol MYL -1601D -[ADDRESS_503886] Identification number (SID), randomization number and study 
medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by [CONTACT_399869]. A 
manual containing complete instructions for Web access and use will be provided to each site 
prior to study start. T he IWRS will assig n a SID  for each subject’s first clinic visit . Each SID 
will be unique and serve as the primary subject identifier throughout all phases of the study. 
The SID must appear on all case report form (CRF ) pages, source documents, laboratory 
data, ECG and diary data.  Subject s qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be 
assigned an additional “randomization number” by [CONTACT_399870]. Dynamic allocation with minimization algorithm will be used for treatment randomization.  
Randomization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_399871] (Glargine) dose time 
(morning or evening).  
5.5 Breaking the Blind 
The trial design is open -label since the two products , MYL -1601D and NovoLog
®, have 
distinct packaging. To avoid any bias in the evaluation of  the critical endpoints, a blinded 
analysis of immunogenicity and other parameters such as HbA1c  and FPG is planned . In 
addition, the majority of the study personnel  (Sponsor and select CRO staff)  will be blinded 
to the randomized assigned treatment arms  and this will be documented , listing the Sponsor 
and CRO personnel w ho are unblinded to ensure transp arency and proper study conduct.  
As all Investigators and sites  staff are not blinded to treatment , no process required for 
breaking the blind.  
5.6 Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to post -
study follow -up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration in the CRF.  All subject s will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.  
Medications  (except for insulin ) taken within 28 days prior to screening and prior to dosing 
with study medication will be documen ted as a prior medication. Medications taken after 
dosing with study medication will be documented as concomitant medications.  
Other than study drugs  (MYL -1601D, NovoLog® and Lantus®), other insulin s / other insulin 
analogs and other anti -diabetes medications as well as glucocorticoid therapy (oral, 
intravenous, inhaled or other routes that produce systemic effects)  are prohibited during the

Subject s will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
section of this protocol ( Section  4.2.2) . Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subject s will be assessed by [CONTACT_394524] (e.g. for safety reasons : see 
Section  4.2.3).  
5.[ADDRESS_503887] s during 
the study : 
“Worsening of HbA1c by >1.0% compared to baseline at [ADDRESS_503888] randomization”. 
At the week 16 (Visit 12) study visit, i f the subject meets the rescue criterion  above , the 
Investigator can decide to proceed with one of the following options;   
1) continue the study with no drug change  
2) continue the study and adjust the dose  of the study treatment  
3) discontinue from the study treatment and switch  to study NovoLog® if the  subject is 
assigned to MYL -1601D  
4) discontinue from the study treatment  if the  subject is already assigned to NovoLog® 
and switch to marketed treatment (both basal and bolus treatments)  
5) early termination from the study  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -[ADDRESS_503889] the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator . They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate.  Subject s agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be  given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre -screening 
(if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_399872].  
Once a subject enrolls  in this study, the site will make every effort to retain the subje ct for the 
planned duration of the study. Clinical study site staff are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the following.  
• Thorough explanation of the complete clinical study visit s schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re -emphasis at each clinic visit.  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the study's successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatm ent groups to the 
overall success of the study. 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic 
visit attendance and full study participation and compliance.  
• Collection of contact [CONTACT_103901] (address, pho ne numbers, email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits.  
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.  
• Immediate and multifaceted follow -up on missed clinic visits, including the possible 
use of trained staff to complete in -perso n contact [CONTACT_394553].  
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_399873]. All contact [CONTACT_131994]'s medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason  of "Lost to Follow -up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for early termination  should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless 
of site plans to support and retain subjects within the study, subjects may voluntarily 
withdr aw from the study for any reason and at any time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be up to [ADDRESS_503890] prior to enrolment.  
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1  [Week - 7 to Week - 4])

discontinuation/early termination as stated in Section  4.2.3.  
Subjects who decide to discontinue from treatment and agree to remain in the study, on marketed treatment, are required to adhere to the study protocol, thus perform all activities and procedures such as SMBG measurements, completing diary entries, partici pating in their 
regularly scheduled study visits for completion of all assessments and procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities until the Week 28 (Follow -up visit).  
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclos ure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. The S ponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
The site should explain the subject the impor tance of data collection and make every effort to 
consent the subject to continue follow up per the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES  until 
Week  28 (Follow -up visit).

6.5.2 Safety Testing  Assessments  
Safety will be assessed through physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, 12- lead 
electrocardiograms, laboratory analyses, and adverse event monitoring.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Assessment  
If a subject report s any symptoms after the signing of the informed consent form, they will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_394530]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_394478] -Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the 
course of action. 
Clinically relevant findings from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical 
examinations will be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant changes from the 
screening procedu res results  will be recorded as adverse events.  
Subjects will be routinely queried with regard to the presence or absence of adverse events using open ended questions. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events in the subject’s CRF.  The ad verse event source documentation will minimally include the 
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 45 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
following information: date and time of assessment, the outcome of the response, and 
identification of the clinic staff member collecting the information.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypoglycemia  
Incidence of hypoglycemic ep isodes will also be summarized by [CONTACT_17203] (Severe 
Hypoglycemia, Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia, Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Relative Hypoglycemia and Nocturnal 
Hypoglycemia). In addition, nocturnal hypoglycemia rate and  incidence will be analyzed in  
same way as overall hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Hypoglycemia is a state produced by a lower than normal level of glucose in the blood. This 
may develop, if for example:  
• The subject misses or delays meals or there is a change i n diet  
• The subject  takes a higher dose of study drug than prescribed  
• The subject  consumes alcohol  
• The subject  does more intense or longer physical exercise or work than normal,  
• The subject  is recovering from an injury, operation, fever or other illness, or from 
other forms of stress  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Classification  
A. Severe Hypoglycemia  
An event is considered as severe hypoglycemia if it requires the assistance of another person 
to actively administer carb ohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions which results in 
neurological recovery, regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. Plasma glu cose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological 
recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  
B. Documente d Symptomatic Hypoglycemia  
An event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_394480] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  
C. Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia  
An event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_10922] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  
D. Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia.  
Characteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia with no blood glucose level measurement that resolved with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose. 
E. Relative Hypoglycemia.  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -[ADDRESS_503914]  reports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and 
interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose 
concentration > 70 m g/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  
F. Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.  
Nocturnal hypoglycemia will include hypoglycemia that occurs from the time the subject  
goes to bed at night till the time he or she wakes up. This may include any of the above 5 
types of hypoglycemia.  
Note: A  diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia as per above classification will always be 
considered as serious adverse event. Other hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_399830] (life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394482].) or represent important medica l events 
based on Investigator’s judgment should also be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Identification of Hypoglycemia  
Symptoms of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to the following: palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
sweating, hunger, nervousness and shakines s, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], dizziness or light –headedness, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak. Neuroglycopenic manifestations may include seizure, coma, and even death.  
Subject  will be instructed to be alert for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; and if possible 
to take glucose meter readings at the time of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_399831] (if it was checked) in their diary.  
Investigators will instruct the subjects  on self -management of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Investigators will instruct subject s on remedial actions to be taken during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_113424]. Subject  will be encouraged to call the study site if they experience 
hypoglycemia.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Manage ment of Hypoglycemia  
The following steps are recommended for managing hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]:  
1. The subject  should begin with 15 to 20 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 3- 4 teaspoons of 
table sugar dissolved in water, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 3 -4 
glucose tablets).  
2. Subsequently, if the glucose level is ≤50 mg/dL, then the subject  will be asked to 
consume 20 to 30 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 4- 6 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water, 2 
tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 4- 5 glucose tablets).  
3. Subject  will be asked to recheck blood glucose after [ADDRESS_503915]  can be treated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) 
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate training, 
or glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Intravenous glucose can also be given if the subject  does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended in order to prevent a 
relapse.

esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy/culture by [CONTACT_399876].  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -[ADDRESS_503916], samples are taken under 
fasting conditions , as described in the laboratory manual . Patients  are required to adhere to  
those requirements/instruction.    
Any clinically significan t findings in laboratory safety data should be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity Assessment  
Blood samples (5 mL each) will be taken into serum separator tubes at each time point as 
outlined in  Table 3. At Visits 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15, five  (5) blood samples  of 5 mL 
each (2 5 mL total volume) will be drawn. The blood samples will be taken pre -dose by [CONTACT_399877], and the exact times of blood sampling w ill be recorded in the CRF. Two of the 
samples will be used to determine the presence of ADA against insulin aspart using the 
approach outlined below . One sample will be used to determine the presence of NAbs  against 
insulin aspart  for samples that are ADA positive . Two  samples  will be collected and stored in 
reserve for potential su pplemental immunogenicity testing and/or characterization  including 
titer assessment if needed . Samples collected pre-dose at the  randomization visit (Visit 6) will 
be considered as baseli ne. Samples collected at screening and the supplemental samples 
collected at baseline may also be used for method development and validation. Sample handling, processing, and storage instructions w ill be detailed in a separate laboratory 
manual.  
A conventional radioimmunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_394489] (RIPA)  will be employed for the assessment 
of ADA in clinical samples. In this assay, samples will undergo a pre -treatment step that 
includes acid dissociation t o release any anti -insulin antibodies complexed with free drug, 
followed by [CONTACT_394533]. T he treated samples will be 
incubated with a fixed amount of 
125I-MYL -1601D tracer under  conditions specified for each 
tier: 
Screeni ng Assay (Tier 1):  
• RIPA Assay buffer only  
Confirmatory Assay (Tier 2):  
• RIPA Assay buffer only  
• RIPA Assay buffer with excess unlabelled MYL -1601D  
• RIPA Assay buffer with excess unlabelled Human Insulin  
• RIPA Assay buffer with excess unlabelled NovoLog 
Titer assay (Tier 3)  
• RIPA Assay buffer only (multiple serial dilutions of the sample)  
 
Anti-drug antibody complex formation with the tracer is measured via gamma counter and 
expressed as a percentage of bound to total radioactivity (%B/T).  
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_399834]- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity 
testing from published white papers (Mire -Sluis AR et al, 2004; Shankar G et al, 2008 ), and 
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 49 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
current regulatory guidance ( FDA 201 9, EMA 2017 ), the assay design will employ a 
screening tier (no inhibition), confirmatory tier (competitive inhibition with excess drug), 
characterization tier (competitive inhibition with excess human insulin  and excess 
NovoLog®) and titration tier.  
All samples will be  subjected to an initial screening assay (Tier 1), and those with %B/T 
values greater than or equal to  a run- specific screening cut point will be  scored as putative 
ADA positives.  
Screen positive samples would then undergo the  confirmatory assay  (Tier 2), and s amples 
exhibit ing percentage inhibition greater than the confirmatory cut point will be scored as 
confirmed positive . The cut -point for the screening assay will be based on the %B/T response 
using normal human serum from treatment naïve individuals and use a 5% false positive error rate. The confirmatory cut points will be determined for both ADA and insulin cross -reactiv e 
ADA based on the % inhibition of tracer binding using excess MYL -1601D and human 
insulin, respectively. Each confirmatory cut -point will be determined using normal human 
serum from treatment naïve individuals and employ a 1% false positive error rate . The 
percent inhibition determined using NovoLog as inhibitor would be reported for comparison purposes.  
All confirmed positive samples will be evaluated for titer (Tier 3) by [CONTACT_399878] (2 -fold dilution steps) and estimating the titer as the interpolated dilution at the run 
specific titer cut point (determined from the screening data using normal human serum from treatment naïve individuals at 0.1% false positive error rate).  In addition, a ll samples 
identified as ADA positive will be further evaluated for neutralizing antibodies using a separate cell -based  assay.  
The labeled drug product (
125I-MYL -1601D) is used as the capture reagent in the RIPA, 
which allows antibodies that arise from any  insulin aspart epi[INVESTIGATOR_399835]. 
The specificity of capture reagent binding is confirmed by [CONTACT_399879] -1601D, which will interrupt binding for any of the insulin aspart epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Because this 
assessment theoretical ly detects all antibodies that may arise due to drug exposure, it will be 
used to determine patient sample ADA status.  
Since endogenous human insulin possesses close sequence homology to insulin aspart, the ADA generated upon drug exposure may also cross react with human insulin. The degree of cross reactivity will be determined by [CONTACT_399880]. ADA that develop against epi[INVESTIGATOR_399836].   
All samples designated for immunogenicity evaluation will be tested in a blinded manner. The ADA and NAb analysis methodologies will be fully validated at Celerion Switzerland AG (Zurich, CH) and Cirion BioPharma Research Inc.  (Quebec, CA), respectively, followed 
by [CONTACT_399881].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in Section  [ADDRESS_503917].  
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, alth ough, when done manually, pulse rate will be 
measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds.  Any clinically significant 
changes in blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as an AE. Determination of 
clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 12-lead ECG  
In this study, 12- lead ECGs will be recorded using local  ECG devices and review . ECGs 
should be collected at times specified in the study schedules in Section  [ADDRESS_503918]  eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant changes between the screening and 
subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diary and Glucometer  
All subjects will receive a diary  and blood glucose monitoring (glucometer) device at 
Visit 2/Week - 4. The glucometer device will be  used by [CONTACT_399882]  7-point SMBGs. The I nvestigator or designee 
will train subjects on how to use the glucometer  and how to record the values and required 
information in the diary.  A user manual for the g lucometer is provided to each site as a tool  to 
educate and train both site personnel and study subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Physical Examination  
A full general physical examination will consist of an examination of the abdomen, cardiovascular system, lungs, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurological systems, skin, extremities, head, ears, eyes, nose, and thyroid gland by [CONTACT_399883] l at the site. 
A full physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 6 (randomization) and Visit 15  (EOT) . 
Height and w eight will be assessed at Visit 1 . Physical examination results will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant finding at Screening (Visit 1) should be 
recorded under medical history and changes between Screening (Visit 1) and subsequent examinations should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the  Investigator's medical judgment.

7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor . This document may modify the plans outlined in the pro tocol; however, any 
major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 500 subjects with type 1 diabetes will participate in this trial. T he sam ple size 
estimation is based on primary  objective -  to demonstrate that immunogenicity as assessed by 
[CONTACT_399884] -1601D is equivalent to that of NovoLog
® during 24- week treatment . 
The 80% power will be achieved with 250 subjects per treatment a rm to demonstrate that 
90% confidence interval of treatment difference ( MYL -1601D minus  NovoLog®) is within  
prespecified  ±margin (Table 5 ). (Chow SC et al, 2002; Chow S -C et al , 2003) . The pre -
specified equivalent  margin is dependent on the  final rate of NovoLog® TEAR rate. No 
replacement of subject will be performed if subject discontinued prematurely from the study . 
An attrition rate is not considered ; for the analysis an imputation of missing values will be 
done  and no patient will be excluded from the primary analysis.

7.2 Primary Endpoints  
7.2.1 Definition of Primary Endpoints  
The TEAR rate during 24- week treatment period is the primary endpoint for this study. 
TEAR criteria is defined as either one of the following:  
1) Subjects who are ADA negative at baseline and become positive at any timepoint post 
baseline.  
2) Subjects who are ADA positive at baseline and demonstrate [ADDRESS_503920]-baseline sample(s) are treatment 
boosted ADA positive s (see S ection [IP_ADDRESS]. in protocol for detailed immunogenicity 
assessment information).  
Although differences in TEAR rate is the primary endpoint for the study from a statistical 
perspective, given that immunogenicity is not a standard endpoint in clinical trials, this 
difference, even if significant, will not be assessed in isolation but wil l be part of totality of 
evidence including changes in HbA1c, F PG, insulin dose, neutralizing antibodies and 
injection site reactions to ensure that changes in TEAR rate, if any, are clinically correlated 
and meaningful.  
7.2.2 Statistical Methodology for Primary  Endpoints  
The 90% confidence interval of treatment difference  (MYL -1601D minus NovoLog®) in 
TEAR rate will be established using Wald confidence limit  method. M YL-1601D TEAR rate 
is equivalent to that of NovoLog® during 24- week treatment period if 90% confidence 
interval of treatment difference in TEAR rate  is within pre -specified margin  defined in 
Table  5. The pre -specified equivalent margin is dependent on the final rate of NovoLog® 
TEAR rate.  
To minimize any bi as due to missing data, multiple imputation will be used to fill in missing 
values for  TEAR criteria  (binary response and continuous titer  values ) prior to  deriving the 
TEAR and subsequently estimat ing the treatment difference and 90% confidence interval . 
The method of imputation for a subject will be dependent on the individual ADA result at baseline. For subjects with baseline ADA negative, post baseline binary response (positive or 
negative) will be imputed using logistic regression multiple imputation assuming missing not at random.  For subjects with baseline positive, missing titer values (continuous values) will 
be impute d with same treatment group non- missing subjects using pattern mixture model 
with the complete -case missing values (CCMV) m ethod ( Little 1993
).  
In the case where there are sufficient number of retrieved dropouts , that is, if there are [ADDRESS_503921] is TEAR positive  or ne gative , and the treatment  difference and 90% confidence 
interval will be estimated using  Wald confidence limit  method.  The result  will be combined 
over all imputations by [CONTACT_399885]. 
The primary analysis will be based on the ITT analysis set . In ad dition, all post -
discontinuation and rescue data shoul d be included in the analysis. Further analysis details 
analysis steps and example SAS codes will be provided in the SAP.  
7.2.3 Primary Analysis for Primary Endpoints  
Equivalence  of TEAR rate  will be  establi shed if 9 0% confidence interval of treatment 
difference  (MYL -1601D minus NovoLog®) is within  ± margin indicated in Table 5 . The pre -
specified equivalence margin is based on the final NovoLog® TEAR rate. T he primary 
analysis will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT ) analysis set .  
7.2.4 Secondary/Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoints  
• Same analysis model  as the primary analysis, but without imputing missing values.  
This will be analyzed based on PP and ITT analysis set .  
• In a deri ved TEAR dataset, for subjects in MYL -1601D treatment group with 
missing antibody values,  TEAR responder will be replaced rega rdless if subject is 
TEAR responder or non- responder. The TEAR rate difference between two 
treatments and 90% confidence interval will be then estimated using Wald 
confidence limit  method.  This will be analyzed  based on ITT. 
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]- point analysis using me thod proposed by [CONTACT_399886] (2014)  will 
be performed . A graphic display (heating map)  is used to  indicate the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_399837]. The  treatment difference s 
are present ed as values  in the heat map . The graph will be displayed to show the 
sensitivity ranging from missing favour testing treatment to missing favour 
reference treatment.   
For tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point analysis, number of subjects with missing data are either 1) 
subjects who miss completely post -baseline ADA data or 2) subjects who miss  
partially ADA data  that cannot be determined if  subject is TEAR positive or 
negative 3) subjects who miss at baseline . If a subject  with partially ADA miss ing 
data already meet the TEAR criteria, the subject is not considered as subject with 
missing data. 
• TEAR rate  for each treatment and difference between treatments for missing data 
during treatment period will be summarized for all sensitivity analyses.  
• In addition, incidence of TEAR rate  at each scheduled visits : visitwise TEAR 
(vTEAR ) will be summarized at each scheduled visit by [CONTACT_399887] -1601D -3001 Page 54 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
definition: ADA negative at baseline become positive at specific visit (Treatment 
Induced TEAR) , and ADA positive at baseline and become 4 -fold increase in titer at 
specific visit  (Treatment Boosted TEAR). 
7.2.5 Missing Data  
The only imputed data will be performed in the primary and s ensitivity analys es as described 
above  for TEAR rate associated with ADA and other  secondary variables if deemed 
necessary . The detailed missing data imputation for other secondary variables will be 
included in SAP . 
7.2.6 Sub- Group Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of important factors, including but not limited to factors such as age 
group, gender , race ,  and ethnicity are planned for the key outcomes of TEAR rate . Wald 
confidence limit method  for TEAR rate  will be used for 90% confidence interval . Other 
exploratory subgroup analyses may be performed, as deemed appropriate. 
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
The following efficacy measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at 
baseline and scheduled visit. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) -effects model  will 
be performed for continuous variables  without imputing missing values . The MMRM model 
will include the fixed, categorical effect of treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group- by-visit interaction and the other fixed effect terms I nvestigator, basal insulin dose 
time, and baseline valu e as covariates.  Contrasts of LS mean at each scheduled visit will be 
used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals for 
treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit.  
• Change in HbA1c from baseline . 
• Change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline . 
• Change in prandial, basal insulin and total  daily  insulin dose per unit body weight 
(U/kg) from baseline . 
• Change in 7 -point SMBG profile from baseline . 
All above analyses will be performed on ITT set.  
A sensiti vity analysis for HbA1c will be performed using multiple imputation to impute  
missing values  with non- missing subjects within same treatment group using pattern mixture 
model with the complete -case missing values (CCMV) method ( Little 1993
). After 
imputation, treatment difference, 95% CI, and p -values will be generated using same MMRM 
model as above. 
The following safety measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at baseline and scheduled visit. Similar MM RM model as efficacy analysis will be conducted 
for hypoglycemia rate. For antibody continuous variables, the MMRM model will include the

comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be 
computed for  each visit. For categorical data analyses, Fisher’s exact test  or Chi-squared test  
will be used .  
The following analyses will also be performed and will form part of the totality of evidence to compare clinical efficacy and safety of two treatment groups : 
• Incidence of ADA response and positive cross -reactive ADA ; and i ncidence of 
positive NAbs . 
• Analysis of potential impact of TEAR status  on efficacy and safety  parameters such as 
HbA1c, glucose control FPG,  insul in dose , hypoglycemic rate , incidence of any 
injection s ite allergic r eactions and hypersensitivity.  
• Change in hypoglycemia rate (30 day adjusted) from baseline and incidence of hypoglycemic events  at scheduled visits  
• Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs  
• Incidence of local allergic reactions, systemic allergic  reactions and other adverse 
events  
Incidence of device -related safety assessment  
 
To explore the potential A DA impact on subject’s glucose control , the following analyses 
will be performed :  
• The inci dence of subjects with meeting all three following criteria will be summarized 
descriptively (for categorical measures) by [CONTACT_3148] , by [CONTACT_765], and overall : 
1) Meet the vTEAR criteria   
2) Increases in HbA1c of over 0.2% from baseline  
3) Increase in total dose from baseline  
• Scatter plots of maximum TEAR  values  with HbA1c , FPG and total daily insulin dose  
by [CONTACT_3148].  
The total incidence of D evice- related safety events will be summarized for each treatment 
group and would include device -related TEAEs and events related to device complaints or 
failures. For device -related TEAEs, two categories will be summarized for each treatment: 
needle -related TEAEs such as pain, bruise, and bleeding; and other device -related TEAEs, 
such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. For device -related patient’s complaints, incidence 
will be listed and summarized for each treatment.  
All the above analyses will be performed on the safety set.  
In addition, graphical visualization of relationship between adverse events and treatment duration will be provided. 
The details of all safety analysis will be provided in the SAP.

information furnished to the IRB/Ethics Committee relevant to this study under appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such IRB/Ethics Committee.  
By [CONTACT_12142], the Investigator agrees that within local regulatory restric tions and 
institutional and ethical considerations, the Sponsor may consult and/or copy source 
documents (e.g., laboratory/X -ray reports, ECG tracings, workbooks, medical records) in 
order to verify CRF data.

accordance with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference 
on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for H uman 
Use (ICH- E6) in addition to the regulatory requirements of the country where the study is 
being conducted as well as the country where the study will be submitted.  
8.7.[ADDRESS_503929]/Ethics Committee  
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining initial and continuing review (at intervals not more  than once per year) of the study by [CONTACT_2717]/Ethics Committee, or in accordance with 
applicable government regulations of the country where the study is being conducted as well as the country where the study will be submitted.  This study will not enroll any subjects until 
the IRB/Ethics Committee provides written approval of the protocol and the informed 
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 59 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
consent to the Investigator . In addition, a copy of the IR B/Ethics Committee approval 
documents must be provided to the Sponsor prior to enrolling any subjects into the study. 
8.7.[ADDRESS_503930] of investigational sites, IEC(s)/IRB(s) approvals, 
as well as other re levant documentation will be submitted to the local Regulatory Authorities 
for review and approval prior to study  start. Upon completion, the Regulatory Authorities 
will be notified the study has ended. The study will only be undertaken in compliance with 
the local regulatory requirements.  
8.[ADDRESS_503931] (e.g. IRB or ethics committee) and the Sponsor and/or its agent for review and approval prior to the start of the study.  The I nvestigator shall provide 
a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the subject, and a signed and dated copy shall be maintained in the volunteer’s medical record.  
8.[ADDRESS_503932](s) will be reported as outlined in this section.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of all AEs and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causality and should 
obtain sufficient information to determine the  causality of all AE s. All AEs will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to 
another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates 
that further evaluation is n ot warranted with the Sponsor concurring with that assessment.  
9.[ADDRESS_503933]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product.  
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre -exist ing diseases or conditions. 
o Pre-existing diseases or conditions  will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or condition.  
o Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug or drug -
food interaction. 
o Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be 
reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent; this should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.  
An AE will be defined as a TEAE if the first onset (or worsening, in the case of pre -existing 
disease) is after the first administration of MYL -1601D  after ra ndomization through follow -
up visit or [ADDRESS_503934] dose [for subjects  that do not have a follow -up visit].  
9.2.[ADDRESS_503935] related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by [CONTACT_96949] a reasonable causal relationship to an investigational product will be 
designated as ADRs.  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 61 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to th e study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated as if the relationship were “possible.”  
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
the applicable reference safety information designated for the study. For example, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected ( greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
The reference safety document  for MYL -1601D  is the IB . For  NovoLog® and Lantus® and 
any concomitant medication, the respective SmPC or US prescribing information  will b e the 
reference safety document. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_503936] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
o NOTE: The term “ life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly.  
o NOTE: A congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed 
to the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly 
diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has received the study drug is not 
considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug interac ted with a 
contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The patient with newly 
diagnosed pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be followed -up every 3 months until delivery or termination to gather information 
about the outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important Medical Event:  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations 
serious, such as important medical events that may not be i mmediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394490] / or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, including localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
considere d an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 62 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
o NOTE: Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394491] 24 hours in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394492]. Events NOT  to be reported as SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43716]:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition.  
 Treatment, which was elective or pre- planned, for a pre -existing condition 
that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen.  
 Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394493] (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical care).  
 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395540]:  
 Rehabilitation facilities.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593].  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief).  
 Skilled nursing facilities.  
 Nursing homes.  
Any non- serious AE that is determined by [CONTACT_7195]/ Sponsor to be serious (per 
company policy or regulatory requirements) will be communicated to the Investigator for 
reclassification. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study . 
9.[ADDRESS_503937] dose of study medication .  Pre -existing diseases 
or conditions (reported at visit 1 in medical history) will not be considered as AEs unless there is an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease o r 
condition. An SAE deemed to be related to the study drug by [CONTACT_737] , and following 
consultation with S ponsor will be reported even after the F ollow -up visit if reported by 
[CONTACT_1766] . 
9.3.[ADDRESS_503938] vi sit or evaluation. The 
Investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non- leading questions, 
such as  
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
• “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
Any clinically relevant observations made by [CONTACT_399889].  
The Subject ’s diary should also be reviewed at each study visit for adverse events.  The diary 
data is considered as source data.  At week [ADDRESS_503939] adverse events in the study diary in a timely manner.  
9.3.2 Evaluation  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
The clinical severity of an AE will be graded using the NCI- CTCAE Criteria Version [ADDRESS_503940] version . A copy of these criteria will be provided to each study site. If an AE is not 
listed in the CTCAE, its clinical severity will be classified as follows:  
Table 6: Clinical Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subject 's usual function.  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's usual function.  
Grade 3 – SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject 's usual function.  
Grade 4 - LIFE- THREATENING  Risk of death at time of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
 
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria  (not applicable if using CTCAE 
criteria) , then the AE meets the criteria for an SAE and the Investigator should immediately 
notify the Sponsor or designee as described in S ection  [IP_ADDRESS].  
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of 
intensity based on the CTCAE grading or on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria r equired for designation as seriousness 
described in Section  9.2.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken  
The possible actions taken for an AE are described in  Table 7.  
Table 7:  Action Taken for an Adverse Event  
Dose reduced  The dose regimen was reduced by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Dose increased  The dose regimen was increased by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was temporarily interrupted.  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Concomitant therapy or 
procedures  Treatment was needed as a result of  the AE (the concomitant treatment 
should be recorded on the relevant page of the CRF).  
Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
No action taken  The AE did not require any intervention.  
Not applicable  AE occurred before intake of study treatment. AE occurred after study 
medication was permanently withdrawn or subject  completed the 
treatment period.  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 64 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Fatal*  
• Unknown  
 
All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e. did not cause death) will be recorded as not 
recovered/not resolved at the time of death.  
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
which is the most plausible cause of death in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] .  
Note:  although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must assess the relationship of each AE (serious and non- serious) to the study 
treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF.  
In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE or SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the Investigator must record this information about the causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in accordance with the reporting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE. 
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset)  
• Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s)  
• Pharmacological plausibility  
• Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history)  
• Drug Interactions  
• De-challenge/re -challenge  
• Dose relationship  
 
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that  there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment 
in accord ance with the following definitions:  
 Protocol MYL -1601D -3001 Page 65 of 71 
MYL -1601D Protocol 14 October 2019  Confidential  
Table 8: Definition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY  Causal relationship is certain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for 
causal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
there is a clinically compatible response to de -
challenge (re-challenge is not required), and other 
causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncertain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable 
or unknown, de -challenge in formation is either 
unknown or equivocal, and while other potential 
causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study drug does not appear probable  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y related 
although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  For Example: E vent or laboratory test abnormality, 
with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship 
improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations  
UNRELATED/NOT RELATED  No possible relationship  
The temporal relationship be tween drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible  
 
For SAEs,  if the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be  unlikely or not 
related/unrelated, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided (e.g., concomitant 
medications, intercurrent condition) wherever applicable and available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation  
All AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF with the following information; where appropriate (the period of observation for the study is described in Section  6): 
• AE name [CONTACT_394560].  
• When the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the date 
the AE became serious.  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoing, i.e., recovering or not recovered).  
• Severity of the AE. 
• Seriousness criteria (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, etc.).  
• Action taken with study  medication as a result of AE.  
• Outcome.  
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_394495].

Hypoglycemic events and associated signs/symptoms will only be recorded on the 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_394487], unless they are SAEs  (i.e., a severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Adverse Events 
AEs that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by [CONTACT_399890] s of care. 
If such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason should be documented in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject  may resume the study treatment will be made by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor after 
consultation with the Investigator and/or medical monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up 
Any AE will be followed- up to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can 
be explained by [CONTACT_17648] (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates further evaluation is not warranted. All findin gs relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Notification  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from the time the 
subject  provides 
informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior 
to undergoing any study- related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through 
and including the follow up visit  or [ADDRESS_503941] be promptly reported to Mylan only in case of reasonable causality (i.e. 
suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  is to be completed for all serio us adverse events, signed by [CONTACT_3786], and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory reports). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name [CONTACT_394561]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965]) must not be visible o n SAE forms or any supporting documentation 
provided by [CONTACT_737]. These should be “blacked out”, and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study  identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification, the Investigator/designee should provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number  
• Reporter (study site and Investigator)  
• Subject  identification number  
• Subject ’s age  
• Investigational medicinal product  
• Date of first dose of study  treatment  
• Date of last dose of s tudy treatment, if applicable  
• SAE term  
• The seriousness criteria that were met  
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_399838] 
• Severity

Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactio ns (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), SAEs and other cases required by 
[CONTACT_399893] S ponsor or the S ponsor’s 
representative to all concerned parties within the prescribed timeframe. The S ponsor or

within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clinical database.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE  or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the S ponsor 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is considered an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that the 
outcome (e.g., elective termination) be reported within [ADDRESS_503946] the completed form to Mylan PSRM in quarterly intervals until the pregnancy outcome has been obtained.  
Non-exposed partner pregnancies (conception occurring prior to receipt of first dose of the 
study treatment and those occurring after the last dose of study treatment) do not need to be reported or followed. A male that has a partner that becomes pregnant durin g the study will 
not be discontinued from study treatment.

9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and Other Events  
Overdose per se of either study treatment or a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. 
Signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be recorded on the AE CRF page. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as protocol deviations.  
9.[ADDRESS_503947] Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., ECG, X -rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with si gns and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an SAE if they 
meet the criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal findings that are detected after study drug a dministration or that are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug are included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
• The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
and/or  
• The test result leads to a change in study dosing or early termination  from the study, 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or  
• The test result is considered an AE by [CONTACT_29517] S ponsor . 
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE.   
Any abnormal test result determined by [CONTACT_399894].

FATE FT596 with Rituximab as Relapse Prevention in High Risk Patients after Autologous 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma  
Study Design:  This is a Phase I multi -center study to evaluate the safety of FT596 when given with rituximab as relapse 
prevention in patients who have undergone an autologou s hematopoietic stem cell transplant (auto -
HSCT) for diffuse large or high -grade B cell lymphoma.  
 
For the majority of participants, this study is presented to the patient and consent is signed at the time 
consent for the autologous transplant is obtained . Research related samples are collected prior to the 
start of conditioning on any consented patient. Alternatively , a patient may be consented and enrolled 
after the transplant  provided the patient can begin treatment within their assigned window.  
 
The transplant procedures and follow -up are conducted per institutional standard of care. Participation 
in this study does not affect or impact the transplant, supportive care, and subsequent post -transplant 
care, except that, if post -transplant radiation ther apy is planned, it must be delayed until after Day 100.  
 
FT596 is comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells expressing a CD19 -targeted chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR), a high -affinity non cleavable CD16 receptor (hnCD16), and an interleukin (IL) -15/IL-15 
receptor alpha fusion protein (IL -15RF). FT596 is  an off -the-shelf cellular product  and expected to be 
uniform in composition. The mechanism of action is targeting B -cell tumor cells through direct 
cytotoxicity, CAR -mediated targeting of CD19 as wel l as through antibody -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) in combination with rituximab for a dual -targeting approach.  
 
This study uses a single dose of the investigational product FT596 in the early post -transplant period. 
Rituximab  or an FDA approved  by [CONTACT_532843] ®, Truxima ®, and Ruxience ™ is given 2-
3 days  prior to FT596. The goal of this study is to 1) establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
FT596 when given 30 days after transplant and 2) to confirm the MTD and safety of givin g a single dose 
of FT596 at Day [ADDRESS_691858] -transplant starting at one dose level below the MTD identified at Day 30.  
 
Component 1: I dentify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT596 when given as a single dose 
at Day 30.  
Up to three FT596 dose levels are planned  for Day 30 administration (with a +3 day window ): (Dose 
Level  1: 9x107 cells/dose, Dose Level  2: 3x108 cells/dose, Dose Level 3: 9x108 cells/dose  with a Dose 
Level -1: 3x107 cells/dose tested only if DLT at DL1 ).The maximum tolerated dose will be determined 
by [CONTACT_2329] a modified continual reassessment method (CRM).  
 
Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3 starting at Dose Level 1. A minimum of 28 days will separate each 
cohort . For Dose Level 1 a minimum of  28 days will separate each patient  to assess for dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). In subsequent cohorts, the 1st and 2nd patient will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_691859] appropriate dose based on 
the updated toxicity probabilities  under the continuous reassessment method (CRM) , and the MTD will 
be identified when the total sample size of 18 is exhausted or 6 patients are sequentially e nrolled at the 
same dose.  
 
Dose limiting toxicity is defined as any of the following events within 28 days of FT5 96 dosing  based on 
CTCAE v5:  
 Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting > 7 days (not including lymphopenia)  
 Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity  
 Grade  ≥3 FT596 Infusion Related Reaction  
 Grade 2 acute GVHD that requires steroid therapy >7 days or progression after 3 days of steroids 
or has partial response after 14 days of treatment  
 Grade ≥3 acute GVHD  
 Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  
 Grade 3 CRS that does not resolve to < Grade 2 in 72 hours  
CPRC #  2019LS230 ( MT2019 -46) – FT596 plus Rituximab as Post Auto-HSCT Relapse Prophylaxis   
 
   
November 30, 2020  Page 9 of 66 Confidential     Grade 3 neurotoxicity  
 Grade 3 organ toxicity involving vital organs; cardiac, central nervous system and pulmonary which 
lasts longer than  7 days including Grade 3 Investigations (laboratory values) of any dur ation that 
indicate damage to vital organs.  
 Any Grade 3 non -hematological toxicity that does not resolve to ≤Grade 2 within 72 hours; 
excepting Grade 3 renal and hepatic toxicity which may take up to 7 days to resolve to ≤Grade 2  
 
Note:  Once enrollment is completed for Component 1, enrollment will be suspended. A summary for 
Component 1, including safety data (summary of DLT and SR events) will be provided to the FDA for 
review. Only after receiving their permission will Component 2 begi n enrollment. If permission is not 
received, the study will end.  
  
Component 2: To determine the safety  of FT596 when given at Day 7 based on the MTD from 
Component 1 .   
Component 2 will use a similar design but identifies the MTD of FT596 when given as a single dose at 
Day 7 (with a +3 day window ) post-transplant. Up to two dose levels of FT596 are planned (one dose 
level below the MTD from Component 1 and the MTD from Co mponent 1). Any two sequential dose 
levels of FT5 96 may be included: Dose Level -1: 3x107 cells/dose, Dose Level 1: 9x107 cells/dose, Dose 
Level 2: 3x108 cells/dose, Dose Level 3: 9x108 cells/dose.  
 
The maximum tolerated dose will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a  modified continual reassessment method 
(CRM). Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3 starting at one dose level below the MTD of Component 1 
(MTD -1). Only the MTD -[ADDRESS_691860] cohort a minimum of 28 days will separate each patient to assess for 
dose limiting toxicity (DLT). In subsequent cohorts, the 1st and 2nd patient will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
[ADDRESS_691861] appropriate dose based on the updated toxicity probabilities. The 
MTD will be identified when the total sample size of 18 is exhausted or 6 patients are sequentially 
enrolled at th e same dose.  
 
The DLT events for Component 2 are the same as in Component 1 except for the addition of : 
• Non-engraftment by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_691862] -transplant  
 
Monitoring guidelines for excessive toxicity (Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_532821]) Component 1 and 
Component 2  (ONLY POST FT596 EVENTS COUNT HERE))

Day 0 as the Transplant Day ). Each component is monitored separately.  
 Mortality by [CONTACT_2006] 100  
 Grade III -IV Acute GVHD by [CONTACT_2006] 100  
 Any Grade 4 FT596 Infusion Related Reaction  
 Any Grade 4 Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT)  event  
 Grade 4 Lymphopenia (<200 cells/uL) at Day 100   
 Engraftment failure by [CONTACT_2006] 28  (Component 2 only)

2 Background and Significance  
2.1 Introduction  and Rationale for the Approach  
Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) is the second most common hematologic  
malignancy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common NHL 
subtype (30 -40%), is an aggressive cancer that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_532824]. In the US, approximately 440,000 patients were treated for NHL in 2010 
(SEER.gov). Although most patients initially achieve a remission, treatment fails 
for about 50% of patients. For these patient, Parma trial established the use of 
high-dose therapy (such as BEAM; BCNU, Etoposide, Cytarabine and Melphalan)  
with auto-HSCT as the standar d of care. (Kondo 2016 )

November 30, 2020  Page 14 of 66 Confidential  However relapse occurs frequently and estimated 5 -year PFS rate is 
approximately 50 -60%. (Vose 2013 , Lerner 2007 , Gisselbrecht 2012 , Cuccuini 
2012 )  Prospective  trial compar ed Rituximab  (R) BEAM vs 131I-tositumomab BEAM  
to demonstrate similar PFS 48.6% (95% CI 38 -58%) vs 47.9% (95% CI, 38.2% to 
57%) at [ADDRESS_691880].  Large multicenter CORAL study reported similar 
PFS of 52%. (Gisselbrecht 2012 ) Almost all relapses occur before [ADDRESS_691881]. (Vose 2013 , Lerner 2007 , Gisselbrecht 2012 , Hamadani 2014 ) 
2.[ADDRESS_691882] Relapse   
1. Lack of CR after front -line therapy and high International Prognostic 
Index (IPI) Score.  
In the R-BEAM prospective trial, the only  significant covariate in the multivariate 
model for PFS was disease status at the time of auto-HSCT . (Vose 2013 ) The 
patients in CR at auto-HSCT  had an improved PFS compared with patients with a 
chemother apy-sensitive persistent or relapsed lymphoma  not in CR  (HR 1.63; 
95%CI 1.14 -2.33).  CORAL trial compared two salvage chemotherapy regimen in 
DLBCL  and assess ed the role of rituximab maintenance after auto -HSCT. Two 
factors  associated with worse PFS were early relapse  after front -line 
chemotherapy of < 12 months, and a secondary age-adjusted International 
Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 2 -3. (Lerner 2007 ) 
 
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation  Registry  (CIBMTR) 
investigators recently analyzed outcomes after auto-HSCT and noted that patients 
with early failure (defined as primary induction failure and relapse <12 months from 
diagnoses) experienced relapse/progression rate of 47% (95% 41% to 52%) and 
PFS of 44% (95% CI, 38% to 50%)  with 2 -fold higher failure rate (P < .001)  within 
first [ADDRESS_691883] compared to patients with late treatment failure.  
(Hamadani 2014 ) 
 
Data from our center demonstrated the 
median PFS of [ADDRESS_691884] for the high - 
and low -risk IPI  [CONTACT_10609] (total 80 
patients). These findings  support using 
the IPI [INVESTIGATOR_532825] a 
selection criterium to select patient s 
who are treated with autologous 
transplantation for DLBCL in second  
complete or partial remissions.

November 30, 2020  Page 15 of 66 Confidential  2. Alterations of c -myc gene is associated with poor PFS.  
Approximately 5 -10% of DLBCL  harbor a 8q24/MYC rearrangement 
(MYC(+)).  WHO now categorize this disease as aggressive B -cell lymphoma with 
MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. CORAL study reported outcomes 
of 28 patients with MYC(+) rearrangement, targeted as either simple hit (25%) or 
complex hits (75%) including MYC/BCL2 , MYC/BCL6, and MYC/BCL2/BCL6.  
(Cuccuini  2012)  Compared to the MYC( -) DLBCL patients, the MYC(+) DLBCL 
patients presented with a more elevated LDH level and more advanced age 
adjusted IPI (P = .0039). The 4 -year PFS in the MYC(+) DLBCL was 18%.  
 
Another r ecent multicenter retrospective study examined the 331 DLBCL patients 
with primary induction failure in rituximab era defined as primary induction failure 
or relapse < 6 months from end of therapy.  (Costa 2017 ) The presence of PI F,

13.6% constituting ultra -high risk features. Our [ADDRESS_691885] 2 -year OS was 74.3%, 59.6% and 10.7% for patients with 0,[ADDRESS_691886] -Transplant  
Rituximab’s key anti -cancer mechanism of action is mediated through FcγRIII 
(CD16) on NK cells; this receptor is by [CONTACT_532845]. 
Rituximab crosslinks CD16 and triggers vigorou s production of cytokines and  
FT596  cell degranulation, leading to target cell killing (a process referred to as 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity; ADCC). Targeting CD20 on lymphoma 
cells with rituximab dramatically improves initial remission rates (by 10 -20%), but 
resistance is common. The international CORAL study tested the impact of 
maintenance rituximab after autografting by [CONTACT_532846].  (Gisselbrecht 2012 ) The 4 -year event -free survival 
rates were identical in the two groups (52% and 53%). The limitations of rituximab 
efficacy may be due to decreased CD16 expression or poor NK cell function post 
transplantation. We hypothesize that FT596 engineering will enh ance rituximab 
activity post -HCT.

November 30, 2020  Page 16 of 66 Confidential  CD16 expression is decreased after treatment with rituximab in vivo . In a 
control experiment ( Figure  2 top panel ), we incubated CD56dim NK cells with 
rituximab (10 μg/ml) in vitro and 
showed that it does not block 
CD16 bi nding. We then tested 
peripheral blood from patients 
with DLBCL before and after the 
therapy with rituximab 
(375mg/m2 x 4 doses). At 
baseline CD56dim NK cells 
expressed high levels of CD16. 
After rituximab therapy, a large 
proportion of blood NK cells 
(46% ) downregulated CD16 and 
became CD16 negative ( Figure  
2, lower panel  16.4% vs 
46.2%) ) demonstrating that rituximab treatment doses clip CD16 off NK cells in 
vivo. 
 
The cellular product FT596 is rationally engineered to express a high -affinity 
non-cleavable  CD16 receptor (hnCD16) to engage rituximab and mediate killing of 
DLBCL tumor cells which survived BEAM chemotherapy.  
2.4 FT596   
FT596 is an allogeneic NK cell immunotherapy produced from a clonal master 
human -induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC) line engineered to express the 
following: a)  a CD19 -targeted CAR; b) a high -affinity non -cleavable CD16 receptor 
(hnCD16); and  c) an IL -15/IL -15 receptor alpha fusion protein (IL -15RF) 
(Jing 2015 ; Li 2018 ). The clon al master cell bank (MCB) used for the production of 
FT596 was generated by [CONTACT_532847] a single, well -characterized 
iPSC clone with defined transgene copy number and integration sites. The use of 
a clonal MCB as the starting material for routi ne Current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMP) production of FT596 is intended to directly address many of the 
limitations associated with current patient - and donor -specific cell CD19 -targeted 
CAR therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Notably, many doses of FT596 drug product can be uniformly produced in a single 
manufacturing campaign. These doses of drug product are homogeneous and can 
be (i) tested to assure compliance with a pre -defined quality specification, 
(ii) cryopreserved in an infusion media, and (iii) stored to maintain  a sustainable 
inventory. As  such, in the clinical setting, FT596  has off -the-shelf availability for

November 30, [ADDRESS_691887] transformed B cells, and therefore, the potency of FT596 is 
expected to be superior to that of patients’ endogenous NK cells. These features  
justify its investigation in B -cell malignancies:  
 The cytotoxic effector function of FT596 is expected to be superior to that of 
patients’ endogenous NK cells, which are diminished in number and poorly 
functional due to prior treatment regimens (e.g.,  chemotherapy) and disease -
related immunosuppression.  
 FT596 expresses a CD19 -targeted CAR that has been specifically developed 
to support NK  cell anti -tumor efficacy against CD19+ cells. Unlike CARs 
developed for T  cells that include, for example, a CD28 co -stimulatory domain, 
FT596 CAR -mediated targeting is driven by [CONTACT_22720]2D transmembrane and 2B4 
co-stimulatory domains, which supports potent killing against CD19+ B cells. In 
nonclinical studies, CAR designs consisting of NKG2D transmembrane and 
2B4 co -stimulatory domains outperformed a conventional CAR, consisting of 
CD28 and 41BB co -stimulatory domains, when expressed in NK cells ( Li 2018 ). 
 FT596 includes the expression of hnCD16 which consists of naturally occurring 
158V polymorp hism and an additional genetic alteration (S179P) that prevents 
cleavage of CD16. In clinical studies in patients whose endogenous NK cells 
express the high -affinity CD16 Fc receptor 158V variant, higher objective 
response rates (ORRs) and increased progre ssion free -survival (PFS) were 
observed with treatment with rituximab, cetuximab, and trastuzumab ( Cartron 
2002 ; Bibeau  2009 ; Musolino 2008 ). In addition, the genetic alterati on S179P 
prevents downregulation of CD16 upon activation due to cleavage of CD16 by 
[CONTACT_532848]17 ( Jing 2015 ; Lajoie  2014 ), a mechanism that 
regulates NK cell activity ( Romee  2013 ). Nonclinical studies conducted with 
cryopreserved FT596 -R, the non -GMP research -use equivalent of FT596, 
demonstrated that the combination of FT596 -R with the US  Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) -approved antibody -dependent cellular cytotox icity 
(ADCC) -inducing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), specifically rituximab, 
resulted in enhanced anti -tumor activity as compared to mAb alone, peripheral 
blood NK  cells alone, or FT596 alone.  Specifically, FT596 -R in combination 
with rituximab demonstrated  improved targeting of CD19 + CD20+ cancer cells, 
enhanced cytokine production, and enhanced combinatorial activity with 
chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD19 antigen.  Based on these

 FT596 expresses IL -15RF designed to provide an endogenous activation

administration such as IL -[ADDRESS_691889] been associated with 
signifi cant toxicities that may limit clinical usage when incorporated into 
clinical studies of peripheral blood NK cells ( Cooley 2019 ). 
 Nonclinical evaluation of umbilical cord blood -derived NK cells engineered 
to express a CD19 CAR and  secrete IL -15 demonstrated the feasibility of the 
overall approach of providing engineered NK cells for the treatment of B -cell 
malignancies, with clinical trials being planned ( Liu 2018 ). 
Overall, FT596 is expected to be uniform in  composition, well -tolerated, available 
off-the-shelf for potential use in multi -dose treatment cycles, and to have improved 
anti-tumor activity through direct cytotoxicity, CAR -mediated targeting of CD19, as 
well as through ADCC in combination with mAbs f or a unique dual -targeting 
approach. These features provide the rationale for the proposed Phase I study of 
a single dose of FT596 in combination with rituximab as relapse prophylaxis after 
an auto -HSCT for the treatment of aggressive B -cell and DBLCL lymp homa.  If 
found safe, the next step will be to propose up to [ADDRESS_691890] and achieve stable blood count recovery .

The rationale to combine FT596 with CD20  targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab 
is to mediate dual targeting of CD20 and CD19  to avoid antigen escape and

5 Patient Screening and Enrollment  
For the majority of participants, c onsent for this study will be presented as part of the 
pre-transplant discussion  as research related samples are collected before beginning 
of conditioning chemotherapy.   
 
Alternatively, a patient also may be consented and enrolled after transplant provided 
the patient 1) can begin treatment within their assigned window , 2) they meet all of the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria based on the previously 
documented standard of care  pre-transplant assessment  and 3) meet the post -
transplant requirements found in Section 4.3 . Research related procedures and 
sample collections missed due to late consenting are not protocol deviations.  
5.1 Registration  with the University of Minnesota Clinical Trials Office  
Any patient who is consented is to be registered  in OnCore by [CONTACT_337586].  
 
If a patient is consented but is not enrolled  in the study treatment (i.e. is found to 
be ineligible  based on pre -transplant inclusion/exclusion criteria ), the patient’s 
record is updated in OnCore as a screen failure and reason for exclusion recorded.

record.  
 
After transplant, the study doctor will need to assess the patient to determine if the 
criteria in Section 4.[ADDRESS_691909] of 
the patient based on their current medical situation.  
 
The patient is assigned to the currently enrolling treatment plan after the transplant  
and confirmation of continuing eligibility . 
5.3 Patients Who Do Not Begin Study Treatment  
If a patient is enrolled in  the study (i.e. assigned a sequence number) and is later 
found unable to begin FT596 , the patient will be removed from study and treated 
at the physician’s discretion . The study staff  will update O nCore of the patient’s 
non-treatment status  (off study)  with t he reason for removal from study prior to 
starting study treatment clearly indicated . The patient will be replaced to complete 
enrollment.  Any data and research samples collected u p to this point will be 
retained as detailed in the written consent document.  
 
If a patient receives FT596, they are considered on treatment and most continue 
follow -up per Section 8 .

November 30, 2020  Page 25 of 66 Confidential  6 Treatment Plan  
Primary sup portive care is to continue according to the primary transplant protocol. In 
order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical conditions, 
investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive care drug 
therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, antimicrobials, etc .).  
 
Because they may inhibit NK cell function, systemic corticosteroids should be avoided 
during the treatment period ( 3 days before and through 14 days after FT596 ) unless 
absolutely required. Int ravenous glucocorticoid as premedication for rituximab may be 
administered per the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_532827]. Methylprednisolone should be 
used as preferred glucocorticoid premedication given its shorter half -life.  
 
Treatment may be given as an inp atient or an outpatient. There is no protocol driven 
requirement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
For scheduling purposes, the rituximab/FT596 “package” is administered with a +3 
day window from the targeted FT596 administration day (Day 30 or Day 7). Rituximab  
or an FDA approved biosimilar  is given 2 -3 days (48 to 72 hours) prior to the planned 
FT596 infusion.  
6.1 Rituximab or an FDA Approved Biosimilar and FT596 Administration 
General Guidelines  
Rituximab or an FDA approved biosimilar and FT596 are administered in the same 
manner regardless of FT596 dose and the administration days.  Refer to the 
following sections for detailed information including enrollment plan, definition of 
dose limiting toxicity and early study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_206319] .  
 Section 6. 2 – Component 1: Identif y FT596 MTD when given on Day 30  only. 
 Section 6. 3 – Component  2: Determine the MTD and safety of Day 7 FT596 . 
6.1.1  Rituximab  or FDA Approved B iosimilar  (2-3 days prior to each 
FT596 Administration ) 
Ritux imab  (Rituxan  or an FDA approved biosimilar , e.g. Truxima and Ruxience ) 
375 mg/m2 is administered as an IV infusion per institutional practice  and the 
specific product’s package insert  on 2-3 days (48 to 72 hours) prior to the 
FT596 . Pre-medications and supportive care per institutional standard of care 
guidelines.  
6.1.2  FT596 Administration  
FT596 is given 2 -3 days after rituximab ; however, it may be delayed for up to 
7 days until all rituximab infusion r elated toxicities resolve to ≤Grade 1.

November 30, 2020  Page 26 of 66 Confidential  FT596 Thawing Overview:  FT596 is provided in one or more  cryopreserved 
bags based on the patient’s dose level. The correct number of bags are 
transferred to the site of infusion using a validated cooler. Thawing occurs on 
the unit just prior to administration. When dose level requires multiple bags, 
bags are thawed sequentially. FT5 [ADDRESS_691910] begin within 60 minutes of thawing .  
FT596 Infusi on guidelines:  FT596 must be administered via gravity using a  
Fate approved  IV administration set with an in -line filter. Total infusion time per 
bag is less than [ADDRESS_691911] thawing. To infusion 3 bags of cells (the 
maximum required for the dose levels in this study), total infusion time from the 
start of the 1st bag to the end of the last bag would be [ADDRESS_691912] 
the empty study drug bag/tubing in accordance with local site p olicy.  
 
Pre-Medications : Prior to administration of FT596  and 4 -6 hours later , patients  
should be pre -medicated with acetaminophen 650 mg orally (PO) and 
diphenhydramine 25 PO. Corticosteroids should not be used as pre -medication 
for FT596.  
 
Vital Signs: Vital signs (temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] ) are performed in association with the FT596  
infusion at the following time points: within 15 minutes of the infusion start, at 
10 (±5) minutes during infusio n, and every 15 (±5) minutes for [ADDRESS_691913] administered bag of FT5 96. 
 
Collection of research sample 30 (±5) minutes after the last bag of FT5 96 
is infused per Section 8.2 . One or more bags are given depending on the dose 
level.  
 
Monitoring for Infusion Related Reactions: All patients are monitored for 
signs of an infusion related reaction. The highest grade infusion reaction for the 
FT596 infusion must be documented (and if applicable r eported as a dose 
limiting toxicity and/or an SAE).

Refer to Section 7.1  for the management of any grade of an infusion related 
reaction.  
 
If a Grade 3 or 4 infusion related reaction occurs  (defined as CTCAE v 5. 0 – 
prolonged or life -threatening consequences), the infusion is stopped if possible 
(i.e. no additional bags of cells are given) and the patient receive supportive 
care per Section 7.1  guidelines. The patient wi ll receive no further FT5 96.  
All patients are monitored for adverse events, dose limiting toxicity and death 
per Section 10 .Refer to Section 7  for management of FT596  related toxicity.  
6.2 Component 1 : Identify FT596 MTD When Given on Day 30 Only

November 30, 2020  Page 28 of 66 Confidential  6.3 Component 2 : Safety of FT596 w hen given at Day 7 based on the MTD from 
Component 1  
Prior to the start of enrollment in Component 2 , a summary of patient data from 
Component 1 will be submitted to the FDA for their review. Included in this report 
will be enrollment and treatment informa tion, a summary of adverse events, DLT’s 
SR events and SAEs as well as any disease status information. Component 2 may 
proceed if permission is received from the FDA. Otherwise the study will stop.  
In Component 2, all patients will receive a single dose of  FT596 on Day 7 (+3 days ) 
post-transplant. Rituximab (Rituxan  or an FDA approved biosimilar, e.g. Truxima 
and Ruxience ) 375 mg/m2 is administered 2-3 days prior to FT596.  
 
Up to two dose levels of FT596 are planned (one dose level below the MTD from 
Component 1 and the MTD from Component 1). Any two sequential dose levels of 
FT596 may be included: Dose Level -1: 3x107 cells/dose, Dose Level 1: 9x107 
cells/dose, Dose Level 2: 3x108 cells/dose, Dose Level 3: 9x108 cells/dose . Refer

In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the pre scribing of all supportive 
care drug therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, antimicrobials, etc.).  
 
Because they may inhibit NK cell function, systemic corticosteroids should be 
avoided during the treatment period ( [ADDRESS_691915] FT596  through 14 days 
after) unless absolutely required. Intravenous glucocorticoid as premedication for 
rituximab may be administered per the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_532827]. 
Methylprednisolone should be used as preferred glucocorticoid premedication 
given it s shorter half -life.  
 
Glucocorticoids should not be used as premedication for FT596.  
6.6 Duration of Treatment  
Treatment consists of a single dose of rituximab  or an FDA approved biosimilar  
followed 2-3 days later  by [CONTACT_532851]596 at the patient’s assigned dose /schedule . If a 
patient cannot receive FT596 by 7 days after rituximab due to unresolved infusion 
related toxicity (refer to Section 6.1 ), FT596 is not given.  
 
All patients receiving at least one dose of FT596 will b e followed per Section 8.[ADDRESS_691916] FT 596 infusion

November 30, 2020  Page 31 of 66 Confidential  7.1 Infusion Related Reactio n Associated with FT596  
Patients will be observed for the occurrence of acute allergic/anaphylactoid 
infusion reactions such as rigors and chills, rash, urticaria, hypotension, dyspnea, 
and angioedema during and after the infusion.  
 
The management of acute infusion or allergic reactions that occur during FT596 
administration is described below.  
If Grade 4 Infusion -Related Reaction  (Life-threatening consequences; 
urgent intervention indicated) : 
Stop FT596 administration. Do not restart.  
The volume of FT596 administered prior to the infusion -related reaction must be 
documented; retain any remaining product and contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bachanova or designee  
for further instructions.  
If Grade ≤3 Infusion -Related Reaction  (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_532829]/or brief  interruption of infusion);  recurrence of 
symptoms  following initial improvement;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_532830] ): 
 Interrupt FT596 administration.  
 Manage symptoms, e.g., with antihistamines, antipyretics  and analgesics, 
according to standard institutional practice standards.  
 Resume FT596 administration only upon complete resolution of the infusion -
related reaction and at the discretion of the Investigator. Given that FT596 
administration may involve singl e or multiple bags depending on the total 
planned dose and accounting for the stability of FT596 post -thaw, FT596 
administration may continue following resolution to a Grade 1  infusion -related 
reactions as follows:  
If single -bag FT596 dosing:  
 No additional  FT596 may be administered.  
 The volume of FT596 administered prior to the infusion -related reaction must 
be documented; retain any remaining product and contact [CONTACT_1016] (or 
designee)  for further instruction.  
 Additional bags may not be administered to make up for FT596 that was not 
administered from the bag during which the infusion -related reaction 
occurred .

patients receive IV hydration with normal saline (NS) 250 ml bolus before and 250 
ml bolus after FT 596 administration  to reduce the potential  risks associated with 
DMSO.  
7.3 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or CRS -Like Symptoms  
While CRS is a clearly defined syndrome with T -cell therapy, it is generally not 
believed to be a toxicity associated with NK cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_532831]8+ T 
cells, e.g., exogenous IL -15 (Cooley 2019 ).  
 
If CRS is suspected, CRP and ferritin levels should be assessed locally, and a 
research related  serum  sample should be collected for  an IL -6 level (if feasible) . 
 
CRS must be graded as outlined in the ASTCT CRS consensus grading system 
per Section 10 (Lee 2019 ). 
 
If CRS occurs  (e.g. a differential diagnosis is recorded in the institutional medical 
record) , CRP and ferritin levels should be done three times weekly until the 
resolution of CRS per Section 8.1. In addition, a research related serum sample 
should be collected for an  IL-6 level at the time of  any change  (increase or 
decrease)  in the CRS grade. Because patients may be outpatients any missed 
collection time points will not be a protocol deviations.

7.4 Neurot oxicity  
While CNS toxicity is a clearly defined syndrome associated with T -cell-based

cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Neurotoxicity was reported in one trial of adoptively transferred NK 
cells given with subcutaneous IL -15 but the mechanism of the toxicity was not well 
defined ( Cooley 2019 ). Nervous system toxicities following CD19 CAR -T therapy 
is characterized by [CONTACT_134217], confusion, delirium, aphasia, obtundation, 
and seizures ( Yescarta USPI 2017 ; Kymriah USPI 2018 ). Cases of cerebra l edema 
have also been reported ( Brudno 2016 ). 
If signs and s ymptoms of CNS toxicity occurs, it will be graded as outlined in the 
ASTCT consensus grading system for ICANS ( Lee 2019 , Section 10 ); management 
should follow current recommendations for CAR -T-cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Neelapu 2018 ). 
If the patient  develops neurological toxicity for which cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF)

7.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
TLS is a possible risk associated with anti -tumor therapy  however the risk of TLS 
on this protocol is exceedingly low because patients have received recent high -
dose chemotherapy and tumor bulk at time of autoHCT is low . TLS symptoms 
include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps or twitches, weakness, 
numbness or tingling, fatigue, decreased urination, irregular heart rate, 
restlessness, irritability, delirium, hallucinations, and seizur es. TLS is comprised of 
abnormal lab changes that include hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.  
Prophylaxis for and management of TLS should be done in accordance with 
standard institutional practice.

All research samples go to the Masonic Cancer Center’s Translational Therapy Lab 
(TTL) except for the baseline and Day 28 for ferritin and CRP testing,  and the PRA 
anti-HLA antibody samples done prior to study treatment start and at Day 28, which 
are charged to research but run in the treatment center’s clinical lab. If additional 
ferritin and/or CRP levels are collected as part of good medical care (i.e . development 
of signs of CRS) they are to be charged as standard of care.  
 
Note:  If a patient is not abiding by [CONTACT_134220] ( Section 8.1), 
the c ollection schedule of research related samples may be altered or deleted or 
discontinued on an individual patient basis, as appropriate. During follow -up no visit 
will be solely for research and instead be linked with a standard of care visit closest to 
the targeted research related time  point.  
 
It is recognized that with novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134159], the timing of protocol 
directed research samples may miss important patient specific events. For this 
reason, up to 3 extra samples for a total of 2 10 ml of blood may be collected at 
additional time points that are not specified above.  
 
Samples to evaluate lymphocyte number and phenotype will be collected as detailed 
above for the Masonic Cancer Center Translational Therapy Lab (TTL) along with 
serum  (red top tubes) for measure of cytokines that can reflect immune activation.  
 
Flow cytometry analysis of a fraction of the PBMC will detect surface markers that 
define lymphocyte subsets (NK, NKT, B, and T cells, both CD4 and CD8), as well as 
intracellular markers that define regulatory T cells (Foxp3) and proliferating cells 
(Ki67). All remaining PBMC will be cryopreserved in 10% DMSO and stored in liquid 
nitrogen for future testing, if subject agreed to future storage at the time of initial 
consent.  
 
Samples may be sent to laboratories outside of the University of Minnesota in cases 
where testing is not available internally as embedded in the patient consent form.

10 Adverse Event Monitoring, Documentation, and Reporting  
For the purposes of the study the FT596 in combination with rituximab  (Rituxan and 
FDA approved biosimilars)  is considered the investigational prod uct.  
 
For the reminder of the section rituximab is a blanket term for Rituxan and any FDA 
approved biosimilars.  
 
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 5.0 (CTCAE) and  reported on the schedule 
below. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page.

The following definitions of adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the OnCore SAE 
Report Form in addition to routine documentation in the OnCore AE case report form 
(CRF).  
10.1 Adverse Event Terminology  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associate d with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life-threatening adverse event  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_532836] #  2019LS230 ( MT2019 -46) – FT596 plus Rituximab as Post Auto-HSCT Relapse Prophylaxis   
 
   
November 30, 2020  Page 48 of 66 Confidential   A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Importan t medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
Unexpected Event:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity tha t has been observed; or, if an investigator 
brochure is not required or avail able, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application, as amended .  
 
The categories for AE attrib ution  to study treatment  are as follows:   
 Definite – clearly related  
 Probable  – likely related  
 Possible – may be related  
 Unlikely – doubtfully related  
 Unrelated – clearly not related  
 
The following definitions are from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) Deviation Reporting:  
 
Major Deviation:  A deviation or violation that impacts the risks and benefits of the 
research; may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research data and/or 
affect a subject’s willingness to partici pate in the research. Deviations that place a 
subject at risk, but do not result in harm are considered to be major deviations.  
 
Minor Deviation:  A deviation or violation that does not impact subject safety, 
compromise the integrity of research data and/or  affect a subject’s willingness to 
participate in the research.  
10.2 AE Documentation Requirements  
Adverse event collection for the purposes of this study will focus on events felt to 
be related to FT596  and rituximab or events that cannot be attributed to othe r 
causes (i.e. transplant -related, co -morbidities ).

CPRC #  2019LS230 ( MT2019 -46) – FT596 plus Rituximab as Post Auto-HSCT Relapse Prophylaxis   
 
   
November 30, [ADDRESS_691946] component is a Phase I clinical trial 
to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT596 at Day [ADDRESS_691947] FT596 infusion. Rituximab is given 2-3 days  before FT596. In 
addition to identifying the MTD and providing preliminary estimates of safety, 
secondary objectives include providing preliminary descriptive estimates of efficacy 
such as progression -free survival, relapse and non -relapse mortality along with 
their error measurements. Correlative objectives include measurement of the 
persistence of FT596 in blood after each FT596 infusion by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_532839] 1 year, the association of FT596 p ersistence with safety and anti -
tumor activity .  
 
Component 1  will identify the MTD of FT596 when given as a single dose at Day 
30. Up to three FT596 dose levels are planned (Dose Level 1: 9x107 cells/dose, 
Dose Level 2: 3x108 cells/dose, Dose Level 3: 9x1 08 cells/dose  with a Dose 
Level  - 1: 3x107 cells/dose tested only if DLT at DL1 ).  
 
Component 1  dose limiting toxicity  is defined as any of the following events 
within 28 days after the  FT596 dosing based on CTCAE v5:  
 Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting > 7 days (not including lymphopenia)  
 Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity  
 Grade ≥3 FT596 Infusion Related Reaction  
 Grade 2 acute GVHD that requires steroid therapy >7 days or progression 
after 3 days of steroids or has pa rtial response after 14 days of treatment  
 Grade ≥3 acute GVHD  
 Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  
 Grade 3 CRS that does not resolve to < Grade 2 in 72 hours  
 Grade 3 neurotoxicity  
CPRC #  2019LS230 ( MT2019 -46) – FT596 plus Rituximab as Post Auto-HSCT Relapse Prophylaxis   
 
   
November 30, 2020  Page 55 of 66 Confidential   Grade 3 organ toxicity involving vital organs; cardiac, central nervous s ystem 
and pulmonary that lasts for longer than  7 days including Grade 3 
Investigations (laboratory values) of any duration that indicate damage to 
vital organs.  
 Any Grade 3 non -hematological toxicity that does not resolve to ≤Grade 2 
within 72 hours; exce pting Grade 3 renal and hepatic toxicity which may take 
up to 7 days to resolve to ≤Grade  2 
 
The MTD will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a modified Continual Reassessment Method 
(CRM). ( Goodman 1995 ) The CRM uses a power model for the pr obability of DLT 
at each dose, where the probability of toxicity at dose i is modeled as pi[INVESTIGATOR_532840](α)  
where pi [CONTACT_832] a constant and α is distributed a priori as a normal random variable with 
mean 0 and variance 2.  The goal of this CRM will be to identify one of  the 3 dose 
levels corresponding to the desired maximum acceptable toxicity rate of ≤25%.  
 
Initial estimates of toxicity or the “skeleton” estimates are provided by [CONTACT_15370].  
The initial estimates or prior probability of toxicity are listed as 1%, 3%, and 6% for 
doses 1, 2 and 3, respectively. As the study progresses, the CRM will continua lly 
update the estimates of the toxicity probabilities.   
 
Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3 starting at Dose Level 1. A minimum of 28 days 
will separate each cohort . For Dose Level 1 a minimum of 28 days will separate 
each patient to assess for dose l imiting toxicity (DLT). In subsequent cohorts, the 
1st and 2nd patient will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_691948] patient from the previous cohort 
has reached 28 days. The MTD will be identified when the total sample size of 18 
is exhausted or 6 patients are sequentially en rolled at the same dose. A maximum 
of 18 patients is used in part due to low expected toxicity. The function ‘crm’ from 
the R package ‘dfcrm’ will calculate posterior means of toxicity probabilities.  The 
CRM uses a Bayesian framework that combines experie nce from patients in the 
earlier part of the trial with the clinician’s initial best estimate of the toxicity rates at 
each dose level to estimate a dose level that best corresponds to the target toxicity 
of ≤25%. Dose escalation of more than one level is not permitted with this design.   
 
Component 2  will use a similar design but identify the MTD of FT596 when given 
as a single dose at Day 7. Up to two dose levels of FT596 are planned (1 Dose 
Level below the MTD from component 1 and the MTD from component 1) so any 
two sequential dose levels of the fo llowing may be included ( Dose Level -1: 3x107

Level  3: 9x108 cells/dose).  
 
The DLT events for Component 2 are the same as in Component 1 except for the 
addition of:  
 Non-engraftment by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_691949] -transplant  
 
The MTD will be identified in the same fashion as Component 1 except that the 
initial estimates or prior probability of toxicity may be slightly higher due to the 
infusion of cells at Day 7 plus the additional pos sible DLT event. Assuming that we 
start at Dose Level 2, the skeleton probabilities might be listed as 5% and 10% for 
doses 2 and 3, respectively. The target toxicity level will still be ≤25%. As in 
Component 1, the CRM will continually update the estimate s of the toxicity 
probabilities of both doses; first at the end of [ADDRESS_691950] three patients; and at the end of the of [ADDRESS_691951] cohort to assess for dose limiting toxicity (DLT). 
In subsequent cohorts, the 1st and 2nd patient will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_691952] likely include 12 patients under each  component but could range from 2 to 
18 patients. With expected enrollment of 12 -18 patients/year, accrual for each 
component should be complete  within 1.5 years. So after combining both trials, 
accrual should be complete in 2.5 -3 years.

November 30, 2020  Page 61 of 66 Confidential  Appendix I – LUGANO 2014 CLASSIFI CATION : TUMOR RESPONSE 
ASSESSMENT IN LYMPHOMA  
Method of Assessment  
Assessments regarding sites of disease in subjects with lymphoma based on clinical, laboratory and 
radiographic evaluation are summarized in Table A . Positron emission tomography (PET) -computed 
tomography (CT) scan is the recommended radiographic modality for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -avid, 
nodal lymphomas. For lymphomas that are not FDG -avid, anatomic CT scans should be used.  
Bone marrow assessments will be based on morphologic eva luation of bone marrow biopsies. 
Immunohistochemistry may be used to assess response if the sample is indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293].  
Bone marrow biopsies are not required if there is positive FDG -PET uptake in the bone marrow.  
Otherwise, in this study of s ubjects with relapsed/refractory lymphoma a bone marrow biopsy should be 
performed only under the following circumstances:  
 A bone marrow biopsy is required at baseline if the subject had a history of bone marrow involvement 
with lymphoma prior to the start  of study treatment;  
 During the course of the study, if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear 
cause clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_532842];  
 During the course of the study, a bone marrow biopsy must be performe d to confirm a radiographic 
CR and show no morphologic evidence of disease, or be negative by [CONTACT_532864], to assign an overall response of CR.

a PET-CT is adequate for determination of bone marrow involvement and can be considered highly 
suggestive for involvement of other extralymphatic sites. Biopsy confirmation of those sites  can be considered if 
necessary.

November 30, [ADDRESS_691964] scans are based on focal uptake in nodal and 
extranodal sites that are consistent with lymphoma based on distribution and/or characteristics as visualized 
by [CONTACT_532865]. Unlike tumor assess ments based exclusively on anatomic CT scan, no distinction 
between target and non -target lesions based on PET scans is required.   
[ADDRESS_691965] ’s overall disease burden. Where 
applicable, these should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease. Definitions of baseline 
measurable disease are as follows, lesions not fulfilling these definitions are designated non -measurable:  
 Nodal lesion:  must be greater than [ADDRESS_691966] diameter (LDi)   
 Extranodal lesion:  should be greater than [ADDRESS_691967] of the perpendicular diameters (SPD).  
All other lesions including non -measurable disease and measurable disease beyond the six designated 
target lesions should be followed as non -measured disease as non -target lesions, e.g.,  cutan eous, GI, 
spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, bone, and bone marrow.  
3.2 Split Lesions and Confluent Lesions  
Lesions may split or may become confluent over time. In the case of split lesions from a designated target 
lesion, the i ndividual products of the perpendicular diameters ([COMPANY_003]) for each split lesion should be summed 
together to represent the [COMPANY_003] derived from the initial target lesion; this [COMPANY_003] is added to the sum of the 
[COMPANY_003]s of the remaining lesions to determine target lesio n SPD. If subsequent growth of any or all of these 
discrete nodes occurs, the nadir of each individual node is used to determine progression.  
In the case of confluent lesions from designated target lesions, the [COMPANY_003] of the confluent mass should be 
compared with the SPDs of the individual lesions. A >50% increase in [COMPANY_003] of the confluent lesion compared 
with the SPD of individual lesions would therefore constitute progressive disease.  
3.3 Definitions of Tumor Response and Progression  
Target lesion responses will b e categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable 
disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).  
For non -target lesions in the absence of quantitative measurement, responses will be characterized as 
follows: CR, Non -CR/Non -PD (correspondin g to PR/MR/SD), or PD.  
CPRC #  2019LS230 ( MT2019 -46) – FT596 plus Rituximab as Post Auto-HSCT Relapse Prophylaxis   
 
   
November 30, 2020  Page 63 of 66 Confidential  For both target and non -target lesions, a response category of not evaluable (NE) is provided for situations 
in which there is inadequate information to otherwise categorize response status.  
The best overall response (BOR) will be de termined based on an overall evaluation of target lesions, non -
target lesions and new lesions  as summarized in Table B . The BOR is defined as the best overall response 
recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression or relapse. The baseline measurement 
will be taken as a reference for determinations of response. The nadir measurement will be taken as a 
reference for PD; this measurement constitutes the smallest measurement recorded, including the baseline 
measurement if this is the smallest measurement.  
Confirmation of overall response is not required. Confirmation of PD may be warranted, e.g.,  small FDG -
PET avid lesions that do not fulfill the dimensional criteria for PD but are confirmed to be progressive  
disease based on histologic examination or continued growth of the lesion.

However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequat e

extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of t he

Abstract  
Importance:  A 2017 National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NAS) report 
suggest s that certain behavioral  interventions  show promise  as strategies for delaying  or 
preventing dementia but require a stronger evidence base . 
Objective:  To examine  five behavioral interventions ’ effectiveness at impacting the outcomes of 
highest importance to persons with mild cognitive impairment (pwMCI) .  
Design:   Multi-site cluster randomized, multi -component comparative effectiveness trial.  
Participants:  Two-hundred seventy two pwMCI and their partners were enrolled . PwMCI met 
prevailing National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer Association for MCI with memory 
impairm ent. Partners were cognitively normal and had frequent contact [CONTACT_148038].  
Interventions:  The intervention program was modeled on the  Mayo Clinic HABIT program , a 
10-day, [ADDRESS_169651] -intervention with a one -day 
booster session occurring at 6 months.  
Outcomes:  Primary outcome measures were selected based on the preference rankings o f 
previous  HABIT completers . All measures were focused on pwMCI at one year of follow -up. 
Measures included validated scales of quality of life (QOL), mood, self-efficacy and memory 
based -activities of daily living  (mADL) .  
Results:  Wellness Education had the greatest estimated  impact on QOL . Mood and self -efficacy 
were most positively impact ed by a combination of wellness education, yoga, compensation 
based calendar training (the MSS) and supportive group therapy . Memory ADLs  were most 
negatively affected by [CONTACT_148039]. All e ffect sizes were modest .  
Conclusion and Relevance:  The findings provide further support for behavioral interventions and 
extend our p reliminary comparative effectiveness finding showing  MSS to  be superior to  brain 
fitness exercises  for mADLs . As might be expected , different outcomes are optimized by 
[CONTACT_148040] . The findings serve as a preliminary foundation for 
personalized approaches to behavioral interventions for pwMCI and that comport which each 
individuals priority outcomes.

Introduction  
As a medical community, we are increasingly able to identify Alzheimer’s disease  (AD)  
at an early  stage, including a Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage . Approximately 15 -20% of 
people age [ADDRESS_169652] of these individuals develop a 
dementia related t o Alzheimer’s disease in 5 years [1]. Amnestic MCI is defined as memory  
abnormal ity beyond normal age related decline with relatively intact  functional capacity , in other 
words, not (yet) dementia  [2].  
There continue to be no FDA approved medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_148028] . In the absence of 
medical therapy, patients and families are often presented  numerous recommendations regarding  
nonpharmacological interventions  (e.g., start keepi[INVESTIGATOR_148029], follow a physical exercise program, 
play computer memory games, etc.)  which can be overwhelming.  There is some promising 
evidence that such behavioral interventions can be beneficial  in MCI . Nam ely, recent meta -
analyses suggest that cognitive interventions have significant, mild to moderate effect sizes 
(Hedges’ g ranging from .23 to .40) for persons with MCI (pwMCI) on multiple cognitive 
domains, including memory, attention, and processing speed  [3]. Meta -analysis of non -cognitive 
effects of cognitive interventions in pwMCI demonstrated s mall, but significant effects for  
activities of daily living ( ADLs ; Cohen’s d = 0.23), mood (d = 0. 16), and metacognitive 
outcomes (i.e., how one thinks/feels about one’s memory; d = 0.30) [4]. Physical exercise meta -
analysis outcomes in individuals over [ADDRESS_169653] sizes on 
cognition (mean effect size = .29)  [5].  
Only recently have enough studies been completed on individual interventions  in 
cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise training, or psychotherapy to allow meaningful meta -
analyses like these to emerge in the literature. Still, these reviews struggle with blending an array 
of various approaches to such interventions , in differ ent delivery systems, in differing “doses,” 
and with different measured outcomes. In other words, there still is not consensus on the best 
method to deliver a specific behavioral intervention . Nor is there a consensus  regarding  how to 
measure the outcomes . Yet there is increasing support for the use of multi -component 
interventions in dementia prevention efforts  [6].  For example the Alzheimer’s Associa tion is 
currently funding a $20 million study of physical exercise, diet , cognitive and social stimulation 
and improved self -management of health conditions (particularly blood pressure). Yet  there is a 
dearth  of literature examining  the effectiveness of various behavioral interventions  in 
comparison to each other .  
Previously , we have compared outcomes for a compensatory cognitive rehabilitation 
intervention and computerized  cognitive exercise intervention as well as no -treatment control 
groups in randomized trials  [7, 8] . In these studies , patient memory related ADLs  (mADLs)  were 
significantly improved over no treatment in those randomized to the cognitive rehab ilitation  
condition  (but not for those completing computerized cognitive exercise),  and sen se of memory 
self-efficacy significantly improved  for those trained in use of the calendar system (but not in the 
computerized cognitive exercise  or no treatment  condition s) [7, 8] . Further, partners in both 
treatment groups showed stable mood  and anxiety  while partners in the untreated group showed 
worsening depression and anxiety over 6 months  [9]. Similarly, systematic review of the 
literature has supported that various computerized interventions aimed at improving cognition 
may have impact on reducing anxiety and depression in individuals with MCI, and those trained 
with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_148030] (like the calendar training highlighted above) show 
more impact on ADLs, self -beliefs about memory, and confidence  [4].  
There is significant debate within the field as to which outcomes to measure and how to 
consistently measure them. The vast majority of studies of behavioral interventions to date have 
focused on the impact on cognition itself for older adults or for those with MCI. However, the 
growing culture of patient  centered care c onsiders patients to be  member s of the healthcare team 
with an active voice in their treatment and care . There is increasing awareness of the need  to ask 
what our patient  want from an intervention. However, n o trials to date have utilized the input of 
persons with MCI (pwMCI) or their family members in the study design and selection of 
outcomes.  Thus, in the first aim of this larger study, we established that pwMCI  and their 
partners rated patient quality of life  (QOL) , patient self -efficacy, patient mood , and memory 
dependent ADLs (mADLs)  to be the more important target outcomes for behavioral 
intervention [10, 11] .  
In the subsequent aims , results of which are  reported here , we sought to compare the 
effectiveness of the five behavioral interventions that compose the Mayo Clinic HABIT Healthy 
Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking® Program, a 50 hour behavioral intervention 
treatment program with 5 components  in impacting those highly valued outcomes  by [CONTACT_148041] . 
The 5 components include physical exercise , computerized brain fitness , patient and family 
education, support group, and cognitive rehabilitation with a compensatory memory support 
system (calendaring system) . Each of these interventions  was originally chosen on a theoretical 
basis, because each h ad support individually in the literature for effectiveness when compared to 
no treatment controls across a variety of outcomes [ e.g., cognitive functioning, QOL, mood, 
partner burden ] [4, 12]  [3, 5] .  
Methods  
Full details of the study protocol and recruitment have been reported previously  [13], and briefly  
summarized below.  
Patient and Partner Engagement . Prior to obtaining funding we created patient/partner and 
stakeholder advisory groups . The patient/partner advisory group included 8 members , all of 
whom had completed the HABIT clinical program (described below). Each recruitment site had 
a patient or partner representative included. The stakeholder advisory group included 
representatives of the Alzheimer’s Association Chapters in Minnesota an d [LOCATION_012], as well as a 
representative from the Minnesota Board on Aging . Both advisory groups reviewed our 
preliminary  protocol . The patient and partner advisory group strongly encouraged the conduct of 
the comparative effectiveness protocol  in such a way  as to ensure that all participants received 
substantial treatment ; they  endorsed our randomized suppression of one treatment component 
over a design involving a no treatment control . The advisory  group also provided pi[INVESTIGATOR_148031] 1 of t he study as re ported elsewhere [9]. The patient and partner advisory group met the 
princip al investigators via teleconference monthly during the first year of the project and roughly 
quarterly thereafter to provide feedback rega rding recruitment strategies and other iss ues. The 
most engaged of the advisors served as co -authors of the published protocol paper [11] and were 
briefed on the final results .  
Participants  
Dyads consisting of a pwMCI and a partner participated in the interventions. 272 such 
couples were recruited through clinical services at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Arizona, and 
[LOCATION_012] as well as University of Washington.  Consecutive candidates with diagnoses of amnestic 
MCI (single or multi -domain)  [2] were screened and if potentially eligible approach ed for the 
study . They then  underwent further evaluat ion based upon  study inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
enrolled in the trial. Inclusion criteria included a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [14] < 0.5, not 
taking , or stable on , nootropic medication for at least 3 months, fluent in English , and able to 
attend with a cognitively normal (Mini Mental Status Exam [15] >24) care partner who ha d at 
least twice -weekly contact [CONTACT_148042] . Exclusion criteria included current participation in 
another treatment -related clinical trial or significant auditory, visual, or motor impairment 
impacting ability to participate in the program. PwMCI completed the Dementia Rating Scale -2 
[14] as a measure of general cognitive function at baseline.  
Intervention and Randomization:  
The intervent ion lasted  [ADDRESS_169654] once 
at each site. In order to achieve our enrollment goals, each Mayo Clinic site ran an extra session.  
Components of HABIT include:  
1. Yoga : Participants engaged in daily [ADDRESS_169655] -HABIT  [16]. 
2. Brain fitness : Participants completed [ADDRESS_169656] -HABIT.  
3. Wellness education: Couples attended daily 45 -50 minute lectures covering a range of 
health topi[INVESTIGATOR_148032], Changes in Roles and Relationship s, Sleep 
Hygiene, MCI and Depression, Nutrit ion, and Assistive Technology . Couples were given 
resources and written information to inform their choices towards incorporating the 
healthy behavioral changes discussed in the lectures (e.g., improving diet) in to their lives 
post-HABIT.  
4. Support  groups: Th e pwMCI  and partners met separately in support groups  for 45-[ADDRESS_169657] 
around caregiving themes.  
5. Cognitive rehabilitation: The pwMCI received cognitive rehabilitation daily focused on 
compensatory -focused memory supp ort system (MSS) development  (i.e., a calendar/note 
taking system) . This involved training from a  structure d curriculum in use of a two page 
per day written memory book to develop compensatory written reminders for important 
appointments, tasks, or experiences/thoughts of the day . Both pwMCI  and partners were 
provided the paper MSS materials in an ongoing manner to enable continued use of the 
system post -HABIT.  
Outcome Measures:   
Completed by [CONTACT_148043]:   
Participant QOL  was the primary outcome measure as assessed by [CONTACT_94259] -AD 
(QOL -AD)[17] overall score. Participant mood was measur ed by [CONTACT_80827][INVESTIGATOR_148033] (CES -D)[18], and p articipant self -efficacy was assessed using 
modified, selected items from the Chronic Disease Self -Efficacy Scales [19].  
Completed by [CONTACT_40335]:  
Patient memory functional status:  Participant funct ional memory was assessed by 8 memory -
related items on the informant -based Everyday Cognition (E -Cog) [20] questionnaire .  
Timing . 
All measures were completed  at baseline, treatment end, [ADDRESS_169658] 
intervention . Six-months and 12 month  data collection was part of a one -day booster session that 
included a refresher for each of the 4 interventions originally provided  [13]. 
Adherence . 
Adherence to taught program activities as well as possible treatment diffusion of the 
withheld intervention were  assessed at [ADDRESS_169659] intervention by [CONTACT_148044] 5 intervention related activities . 
We categorized participants into three levels of adherent: adherent, non -adherent, or 
indeterminate. Table [ADDRESS_169660] in the literature to support each definition of adherent . 
Power analysis . 
We used approaches developed for this design to estimate the power to conclude that a 
specific HABIT® component provided benefit on the primary outcome. Data from  a prior 
clinical sample and a matched, non -randomized, untreated control group provided initial 
estimates for this power estimation . We computed the expected variance of the estimated 
treatment effect for one HABIT® component by [CONTACT_148045] -covariance matrix derived from the design matrix corresponding to the allocation of 
treatment groups within the study. Using this, we estimated the magnitude of the effect size 
(difference score divided by [CONTACT_148046]) that is de tectable with 80% power using a 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_169661] that we ha d approximately 80% power 
to conclude that a treatment component is efficacious if it is associated with an improvement of 
0.[ADDRESS_169662] deviation units  (d = 0.53) while accounting for effects due to the other treatment 
components, study sites, and sessions within sites. We have observed differences larger than this 
in previous studies. For instance, we observed that training in the MSS improves E -cog sco res by 
[CONTACT_47071] 0.[ADDRESS_169663] follow -up in a previous study [8]. Therefore the study had  
sufficient power to detect meaningful changes of magnitudes that we expect ed.  
Statistical analysis.  
For analysis of the primary aim , we utilized linear mixed -effects regression models to 
obtain the estimated change in each of the four outcome measures ( QOL , self-efficacy, mood, 
and functional ability ) from baseline to 12 months along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the 5 separa te study arms . The model included the outcome measure at 4 time points (baseline, 
end of treatment (EOT), 6 -month follow -up, and 12 -month follow -up) with separate random 
effects for participant, session, and time point within session . Fixed effects include d indicator 
variables for each of the 4 sites, age, sex, interactions of age and sex with each of the 3 non -
baseline time points (6 parameters), and indicator variables representing each of the 5 treatments 
at each of the 3 non -baseline time points (15 par ameters) . We reported the coefficients 
corresponding to each of the study arms at 12 months along with the 95% profile confidence 
intervals and likelihood ratio test p values in addition to the coefficients corresponding to each of 
the study arms at EOT an d 6 month follow -up. The coefficients were reported as the fitted mean 
change in outcome from baseline to the given time point for an individual with covariates equal 
to their mean values . In addition, we performed likelihood ratio tests to evaluate whethe r there 
was evidence of differences in outcome between study arms at EOT, 6 months, and 12 months . 
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed . Analyses were performed using R statistical 
software (version 3.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).  
Results  
Participants  
There were 272 participants from 4  sites who were randomized as described above to one 
of five study arms  after enrollment  (Figure  1). Participant baseline characteristics are described 
in Table 2 according to study arm.  There were no  meaningful  differences in demographics  or 
general cognitive status  across sites or samples.   Participants in the no support group arm were 
slightly more likely to be taking memory medications.   Two hundred eleven of t hese partic ipants 
completed the study.  Two participants died over the course of follow -up, 42 participants 
formally withdrew (predominantly due to health concerns of participant or partner, or because of 
time commitments) and [ADDRESS_169664] to follow -up.   
Outcome Measures  
Results by [CONTACT_148047], mADLs, mood, and self -efficacy are displayed in 
Table 3. 
Quality of Life  
All 5 study arms showed improvement in QOL -AD overall score from baseline to EOT 
with the fitted mean change from baseline ranging from 1.10 (no support groups) to 1.5 5 (no 
wellness education) (all p ≤ 0.049), but these changes were not sustained through 6 -month or 12-
month follow -up. There was no evidence of a difference between study arms in change in QOL -
AD from ba seline at EOT ( p=0.98), 6 -month follow -up (p=0.38), or 12 -month follow -up 
(p=0.21) . In comparative effectiveness analysis at [ADDRESS_169665] on QOL (effect size = 0.34, p = .02). See Figure 2 a. 
Self-efficacy  
At EOT there were improvements in self -efficacy from baseline for the arm with no 
support group, no MSS training, and n o yoga . At 6 months, the arm with no yoga  had 
statistically significant worsening of self -efficacy, though there were no significant within group 
changes by 12 months . There were no statistically significant differences between study arm s in 
change in self -efficacy from baseline at EOT ( p=0.58), 6 -month follow -up (p=0.19), or 12 -
month follow -up (p=0.23) . In comparative effectiveness analysis at [ADDRESS_169666] on self -efficacy (effect size = 0.31, p = .04. See Figure 2 b. 
Mood  
Three of the five arms (no MSS, no BF, and no yoga ) showed an improveme nt in mood 
from baseline to EOT . The remaining two  arms showed change in the direction of improvement, 
but were not statistically significant . At 6-month follow -up there was no evidence of a change 
from baseline for any of the [ADDRESS_169667] 
these differences are between the arm with no wellness education (mean fitted change 95% CI: 
0.50 to 4.33) and no computerized brain fitness training (mean fitted change 95% CI: -3.79 to 
0.00) . In the context of multicomponent treatment involving four interventions, replacing BF  
with another intervention  appeared to have significant positive impact on mood  as follows:  
replace with wellness education (effect size = 0.53, p = .001), replace with yoga (effect size = 
0.34, p = .035), and repl ace with MSS calendar training (effect size = 0.34, p = .04). These 
findings suggest only support groups were not statistically better than BF in terms of impact on 
patient mood . See Figure [ADDRESS_169668] a significant 
improvement in everyd ay memory from baseline to EOT . There was no evidence of change in 
any group for  everyday memory from baseline to 6 -month follow -up. By 12 -month follow -up, 
all of the groups had a significant worsening of everyday memory function with the exception of 
the arm with no support groups . There were no statistically significant differences between study 
arms in change in everyday cognition from baseline at EOT ( p=0.10), 6 -month follow -up 
(p=0.90), or 12 -month follow -up (p=0.07). See Figure [ADDRESS_169669] on QOL  or mood 
outcomes . Adherence to exercise  broadly was positively  associated with self-efficacy outcomes 
(p < .05, d = .29)  and mADL s outcomes  (p < .05, d = .26) . Wellness adherence was positively 
associated with mADL outcomes as well (p < .05, d = .22) . Adherence impact on outcome 
variables is presented in Table 4. 
Discussion  
In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NAS) released 
its report evaluating strategies aimed at preventing or delaying normal age related cognitive 
decline, MCI, or Alzheimer’s -type dementia [21]. That report concludes that the data do not 
currently support a widespread public  health campaign for any  particular prevention strategy. 
However, they report promising results with one medical intervention (blood pressure 
management) and two behavioral  interventions: cognitive training  and physical activity . In this 
study, we sought t o examine the comparative effectiveness of behavioral interventions, including 
cognitive training through either the MSS compensation system or computerized BF training and 
physical activity through yoga, as well as the impact of wellness education and sup portive group 
therapy  on individuals with MCI .   
This study was a patient -centered comparative effectiveness outcome study . Thus, our 
methodology  and results were guided by [CONTACT_148048]/partner focus groups (see full protocol [13]). As a consequence , the primary outcomes 
were defined by [CONTACT_148049], self -efficacy , mood, and mADLs [11]. Further, we 
were prompted to forgo  the traditional “addit ive” approach of clinical trials of randomly adding 
participants to one intervention at a time, to undertake a novel, “subtractive” approach of 
randomly withholding one intervention at a time . This assured that all participants w ould receive 
substantial interventions while still permitting comparison of the components . This design 
inverts the typi[INVESTIGATOR_148034] . Rather than looking to associate the best 
outcomes with the presence of an intervention, this design requires considera tion which groups 
has the poorest outcomes associated with a missing intervention .  
Treatment End  
Immediately after the intervention , all combinations of behavioral intervention resu lted in 
reports of improved QOL . Thus, each of our interventions actually may positively impact QOL 
in the short run . It could be argued that  simply participating in an intensive group intervention 
leads to a sense of better QOL immediately following the group, regardle ss of what the 
intervention is, simply because the act of doing something  rather than nothing  fosters  an 
improved sense of QOL.  On the other hand, meta-analysis of cognitive interventions in MCI 
have not previously been shown to significantly impact  on QOL [4], suggesting mere contact 
[CONTACT_148050] .  
All groups except those missing BF show ed statistically significant improve ments in  self-
efficacy  by [CONTACT_148051] . This  suggest s that not participatin g in BF may have some cost in 
terms of improved self -efficacy.  The findings regard ing self -efficacy are i n keepi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] a n 
overall positive effect size of d = .30  for meta -cognitive variables such as sense of self -efficacy  
reported in a prior meta -analysis of cognitive interventions for MCI [4]. However , our finding 
stand s in contrast  to prior studies showing compu terized training interventions  did not impact 
beliefs about one’s memory ability confidence [22, 23] .  
Mood improved signif icantly  by [CONTACT_148052], no BF, and no yoga  
groups, but did not improve for the no  support  group or no wellness education groups.  Thus, 
support group and wellness education may be more  important in mood improvement  than MSS, 
BF, or yoga  at treatment end . Improvement in mADLs at treatment end was only observed for 
those not receiving support group. Thus, support group did not appear to play a significant role in 
improving mADLs in the near term  or conversely , the combination of MSS, BF, yoga and 
wellness was most potent at improving near term mADLs.  
12 Month Follow -Up 
We were particularly interested in the lasting effects of these interventions over time, 
after the initial “honeymoon” period of participati on subsided. By [ADDRESS_169670] better outcomes [8, 24] . In this study, a dherence to exercise 
broadly  improve d self-efficacy, and adherence to exercise  and wellness improved mADLs . There 
is much still to be determined about the impact on adherence to outcomes . For example, of the 
interventions, the physical exercise  component (broadly defined) had the most individuals still 
adherent  at one year (55%) compared to the other variables (BF = 25%, w ellness = 23%, MSS = 
12%, and s upport group 9%), giving more power to detect significant differences in the physical 
exercise  component for adherent and non -adherent groups . Further, our grading of adherence is 
not equivalent across interventions . For example we required s trict use to our particular calendar 
and brain fitness programs to be considered adherent to those component s but accepted any form 
of physical exercise towards adherence to the physical exercise component . This mak es it 
difficult  to compare impact of adherence across components in this study design .  Most 
behavioral interventions in this area are intended not a s one time treatments, like a course of 
antibiotics but more as life -style modifications intended to persist as long as possible.  Research 
on efficacious and cost -effective ways to optimize adherence is needed.  
In this type of behavioral intervention tre atment diffusion is also a problem. In drug trials 
it is generally difficult to get the experimental medication unless your are randomized to it.  But 
here participants could freely engage in the behaviors that had been suppressed in their 
intervention arm . For example, 82% of the physical exercise suppressed group met physical 
exercise adherence guidelines at [ADDRESS_169671] of receiving an 
intervention . However, maximizing the number of interventions received was of great import to 
our patient advisors in designing this trial  [13]. To try to help simplify the explanation of the 
results , we also sought to statistically examine the impact of receiving each component by 
[CONTACT_148053]: b rain 
fitness. Whe n viewed in this manner , wellness education appears to be most important to QOL at 
one year post intervention; w ellness education, yoga, and MSS calendar training wer e important 
for mood outcomes; s upport group had a positiv e impact on self -efficacy, and y oga was most 
beneficial to mADLs . Thus, for parti cipants who share the same opi[INVESTIGATOR_148035] (patient QOL, self -efficacy, mood, and 
functional ability [11], the most benefit would be found in the long term of participat ing in a 
program that included w ellness education, yoga, MSS calendar training, and support group. The 
same alumni group also  ranked the importance of our interventions  overall as 1) MSS, 2) s upport 
group, 3) w ellness education, 4) y oga, a nd 5) b rain fitness  [11], furthe r supporting the 
importance of these top four interventions .  Though these findings are preliminary , they provide 
a start on the development of ‘personalized’ intervention protocols wherein the interve ntions are 
tailored to the outcomes of greatest import ance to the pwMCI and his or her support network . 
Other outcomes including pwMCI cognition, time to dementia diagnosis and partner  QOL, mood 
and burden, are available to us as secondary outcomes and will be reported elsewhere.  
For the time being however, the urgency of dementia and an individual and public health 
concern is great [21]. Under the circumstances it is reasonable to pursue all possible behavioral 
approaches in multiple components programs as studied here and deployed in the World Wide 
Fingers network (wwfingers.com).  
While we utilized our par ticular version of these intervention s, similar behavioral 
interventions (therapy based cognitive rehabilitation, computerized brain training programs, 
physical exercise, psychotherapy/group therapy, and education programs for memory loss ) are 
being offere d in various combinations in medical and research centers around the world [4]. 
While our exact conclusions may not generalize to other forms of the behavioral intervention 
(e.g., resistance training as physical exercise versus yoga), we offer th ese results  as a starting 
point in the literature to begin these sorts of comparative effectiveness trials. Future research thus 
can look at the nuances  of different types of physical exercise compared to different types of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_148036], etc., and combin ations thereof.   The recruited cohort was 
ultimately not diverse and was highly educated.  It is not clear how results might change in more 
representative samples or in specific underrepresented populations.   
 
Conclusions:  Wellness education had the most  impact on our highest patient ranked outcome of 
QOL by [CONTACT_148054] . Psychological outcomes of mood and self -efficacy were 
most positively impacted at one year by [CONTACT_7624] a combination of wellness education, 
yoga, compensation ba sed calendar training (the MSS) and  supportive group therapy. When 
functional independence wa s considered as the outcome, a combination of MSS training, 
computer BF, wellness education, and yoga  appear ed to be of most benefit in maintenance of 
mADLS, with par ticular decline if yoga  was not included.

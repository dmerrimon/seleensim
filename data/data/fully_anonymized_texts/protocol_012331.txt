2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Protocol 2014 -0435

Page 3 of 31 
 The Philadelphia chromosome [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] (Ph+), is the most common cytogenetic 
abnormality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults.1,2 Up to 40 -50% of ALL patients 
older than 60 years will be Ph+. Before the introduction of molecularly targeted therapy, Ph+ 
ALL was associated with lower remission rates and a very poor prognosis with a median survival 
of less than one year.3  
With the introduction of therapy using ABL -tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted to the 
aberrant BCR -ABL protein, the outcome of Ph -positive ALL has im proved substantially and has 
been the major treatment advance for adults with ALL in the past two decades.[ADDRESS_219618] TKI developed for use in Ph+ leukemias, has been combined with combination 
chemotherapy by [CONTACT_185980] 
(CR) and disease -free surviva l (DFS) rates.5,[ADDRESS_219619] to report on 
the combination of imatinib with chemotherapy.5,6 The 3 year CR duration and OS rates were 
significantly im proved with hyper -CVAD -imatinib therapy compared to historical controls 
treated with hyper -CVAD alone (68% vs. 24% and 54% vs. 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). 
Second generation TKI dasatinib has also been combined with hyper -CVAD chemotherapy with 
improved outcomes.7 In a report of 35 patients treated with hyper -CVAD + dasatinib, the CR 
rate of 94% was achieved with estimated 2 -year OS of 64%.[ADDRESS_219620] treatment of Ph+ 
ALL.1,2,4,8 Ponatinib is a novel TKI with single -agent activity in patients with T315I mutations.9 
Cortes and colleagues reported activity of ponatinib monotherapy in patients with Ph+ 
leukemias.9 The primary endpoint for the Ph+ ALL and CML in lymphoid blast phase disease 
phase  was major hematologic response (MaHR) , and was achieved in 31% of patients with CML 
in lymphoid blast crisis and 41% of patients with Ph+ ALL.  
Bosutinib is a second generation TKI and is a dual Abl and Src kinase inhibitor. Bosutinib was 
recently approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase 
CML with resistance/ intolerance to prior therapy.10-12 In a phase I/II study in advanced Ph+ 
leukemia with r esistance/ intolerance to imatinib, patients received single -agent bosutinib (500 
mg daily).13 One hundred thirty four patients were enrolled (63 accele rated phase [AP], [ADDRESS_219621] 
phase [BP], 23 ALL). Non -hematologic treatment -related adverse events occurring in ≥10% of 
pts were diarrhea (67%), vomiting (40%), nausea (37%), rash (20%), and fatigue (10%). Grade 
3/4 adverse events of any causality occurring in ≥5% of pts were diarrhea (6%), pneumonia 
(6%), elevated ALT (6%), vomiting (5%), and dyspnea (5%). Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity of 
any causality were anemia (37%), neutropenia (46%), and thrombocytopenia (65%). For the 
evaluable patients with BP and A LL, major cytogenetic response and major molecular response 
occurred in 57% and 34% patients, respectively. Thus, bosutinib is an active agent for treatment 
of patients with advanced Ph+ leukemia.  
CD22 expression occurs in >90% of patients with ALL. Inotuz umab ozogamicin (IO) is a CD22 
monoclonal antibody bound to a toxin, calecheamicin, and has shown single -agent activity in 
Protocol 2014 -0435

 relapsed/refractory ALL.14 In a phase II study, patients were given IO at 1.8 mg/m2 
intravenously every 3 -4 weeks. Forty -nine patients were treated . The median number of courses 
administered were 2 (range 1 -5) and the median time between courses was 3 weeks (range 3 -6). 
The overall response rate was 57% (CR 18%, marrow CR 39%).  There were 7 patients with Ph+ 
ALL of which 3 (43%) had a response. Twen ty-four percent patients had grade 1 –2 and 4% had 
grade 3 increases in bilirubin. Grade 1 –2 elevations of serum aminotransferase were noted in 
55% patients and grade 3 elevations in 2% patients. Based on higher in vitro efficacy with more 
frequent exposure , a weekly schedule (0.8 mg/m2 day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 days 8 and 15, every 3 -4 
weeks) has been developed.15 With the weekly schedule (n=34), overall response rate was 53% 
(similar to 57% noted with the every 3 weeks schedule). With the weekly schedule, reversible 
grade 1 –2 and 3 –4 bilirubin elevations were observed in 3% and 0% patients, respectively. 
Reversibl e grade 1 –2 and 3 –4 liver enzyme elevations were observed in 21% and 6%, 
respectively on the weekly dose. Thus, weekly schedule has similar efficacy as every [ADDRESS_219622] shown independent clinical activity in patients with 
Ph+ ALL (and CML lymphoid bl ast phase ), we hypothesize that combination strategy (‘chemo -
free’ approach) would lead to improved clinical outcomes. We propose a phase I/II clinical trial 
with combination therapy with bosutinib and IO. If successful, this would represent a major 
advanc e in the management of patients with Ph+ ALL.  
The present study will include patients with either Ph+ ALL or CML in lymphoid blast phase  
(CML -LBC). Both these disorders are characterized by [CONTACT_185981] e of the Philadelphia chromosome.16,17 The disease biology, clinical 
outcomes and management of patients with CML -LBC and Ph+ ALL is identical [NCCN 
guidelines (version 4.2013)]. The presence of Philadelphia chromosome defines these disease 
subgroups which are many times impossible to differentiate from each other ( e.g., de-novo blast 
phase versus Ph+ ALL) and therefore, it is not surprising that many pi[INVESTIGATOR_185961].9,18,19    
Frontline Ph+ ALL Cohort: Outcomes of older patients with ALL remain suboptimal with long -
term disease free control of < 20% at [ADDRESS_219623] chemotherapy. In analysis reported by O’Brien 
and colleagues, the risk of death  in CR due to infections was 34%.[ADDRESS_219624] been reported to be effective and safe in patients with ALL. Use of 
antibody -drug conjugate inotuzumab and lower -intensity chemotherapy has been  shown to be very 
effective in patients wit h Ph negative ALL (Jabbour  et al.  ASH 2015). Given suboptimal results 
with standard chemotherapy in older patients with ALL,  and poor tolerability of chemotherapy in

 ● Patient decision (e.g., withdrawal of consent)  
● Study termination by [CONTACT_185983]. Patients who discontinue study  
treatment will be  contact[CONTACT_185984] 12 weeks (for up to one year) and asked about any 
anti-cancer therapy they may be receiving.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_219631] phase patients will start therapy with bosutinib at 300  mg orally once 
daily (which is 40% lower than the FDA approved dose of 500  mg orally once daily ). 
Bosutinib will be dose -escalated in subsequent coho rts in a standard 3 +3 study design. 
Patients will receive inotuzumab ozogamicin as an intravenous infusion over 
approximately one hour on a weekly schedule (0.8 mg/m2 IV day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 day 8  (±3 
days) , and 0.5 mg/m2 day 15 (±3 days) . A minimum of 6 days should be maintained 
between subsequent doses.  
A cycle is defined as 28 days, h owever, start of cycle 2 may be delayed if the patient 
achieves a CR or CRi and/or to allow toxicity recovery.

 schedule (0.5 mg/m2 days 1, 8 (± 3 days) and 15 (± 3 days).  The rationale for this 
is that , based on prior experience at our institution,  the number of circulating 
blast cells is a significant covariant affecting inotuzumab clearance and 
therefore, once the peripheral blood blasts clear, the dose may be  reduced  
maintaining efficacy .  This will also reduce  the risk of  toxicity for subsequent 
cycles.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   A minimum of 6 days should be maintained between the doses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For patients who have achieved CR/CRi – the next cycle (cycle 2 and onwards) 
will begin when ANC ≥1.0, and platelet count ≥[ADDRESS_219632] of the p atient  after discussion with study PI 
(e.g., if there is evidence of minimal residual disease) . 
4.1.1. 4 Transition to the every 4 -weekly schedule  – In order to decrease the toxicity 
of the subsequent cycles,  once a response is confirmed (CR, CRi, or whenever 
CCyR and/or absence of MRD by [CONTACT_185985]), subsequent 
cycles will be administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks.  Note: 
Patients who have been switched to every 4 weeks schedule may return to the 
weekly schedule if there is concern about recurrence of the disease.  
4.1.1. 5 Patients who experience a clinical benefit (CR/CRi /PR) with acceptable toxicity 
can receive up to a tota l of [ADDRESS_219633] 3 +3 study 
design  (see Section 1 1.2).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing for the Frontline Ph+ ALL or CML -LBC Cohort  
 Phase I dose -escalation Phase:  in the phase I portion of the study, frontline Ph+ ALL or 
CML -LBC patients will start therapy with bosutinib  at 300 mg orally once daily . This 
dose has already been shown to be safe in the relapsed cohort (we have treated 3 patients 
with R/R ALL, and no DLT was noted at the 300mg dose level). Bosutinib will be dose -
escalated in subsequent cohorts in a standard 3 +3 study design.    
Patients will receive inotuzumab ozogamicin as an intravenous infusion over 
approximately one hour on a weekly schedule (0.8 mg/m2 IV day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 day 8 (±3 
days), and 0.5 mg/m2 day 15 (±3 days). A minimum of 6 days should be maintai ned 
between subsequent doses.  
A cycle is defined as 28 days, h owever, start of cycle 2 may be delayed if the patient 
achieves a CR or CRi and/or to allow toxicity recovery.

administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks.  Note: P atients who have been 
switched to every 4 weeks schedule may return to the weekly schedule if there is concern 
about recurrence of the disease.  
 
Patients who experience a clinical benefit (CR/CRi/PR ) with acceptable toxicity can 
receive up to a total of 6 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin. Treatment with bosutinib 
should continue indefinitely as long as patient is tolerating it well and responding to it.  
 
NOTE: For all patients included in this trial, inotuzu mab doses may be omitted if deemed 
in the best interest of the patient (for e.g. patients with plans of undergoing stem cell 
transplant)  by [CONTACT_1963] (after discussion with the study PI). The reason for 
omission will be noted in the medical record.

4.1.2  Evaluation of dose limiting toxicity  (DLT)   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior to advancing/changing cohorts a cohort summary will be completed and 
submitted to the Medical Monitor in the IND Office.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DLT is defined as clinically significant non -hematologic adverse event or 
abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and occurring during the first 
cycle  of thera py that meets any of the following criteria:  
• CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_219637] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) for ≥ 14 days  
• All other clinically significant non -hematological adverse event possibly 
related to study drugs that is Grade 3 or 4 according to the NCI common 
termin ology criteria version 4.0. with the following exceptions:  
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting and diarrhea will be considered DLT 
only if not controlled by [CONTACT_185986].  
• Grade 3 biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lipase or bilirubin elevation) 
will only be considered DLT if accompanied by [CONTACT_185987].  
Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities will only be considered DLT if 
possibly related to study drug and not corrected by [CONTACT_185988].  
• Hematologic DLT is defined as absolute neutrophi l count (ANC) < 0.5 
x109/L or platelet count < 25 x109/L with a hypocellular  bone marrow 
lasting for 6 weeks or more after the start of a course in the absence of 
residual leukemia (i.e., with less than 5% blasts).  (In case of a 
normocellular bone marrow with <5% blasts, 8 weeks with pancytopenia 
will be considered DLT). Anemia w ill not be considered for the definition 
of DLT.  
• The last patient enrolled in each cohort will be observed for toxicity for  
28 days (1 cycle) prior to advancing to the next dose level.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients that are removed from study during cycle [ADDRESS_219638] not experienced DLT will be replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For the purpose of defining DLT, the first cycle will be considered ; however 
information on observed toxicities during subsequent cycles will be collected 
from all patients.

 4.1.3  Cycle 1 is a 4 week cycle. However, cycle 2 may be started up to 1 week early  if the patient 
has not achieve d a CR or CRi and/or has persistent disease or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_185964], 
provided all drug -related toxicity has recovered to grade 1 or less . All subsequent cycles 
are 4 week cycles.  Note: Subsequent cycles may start early if there is recovery of all 
toxicity related to the study drugs to grade 1 or less, but not earlier than day 21.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Subsequent cycles may be delayed for recovery of toxicity. Delays in start of 
subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks should be discussed with the principal 
investigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS] If the peripheral counts do not recover (ANC <1 x109/L and/or platelets <7 5 
x109/L) but there is eviden ce of residual leukemia in the bone marrow, subsequent 
cycles can be administered at the discretion of the treating physician .

this level ) is established  in each cohort separately , a phase II portion will commence  
respectively for each cohort . For each cohort, the 6 patients at MTD from the phase I 
dose part  will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study.   
 
            Patients will receive bosutin ib per the  MTD  established in the Phase I study. Patients will 
receive inotuzumab ozogamicin at the same dose and schedule as for the Phase I part of 
the study. For each cohort, a  maximum of 28 patients (including the 6 patients at MTD 
from the phase I dose part) will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study.   
 
5.0 TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED  
 
5.1 Inotuzumab ozogamicin , the investigational agent under study in this protocol, is an 
ADC comprised of a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody (G5/44) that recognizes CD22 
antigen and is covalently linked via an acetyl butyrate linker to N -acetyl --calecheamicin dimethyl 
hydrazide (CalichDMH), a semisynthetic derivative of calecheamicin.  
 
Detailed information descr ibing the prepa ration, administration, and storage of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin is located in the Pharmacy Manua l. 
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_219639] not be administered as  an IV pu sh or bo lus. Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin should not be mixed with other medications. Dosing is based on pa tient

 weight according to the institutional standar d; however,  doses  will be adju sted for 
patients  who experi ence a ≥10%  change in weight from baseline.  Please refer to the 
Dosage and Administration Instructions in the Pharmacy Manual for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin intravenous solution. Reconstituted inotuzumab ozogamicin will be 
administered over 1 hour ± [ADDRESS_219640] 
requires temporary interruption of the administration.  A minimum of 6 days should be 
maintained between the doses.  
 
5.1.3  Required Premed ication 
Recommended premedication before inotuzumab ozogamicin: acetaminophen 650 mg 
orally, diphenhydramine 10 -25 mg IV, hydrocortisone 25 mg IV. Modifications to this  
premedication are also allowed.  
 
5.1.4 Drug Preparation, Storage  and Handling 
Detailed drug preparation instructions are provided in the Investigator Brochure. 
Unused portions of the study drug will be discarded properly  as per the institutional 
policies.   
 
5.2 Bosutinib  (BOSULIF®) is a kinase inhibitor FDA approved for the treatment of adult 
patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with 
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. The recommended dose is 500mg once daily with food. 
Bosut inib will be provided by [CONTACT_4618].  Bosutinib inhibits the abnormal Bcr -Abl kinase that 
promotes CML. Modeling studies indicate that bosutinib binds the kinase domain of Bcr -Abl. 
Bosutinib is also an inhibitor of Src family kinases including Src, Lyn and Hck . Bosutinib 
minimally inhibits PDGF receptor and c -Kit.  
5.2.1  Method of Administration  
Bosutinib tablets are available containing bosutinib monohydrate equivalent to either 100 
or 500 mg of bosutinib. The recommended dose of Bosutinib  for the treatment of 
leukemia is 500 mg by [CONTACT_185989]. If a dose is missed, the patient should 
not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed dose on the following day.  
Unused portions of the study drug will be discarded proper ly as per the institutional 
policies.   
6.0 DOSE MOD IFICAT IONS  
 
6.1 Intrapatient dose reduction will be allowed depe nding on the type and severity of 
toxicity.  Dose interruption may occur within a cycle until adequate recovery or omission of 
a dose during a given treatment cycle . While doses given within a treatment cycle (i.e., Days 
8 and/or 15) need not be delayed due to neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, dose delays

Page 15 of 31 
 Adverse Event  Action# 
Grade I  Remain on current dose level  
Grade II  For persistent, clinically relevant toxicity not responding to optimal 
management: Interrupt bosutinib, then reintroduce at the same dose or 
reduce dose by [CONTACT_185991] ≤ 1  
Grade III  For persistent, clinically relevant toxicity not responding to optimal 
management: Interrupt bosutinib, then dose reduce by 1 level upon 
recovery to grade ≤ 1  
Grade IV  Interrupt bosutinib. Discuss with PI [INVESTIGATOR_185965]. Resumption should happen only upon 
recovery to grade ≤ 1  
# For subjects who have required a dose reduction due to toxicity, but then have been free of the 
specific toxicity (grade ≤ 1) for at least 1 month and are otherwise tolerating bosutinib we ll, the 
investigator may choose to re -escalate the dose by [CONTACT_185992] ( i.e. increase the 
daily dose by 100  mg/month) until the subject is back to the starting or previous dose (whichever 
is higher).  
NOTE: Cytopenias  are common in the patient population studied in this trial. Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin can cause low platelet count. Therefore, dose modification for bosutinib for 
hematologic toxicities would be considered only if the investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_185966] e 
cytopenias were related to bosutinib.

Prophy lactic intrathecal therapy  is allowed. The use of  hematopoietic growth factors or  
transfusions is allowed. The use of hydroxyurea and/or steroids is permitted for the first 2 
weeks of the study period for cytoreduction.  Note: Patients with isolated CNS relapse while on 
the study can continue on the study if deemed in the best interest of the patient. These patients 
can receive intrathecal chemotherapy to clear the CNS leukemia.  
 
7.2 Proh ibited Concom itant Therapy  
Patients may not receive other investigational drugs, immunosuppres sive medications 
(exclu ding therapy as described in Section 7.1), radiotherapy, or sys temic anti-neoplastic 
therapy  during the study.  Herbal supplements, including St. John’s Wort and grapefruit juice 
are prohibited.  
7.3        Concomitant Use With CYP3A Inhibitors  
Avoid the concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A and/or P -gp inhibitors with  
bosutinib  as an increase in bosutinib plasma concentration is expected . Strong CYP3A 
inhibitors include ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, boceprevir, 
telaprevir, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, 
nefazodone and conivaptan. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors include fluconazole, darunavir, 
erythromycin, diltiazem, atazanavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, imatinib,

10.0   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
10.1 Leukemia -specific Adverse Event Recording and Reporting Guidelines  
These guidelines serve to bring the Department of Leukemia in compliance with the 
institutional policy on Reporting of Serious Adverse Events -definition of expected AE -"  
 
Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with 
a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relation ship with 
this treatment.  
 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which 
occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or 
for the modification of physiologic function.  
Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fundamental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the event 
would not  have happened at all, 2) the event would have occurred later than it actually did, 
or 3) the event would have been less severe.  
The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse events a nd assigning the attribution for each event for all 
subjects enrolled on the trial.  
10.1.1  PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol.  Adverse 
events will be documented in the medical record and entered into PDMS/CORe.  
Protocol 2014 -0435  
  07/12/19
   
Page 22 of 31 
 10.1.2 Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_219647].  All AE’s regardless of grade and attribution will be 
collected on toxicity logs; however, unexpected and related AE’s of all grades will be 
entered into CORe.  Only unexpected AEs , any grade,  will be recorded in the Case Report 
Form (CRF).  Expected events during leukemia therapy are:

 10.1.4  All events that are not listed as expected in section 10.1.2 will be collected for the 
purpose of grading, and determining attribution to study drug by [CONTACT_978].  
10.1. 5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results  in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse experience as it occurred. It doe s not include an adverse experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate me dical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatmen t in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32).  
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serio us 
adverse events.  Any important medical event can and should be reported as 
an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_185994], IND Office.  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition 
of a SAE must be reported to the IRB and IND Office in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center Institut ional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting 
Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise 
in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND 
Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the 
event).  
Protocol 2014 -0435  
  07/12/19
   
Page 24 of 31 
  "Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) for M. D. Anderson -Sponsored IND 
Protocols":  
• All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study 
drug, must have a written report submitted w ithin 24 hours  (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB .  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_219649] returned to baseline, progression of the event 
has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_219650] be reported to the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office ) according to 21 CFR 31 2.32.  
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_185972], 
Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, 
and Institutional Review Board policy.  
Investigator Communication with Supporting Companies:  
Any individual expedited SAE reports required by [CONTACT_185995] [ADDRESS_219651] awareness  of the event (immediately  if the event  is 
fatal or life-threatening),  Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_185973] . Principal  
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_185974]:  (1) an FDA  
MEDWATCH  form,  (2) a CIOMS  form, (3) an Investigator -Initiated  Research

 11.1   Endpoints  
11.1.1  Primary Endpoints:  
Phase I:  
1. MTD of bosutinib in combination with inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with Ph+ ALL 
and CML in lymphoid blast phase  that express CD22  
 
Phase II:  
2.  Major hematologic response (MaHR)  for relapsed ph+ALL and CR/CRi for newly diagnosed 
Ph+ ALL or CML -LBC with age≥60 .  
 
11.1.2  Secondary Endpoints:  
Phase I:  
1. Overall MaHR  
2. Duration of response and overall survival  
 
Phase II:  
3. Incidence and severity of adverse events  
4. Duration of response and overall survival  
 
11.2  Sample size  
This will be a single arm, single center, open label study of bosutinib in combination with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with Ph+ ALL and CML in lymphoid blast phase  that 
express CD22.  There are two parallel cohorts of patients: relapsed ph+ALL and newly 
diagnosed Ph+ ALL or CML -LBC with age≥60.  
 
Sample size – Up to 18 patients will be enrolled in phase I part of the study  for each cohort . 
Therefore, there will be  a maximum of 36 patients, 18 patients per cohort in phase I part.  A total 
of 56 patients will be enrolled in phase II  with 28 patients for each patient cohort: relapsed ph+ALL 
and newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL or CML -LBC with age  ≥60. The 6 p atients treated at the MTD 
from the phase I dose cohort  will be included in the phase 2 part for each cohort. Therefore, the 
maximum samp le size is 36 in phase I  + 44 in phase II  = 80. 
Phase I  
Bosutinib will be dose -escalated in a standard 3 +3 study design  separately for two cohorts 
(relapsed ph+ALL and newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL or CML -LBC with age  ≥60). Patients will be 
entered sequentially to each dose level.  Three  combination dose levels are defined. The starting 
dose is dose 1.  If none of the first [ADDRESS_219652] cycle dose -limiting

Phase II  
Cohort 1: relapsed ph+ALL  
Once the MTD (bosutinib 500mg dose level  or lower ,) is established, a phase II portion will 
commence. Patients will receive bosutinib per the dose established in the Phase I study. Patients 
will receive inotuzumab ozogamicin at the same dose and schedule as for the Phase I part of the 
study.  
A total of 28 patients (including the 6 patients treated at the MTD from the phase I dose cohort) 
will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study.  The primary efficacy endpoint is MaHR 
during the study period of 4 cycles. We will employ Simon MinMax  two-stage design.23 The 
target response rate will be 50% and a response rate of 30% or lower will be considered as not

  07/12/[ADDRESS_219657] been enrolle d. At the end 
of the study, if 12 or more patients out of 28  patients respond, the regimen will be considered 
active. With this design, the probab ility of early termination is 49 % if t he true response rate is 
only 30 %. 
The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey will be used to perform interim safety monitoring.24  We 
will assume a Beta (0.6,  1.4) prior distribution for the toxicity rate which in particular has mean 
of 30%.  The toxicity is defined as any DLT at lea st possibly attributed to the study drug during 
the treatment period.  
The following decision criteria will be applied continuously  up to the 28 patient. The trial will be 
stopped early according to the following monitoring rule.  
Pr{toxicity   rate > 30%| data} > 0.93  
That is, if at any time during the study we determine that there is more than a 9 3% chance that the 
toxicity rate is more than 30% we will stop the study.  The design software Multc Lean Desktop 
(version 2.1) developed by [CONTACT_185997] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center

11.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The primary end -point is major hem atologic response .  The response  will be evaluated along 
with its 95% confidence interval.  Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be 
included in the safety analyses. Subjects who entered the study and did not take any of the study 
drugs and had this confirmed will not be evaluated for safety. The severity of the toxicities will 
be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_219659] 
reporti ng guidelines for adverse events . Safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_17203], severity and 
frequency.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be predominantly descriptive statistics and will be 
interpreted as being exploratory and hypothesis generating. The d uration of response and overall 
survival (OS) will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier.   Cox regression  models will 
be used to determine the relationship with the time -to-events (e.g. OS) and the potential 
prognostic factors.

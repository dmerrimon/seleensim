Key Exclusion Criteria  1. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Pa tient should not be on  
any immunosuppressive therapy or steroids > prednisone 
10mg/day or its equivalent on the day of the start of therapy.  
2. Has had targeted small molecule therapy, or palliative radiation

recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due 
to a previously administered agent.  Some exceptions are allowed.  
3. Has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases 
and/or carcinomatous meningitis.  Subjects with asymptomatic 
brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically 
stable and are not using steroids equivalent to >10mg of 
prednisone day prior to trial treatment.  
4. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic 
treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying 
agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). 
Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic 
corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_12978], etc.) is not consi dered a form of systemic 
treatment.  
5. Has known history of non -infectious pneumonitis that required 
steroids or has current pneumonitis. Has known history of 
interstitial lung disease.  
Statistical Design  The study design is a multi -site, single arm phase II trial with 2 parallel 
cohorts. To minimize the number of patients required the single arm two -
stage minimax Simon's design will be used for each cohort. The study will 
be conducted in two separate cohorts; EGFR mutation positive NSCLC 
cohort and NSCLC p atients with  other genetic alterations, previously 
treated with appropriate targeted therapy . The primary objective is to 
assess the treatment efficacy based on the response rate (RR), of 
combination p embrolizumab and platinum -based doublet in EGFR 
mutatio n positive or NSCLC patients  with other genetic alterations 
patients who have progressed in the two study cohorts . The primary 
endpoint is RR defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  
For each cohort the sample size calculation is the same as we chose the 
same parameter settings. Sample size calculation: The combination 
treatment would be of clinical interest if the RR is > 0.55 and will not if 
the RR is <0.3. With 14 pts in stage I and  28 total pts, the 2 -stage Simon’s 
minimax design has a 5% type I error and 85% power and a probability of 
early termination of 0.58. The cohort is to be terminated at stage I if ≤ 4 
pts respond. If the cohort goes on to stage II and total number of respon ses 
is ≤ 12, the treatment is rejected.  Thus, if both cohorts go to stage II then 
each of the cohorts will require [ADDRESS_448161] one dose of 
pembrolizumab and doublet chemothe rapy. We assume an ineligibility 
rate of 10% so we plan to enroll 31 patients in each cohort of the trial.

Due to slow enrollment on the study and changes in study personnel, 
the study enrollment will be terminated on December 31, 2020. We 
anticipate that we will enroll approximately 25 patients in C ohort  1 
and approximately 7 in Cohort 2.

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.1 Background 
4.1.1 EGFR mutation positive NSCLC 
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first line therapy for advanced 
NSCLC patients (pts) with tumors that h arbor activating EGFR mutations (1). For pts 
progressing on first line TKIs, the most common mechanism of resistance is presence of T790M mutation (2). Recently, T790M inhibitors, like osimertinib, have shown clinical 
benefit in these pts. However, almost all patients develop tumor progression even on 
these drugs  (3,4). In addition, there are no approved targeted treatments for pts who have 
other mechani sms of resistance. Many of these  patients will be considered for 
chemotherapy. The IMPRESS trial showed that continuation of gefitinib, an EGFR TKI, after disease progression did not prolong PFS in pts who received platinum -based doublet 
chemotherapy as su bsequent therapy. Thus, platinum -based doublet chemotherapy 
remains a treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation positive cancer who have 
disease progression on a T790M inhibitor or have progression of disease following front line EGFR -TKI and don’t have the T790M mutation in their tumor. In the IMPRESS  
trial, the response rate (RR) to chemotherapy was 33%  (5). Another combination 
evaluated in a similar population is the combination of afatinib and cetuximab. In a single arm multi- institutional study the response rate with this combination was 29% (6).  
 
4.1.2 Other genetically altered  NSCLC  
 
Several ALK inhibitors  are currently approved as front line therapy for ALK positive 
NSCLC (7). The median progression free survival with these drugs can range from   about 
11 months  to 34 months. Two drugs are currently approved for the treatment of crizotinib 
resistant/refractory ALK positive NSCLC, ceritinib and alectinib (8, 9). The response 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
7 
 
rate with these agents is about 50% and the median PFS is about [ADDRESS_448162] shown activity in ALK positive patients 
following treatment with 2 prior ALK inhibitors (10). However, many patients eventually require chemotherapy.  Though the response rate with chemotherapy in ALK positive 
patients who have received [ADDRESS_448163] also 
received FDA approval. Crizotinib and entrectinib are now approved for the treatment of ROS1 positive NSCLC  (11.12) . Similarly , the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib 
is approved for the treatment of  Braf mutation positive NSCLC and recently larotrecinib 
was approved for the treatment of NTRK gene rearranged cancers  (13, 14). In addition, 
NCCN guidelines include treatment with crizotinib for patients with cMET amplification 
and exon 14 skip mutation and RET inhibitors for the treat ment  of RET altered NSCLC  
(15). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_359286], almost all patients eventually experience 
disease progression. Many of these patients are treated with platinum based chemotherapy. The efficacy of p latinum based chemotherapy following targeted therapy 
in these patients is not well defined but is not expected to be any better than the efficacy of chemotherapy in EGFR or ALK positive patients.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_448164] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n has been known for decades  (16).  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies  (17,18,19) .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long- term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_448165] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548]  (20,21,22,23,24) .  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface 
of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive 
immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an 
Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD-L2).  
The structure of  murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable- type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules .  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_448166] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T- cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natu ral Killer 
cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double 
negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD- 1 
(PD-L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors.  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -
[ADDRESS_448167] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted 
T-cell fun ction in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -
1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects  with melanoma 
(MEL) .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab  (Keytruda
®) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -[ADDRESS_448168] high PD -L1 expression. This approval was 
based on the results of the Keynote -24 trial  (25). In this trial patients with tumor s that had ≥ 
50% tumor proportion score (TPS score) for PD -L1 expression were randomized to 
pembrolizumab or platinum based chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutation and ALK 
positive NSCLC were excluded. The results of this study showed that pembrolizumab significantly improved survival and progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. Thus currently single agent pembrolizumab is approved for advanced NSCLC patients as front line therapy if their tumors have high PD -L1 expression and for patients who have had prior 
chemotherapy or targeted therapy if their tumor has any level of PD -L1 expression.   
4.2.[ADDRESS_448169] 
been FDA approved for second line therapy in NSCLC  (26,27,28) . Activity of single agent 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 drugs has been modest in EGFR mutated/ALK positive patients. 
Retrospective subset analysis of Checkmate 057 and atezolizumab trials showed that never

smoke rs and EGFR mutated pts did not derive greater benefit from these agents  compared to 
docetaxel  . Recently, Gainor, et al published the results of a retrospective analysis of the use 
of these agents in 28 patients with EGFR mutation (n=22 patients) or ALK translocations (n=6 
patients) (2 9). Of these patients, only 1 EGFR mutation positive patient had tumor response to 
a PD -1 directed agent. This response rate was far lower than the response rate of 23% among 
[ADDRESS_448170] been reported in patients with other gene altered NSCLC (29).  
Previous studies have suggested that tumors with higher number of somatic mutations such as melanoma and lung cancer had higher  RR to PD1 -blockade ( 30, 32 ). This was also supported 
by [CONTACT_359309], pts with smoking history had higher RR to PD1 inhibition  (31) . In addition, anti -PD-[ADDRESS_448171] 10 to 100 times as many somatic mutations 
as mismatch repair -proficient (34) . The relative lack of benefit with anti -PD-[ADDRESS_448172] are 
never/light smokers.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_448173] shown promising results (29 ). 
In the Keynote 021 trial (35), 74 advanced NSCLC patients were treated with one of 3 different chemotherapy regimens in combination with pembrolizumab. In cohort A, patients received carboplatin and paclitaxel; in cohort B, patients received carboplatin paclitaxel and bevacizumab and in cohort C patients received carboplatin (Parapati n
®) and pemetrexed  
(Alimta®). The overall response rate was 57% (RR varied from 48% -71%). The response rate 
did not vary according to the PD -L1 status. The median PFS (progression free survival) was 
10.2 months in cohorts A and C and had not been reached at the time of analysis in cohort B. No unusual toxicities were reported. Immune related AEs were reported in 16% -38% of the 
patient s.  
Subsequently over 120 patients with advanced non- squamous histology were randomized to 
carboplatin pemetrexed with or without pembroli zumab  (36). The results of this randomized 
cohort demonstrated that the progression free survival  (median 13mo vs. 8.9mo, HR - 0.53, 
p=0.0102) and response rate (55% vs. 29%)  were significantly improved with the addition of 
pembrolizumab. These data suggest that the addition of pembrolizumab can enhance the 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
10 
 
efficacy of chemotherapy regimens and this  study also showed that the increase in efficacy can 
occur irrespective of tumor PD -L1 expression. Based on these data a randomized double blind 
phase III study Keynote 189 was initiated and reported similar results (3 7) initiated  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In this study treatment naïve advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients, that 
are EGFR and ALK negative were randomized in 2:1 fashion to chemotherapy and 
pembrolizumab. Based on the improved survival observed with combination of 
pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, the FDA has now approved the regimen for advanced NSCLC patients without EGFR or ALK gene alterations in their tumors.         
 
4.3 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the investigator’s brochure  and package insert  for preclinical and clinical data  of 
pembrolizumab. Also please refer to package inserts of carboplatin (paraplatin®) and 
pemetrexed (Alimta®) for details of these drugs.  
4.[ADDRESS_448174] Population  
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients (pts) with tumors that harbor activating EGFR mutations. T he most 
common mechanism of resistance in pts progressing on first line TKIs is presence of T790M mutation. T790M inhibitors, like osimertinib, have shown clinical benefit in 
these pts. However, almost all patients eventually develop tumor progression . In addition, 
there are no approved targeted treatments for pts who have mechanisms of resistance, other than T790M . All such patients will be considered for chemotherapy.  The most 
commonly considered chemotherapy for such patients is the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed .    
ALK inhibitors are now consistently utilized as front line and second line treatments for ALK positive NSCLC patients. Though there are ALK inhibitors in development that may have activity after patients that have received [ADDRESS_448175] not shown significant activity in these patients. Chemotherapy is 
thought to cause release of tumor antigens through cell necrosis and activate the anti -
tumor T cell response which can be further potentiated with the addition of anti -PD-1 
drugs. The trial Keynote 189 showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to the 
combination of carboplatin/pemetrexed enhanced t he efficacy of chemotherapy in 
advanced NSCLC patients, irrespective of PD -L1 status of the patient’s tumor.    
Based on the above  data,  we hypothesize that the addition of pembrolizumab to the 
combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed will increase the response rate in EGFR 
mutation and other gene altered  NSCLC patients  who have had disease progression on 
appropriate targeted therapy . To test this hypothesis we  propose to conduct a phase II 
clinical trial evaluating the addition of pembrolizumab to standar d platinum based 
doublet chemotherapy in EGFR mutation and other gene altered  NSCLC patients who 
have disease progression follow ing treatment with appropriate targeted therapy .  
For this exploratory study, w e believe that a single arm study  with 2 cohorts one (EGFR 
mutated and other gene altered NSCLC  cohorts) is acceptable design since efficacy of 
chemotherapy in these patients is well defined. If the results of the proposed trial demonstrate sufficient efficacy then a randomized study will be conducted in the future.
    
 
4.4.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) has reported  safety and clinical activity of single 
agent MK -3475 (20 ).  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting 
toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent 
schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and cl inical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half- life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -
2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This 
 UMCC 2017. [ADDRESS_448176] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/k g Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to 
remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanom a indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in 
exposure between different indication settings.  The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships 
of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as  an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
Finally , in the Keynote 021 trial , cohort G  this flat dose of 200mg of pembrolizumab 
administered every 3 weeks when combined with carboplatin/pemetrexed was found to be well tolerated and efficacious. So consistent with the schedule tested in cohort G of trial Keynote 
021, in this trial all eligible patients will be treated with pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg in 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
13 
 
combination with carboplatin AUC 5 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Patients  will 
receive combination chemotherapy for a maximum of 4 cycles. Following 4 cycles patients 
will receive maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab for a maximum of 24 months (from the start of trial therapy).  
 
4.4.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints  
We have selected Response Rates (RR)  as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria as the primary 
endpoint. RR with the combination of a platinum analogue and pemetrexed in a similar 
patient population, as being studied in this study, was found to be 33% in the recently reported IMPRESS trial. Another combination of afatinib+cetuximab examined in a similar population showed a RR of 29%. These two datasets provide the benchmark for EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients. The response rate with second line and third line ALK inhibitors in ALK positive NSCLC is about 50% and this establishes the benchmark of ALK posi tive NSCLC patients. Though data with platinum based 
chemotherapy in other gene altered NSCLC patients is not well defined we speculate that efficacy will be no better than what has been observed in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients. We also wanted to select a relatively early endpoint for this exploratory trial.    
It is well recognized that  in minority of patients treated with immune therapy may have 
pseudo progression or can have delayed response. In addition, there are patients who 
have isolated areas of progression, with control in other areas. Therefore, patients can 
continue on study therapy beyond progression, if felt to be in the best interest of the patient .      
In this trial we will also assess PFS by [CONTACT_359310] l survival  
as well .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research  
Response rates to PD -[ADDRESS_448177] for benefit 
from pembrolizumab and other anti -PD-1. Benefit has also been observed in patients 
whose tumors don’t express PD -L1 but the percentage of such patients who benefit is far 
less. This difference in efficacy with anti- PD-[ADDRESS_448178] that tumor PD -L1 expression is a predictive marker for 
pembrolizumab (20). In patients with recurrent NSCLC the drug is only approved in 
patients whose tumors have some level of tumor PD -L1 expression. In addition, recently 
the results of trial Keynote [ADDRESS_448179] high level 
of PDL1 expression (tumor proportion score of ≥ 50%) pembrolizumab demonstrated significantly greater response rate, PFS and overall survival compared to platinum based combination chemotherapy  (22). Based on these data pembrolizumab is currently 
approved for front line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors have high PDL1 expression. However, the relevance of PD -L1 expression in determining efficacy 
of the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is unclear. In Keynote -[ADDRESS_448180] of care and this 
information will be collected .  
Mutational Load  
In addition to PD -L1 expression, recent data has also shown that mutational load of 
tumors can correlate with efficacy from pembrolizumab  (26). Mutational load in EGFR 
mutation positive and other gene altered  NSCLCs is not well defined. We therefore 
propose to analyze the mutational load of the tumors of patients enrolling on the trial. This analysis will also be conducted on tumor tissue obtained via tumor biopsy followin g 
tumor progression on prior  targeted therapy . This analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_359311].

All available gene analysis data on the patient will be collected. An attempt will be made 
to assess efficacy of the study regimen in patients with specific resistant gene alterations.  
Circulating Tumor Cells  
Obtaining tumor tissue in advanced NSCLC can p rove to be challenging. In addition, the 
tumor sample obtained can be small and this can limit the biomarkers that can be analyzed. Therefore, in recent years ‘liquid biopsies’ are being used increasingly both in clinical practice and in clinical research.  One avenue that holds promise in developi[INVESTIGATOR_359287] (CTCs)  (38). CTCs describe the subset of tumor cells that have 
genetically acquired the ability to disseminate from primary and metastatic sites and intravasate to the circulatory system. The full clinical potential of CTCs is not yet realized due to the limitation of existing technologies to measure and study these cells in patient blood samples.  
Dr. S unitha Nagrath from the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of 
Michigan has developed the GO Chip technology which we propose to use in the current study (39). This technology takes the advantage of the novel nanomaterial graphene 
oxide for the sensitive capture of CTCs using the self -assembly of GO nano -arms on a 
flat substrate. Some researchers have used circular patterns to capture rare cells in microfluidic devices. However, to enhance the surface area and the hydrodynamic interactions, we used a flower -shaped architecture pattern instead of regular circular 
structures. [CONTACT_359331] and her colleagues have evaluated this technology and the resulting CTC capture in early stage NSCLC patients and found that presence of CTCs can have prognostic import (40).   In addition, her group has demonstrated the ability to assess PD -L1 expression in CTCs 
and also evaluate markers for epi[INVESTIGATOR_359288] (EMT) in CTCs. As previously mentioned PD -L1 expression does correlate with clinical efficacy with PD -1 
and PD -L1 inhibitors. In addition, EMT is a known resistance mechanism to EGFR -TKIs 
and ALK inhibitors. Recently tissue based data has suggested that presence of EMT features maybe associated with increased benefit from PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors (42, 42).  
 
We therefore propose to collect and bank blood on all patients enrolled on the trial before the first cycle and before the third  cycle. Apart from quantifying CTCs, we will also 
assess PD -L1 expression and presence of EMT markers. We will attempt to correlate 
CTC count, PD -L1 expression and presence of EMT markers to response rate from the 
study therapy. We also propose to isolate tumor DNA from the circulating tumor cells and analyze for EGFR and ALK gene alterations .

Patients will receive combination chemotherapy for a maximum of 4 cycles. Following 4 
cycles patients will receive maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab for a maximum of 24 months (from the start of trial therapy). Patients ma y receive carboplatin for 
a shorter number of cycles if felt to be in the best interest of the patient by [CONTACT_359312] .    
Patients will continue therapy for maximum of [ADDRESS_448191] of the patient and patient is agreeable with it. See Section 6.4.   
6.1 Dose Selection/Modification /Timing of Administration  
6.1.1 Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 – Background and Rationale.   
Details on prepar ation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.   
6.1.2 Dose Modification  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTC AE 4.0) will utilized 
to grade toxicities.  
Appropriate dose and schedule modification should be considered for carboplatin and 
pemetrexed according to package inserts of both drugs and institutional guidelines. Guidelines for dose modification for hematologic toxicities are provided in Table 3 below. For grade 3 -
4 non -hematologic t oxicities both chemotherapy drugs should be held till the toxicity 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
21 
 
recovers to ≤ grade 1  and then restarted at next lower dose as in the table for hematologic 
toxicities (Table 3). If grade 3 toxicity is not felt to related to chemotherapy drugs and 
will not worsen with chemotherapy drugs (eg - serum sodium of 129mmol/L) 
chemotherapy treatment maybe continued after discussion with the PI. For grade [ADDRESS_448192] of the patient  or the patient so desires. If chemotherapy drugs are held for longer than 3 weeks for 
pembrolizumab related toxicities or for toxicities that cannot be definitively attributed to chemotherapy drugs, chemotherapy drugs could be restarted after a discussion with the PI  
(Principal Investigator) .

chemotherapy drugs. Dosages different than the suggested doses may be u sed 
if consistent with local guidelines.  If a physician wants to give doses higher 
than recommended or wants to give both drugs in situations where it is 
recommended to only give pemetrexed, a discussion with and permission from the PI [CONTACT_60296].  
Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure , including coadministration with additional compounds  may represent an 
immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab /combination treatment  
must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or life- threatening AEs as per 
Table 4 below. 
There is no dose reduction allowed for pembrolizumab on the protocol.  If the 
schedu le of concomitant chemotherapy is changed to every 4 weeks  due to 
tolerability issues  then pembrolizumab will be administered on the day of the 
chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored closely to maintain the schedule as 
close to every 3 weeks as possible.  
Pembrolizumab  will be withheld for drug- related Grade 4 hematologic toxicities, non -
hematological toxicity ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_448193] 
of the patient .  
Attribution of Toxicity: 
When study interventions are administered in combination, attribution of an adverse event to 
a single component is likely to be difficult.   Therefore, while the investigator may attribute a 
toxicity event to the combination, or to pembrolizumab alone, for adverse events listed in Table [ADDRESS_448194] be held according to the criteria in Table 4 Dose 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -Related Adverse Event s 
Associated with Pembrolizumab . 
Holding Study Interventions:  
When study interventions are administered in combination, if the AE is considered immune-related, both interventions should be held according to recommended dose modifications. 
Restarting Study Interventions:  
 UMCC 2017. [ADDRESS_448195] any dose modifications (no change in dose or schedule) of 
pembrolizumab in this study, as described in Table 4 . 
• If the toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming treatment are not met, the 
participant must be discontinued from all study interventions. 
• If the toxicities do resolve and conditions are aligned with what is defined in Table 4, the 
combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab may b e restarted at the discretion of the 
investigator.   In these cases where the toxicity is attribute d to the combination or to 
chemotherapy alone, re -initiation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy may be considered 
at the princi pal investigator’s discretion.

Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study therapy  (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the PI . The reason for interruption 
should be documented in the patient's study record. 
With investigator and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_73261], subjects with a laboratory adverse 
event still at Grade 2 after 12 weeks may continue treatment in the trial only if asymptomatic and controlled. A patient who requires longer than 12 weeks but less t han 24 weeks to 
recover from an adverse event that led to the withholding of pemetrexed and/or pembrolizumab  and is still grade 2 , the patient  could be restarted on the drug/ drugs IF 
the treating physici an believes that it is in the best interest of the patient to restart the 
drug and the patient is agreeable. This has to be discussed with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_359291]. This does not apply to toxicities that require discontinuatio n 
of one or more study drugs.  
Subjects who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life- threatening event at the same 
grade or greater with re- challenge of study therapy drugs should be discontinue  trial treatment.  
 
6.1.3 Timing of Dose Administration 
Subjects will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg together with  pemetrexed 500mg/m
2 (with 
vitamin supplementation) + carboplatin  AUC 5 all on Day 1 Q3W for 4 cycles followed 
by [CONTACT_79911] 200 mg together with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Q3W until 
progression/completion. Patients should receive appropriate nausea and emesis prophylaxis.   
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 7.0).  Trial treatment may  be administered up to 3 days before or after the 
scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons, including patient’s desire . 
It is understood that patients on a study with a planned therapy for 2 years may desire to take short breaks or travel. For patient’s desire , therapy may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_448206] 30 minutes prior to premedication for  
chemotherapy (pemetrexed with or without carboplatin).  
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
27 
 
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion.  Sites should make 
every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to  30 minutes as possible.  However, 
given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and +10 
minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). 
[COMPANY_006] will provide Pharmacy Manual which contains specific instructions for 
pembrolizumab dose calculation, reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
Carboplatin and pemetrexed will be administered according to package insert and institutional guidelines.  
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 10 
minutes Q3W until progression or unacceptable toxicity. All subjects should receive appropriate supplementation with vitamin B12 and folic acid and corticosteroid prophylaxis.  Carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 15-[ADDRESS_448207] CBC with differential and a multiphasic profile before each 
cycle of therapy. Patients can only receive chemotherapy (carboplatin and/or 
pemetrexed) if  
Neutrophil count ≥1,500 /mcL  
Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL  
In addition patients should meet crite ria mentioned  in table s 3 and 4 and should be 
dosed accordingly.   
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. 
6.1.4 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the  investigator and subject will know the treatment 
administered.  
6.2 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the on going trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
28 
 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or [COMPANY_006] C linical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary treating physician.  
6.2.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
Patients will receive vitamin B12 (1000 mcg intramuscularly) and folic acid (1 mg orally daily) 
supplementation at least 5 days before starting therapy with pemetrexed and continue to receive it at frequencies mentioned in the package insert or according to institutional guidelines. All patients should receive anti -nausea and other supportive measures according to institutional 
guidelines.  
Patients should receive appropriate anti -nausea medications and dexamethasone for 
management of chemotherapy related adverse events  as per institutional guidelines and 
package insert. All treatments that the investigator c onsiders necessary for patient ’s welfare 
may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_359292] c are. All conco mitant medication will be recorded i n the medical record

†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred an d usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation 
methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
 ‡If a co ntraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
partici pating at sites in that region. 
Subjects should be informed that t aking the study medicatio n may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential  must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from  the day of stud y medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation 
of study medication for oral contraception) throughout  the study period up to [ADDRESS_448214]’s status until the pregnancy has 
been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_359293] 24 hours  to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] 
if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site mu st be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_359294] 8.2.2. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_448215] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_359313]  [INVESTIGATOR_359295], th e trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 8.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Note : A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improve d. 
It is well recognized that in some patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_359296]. In addition c ertain 
patients may develop isolated areas of progression. The treating physician may consider treating such isolated areas of progression with local treatments such as radiation or surgery , as long as at least one target lesion 
is not treated with any oth er treatment than the study therapy . The patient 
may continue on study therapy after the patient has recovered to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_448216] disease progression or after local therapy for limited areas of progression can only 
be done after discussing with the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR.   
• Unacceptable adverse experiences.  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment.  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow-up 
 UMCC 2017. 057  
 
33 
 
• Completed 24 months of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab  or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later.   
Note: [ADDRESS_448217] dose. Subjects 
who stop pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_359297] [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Administrative reasons  
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in S ection 7  (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 8.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after  the end of treatment as described in Section 8.2.3).  Subjects who discontinue 
for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -treatment follow -up for disease status 
until disease progression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing  consent or 
becoming lost to follow -up.  After documented disease progression each subject will be 
followed by [CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  
Discontinuation of Study Therapy after CR  
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR and have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_448218] 80% of the planned dose beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.  The decision to continue or discontinue pemetrexed in such patients 
is to be decided by [CONTACT_1963]. Subjects who then experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to one year of additional treatment with pembrolizumab  
with or without pemetrexed  via the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the investigator 
if no cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab,  other than 
pemetrexed,  the subject meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, 
and the trial is open.  Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation.  Additional details are provided in S ection [ADDRESS_448219] dose of study therapy.

 8 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
8.1 Trial Procedures  
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally mana ged by [CONTACT_359314]:  
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_359315]. 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting patient registration request to the Coordinating Center. After patient eligibility has  
been determined, a copy of the completed  Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent 
de-identified source documents will be submitted by [CONTACT_359316], by [CONTACT_88312] -Oncology- [EMAIL_896] .   
The Multi -Site Coordinator, who acts as the registrar, will review the submitted documents 
and process the registration. Sites should inform the Multi -Site Coordinator of a potential 
registration by [ADDRESS_448226] study identification number assigned to them, and will not receive study treatment. 
Once registration has occurred patient has to be treated within 5 days. If patient does not start 
therapy within 5 days of registration, the reasons for delay should be communicated to the 
Principal Investigator. He will then decide if the patient can continue on study therapy.  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 7 .0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furth ermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or [COMPANY_006] 
for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.

 8.1.4 Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 8 .2 - Assessing and Recording 
Adverse Events.  Subjects who a) attain a  CR or b) complete 24 months of treatment with 
pembrolizumab may discontinue treatment with the option of restarting treatment if they meet 
the criteria specified in S ection 8 .1.5.2.  After discontinuing treatment following assessment 
of CR, these subjects should return to the site for a Safety Follow -up Visit (described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) and then proceed to the Follow-Up Period of the study (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
8.1.5 Visit R equirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 7.0 - Trial Flow Chart.   Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 8.1 - Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow- up Visits  Including Safety Follow Up Visit  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move 
into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed at least every 12 weeks (by [CONTACT_359319] ) to monitor disease status.  Every effort should be made to collect information 
regarding disease stat us until the start of new anti- neoplastic therapy, disease progression, 
death, end of the study or if the subject begins retreatment with pembrolizumab with or without 
pemetrexed  as detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Information regarding post -study anti -neopla stic 
treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated.  
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit  should be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_448231] such a visit will not be considered a protocol deviation.  All AEs that occur 
prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_448232].  SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of 
treatment or before initiation of a new anti- cancer treatment should also be followed and 
recorded.  If the investigator or a member of the study t eam becomes aware of SAEs that 
occurred 90 days after end of treatment and they were considered to be treatment related then 
they should be recorded as the other SAEs. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment  (as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may have up to two safety follow -up visits, one after the 
Treatment Period and one after the Second Course Phase.  
Subjects who are eligible to receive retreatment  according to the criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will 
move from the follow -up phase to the Second Course Phas e when they e xperience disease 
progression.    
 
 44 
 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_448233].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Second Course Phase (Retreatment Period)  
Subjects who stop therapy  with SD or better may be eligible for up to one year of additional 
pembrolizumab therapy  with or without pemetrexed  if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_210218].  This retreatment is termed the Second Course Phase of this study and is only 
available if  the study remains open and the subject meets the following conditions: 
• Either  
o Stopped initial treatment after attaining an investigator -determined confirmed CR 
according to RECIST 1.1, and 
 Was treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab  with or with out either 
of the chemotherapy drugs before discontinuing therapy 
 Received at least two treatments with pembrolizumab  with or without 
chemotherapy  beyond the date when the initial CR was declared  
  OR 
o Had SD, PR or CR and stopped pembrolizumab treatment after 24 months of study 
therapy for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability 
o Patients who stopped therapy earlier than 24 months and had SD, PR or CR can also be considered for re- treatment after discussion with the PI.  
 
AND  
• Experienced an investigator -determined confirmed radiographic disease progression 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_272463]  
• Did not receive any anti -cancer treatment since the last dose of pembrolizumab . 
• Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Perf ormance Scale  
• Demonstrates adequate organ function as detailed in Section 5.1  
 
 45 
 • Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative serum or urine 
pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving retreatment with study medication.   
• Female subj ect of childbearing potential should be willing to use [ADDRESS_448234] dose of study me dication (Reference Section 
5.2).  Subjects of child bearing potential are those who have not been surgically 
sterilized or have been free from menses for > 1 year.  
• Male subject should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through [ADDRESS_448235] dose of study therapy.   
• Does not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory 
abnormality that might interfere with the subject’s participation for the full duration of 
the trial or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021].  
Subjects who restart treatment will be retreated at the same dose and dose interval as when they last received pembrolizumab. The investigator can decide to either start p embrolizumab 
alone or with pemetrexed. For the retreatment patients will not receive carboplatin again.   
Treatment will be administered for up to one additional year.  Therapy beyond one year may  
be considered after discussing with the PI.  
Visit requiremen ts will be the same as done with the first treatment on the study. See s ection

8.[ADDRESS_448236] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of the underlying lung cancer that is temporally associated with the 
study therapy, is also an adverse event .  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of any of the study therapy drugs  in 
clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or 
intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
All adverse events that  occur after the start of study  treatment allocation  must be reported by 
[CONTACT_093]  
 
 [ADDRESS_448237] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such events will be recorded at each 
examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe 
for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section [IP_ADDRESS] The investigator 
will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non -serious adverse events for outcome. 
 
8.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the PI 
(Principal Investigator) and to Me rck 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_359299]. The Coordinating Center within 2 working days  to [COMPANY_006]  
Global Safety . (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840]). 
Overdose of carboplatin and pemetrexed should be addressed according to institutional guidelines and should be documented in patient’s study records.

Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment  
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_093] . Pregnancies and lactations that 
occur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_448239] be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as 
 
 47 
 serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be report ed. 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_359299]. The 
Coordinating Center will report  within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn:

8.2.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring during study therapy  that: 
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359300] (eg. Transportation issues) will not be considered a SAE.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is any other important medical event  
  
Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below 
criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same 
timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892]. 
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
● Is associated with an overdose. 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre- existing condition that did not worsen, or 
that is required per protocol  
• Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
• Death due to disease progression unless attributable to the study drug(s)  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359301] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359302]).  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UPs), regardless of causality to study drug, will be reported to  the Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_359303].  All SAEs and UPs must be reported to the Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_448240] awareness of the event.  Events should be reported using the Coordinating Center SAE 
form as available in the study database.  A copy of  the Coordinating Center SAE form should 
be sent to the Coordinating Center via email to CTSU -Oncology- Multisite @med.umich.edu 
within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  
Follow- up information must also be reported within 24 hours of receipt of the information by 
[CONTACT_093].  
All SAEs and UPs should be reported to the local IRBs per current local institutional standards. 
The Coordinating Center will disseminate information regarding SAEs and UPs to the 
participating sites within 5 days of re view of the information by [CONTACT_5081]’s 
Principal Investigator (or designee in the event of extended absence) only in the case that the event(s) is believed to be related (i.e., possibly, probably, or definitely) to the study drug. The Coordinating Center will be responsible for reporting of events to the FDA and [COMPANY_006], as appropriate (outlined below). 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified 
physician to be related to study therapy  that is brought to the attention of the investigator at 
any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow -up period specified 
in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph als o must be reported immediately to the PI, the Coordinating Center and to [COMPANY_006] 
Global Safety.  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  
In this trial, serious unexpected adverse events believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study treatment will be reported to the Food and Drug Administration via the MedWatch 3500A.  The Coordinating Center will be responsible for correspondence regarding adverse events with the FDA for all participating sites.  
The Coor dinating Center will be responsible for sending SAE reports and any other 
relevant safety information to the [COMPANY_006] G lobal Safety  facsimile number:  +1 -[PHONE_833]  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by [CONTACT_8415], or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this submission according to local 
regulations to the [COMPANY_006] Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of 
submission.  Additionally the Coordinating Center  will submit a copy of these reports to [COMPANY_006] 
& Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220) at the time of submission 
to FDA.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must  be reported within 24 hours to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_295760] 2 working days after the 
University of Michigan Multi -Site Coordinator becomes aware of the event to [COMPANY_006] Global 
Safety.  (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840]). 
 
 [ADDRESS_448241] for this trial include: 
1.  an overdose of [COMPANY_006]  product, as defined in Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_448242] of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.*This is not required if the elevation is deemed to be related to progression of underlying cancer.  
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 
8.2.4 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator who is a qualified physician or an appropriate designee  will evaluate all 
adverse events according to the NCI Co mmon Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version 4.0. The investigator or sub -investigator will assess the grade, duration of the AE, 
management of the AE and the relatedness to the study therapy. Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the co urse of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_80035]/worksheets.   
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.  
8.2.5 Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse  Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable local  laws and regulations.  
8.3 Study Closure  
 At this amendment (dated 10/27/2020) the enrollment rate has been significantly slower than anticipated when this study was developed. We therefore may close the study earlier than planned since planned enrollment is not feasible. The current plan is to c lose the study to 
enrollment on December 31st 2020. Based on current enrollment, we anticipate that we will enroll approximately 25 patients in the EGFR cohort  (Cohort 1)  and 7 patients in the other 
cohort (Cohort 2). 
 
 [ADDRESS_448243] a greater probability of deriving benefit from anti -PD-1 drugs such as 
pembrolizumab (20,22) . In addition, the FDA has recently approved the use of pem brolizumab 
as single agent for upfront therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with high PD -L1 
expressing t umors (22).  
Although the predictive relevance of tumor PD -L1 expression in patients receiving 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy is unclear , the data from Keynote -021 trial 
suggests that benefit with the addition of pembrolizumab to chemothera py maybe irrespecti ve 
of tumor PD -L1 expression (30,31). In an effort to characterize PD -L1 expression in tumors of 
EGFR mutation or other genetically altered  NSCLC patients with progressive disease, we will 
analyze tumor specimens, for PD -L1 expression analyses , unless these results are already 
available. If these results are not available and there is no tumor tissue available, then a fresh 
tumor biopsy will have to be obtained.  
PD-L1 expression can be conducted locally and the results and methodology reported to the 
Coordinating Site. It is highly encouraged that the test be performed on the tumor tissue 
obtained with the most recent biopsy procedure.  
 
Mutational Load  
In addition to PD -L1 expression, recent data has also shown that mutational load of  tumors can 
correlate with efficacy from checkpoint inhibitors (26). Mutational load is higher in tumors of 
patients who have a history of smoking for many years. It is speculated that lung cancers that arise in patients with chronic smoking history are a result of chronic exposure to carcinogens that leads to accumulation of several genetic changes and higher mutational load in such tumors. It is also suggested that higher mutational load may cause more neo- antigens to be 
expressed on the surface of cancer  cells and therefore these cancers maybe more susceptible 
to immunogenic attack.  It is possible that one of the reasons single agent anti -PD-1 and anti -
PD-L1 agents are not very effective in patients with EGFR/ALK NSCLCs is that almost all of 
 
 [ADDRESS_448244] a low 
mutational load.  
We therefore propose to analyze the mutational load of the tumors of patients enrolling on the 
trial, as reported by [CONTACT_359320], et al  and classify tumors as hi gh or low mutational load tumors  (a 
blood sample will be utilized to conduct  genomic analysis in order to assess if the mutations 
identified in the tumor are somatic or germline . We will then attempt to correlate mutational 
load of the tumor with the response rate observed with the study therapy. This analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_359321]. It is recognized that tissue for both 
PD-L1 expression and mut ational load may not be available. PD -L1 expression is considered 
mandatory and mutational load will only be assessed if tissue remains available.      
 
T790M Status 
All eligible EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients’ tumors will be analyzed for EGFR 
mutations in exons 18- 21, including T790M. About 60% of the EGFR mutation positive 
NSCLC patients have T790M as the primary mechanism of resistance to EGFR -TKIs. We 
propose to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab administered with chemotherapy in these patien ts based on presence or absence of T790M mutation. This assessment will be considered 
standard of care. If patients have a positive T790M result from a circulating cell free tumor DNA test , then a tissue test will not be mandatory.  
Circulating Tumor Cells  (CTCs)  
[CONTACT_359331], et al at Universi ty of Michigan have developed a  unique technique of identifying 
and quantifying CTCs. In addition, they can assess several biomarkers including PDL1 and markers associated with EMT (epi[INVESTIGATOR_359288]).  [CONTACT_359331] has 
demonstrated that CTCs can provide prognostic information in NSCLC patients.  We propose to collect  and bank blood from prior to the start of study therapy and before the 
third  cycle in patients enrolled in this trial to identify and quantify CTCs by [CONTACT_359322]. Nagrath. In addition, we propose to assess PD -L1 expression and correlate 
it with tumor tissue PD -L1 expression where possible. We also plan on assessing  markers for 
EMT in the isolated CTCs. EMT has been recognized as a resistance mechanism to both EGFR -TKIs in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients and to ALK TKIs in ALK positive 
NSCLC patients. We also propose to isolate tumor DNA from the CTCs to conduc t EGFR and 
other gene analysis.    We also propose to correlate the number of CTCs at baseline and the change in the CTC count before and after 2 cycle s with response rate from the study therapy. 
Blood sample collection  
 
 52 
 Whole blood will be obtained for the CTC analysis.  All samples will be labeled with a unique 
specimen ID.  The specimen ID will not contain names, MRN, or other identifiers.   
 
Circulating tumor cell isolation  
Circulating tumor cells will be isolated from whole blood using a CTC chip as previously described (Nagrath 2007).  Isolated tumor cells will be confirmed by [CONTACT_359323]/or immunostaining for tumor cell and nucleated blood cell surface markers.  
CTC quantification protocol 
Patient blood will be run over the CTC chip.  The chips containing bound CTCs are then 
washed with PBS and fixed with PFA.  Fixed chips can be stored in a refrigerator.  The number of tumor cells is determined by [CONTACT_106886].  
 
CTC RNA and DNA isolation  
DNA and RNA will be extracted from the isolated CTCs.  
   
CTC staining protocol 
The CTC -chip containing patient sample is treated with buffer then washed with PBS.  The 
CTC -chip is then incubated with serum and the appropriate antibodies are added (e.g. CK, 
CD45) for a  specific period of time.  CTC -chips are then washed with PBS and the appropriate 
secondary antibody are added.  
9.1. Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_359304] a tumor lesion not previously irradiated 
must be provided in the form of a tissue block or at least ten unstained slides. If new scientific data emerge that indicate that an  existing biopsy or surgical specimen is suboptimal 
for identification of subjects, then only new biopsies will be acceptable for determination of PD-L1 status. A fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_359305]. Needle or 
excisional biopsies, or resected tis sue is required. Newly obtained formalin fixed specimens 
are encouraged. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details.   Blood samples for CTC and mutational load analysis should collected, handled and shipped to the University of Michigan as outlined in the Laboratory Manual.   
 
 [ADDRESS_448245] 1.1 will be used to define response rates as: 
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least  a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest  sum diameters while on study.  
 
Secondary Endpoints - 
RECIST 1.1 defined Progression Free Survival ( PFS) - PFS is defined as the duration of 
time from registration to time of progression. Patients who die without reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Patients who did 
not progress will be censored at the day of last tumor assessment. 
Overall Survival- Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to time of death. 
If the patient is lost to follo w-up, survival will be censored on the last date the patient was 
known to be alive. 
10.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
10.2.1 Study Design and Primary Endpoint  
The study design is a multi- site, single arm phase II trial with 2 parallel cohorts. To 
minimize the number of patients required the single arm two -stage minimax Simon's 
design will be used for each cohort . The study will be conducted in two separate cohorts; 
EGFR mutation positive NSCLC cohort and other genetically altered  NSCLC cohort. 
The primary objec tive is to assess the treatment efficacy based on the response rate (RR), 
of combination pembrolizumab and platinum -based doublet in EGFR mutation positive 
or ALK positive NSCLC patients who have progressed on prior TKIs . The primary 
endpoint is RR defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.   
 
 54 
 Secondary  objectives include the  evaluation of toxicity, overall survival (OS) duration, 
and Progression Free Survival (PFS). OS is defined as the time from the initiation of 
study therapy to death from any cause, see 10.2. PFS is defined as the time from the 
initiation of pembrolizumab to disease progression  or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first . PFS as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (Section 10.1).  
Exploratory endpoints include correlating tumor PD -L1 expression positive or negative 
and tumor mutational load as high or low with the primary endpoint of response rate. In addition, the study will assess toxicity from the study therapy.  
10.2.2 Sample Size and Accrual Rate:  
 
With chemotherapy in these patients, both EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients and other genetically altered NSCLC patients are expected to demonstrate a response rate of about 30%. We hypothesize that the study regimen will be higher than 30% in both cohorts. A RR of 55% with the study regimen for this patient population will be considered of interest in both cohorts.  The accrual rate of  both cohorts should be similar .  
For each cohort, the combination treatment would be of clinical interest if the RR is > 
0.55 and will not if the RR is <0.3. With 14 pts in stage I and 28 total pts, the 2- stage 
Simon’s minimax design has a 5% type I error and 85% power  and a probability of early 
termination of 0.58. The cohort is to be terminated at stage I if ≤ 4 pts respond. If the 
cohort goes on to stage II and total number  of responses is ≤ 12, the treatment is rejected.   
Thus, if both cohorts go to stage II then each of the cohorts will require [ADDRESS_448246] one dose of 
pembrolizumab and doublet chemotherapy. We assume an ineligibility rate of 10% so 
we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_448247] been assessed for CR/PR. 
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_448248] 95% binomial confidence interval in the response evaluable population in each cohort .  If stage 2 is initiated  for a cohort  then the efficacy 
analysis methods will be as described  by [CONTACT_43900]  (43). 
 
 55 
  
Secondary endpoint analysis will include Kaplan- Meier methods to describe OS and 
PFS.  Descriptive analysis including counts and proportions will be used to desc ribe 
toxicity.  Expression of PD -L1 by [CONTACT_359324] ( ≥1% of cells) or 
negative. Mutation load will be high/low (Rizvi, et al)  (32) .  A description of the 
association of each with the response rate will be described using counts and percentages 
and tested using fisher’s exact chi -square test.  
   
Counts of CTC before the first cycle and before the third cycle will be summarized across 
all patients with sample means and standard deviations, or sample medians and ranges if the distribution of CTC levels is skewed.  We will also summarize counts of CTC before the first cycle and before the third cycle separately for responders and non -responders.  
All other data collected from the blood samples, such as EGFR and ALK expression, will be summarized in similar fashion and Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be used to summarize the association of PD -L1 expres sion in CTCs and in tumor tissue.

12.4 Data Safety Monitoring 
This study will be monito red in accordance with the NCI approved University of Michigan 
Rogel Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, with oversight by [CONTACT_249078] (DSMC).  
The Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_359306].  
The Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Project Manager/Delegate will review data and patient safety issues with participating sites per a de fined  quarterly meeting  cadence. 
Depending on the protocol activity, the meeting cadence may be more frequent. This data review meeting may be achieved via a teleconference or another similar mechanism to discuss matters related to:  
 Enrollment rate relativ e to expectations, characteristics of participants  
 Safety of study participants (SAE reporting, unanticipated problems) 
 Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations) 
 Completeness, validity and integrity of study data 
 Retention of study participants  
Similarl y, protocol deviations are to be documented using the Notice of Protocol Deviation 
Form and requires the signatures of both the sites data manager or study coordinator and the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator. These reports are to be sent to the University of 
Michigan Coordinating Center within 7 calendar days of awareness of the event . 
Participating sites are required to ensure all pertinent data for the review period are available in the database at the time of the discussion. 
Participating sites unable to participate in the data review meeting are required to provide 
written confirmation that their site has reviewed the relevant data and patient safety issues for 
the review period and their site’s data are in alignment with the data reported  in the database. 
Written confirmation is to be provided to the Project Manager/Delegate within the timeline requested to retain compliance with monitoring timelines.  
Documentation of the teleconference or alternate mechanism utilized to review items above is 
to be retained in the Trial Master File.  
The Project Manager/Delegate is responsible for collating the data from all participating sites and completing the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report (DSMR) form to document the data review meeting discussion.  
 
 [ADDRESS_448253] a ‘for cause’ quality assurance audit 
of the trial if the committee identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related 
issues.  
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during 
its conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Coordinating Center that such a request has been made.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_448254] be conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study will be monitored by a representative of the Coordinating Center. Monitoring visits  
will be made during the conduct of the study and at study close-out. 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo site initiation meeting to be 
conducted by [CONTACT_5081]. This will be done as an actual site visit; teleconfere nce, 
videoconference, or web -based meeting after the site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16514]. Study –related 
questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed -up by [CONTACT_359325]. 
Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source 
documents at the Coordinating Center and ‘On- site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first 
‘Centralized’ visit should occur after the first subject enrolled completes first treatment cycle .  
The study site will send the de -identified so urce documents to the Coordinating Center for 
monitoring.  ‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_311003]. The site will send in pertinent de -
identified source documents, as defined by [CONTACT_43910].  
The first annual ‘On- site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants 
are enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit 
may be conduct ed as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study 
site.  The type of visit is at the discretion of the Coordinating Center.  At a minimum, a routine monitoring visit will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if the study duration is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify: 
 Adherence to the protocol  
 
 59 
  Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication 
 Compliance with regulations  
 
During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359307].  While most patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be review ed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced 
cases.  
The Coordinating Center expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to facilitate the conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. Any issues 
identified during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] a timely manner.  For review of study -related docu ments at the Coordinating 
Center, the site will be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.   
Participating site will also undergo a site close -out upon completion, termination or 
cancellation of a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the 
study, and that the site Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, a site close -out is conducted during a site visit; however, site close -out can occur without a site 
visit.  
12.5 Data Management 
All information will be recorded locally and entered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on the web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system of the University of Michigan. Online access 
will be provided to each site by [CONTACT_5081].  
CRFs will be reviewed and  source verified by [CONTACT_359326]. Discrepant, unusual and incomplete data will be queried by [CONTACT_359327]. The investigator or study coordinator will be responsible for providing resolutions to the data queries, as appropriate. The investigator must ensure that all data queries are dealt with 
promptly.  
The data submission schedule is as follows:  
• At the time of registration   
o Subject entry into EDC 
 Subject Status  
 Demographics 
• During study participation  
o All data should be entered online within 10 business days of data acquisition. 
[Information on dose limiting toxicity events must be entered within one 
 
 60 
 business day.] Information on Serious Adverse Events must be entered within 
the reporting timeframe specified in Section 8.2.3 of the protocol.  
All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic chart).

14.2 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0 (CTCAE) 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting. (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)  
14.3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.[ADDRESS_448258] version 1.1* will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or MRI m ay be utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this 
study.

A. Study Visit Schedule:  
• Visits:  Where participants cannot be seen at the site, the use of telemedicine and 
adaptation of schedule of assessments will be implemented, where feasible to 
ensure patient safety.  
• Treatment:  Per physician discretion, 1- 2 cycles of treatment may be omitted once 
a patient completes 4 cycles of therapy.  
 
B. Correlative Samples:  
• PD-L1 testing:  Per physician discretion, a new biopsy is not required if a patient 
does not have PD -L1 results or archival tissue  
• CTC samples:  Samples will not be collected while the lab is closed due to COVID -
19. 
• Mutati onal Analysis samples:  Blood and tissue will not be collected or shipped 
while the lab is closed due to COVID -19.

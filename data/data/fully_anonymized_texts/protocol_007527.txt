 INTRODUCTION  
 
In 2012, the global volume of surgery was  estimated to be 312 million operations , a 33% increase from 
2004.1 According to Weise r et al , the increase in surgical volume is projected to grow with economic 
development . Surgery  is associated with high mortality and morbidity, de spi[INVESTIGATOR_788625]. Overall inpatient 30-day morta lity is about  2%, and climbs up 
to 6% in high -risk populations .2-7 More than 1%  of patients aged 45 years  or more  die after  major non-
cardiac surgery while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_788626] 30 days of surgery .8 
Cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI ) and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery 
(MINS)  are strongly associated with 30 -day mortality .6 MINS is defined as myoc ardial injury caused by 
[CONTACT_788668] 30 days after surgery . Elevated  high-sensitivity  troponin T 
measurement, diagnostic of MINS, is significantly associated with an increased risk of 30 -day mortality 
(0.5%  for <20 ng/L, 3.0%  for 2 0 to <65 ng/L, 9.1%  for 65 to <1000 ng/L, and 29.6% for ≥ 1000 ng/L) .8 
Without perioperative troponin monitoring, 93% of MINS and 68%  of myocardial infarctions go es 
unrecognized because these patients do not experience ischemic symptoms.8 Many factors are strongly 
associated with MINS/MI, but most are unmodifiable baseline characteristics.  But intraoperative 
hypotension is a  distinctly  modifiable factor which reduces the myocardial oxygen supply- demand ratio.  
Intraoperative hypot ension  
Intraoperative  hypotension is  strongly  associated with adverse outcomes.9-12 In addition to being associated 
with MI, hypotension is  implicated in the genesis of perioperative acute kidney injury a nd stroke .13 Recently 
Green et al demonstrated that 60% of surgical patients experience post-intubation hypotension,  and that 
hypotension after induction of anesthesia is  association with prolonged postoperative mechanical 
ventilation ICU length of stay.14 Overall, t he incidence of intraoperative hypotension is surprisingly high 
and, depending upon the definition, range s from 5 to 99%.15  
Hypotension can be defined by [CONTACT_788669] . Commonly used absolute thresholds for 
definition include  systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mmHg or  mean arterial pressure (MAP) les s 
than 65 mmHg. Relative thresholds for describing hypotension include  a 20% decrease in baseline SBP or  
a 30% decrease in MAP.  Variability in definitions  of intraoperative hypotension results because it remains 
unclear what thresholds are actually associated with harm . However, recent work has much enhanced our 
understanding of the relationship between intraoperative hypotension and adverse outcomes.  
For example , in a retrospective cohort analysis (N=57,315), Salmasi et al reported that MAP below absolute  
thresholds of 65 mmHg and lower or relative thresholds of 20% or more below baseline were progressively 
related to both myocardial and kidney injury  (Figure  1). The investigators also  found that t he associations 
based on relative thresholds were no strong er than those based on absolute thresholds — which are easier 
to use .

Figure 1 – A 20 % reduction from baseline worsens myocardial injury & mortality — but is not a better than 
absolute threshold of MAP <[ADDRESS_1085795] intraoperative  hypotension or 
bradycardia intra- operatively.16  However, the Prediction  is on a per -patient basis, and does not provide 
minute- by-minute guidance for intraoperative management. Furthermore, the score has not been externally 
validated and was derived from a small cohort.  
Acumen Hypotension Prediction  Index   
The Acumen Hypotension Prediction  Index (HPI) software suite is enabled by [CONTACT_788670] .17-19 The Flotrac  IQ sensor is the hardware which is connected to the existing arterial 
catheter . The hemodynamic information is presented on Edwards EV1000 platform .Thus whole system is 
comprised of 
- Flotrac IQ sensor (hardware ): Flotrac IQ  is the sensor (Figure 2a) which is connected to the  
standard arterial catheter tubing from the patient.  The sensor than relay information to the standard 
anesthesia monitor in the form of continuous arterial pressure waveform. The sensor also relay 
infor mation to Acumen HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788627]1000 platform.  
-  Acumen HPI (software) : The software unlocks the Hypotension Prediction  Indicator and other  
advanced hemodynamic parameters ( Appendix 1)  
-  EV1000 ( screen platform ): This is the platform  (Figure -2b). which displays the continuous 
arterial pressure monitoring, HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788628].  

Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index -  CCF

 The hemodynamic information includes following three elements :  
(1) A continuous arterial pressure waveform including blood pressure readings.  This arterial wavefo rm 
is also shown on the standard anesthesia monitor.  
(2) The hypotension Prediction  parameter, which indicates the possibility of a hypotensive event 
using machine learning techniques developed from more than 20,[ADDRESS_1085796] patient events. The HPI 
(0-100%) gives a percent Prediction  of hypotension in coming minutes. For example, a HPI [CONTACT_4007] 85 
indicates that there is roughly an 85% chance of hypotension to occur in the subsequent five 
minutes (Table 1).  An alarm (audible and visual) is incorporated in the system that alerts 
clinicians when hypotension Prediction  exceeds an upper threshold.  
(3) Advanced hemodynamic parameters are displayed a secondary screen (Figure  2) which provide 
information on the pathophysiology of the predicted hypotension. The traditional explanat ion of 
hypotension pathophysiology is based on three distinct concepts -  preload, afterload and 
contractility. And based on these concepts the treatment of hypotension can consist of -  fluids, 
vasopressor and/or inotropes  (Figure 3) . The advanced hemodynam ic variables  (Appendix -1) 
given by [CONTACT_788671] [INVESTIGATOR_788629]/dt, dynamic elastance (Eadyn), stroke volume (SV), stroke 
volume variation (SVV), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can aid 
clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment and eva luating the treatment response.20 All parameters are 
described in the Appendix 1.

Animal  studies  
The performance of the HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788630] a porcine model ( unpublished data, confidential). This 
animal study examined the HPI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a hemorrhagic model and a vasodilation translational model to 
estimate the probability of a hypotension event in the acute set ting. Swine were intubated with arterial 
lines and pulmonary artery catheters were placed to measure right heart cardiovascular parameters and 
continuous cardiac output (CO). Five swine were bled by [CONTACT_788672] 5 -20 cc/min after establishing 
baseline stabilization.  Animals were bled to MAP of 60 mm Hg and sustained for 15 min and fluid 
resuscitated via auto transfusion to MAP of 85 mm/hg for [ADDRESS_1085797] modalities.   
•The hemorrhage model directly reduces blood volume, demonstrating the direct relationship between 
hypotension prediction  and reduction in optimal fluid status. This model directly analyzes the abil ity of 
HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788631].  
•The vasodilation model, by [CONTACT_2224] a vasodilation substance, demonstrates the direct effect of 
afterload reduction and the relationship to HPI.  
In both models, mean arterial pressure (MAP), hypotension Prediction  indicator (HPI), heart rate (HR), 
stroke volume variation (SVV), dP/dt, arterial dynamic elastance (Eadyn), stroke volume (SV), systemic 
vascular resistance (SVR), end -diastolic volume index (EDVI), and ejection fraction (EF) were 
measured. (Figure 4) Both models show that the mathematical analog demonstrates the absolute 
usefulness in using the dynamic changes in ventricular force compared to the ability of the vascular 
vessels to increa se tone.  As dP/dt acutely increases, cardiac performance compensates maximally thus

 maintaining mean arterial pressure. Eventually dP/dt will decrease as Eadyn increases which is reflected 
as an increase in HPI [CONTACT_30432] a high probability of an acute hypot ension event.  
In short, the hemorrhage model demonstrates the ability of HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788632] a reliable prediction for a hypotensive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The vasodilation model de monstrated the usefulness of the HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788633].

 Protocol  
Anesthetic care will be per clinical routine. There is no restriction on type of general anesthesia , 
and regional anesthesia/analgesia is permitted.  
In addition to the standard ASA monitors , all patients will have an arterial catheter inserted for 
pressure monitoring. The catheter will be connected to a FloTrac IQ sensor and to EV1000 platform 
which includes Acumen  HPI [CONTACT_183782].   
Shortly b efore induction of anesthesia, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups 
using a reproducible set of computer -generated random number s. We will use web -based, 
computer -generated randomization, prepared by [CONTACT_543584], and access ed shortly before 
induction of anesthesia  to conceal allocation to the extent practical . Patients will not be informed 
of their group assignments.   
The randomized groups will be:  
1) Access to arterial waveform and pressures from the standard  anesthesia 
monit or.   
2) Access to arterial waveform and pressures from the standard  anesthesia 
monitor and information from  an Acumen HPI -enabled EV1000 screen . 
 
The amount and timing of intravenous fluids  and vasopressor drugs  will be decided by [CONTACT_788674] o n the guidance from the software in the intervention group. The software 
provide multiple parameters. In order to standardize the interpretation of hemodynamic parameters 
clinicians at Cleveland Clinic has agreed to the conceptual framework presented in Figure 6. In the 
arterial pressure monitoring group without Acumen HPI , clinicians will make treatment decision 
based on the pressure waveform.  In all cases, good clinical judgment will be predominant, and the 
attending anesthesiologist take all necessary steps to provide optimal and safe care. B lood and 
blood products will be administered based on clinical judgment.

A research fellow will be present in the operating room and will monitor th e HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788644] 15 min and also when HPI >85. He will specifically document 
the HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788645] – hypovolemia, vasoplegia and decreased contractility  
and document the clinician’s response as following 
Table [ADDRESS_1085805] of care.  
Postoperative Management  
The attending anesthesiologists and surgeons, taking into account the clinical condition of 
individual patients and risk of complications, will determine whether postoperative  ICU adm ission  
is appropriate.  
Measurements  
Baseline Information : We will record d emographic and morphometric characteristics  include 
height (cm), weight (kg), age (yr.), sex , ASA physica l status, and self -declared ethnicity. If 
available we will collect social history (tobacco and alcohol use), medical history (pulmonary 
disease, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, drug usage (including but not limited to: statins, 
ß blockers, ora l hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin), NSAIDs, diabetes (and whether insulin-
dependent or not), and previous glucose -tolerance test results, preoperative hemoglobin and 
hematocrit, BUN and creatinine, electrolytes, preoperative EKG, and hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c). 
We will obtain contact [CONTACT_788675] -up.  
Perioperative Data : Intraoperative care data will be accessed from  electronic  anesthesia 
information management system. The hemodynamic monitoring data will be downloaded fr om the 
monitors on to the secure Cleveland Clinic computers for analysis.  
Anesthetic data will include the volatile anesthetic dose in MAC -hours, as well as total doses of 
propofol and other sedative hypnotics. Hemodynamic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951], BIS valu es and 
esophageal temperatu re will be recorded at regular intervals intraoperatively. Blood loss will be 
estimated; urine output and fluid administration including allergenic blood will be recorded. 
Intraoperative use and total dose of vasoactive drugs as well as antibiotic administration will be 
recorded. If available arterial blood gas results will be recorded.  
Blood pressure measurements:  A research fellow will be present in the operati ng room 
throughout the surgery.  The research fellow will document when HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788646] – hypovolemia, 
vasoplegia or decreased left ventricular contractility . The research fellow will also document the 
clinician’s  response; no action, fluid bolus, vasopressor started or increased , and inotrope  started 
or increased.  The hemodynamic monitoring data will be downloaded from the monitors on to the 
secure Cleveland Clinic computers for analysis.

Follow up  
Patient will be followed up for major and minor complications as listed above. Patients will have a 
Troponin T drawn  preoperatively and  on the first  and second days after surgery while patients 
remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Study personnel will recommend and attempt  to obtain an ECG and/or 
Hypotension Prediction Index -  CCF  
 
 22 echocardiogram on patients with an elevated Troponin T. Patients will be queried about ischemic 
symptoms and pulmonary edema.  
Research personnel will follow patients throughout their time in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_788651]. If 
records/ patients indicate that they have experienced an outcome, study personnel will obtain the 
appropriate documentation.  
PATIENT RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSE NT  
To ensure efficient recruitment, research personnel will screen the patient list in the preoperative 
assessment clinic to identify eligible patients. Research personnel will use a variety of screening 
approaches to capture patients who do not attend th e preoperative assessment clinic, including 
screening: the daily surgical list in the operating room, patients on surgical wards and intensive 
care units, and patients in the preoperative holding area. Center will also use all potential patient 
sources inc luding asking the services of anesthesia, surgery, and medicine to page the study 
personnel regarding all surgical admissions through the emergency department and consultations 
for floor patients requiring surgery. Research personnel will approach all elig ible patients to obtain 
informed consent. We will enroll patients undergoing surgery at single institution (Cleveland Clinic 
foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, [LOCATION_003])  
DATA ANALYSES  
Randomized groups will be compared on baseline variables using the standardized dif ference 
(difference in means or proportions divided by [CONTACT_103884]), and such variables 
will be considered balanced if the absolute stand ardized difference is < 1.96 sqrt(2/N) , where N is 
the per group sample size. Imbalanced variables wi ll be adjusted for in all analyses.  
The treatment effect of Acumen HPI [INVESTIGATOR_42201] (versus no Acumen HPI [INVESTIGATOR_42201] ) on the primary 
outcome of intraop erative  time- weighted average (TWA) MAP under  a threshold of [ADDRESS_1085808] or a proportional odds logistic regression model, as appropriate.  
For all analyses, focus will be on the estimated treatment effects and their confidence intervals, as 
well as the P -values.  SAS statistical software, Carey, NC, will be used for all analyses.

 23 SAMPLE SIZE  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Summary.  From our a -line s tudy [ unpublished ] we observed mean (SD) of area under the curve 
AUC -MAP<65 of 80 (127) and median [quartiles] of 24 [1, 121].  Similar to time weighted 
average AUC -MAP represents depth and duration of hypotension. AUC -MAP = TWA -MAP x 
duration of observati on.  The data is highly skewed, with a non- trivial proportion of zeros.  
Therefore, it is not appropriate to base a sample size estimate on a t -test which assumes 
normality.  It is best based on a non- parametric test such as the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test,  as 
put forth in the preliminary protocol for the larger study.  In that study we needed about [ADDRESS_1085809] a 50% reduction in the median, based on 90% power and incorporating interim 
analyses.  For the calculations below we use 80% power.  As no ted below, for the current study 
we recommend a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1085810] an approximate 20% reduction in the mean of 
the primary outcome of AUC -MAP < 65 mmHg x min, which based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_788652] a Wilcoxon- Mann -Whitney probability (i.e., a c -statistic) of 0.61.  
Detailed calculations.  In the below Table 3, using the same calculations based on the Wilcoxon-
Mann -Whitney test as in the proposal for the larger HPI [CONTACT_10665], we present the required sample size 
to detect reductions or shifts in the distribution of the primary outcome (AUC -MAP < 65 mmHg x 
min) which are equal to various percentages ( achieved  reductions ranging from 7% to 35%) of the 
control group mean.   The reduction is applied on a case level (i.e., for each control observat ion), 
so that a reduction of say 10% of the mean would reduce all observations by 8 mm Hg x min (0.10 
x control group mean (80 mmHg x min).  But if that brings an observation below zero, the value of 
zero is used (cannot have negative AUC!).  Table 3 thus gives a top row for the attempted reduction 
(on the case level), and then the achieved  HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788653], as well as the ratio (HPI/control) 
of means and medians.  
Recommended Sample Size of total N=213:  In the 35% attempted reduction column, a reductio n 
of 35% of the control mean (equal to 28 mmHg x min) was attempted  for all control cases when 
constructing the HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788654].  The achieved  ratio of means was 0.79, indicating a 
21% reduction in the mean.  The achieved reduction was not the  full 35% since, as expected, many 
of the cases reached zero instead of the full attempted reduction.  This scenario also brought the 
HPI [CONTACT_133763] (and thus the ratio of medians) to zero.  The scenario requires a total of 213 patients 
(107 / group).  The Wil coxon- Mann -Whitney probability of 0.61 means the probability that 
randomly chosen HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788655] -MAP<65 compared to random control patient is 0.61.

executive committee will also review the conduct of the study; and h elp identify and reso lve 
problems with recruitment or performance.  
Data management  
Procedures used to assure the integrity of data include (1) quarterly external audits by O UTCOMES 
RESEARCH  staff, (2) data entry procedures following standard operating procedures (SOPs), and 
(3) data queries and resolution processes following SOPs. Frequent interaction among members of 
the study Executive Committee (PI, co -investigat ors), and others as necessary, will maintain overall 
quality assurance. They will meet or have conference calls at  least quarterly throughout the data 
collection period, and as necessary thereafter.  
A standard form for data collection will be used. The key variables for intraoperative management 
and postoperative data collection are explicitly defined in the data for m. Qualified and trained 
individual will enter the information into research database, to decrease the variability and to ensure 
quality of essential data. Hard- copy forms will be stored in locked cabinets within a secured area. 
To protect electronic recor ds and files against loss, duplicate files will be maintained on the 
Anesthesiology Institute servers at the Cleveland Clinic. These servers are highly secured because 
they already contain much patient -related information and are backed up daily to tape th at is 
maintained in a remote location. The system fully meets all applicable HIPAA Privacy and Security 
rules. Access to the database and backups are strictly monitored according to need.  
An initial training meeting before study enrollment will ensure reliability and consistency in the 
use of Acumen HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788662] (SOPs). At least 80% of 
the data will be independently audited to confirm consistency among patient records, study data 
sheets, and the main database. Data will be maintained on a custom -designed Access or SQL 
relational database. Data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_653004]. We have programmed 
and used similar password -protected databases in our previous major outcome trials. Trial 
management will be coordinated from  the department of Outcomes Research,  Cleveland.  
Hypotension Prediction Index -  CCF  
 
 [ADDRESS_1085813]; research data will not be collected from these patients.  
1. Human Subjects Involveme nt and Characteristics:  
The executive committee which will not otherwise be involved in day- to-day aspects of the 
protocol, will evaluate all results from the proposed trial. This committee, along with the IRB, will 
have exclusive authority to stop the studies either because the hypotheses have been confirmed, 
denied, or because adverse events are detected. It will be the responsibility of this committee to 
alert the IRB at each participating institution to any untoward toxicity in one of the study groups.  
2. Sources of Material  
Data obtained routinely for clinical purposes will be used in this study. Such data include: 
1) anesthetic dose and safety monitoring; 2)  fluid balance and transfusion requirements; 
3) postoperative nausea and vomiting; 4)  details o f surgery; and 5)  morphometric and demographic 
information. Postoperative outcomes will be retrieved daily from the patients’ charts.  
3. Potential risks to Subjects  
Monitoring and Data Collection : Some data obtained routinely for clinical purposes will be used 
in this study. Such data include: anesthetic concentration and safety monitoring (end- tidal gases, 
arterial blood pressures, oxygen saturation, esophageal temperatures, intraoperative arterial blood 
gas samples, etc.), fluid balance, and urine volume.  Recording these data is clinical standard and 
introduces no additional risk.  
 
Randomized treatments:  Only patients needing arterial line placement for hemodynamic 
monitoring will be included . The information from the additional monitor Acumen  HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788663]. Use of crystalloid LR is normal practice for 
perioperative fluid administration. Clinicians are not bound to any treatment recommendation and 
will use best clinical judgement at any time for patient care.   
 
Acum en HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788664] : HPI [INVESTIGATOR_788665] .  The software is CE marked and already on the European 
market available for use in humans.  The FDA has reviewed and granted de novo request 
DEN160044; a reclassification order allowing the software to be marketed in the US  
 
Patient Privacy : Patient privacy will be fully respected. The investigators will discuss with subjects 
and their assigned representatives, the IRB -approved informed consent explaining all procedures 
and potential risks, and the HIPAA regulations regarding privacy of their medical information. 
Participating patients will complete the appropriate HIPAA forms.  
Access to medical records is limited to the investigative st aff. Data will be managed by [CONTACT_788677]. All reports will be of a summary nature and no individual will 
Hypotension Prediction Index -  CCF  
 
 27 be identified. The investigators and study coordinators are keenly aware of the increasing ethical 
concerns of using medical information in research and its potential misuse in clinical care. They 
will insure that data will be handled appropriately and that confidentiality is strictly maintained. 
All members of the study staff will sign agreements of confidentiality.  
4. Recruit ment and Informed Consent  
Patients will be recruited from the Operating Room schedules. A specially trained member of the 
study staff will approach potential subjects at the Cleveland Clinic in the Preoperative Clinic or 
surgeon’s office and give a general  description of the study and its purpose to the patient. Patients 
who orally agree will be given the Informed Consent document and asked to read it carefully. If for 
some reason they cannot read it themselves, it will be read to them. Any questions will b e fully 
answered. Once patients completely understand the procedure, benefits, and risks involved, they 
will be asked to sign and date the consent form.  
Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_652929]. One copy remains in the patient’s chart, 
another  copy will be given to the patient, and the original will be filed with the case report form. 
The original consent will thus be available to the investigators, their staff, study monitors, and each 
institution’s IRB.  
5. Protection against Risks 
All interviewers will undergo training by [CONTACT_788678] 
a high level of proficiency before being certified to interview subjects. Research fellows and study 
coordinators will be trained in all aspects of the study. Procedures used to assure the integrity of 
data include: (1) quarterly external audits by [CONTACT_685636], (2) data entry procedures 
following standard operating procedures (SOPs), and (3) data queries and resolution processes 
following SOPs. Frequent interac tion among members of the study Executive Committee (PI, co -
investigators, consultants), RAs, and others as necessary, will maintain overall quality assurance. 
They will meet or have conference calls at least quarterly throughout the data collection period , 
and as necessary thereafter.  
The executive committee will evaluate all results from the proposed trial at least yearly, but more 
often if the Committee deems it necessary. It will be the responsibility of this committee to alert 
the IRB via  letter to an y untoward toxicity in one of the study groups. This committee, along with 
the IRB, will have exclusive authority to stop the study either because the hypotheses have been 
confirmed or denied, or because adverse events are detected. The executive committee  will operate 
under guidelines published on the NCI web site.  
6. Collaborating Sites  
Single center  
7. Gender and Minority Inclusion  
We have no reason to believe that the effects of hemodynamic  management on outcome are related 
to race or ethnicity. We will  consequently include patients of all races and ethnicities and make a 
special effort to include minorities. We assume that our study population will reflect the patient 
Hypotension Prediction Index -  CCF  
 
 28 population of each participating health system. In Cleveland, our participants will be  roughly  10% 
Hispanic and 15% African American.  
8. Inclusion of Children  
Children will be excluded from the proposed studies.

1. Description of hemodynamic parameters  
- MAP= mean arteri al pressure . Average systemic arterial blood pressure.  
- CO= cardiac ouput. Volume of blood ejected per minute from the heart into the 
systemic circulation measured in liters per minute.  
- PR=pulse rate= heart rate  
- SV = stroke volume. Amount of blood ejected f rom the ventricles with each 
contraction.  
- SVV=stroke volume variation. Stroke volume variation is the percent difference 
between maximum and minimum stroke volume. A SVV>12% means the patient is 
fluid responsive. Fluid responsiveness means the cardiac outp ut will increase when 
fluids are administered.  
- SVR=Systemic vascular resistance. A derived measure of impedance to blood flow 
from left ventricle (afterload).  Formula: SVR = (MAP -  CVP) x 80 /CO (dyne -
sec/cm5)  where: CVP -  Central Venous Pressure  
- dP/dt = a measure of left ventricular contractility from an arterial pressure 
waveform, for contractility. It is the maximal first derivative with respect to time of 
arterial pressure waveform . Formula: dP/dt = max(P[n+1] -P[n]), for n=0 to N -1 
where:  P[n] - curren t sample of the arterial pressure signal, mmHg  N - total number 
of samples in a given cardiac cycle  
- Eadyn= Dynamic elastance. Dynamic arterial elastance is the ratio of pulse pressure 
variation and stroke volume variation (PPV/SVV). It is an estimate of ar terial 
elastance

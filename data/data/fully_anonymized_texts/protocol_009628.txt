All patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (8 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit ( CR, PR, or SD)  are 
eligible to receive a 2nd cycle of treatment (lasting 8 weeks). Patients can receive a maximum of 2 cycles of 
treatment.  
 
Assessments : 
Biological and immunological effects (primary endpoint)  
• Intratumoral natural killer ( NK)-cell and T -cell infiltrate and density  
• Phenotypic characterization of immune cells (NK cells, T cells and other) in tumor and peripheral blood  
• Cytokine production and release in tumo r and peripheral blood  
 
Safety Assessments (secondary endpoint)  
• Determine the safety profile as a function of dose and schedule.

Center for Lymphoid Malignancies [ADDRESS_387922] 95% confidence intervals will be 
constructed based on Binomial dist ribution.  
Based on the prior Phase 1 study of AFM13, it is expected that approximately 7 8% of the patients will show 
immunological and biological activity. Observing 12 patients out of  15 with immunological and biological 
response would lead to 95% exact binomial confidence interval of 52%-96% showing activity . The lower bound 
of 52% is assumed to be sufficient for evidence of activity in this exploratory study.  
No formal interim analysis is planned , however a safety committee (not a formal data safety mon itoring board) 
will review the safety data from  each cohort and advis e on opening the next cohort.

 7 INTRODUCTION  
Natural killer (NK) cells represent approximately 15% of circulating lymphocytes and are 
considered one of the key innate effectors in host immune defense  [1]. Although NK cells are 
primarily found in the blood, liver, spleen, bone marrow and, to a lesser extent, lymph nodes, 
inflammation and other factors can trigger  NK cell migration into almost any tissue. NK cells 
were identified on the basis of their ability to lyse tumor cells without prior sensitization. In 
contrast to B - and T - lymphocytes, NK cells do not rearrange genes to acquire antigen -specific 
receptors. Instead, NK cells target tumor cells via an array of germ line -encoded cell surface 
receptors. Based on this characteristic, NK cells have traditionally been considered to be part 
of the innate immune response  [1]. New observations that some NK cell subsets can be long -
lived and show recall responses to certain stimuli has recently challenged this view, as these 
are properties characteristic of adaptive immunity  [2-8]. 
NK cells can mediate cytotoxicity via several distinct mechanisms. Th e most studied pathway 
is degranulation, whereby [CONTACT_315247] -1, and granzyme B into the cytoplasmic 
compartment of the target cell. This pathway is triggered by [CONTACT_315248] 2 member D (NKG2D) , DNAX accessory molecule -1 (DNAM1 
or CD226), 2B4 (CD244), a member of the SLAM -related receptor family, and the natural 
cytotoxicity receptors  (NCR), including  NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, counterbalanced by 
[CONTACT_315249], most of which bind to major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class I molecules [ 9]. Subsequent research has not only provided further insights into 
the intricate regulation of NK cell degranulation but also revealed that their functional capacity 
is tuned by [CONTACT_315250] -MHC class I molecules [ 10-12]. In humans, killer cell 
immunoglobulin -like receptors (KIRs) and the CD94 –NKG2A receptor are the onl y receptors 
known to mediate functional tuning (also referred to as NK cell education). However, the role 
for other receptors, such as leukocyte immunoglobulin -like receptor subfamily B member 1 
(LILRB1), in this process remains to be established. One rece ptor that can trigger potent 
degranulation without the need for simultaneous co -activation signals from other NK cell 
receptors is the Fc receptor CD16 which, upon interacting with antibody -coated cells, mediates 
antibody -dependen t cellular cytotoxicity (A DCC).  
Over the past few decades, drugs and cell -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315222] 
T-cell immunity represent an established and growing component of cancer therapeutics. 
Example s include:  the engineering of T-cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR -T cells) in 
leukemia  [13], and the recently approved bispecific T -cell engager (BiTE) molecule, 
blinatumomab for patients with  Philadelphia chromosome -negative precursor B -cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (B -cell ALL)  [14], which recruits cytotoxic T -cells to target tumor B -
cells by [CONTACT_315251]3 and  CD19 antigens. Although NK cells have long been believed to 
have advantages over T lymphocytes in terms of their capacity to induce antigen -independent 
host immune responses against malignancies, their therapeutic potential in the clinic has been 
limited.  A growing number of scientific discoveries into pathways that both activate and 
suppress NK cell function, as well as methods to sensitize malignancies to NK cell cytotoxicity,

Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_387939] now provided 
investigators with a variety of new methods and strategies to ha rness the full potential of NK 
cell-based canc er immunotherapy in the clinic.  
Bispecific antibodies and bispecific or trispecific killer engagers (BiKEs or TriKEs) are 
engineered molecules that exclusively act via ADCC by [CONTACT_315252][INVESTIGATOR_315223]16 receptor on NK cells. These molecules have advantages ove r monoclonal 
antibodies ( mAbs ) because they bind to a different epi[INVESTIGATOR_140011]16 molecule, resulting in 
stronger NK cell ADCC  [15]. In vitro , the CD16 –CD33 BiKE seems to overcome inhibitory 
KIR signaling, leading to robust NK cytokine production and killing of myeloid malignancies. 
Several BiKEs and TriKEs are currently being developed and evaluated for targeting of various 
malignancies  [16]. AFM13 is a bispecific mAb designed to bind to both CD16A on NK cells, 
and CD30 on malignant cells. A Phase I trial of AFM13 in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (HL) patien ts has shown promising res ults [29, 34]

 7.1 Background  
7.1 Targeting Unique Cell -Surface Proteins in Lymphoma  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  (NHL)  is a heterogeneous  group of  lymphoproliferative malignanc ies 
with multiple histological subtypes. It is estimated that approximately 65,540 new cases of 
NHL were diagnosed in 2010 and 20,210 patients died of their disea se [17]. Based on the World 
Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematological and lymphoid tumors, NHL can 
be broadly classified as B or T/NK cell neoplasms  [18]. In the [LOCATION_002], about 85% of 
cases are categorized as B cell lymphomas and 15% are categorized as T/NK cell lymphomas  
[17]. 
The expression of unique proteins on the cell surface allows for the identification and diagnosis 
of different malignancies. These cell markers have been exploited as targetable treatment by 
[CONTACT_315253] s, such as Rituximab , a genetically -engineered chimeric IgG1  mAb tha t 
targets  CD20. CD30  was identified  in the early 1980 s as a protein recognized by [CONTACT_315254]-1 
[19] and abundantly and selectively expressed on the surface of Hodgkin  and Reed -Sternberg 
cells. Later on, its expression in other neoplastic cells was demonstrated such as  anaplastic 
large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), and other lymphoid malignancies as well as on several non -
lymphoid malignancies including selected germ cell tumors . Expression of CD30 o n normal 
cells is highly restricted, thereby [CONTACT_315255]. CD30, a 
member of the tumor  necrosis factor (TNF) -receptor super family  (TNFRSF)  has pleiotropic 
biologic functions, and antibodies targeting CD30 and other TNF  family receptors can exhibit 
both agonistic and antagonistic signaling  functions. Recently, antibody -drug conjugates 
targeting CD30, such as brentuximab vedotin, have shown striking activity in phase I and II 
trials, with manageable toxicity. This has def ined an important emerging role for targeting of 
CD30 in the setting of HL, ALCL, and possibly other CD30 -positive  malignancies.  
Primary cutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms 
derived from skin -homing T cells. Apart from mycosis fungoides (MF), primary cutaneous 
CD30 -positive  lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are the most common group, accounting 
for approximately 25% of all CTCL. This group includes primary cutaneous CD30 -positive  
(anaplastic) large T -cell lymphom as (LTCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), a chronic 
recurrent, self -healing papulonodular skin eruption with histolog ic features of a CD30 -positive  
CTCL [ 20]. 
 
7.2 CD30 -Positive Lymphoid Malignancies  
In hematologic malignancies, CD30 expression is strongly increased in HL and ALCL, but has 
also been noted in other lymphoid malignancies, such as diffu se large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL), including primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), peripheral 
T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), Lyp, MF, and Epstein -Barr Virus ( EBV )-driven clonal LPD  
enteropathy -associated T -cell lymphoma  type I , human T -cell lymphotropic  virus type 1

 (HTLV -1)-associated adult T -cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), primary effusion lymphoma 
harboring human herpes virus -8 [21- 25]. Additionally, CD30 expression is regularly observed  
in primary CTCL .  
 
7.3 AFM13  
The target of AFM13 is CD30, which is a 120 -kDa type I transmembrane protein that contains 
six cysteine -rich pseudo -repeat motifs in its extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail with 
several TNF receptor -associated factor (TRAF) -binding sequences that mediate activat ion of 
nuclear factor kappa -B (N F-κB) [26, 27]. CD30 has a broad spectrum of biologic effects 
depending on the cellular context, including in duction and regulation of cytokine secretion and 
inflammation, induction of apoptosis, and promotion of cell survival and proliferation [28] 
Please refer to the In vestigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details of non -clinical and clinical 
studies conducted with AFM13.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_387942] AFM13 is a tetravalent bispecific chimeric (anti -human 
CD30 x anti -human CD16A) recombinant antibody construct ( TandAb®) for the treatment of 
HL. 
AFM13 is constructed by [CONTACT_315256] a homodimer of a polypeptide 
comprising four antibody variable  domains, each one being separated from the neighboring  
domains by a glycine -serine linker of nine amino acids.  The four -domain gene product is 
unable by [CONTACT_315257], since the lengths of the linkers between the domains are too 
short for intram olecular pairing of the corresponding heavy and light chains.  However, they 
are arranged in an order that permits formation of the corresponding antibody V H/VL domains 
after non -covalent dimeri zation.  The result of this folding process is a homodimer mol ecule 
with a molecular weight of 104 -kDa as outlined in Figure 1 .

The tetravalent bispecific format, as represented by [CONTACT_315258]13, is designed to recruit cytotoxic 
effector cells of the immune system effectively against pathogenic i.e. tumor target cells.

activated. Their inherent cytotoxic activity is stimulated by [CONTACT_271277]γRIIIA (CD16A) , which is 
expressed on the surface of NK cells as well as on macrophages, and activated monocytes. 
Interestingly, recent studies have provided evidence that NK cell can be pre-activated  prior to 
cytolysis. More important observations have been made regard ing the development of a 
memory NK cell that can be primed prior to cytotoxicity against stressed cells (i.e., infected or 
transformed cells ) [2-8].  
Regarding AFM13 -mediated NK cell -directed cytotoxicity, in vitro  studies have shown that 
AFM13 simultaneously binds to CD16A on NK cells and CD30 on Hodgkin - and Reed -

Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_387945] been 
extensively characterized.  The results demonstrate high affinity of AFM13 to both of its 
ligands.  AFM13 binds to human CD16A with an affinity of ~ 1.6 x 10-9 M and to human CD30 
with an affinity of ~ 1.[ADDRESS_387946] either CD16 or CD30.  
 
7.5.2 Primary pharmacodynamic activity  
In vitro  AFM13 induces specific and selective killing of CD30 -positive  target cells by [CONTACT_315259] 50 typi[INVESTIGATOR_315224] ~ 5 – 250 pM (depending on the target cell line and 
effector cells used). AFM13 -induced target cell lysis is specific since A FM13 -activated killing 
of CD30 -positive  target cells by [CONTACT_315260]30 -negative  by[CONTACT_145111]. The 
onset of AFM13 -mediated target cell lysis is immediate and does not require pre -activation of 
NK cells. AFM13 which is already bound to CD30 -positive  target cells or CD16A -positive  
effector cells is able to mediate target cell lysis even in the absence of free soluble AFM13. 
The data suggests a difference between PK and pharmacodynamic half -life in vivo . There is 
substantial inhibition of the AFM13 -mediated cytolytic response by [CONTACT_315261]30.

7.5.3 Secondary pharmacodynamic activity  
Secondary pharmacodynamic properties of AFM13 were investigated in several in vitro  
systems. These in vitro  studies encompassed the ability to induce cytokine release in human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC s) and the ability to induce proliferati on in CD30 -
positive  and CD16A -positive  cells.  The ability of free soluble AFM13 to induce cytokine 
release from human PBMC is minimal.  Nevertheless, it is not possible to claim that AFM13 
is free of cytokine releasing potential.  Measurement of plasma co ncentrations of IL -2, IL -6, 
TNF -α, and IFN -γ, which are known to be most relevant for cytokine -related adverse reactions, 
did not indicate cytokine release in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 28 -day repeated dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys up to a dose level of 10 mg /kg. 
Additional data do not indicate strong induction of cytokine release from human PBMC by 
[CONTACT_315262]13 or AFM13 in the presence of physiological and non -physiological cross -
linkers.  The most effective cross -linker with regard to induction of cytok ines (especially TNF -
α and IFN -γ) by [CONTACT_315258]13 seem s to be CD30 -positive  target cells.  This may be part of the mode 
of action since activation of NK cells is normally associated with release of IFN -γ. Binding of 
AFM13 to CD16A -positive  cells in cultures of hu man PBMC or binding to CD30 -positive  on 
HL cells does not t rigger or affect proliferation.  
 
7.6 Safety pharmacology  
A number of safety pharmacology end -points concerning the central nervous system  (CNS) , 
cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], gastrointesti nal system, renal/urinary system, and 
hematopoietic  system, have been integrated into standard toxicity studies of AFM13 in 
cynomolgus monkeys. No alerts with regard to safety pharmacology arose from these studies 
that might call for additional in -depth investigations of AFM13.

7.7 Phase I clinical trial in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma  
A clinical phase I study, AFM13 -101, was conduc ted in patien ts with heavily pre -treated 
relapsed/refractory  HL [29]. The trial results are summarized in the sections below.  
 
7.7.1 Results of the AFM -101 phase I trial 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient population and treatment  
Twenty -eight patients with HL including 16 males and 12 females were enrolled in the 
AFM13 -101 trial. The median age was 38.5 years. The patients had a median of 6 (range 3 -11) 
previous lines of therapy for HL includi ng ASCT in 22/28 patients and previous radiotherapy 
in 24/[ADDRESS_387950] recent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 9/28 
patients had received brentuximab vedotin.  
The included patients received treatment with AFM13 in the planned  8-dose cohorts. In the 
dose escalation part, 24 patients received increasing doses of AFM13 ranging from 0.01  mg/kg 
to 7.0 mg/kg on a weekly dose schedule for 4 weeks. In addition, 4 patients were treated with 
AFM13 at a dose of 4.5 mg twice weekly for 4 weeks. Nineteen of 28 patients completed the 
study; the remaining 9 patients discontinued the treatment due to disease progression (n=2), 
adverse events (AEs) (n=1), withdrawal of consent (n=3) and other reasons (n=3). Eight of the 
[ADDRESS_387951] dose before being withdrawn.  
All 28 patients were included in the safety analysis. Two patients were excluded from the 
efficacy  population: patient 001 -03 in C ohort 1 (0. 01 mg/kg) completed cycle1, but left the 
study to start another treatment before completing the final study visit. Patient 002 -01 in C ohort 
4 (0.5 mg/kg) discontinued due to AEs (hemolytic anemia followed by [CONTACT_315263] -organ failure) b efore completing cycle 1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety results of AFM13 -[ADDRESS_387952] AEs were mild or moderate; only 18 of 196 documented AEs were 
National Cancer  Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 
grade 3 AEs; in only 1 patient (patient 002 -01) a dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ), a hemolytic 
anemia CTCAE grade 4, possibly related to AFM13, was documented. The patient 
subsequently died due to aspergillus pneumonia and multi -organ failure which was assessed as 
not or unlikely related to the study drug.  
The most frequent AEs were i nfusion -related reactions (IRR) including pyrexia, chills, 
headache, nausea and other IRRs . Treatment -associated infections were rare; nasopharyngitis 
was noted in 5 patients and pneumonia in 4.

Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_387953] , 201 9 Page 28 of 88 
 After review of the safety data , the independent data monitor ing committee (IDMC) concluded 
that the maximum dose of 7 mg/kg in the weekly dose schedule was reached without any 
toxicity concerns and without reaching the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). Additionally, the 
4 patients treated with 4.5 mg/kg twice weekly co mpleted the treatment without toxicity 
concerns of the IDMC. Apart from the documented DLT in patient 002 -01 the administration 
of AFM13 was not associated with clinically significant changes in any laboratory parameters, 
nor was it associated with clinica lly significant changes in any vital signs or electrocardiogram 
(ECG ) parameters.  
Thus, the AFM13 -101 trial showed that AFM13 is safe and well tolerated at the examined 
doses and dose schedules.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy analyses of the AFM13 -[ADDRESS_387954] cycle. All patients treated in the dose cohorts 
of 1.5 mg/kg AFM13 experience d a marked decrease of sCD30. Furth ermore, 
immunophenotypic analyses showed that AFM13 resulted in an increase of activated NK cells 
in the peripheral blood as measured by [CONTACT_398]69 expression on their surface.  
Of the 26 patients who were eligible for efficacy assessment, 3 patients achieved a p artial 
response (PR), and 13 patients experienced a stable disease (SD) as documented at the final 
study visit. More detailed efficacy analyses indicate that the clinical activity is more 
pronounced at or above a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Of the 13 patients treat ed at or above a dose level 
of 1.5 mg/kg, 7 patients experienced a SD and only 3 patients developed a progressive disease 
(PD) at the end of the trial. Two of the reported PRs were documented at a dose level of 1.5 
mg/kg and one PR at the dose level of 4.5  mg/kg given twice a week. A waterfall plot analysis 
showed a reduction of the tumor volume in 8 patients treated at a dose level of 1.5 mg/kg or 
above [29, 34]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic analyses of the AFM13 -101 trial  
Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that weekly  dosing is suboptimal because the documented 
half-life of AFM13 was between 9 - 19 h in the dose cohorts ≥ 1.5 mg/kg and because the 
serum levels in the weekly dose schedule were mostly below the serum level of 400 ng/ml 
which was defined as trough blood l evel as a result of in vitro  data. Also, the bi -weekly regimen 
did not result in adequate trough levels at the end of the infusion intervals.  
Furthermore, the measurement of NK cell activation with immunophenotypic analysis of 
CD69+ cells in the periphera l blood showed a correlation between the biological activity of 
AFM13 and its PK (Figure 2 ).

Thus, these PK data indicate that the dosing has to be done more frequently than bi-weekly at 
least for some defined period of time.  
7.8  Rationale  
Natural killer cells play an important role in tumor immune -surveillance  [8, 10, 30]. Their 
function is regulated by a repertoire of inhibitory and a ctivating surface receptors. NK  
cell-mediated cytotoxicity  can occur through distinct mechanisms: (1) by [CONTACT_315264]2D and NCR, and (2) through the potent activating receptor CD16 (FcγRIII) 
which mediates ADCC  [8].  Enhanced expression of NK cell antigens has been shown to 
correlate with systemic anti -tumor response in early primary CTCL  [31]. Further, phase I 
clinical  data with AFM13 indicate that engagement of NK cells results in pharmacodynamic 
and clinical activity in relapsed/refractory HL. However, NK cell migration into the tumor, 
cytokine release in the tumor, potential effects on the adaptive immune response and other 
biological processes triggered by [CONTACT_315265] .  
Thus, we hypothesize that if we are able to engage the innate immune syst em through a specific 
activation and recruitment of NK cells via CD16A to tumors expressing CD30,  then we intend 
to demonstrate an immunological  and/or  tumor response that might be broadly described in 
relation to dosing/ PK parameters and could serve as a good and useful parameter in  predic ting 
clinical response.

Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_387956] , 201 9 Page 30 of 88 
 The therapeutic potential of manipulating NK cell function via CD16 for the treatment of 
cancer has been  previously  demonstrated through the use of mAb s [32]. Presently, novel single 
chain fragment variable (scFv) recombinant reagents (BiKE and TriKE), which specifically 
target CD16 expressed on effector NK cells and antigens -of-interest on tumor cells, are being 
developed and tested for clinical use  [33]. Further, a novel tetravalent bispecific CD30/CD16A 
antibody, AFM13, was investigated in a phase I study  in HL patients and was demonstrated to 
be safe and active [ 29, 34]. We plan to investigate AFM13 and evaluate its ability to facilitate 
and redirect the NK cells in eliminatin g CD30 -positive  lymphoma targets in the skin  and, by 
[CONTACT_151998],  other organs involved by [CONTACT_315266] .  
Primary c utaneous CD30 -positive  lymp hoproliferative LPD represent a spectrum from LyP, to 
primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( C-ALCL ), to transformed mycosis 
fungoides (TMF). The most indolent form of primary cutaneous  CD30 -positive  LPD is LyP, 
which is usually well controlled w ith low dose oral methotrexate, but control of the disease 
frequently requires life -long therapy. In contrast, TMF is an aggressive disease which does not 
have a standard of care, as patients are treated with various modalities of care with variable 
outcom es [20]). The spectrum of other CD30 -positive  lymphomas with cutaneous presentation  
is very broad and involves systemic B and T cell lymphomas with various clinical  behaviors. 
Again, redirecting NK cells towards these CD30 -positive  malignancies through direct 
engagement with AFM13 is expected to induce tumor cell k illing through NK cell -mediated  
and T cell -mediated cytotoxicity (i.e. , cytotoxic T lymphocytes [ CTL ]).

This is an open label, Phase Ib /IIa study designed to evaluate  the biologic activity of AFM13 
in patients with relapsed or refractory  CD30 -positive lymphomas with cutaneous involvement.  
The primary objective of this trial is to study the biologic and immunologic effects induced by 
[CONTACT_315267]13, when given as a single agent . The study will 
enroll at least  9 patients with CD30 -positive cutaneous lymphoma . Patients will be assigned to 
3 dose cohorts of 3 patients each. As this is not a  dose-finding study, there are no stringent 
criteria for initiation of subsequent cohorts: s ubsequent cohorts will be progressively enrolled 
after all [ADDRESS_387959] planned treat ment 
dose(s) during the f irst week of the cycle, and the safety of the patients on Week [ADDRESS_387960] cycle is deemed acceptable by [INVESTIGATOR_92052] i nvestigator s (Table  1). 
After preliminary analysis of Cohorts [ADDRESS_387961] and the 
companies own experience in the Hodgkin’s Study of AFM -13, it was decided to investigate 
an interme diate dose of 4.5mg/kg. Study ing the intermediate dose may optimize some of the 
efficacy seen in Cohort 1 while reducing steroid use  seen in Cohort 2 to manage infusion related 
reactions . An additional 3 patients will be recruited into  Cohort 4.  Afterwards a three patient 
expansion will be planned to confirm efficacy and tolerability of the selected cohort for a phase 
2 study.

Prior to recruitment into this trial, all patients will be assessed individually to document 
eligibility into the trial according to the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Additionally, 
documentation of patient briefing and signed informed consent  form (ICF)  are mandatory 
requirements for trial participation. The protocol mandates that the primary diagnosis of  CD30 -

 positive  lymphoma be confirmed by [CONTACT_315268] y at Columbia University 
Medical Center (CUMC). Patients whose diagnosis was made at a different institution will 
consent to have their biopsy material forwarded to CUMC for confirmation.  CD30 expression 
will be confirmed using the BerH2 antibody . To date, there is a suggestion that the level of 
CD30 may not be important in predicting response;  it is unclear what the lower limit should 
be. The data from Kim et al. [37] suggest that patients with <5% positivity for CD30 respond 
less well than patient who have more than 5%. Although this is the first paper to suggest a 
relationship on a lower level of expression and response .. 
Each patient eligible for the study will be aske d to give consent for the collection of fresh tumor 
material. The completion of all staging assessments is also mandatory before registration into 
this trial. The patient will receive one 8 -week cycle of protocol treatment  followed by 3 weeks 
off and will be assessed for treatment /tumor  response thereafter  at week [ADDRESS_387963] SD  will receive a second cycle of protocol treatment at the same dose 
administered during Cycle 1, starting in what would be considered Week 12 . During treatm ent 
and follow -up, patients will be closely monitored for sa fety. The biological and immunological 
effects of the treatment will be assessed in Cycle 1 only.   A schematic overview of treat ment, 
interventions and assessments (safety, feasibility, and effica cy) is given in Table  2. 
In cohort 1 and 2 AFM13 will be administered in all patients as a slow intravenous ( IV) infusion 
over 4 hours. The duration of the infusions will be stepwise shortened by 30 minutes to a 
minimum infusion rate of 1  hour if well tolerated by [CONTACT_102]. In cohort 3 weekly treatment 
will consists of a loading AFM13 dose of 1 mg/kg to be applied on day1 as 1 -hour infusion, 
followed by a 6 mg/kg AFM13 as continuous infusion over 5 days.  For further specifications 
please refer to the pharmacy manual.  Cohort 4 will use the same dosing schedule as cohorts 1 
and 2.  
The biological  and immunological  studies will investigate the NK cell phenotypic 
characteristics, proliferative response  (Ki-67), activation status  (CD69) , and density  in the 
peripheral blood. Th e same analyses will be conducted in the tumor tissue collected from all 
patients at different time points . In addition, tumor cell infiltrate by [CONTACT_315269] t he tumor and its microenvironment will be studied. NK effector function will 
be assessed in both compartments (peripheral blood and tumor) by [CONTACT_315270], 
presence of cytolytic prot eins (granzyme B, perforin -1), and the production and release of 
cytokines and chem okines.  T cells phenotype and effector function (CTL) will also be studied. 
Additionally, tumors obtained from study participants will be analyzed for expression of CD30, 
major histocompatibility antigens (MHC Class -I), other immune cell infi ltrate s, and resident 
immune cells (myeloid -derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells ( Tregs).  
The presence of anti -AFM13 antibody will be investigated, and their neutralizing ability 
assayed.  
Continuous safety analyses (AEs, safety clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECGs)  
will be regularly performed  by a Principal Investigator -led safety team to ensure the safety of

AFM13 in the tumor. The selected dose regimens  of the 3 cohorts  are based on the target dose 
and do se regimen of  AFM13 being investigated in a P hase II proof -of-concept study in 
relapsed/refractory HL. In th e Phase II study , [ADDRESS_387966] cohort of continuous intravenous 
infusion was added which is identical  to Cohort 3 of the HL  study. A fourth cohort, of an 
intermediate dose between Cohort 1 and 2 was also added.  
The rationale for the selecti on of dose and dose regimen   in Phase II is based on data from 
the phase I trial including a PK modeling as well as pre -clinical cytotoxicity data.  
In the phase I study , it was shown that pharmacodynamics and clinical effects are more 
pronounced at AFM13 doses ≥1.5 mg/kg without having a negati ve effect on the safety profile. 
It was therefore concluded that the dose in future studies should be at least 1.5  mg/kg  (Cohort 
1 of the current study) . 
Phase I PK data have been collected and analyzed  after weekly doses of AFM13. Data revealed 
that a defined minimum trough plasma level of AFM13 could not be maintained with weekly 
infusions ( Refer to Figure 1) . This minimum plasma level of 400  ng/mL, indicated by [CONTACT_315271] 2, was calculated based on the EC 50 of in vitro  cytotoxicity assays and 
considering physiological conditions like the presence of IgG in blood as well as the barrier 
from the vascular compartment to the HL lesion.  
In parallel to the AFM13 plasma levels, the portion of activated NK cells (relative to t he total 
number of NK  cells) increased after AFM13 infusion but dropped during the weekly infusion 
period back to basel ine prior to the next infusion.  This finding supports that more frequent 
dosing is needed at least in the initial phase of treatment.  PK  modeling revealed that 1.5  mg/kg 
AFM13 administered 3x per week succeeds in maintaining AFM13 plasma levels above 400 
ng/mL ( Figure 2). Therefore, this dose regimen was defined for the initial 2 -week treatment 
phase with AFM13.  
Considering clinical feasibility aspects, it was decided  for the P hase II study  that, after the 
initial treatment phase, AFM13  will be dosed 7 mg/kg weekly  (Cohort 2 of the current study) . 
The dose regimen of 1.5  mg/kg 3x per week over 2 weeks followed by 7 mg/kg weekly over 6 
weeks ( Figure 3) is currently in P hase II clinical development. AFM13 is administered in 8 -
week cycles.   
PK modelling based on the data gathered f rom the phase I study and as well from the currently 
ongoing phase II study revealed that a more stable serum levels of AFM13 can be achieved

 with continuous infusion (CIVI) of 6mg/kg over 5 days after a loading dose of 1 mg/kg . 
Therefore, a new cohort is currently being investigated with the German Hodgkin Study Group 
to assess efficacy of a CIVI dosing scheme identical  as plann ed in this study . (Cohort 3 of the 
current study)

For Cohort 4: The rationale for the selected dose and schedule of 200 mg is based on  an 
updated analysis  of the overall pre -clinical and clinical experience from the completed 
AFM13 -101 Phase I  study and the other ongoing AFM13 clinical studies  ( including  present 
study) . An exposure -response analysis was completed based on the  data from the AFM13 -
101 Phase I  study.  
 
The PK data from the AFM13 -101 showed that overall, the systemic exposure to AFM13 
increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional fas hion (an increase of 2.14 and 2.30 -
fold for C max and AUC 0-∞, respectively), the systemic exposure increase from the  dose 1.5 
mg/kg to 7 mg/kg (4.7 -fold), geometric mean C max and AUC 0-∞ increased 9.6 -fold and 13.2 -
fold, respectively i.e. approximately 2 - to 3-fold greater than expected based on a 
proportional relationship.  
 
Exposure -response analyses for the study showed that achieving an AUC0 -∞ of at least 
100,000 h*ng/mL appears to be important to inc rease the likelihood of achieving clinical 
benefit and the proposed stratified flat dose of 200 mg corresponded to a dose of

 approximately 3 mg/kg; which is also significantly lower than the dose of 7 mg/kg, a dose 
level that was associated with increased incidence and severity of AFM13 -assoc iated IRRs.  
 
Completed population PK analysis using data from AFM13 -[ADDRESS_387971] on PK parameters as listed 
below:   
 
• Dose: h igher do ses had a greater effect on the central volume of distribution (i.e. with 
higher doses, more of the drug stays within the central compartment)  
• Body surface area ( BSA ): higher BSA had proportionately lower C max; however, BSA 
had no significant impact on the AUC  
• Albumin:  lower albumin led to faster clearance , thereby [CONTACT_315272].  
 
While t hese results do not alter the proposed dose select ion of [ADDRESS_387972] on albumin is confirmed and to determine if a higher 
dose of AFM13 is warranted for patients with very low albumin.

 10 INFORMED CONSENT  AND OTHER STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study Informed Consent  
Before beginning of trial -specific screening examinations described in Section 9.6.1  and 9.6.2 , 
the patient will be informed about the trial, including the following main points: title and aim 
of the trial, procedures, nature of treatment, duration, side-effects,  risks, discomforts, be nefits, 
incentives, passing on of data and material samples, confidentiality, alternatives to 
participating, insurance, the ethics committee’s approval , patient’s freedom to decide , and who 
to contact . Independent of the consent to the treatment with AFM13  within the trial and to 
treatment -related diagnostics, the patient will be informed about the scientific research project. 
She/he will receive the respective patient information and will be asked for the informed 
consent to the lab oratory  research  project  (biological and immunological analyses) .  
Study personnel must obtain documented consent from each potential patient prior to entering 
in the clinical study. Consent must be documented on the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) 
approved ICF by [CONTACT_315273]. If the patient is unable to sign the ICF, then oral consent, 
attested to by [CONTACT_315274] (someone not involved w ith the 
conduct of the study), is the required alternative.  
If the patient is illiterate, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed 
consent reading and discussion. Afterward, the patient should sign and date the ICF, if capable. 
The impartial witness should also sign and date the ICF along with the individual who read and 
discussed the informed consent (i.e., study staff personnel).  
The information from the ICF should be translated and communicated to the subject in 
language understa ndable to the subject. ICFs will be available in English and Spanish. When 
the study participant is non -English and non -Spanish speaking  the CUMC IRB short form will 
be utilized and the consent process followed and documented as per CUMC IRB policy . A 
copy  of the signed and dated ICF should be given to the patient before participation in the 
study.  
The initial informed ICF and any subsequent revised written informed ICF, and written 
information will receive the IRB approval. The patient or his/her legally a cceptable 
representative will be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that 
may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The 
communication of this information will be documented.  
10.1 Consent an d Use of Tissue Specimens for Research  
The study ICF will be inclusive for the  collection of tumor tissue biopsy and blood specimens 
for the correlative lab oratory  research (biological and immunological analyses) will be 
explained to each patient, and , if willing to participate in th is sub -part of the  study, must be 
signed by [CONTACT_102]. The investigator or designee is responsible for explaining and verifying 
the subject’s consent before obtaining any biopsy.  
Columbia University Medical Center   CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AFM13    
 
Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_387991], 2018  Page 45 of 88 
 An additional biopsy may be requested from the  patient at the EoS visit ([ADDRESS_387992] dose of treatment ). This biopsy is optional.  Patients are required to undergo skin biopsies 
of the cutaneous tumor at no more than 6  different time points  during the course of the study.  
Blood specimens will be obtained from patients for the study of the immunological and 
biological effects of AFM13. For each patient, the analyses of the peripheral blood will be 
paired with those of the tumor tissue obtaine d at the time of the cutaneous biopsies.  
 
10.2 Treatment Period (8 weeks)  
One treatment cycle  is [ADDRESS_387993] 
during each cycle.  Study visits will be done according to the schedule of assessments (Table  2). 
These visits  will be referred to according to the  treatment Week (W1 -8) and day of the  
treatment  week (D1, 3 or 5 /6), e.g. the first visit during th e treatment period will be W1D1 .  
 
10.3 Week 1 
During Week 1, the following will be performed:  
W1D1 : 
On Day 1, the following assessments will be performed  prior to treatment infusion : 
• physical examination  
• vital signs  
• skin biopsy can be up to a week prior to therapy  
• blood sampling for the following:  
o clinical chemistry and hematology  
o PK assessment of AFM13 trough serum levels  (Cycle 1 only)  
o full AFM13 PK sampling  (Cycle 1 only)  
o blood for immunology  
o blood cytokines  
o sCD30  
o anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)  
• Review  of concomitant medications . 
Once the above assessments have been carried out, p atients from all 3 cohorts will receive an 
infusion of study drug . 
After the end of treatment infusion  (after the loading dose in cohort 3) , the following will be 
done:

10.9 Discussion of Study Des ign 
This is an open label, Phase Ib/IIa study designed to evaluate the biological and immunological 
activity of AFM13 in the tumor s and peripheral blood of lymphoma patients treated with this 
drug.  
This study is to be carried out in patients with histologically -confirmed CD30 -positive 
lymphoma with cutaneous presentation  who have failed or have been intolerant to at least one 
prior therapy for the current disease with no further standard therapy available. AFM13 has 
shown preliminary anti-tumor  activity in a Phase I study in patients with relapsed or refractory  
HL; a Phase II proof -of-concept stu dy is underway in relapsed/refractory  HL.   
In the current study, doses of AFM13 will be administered to patients  (Table  1). These doses 
have been chosen based on the results of the Phase I trial of AFM13 in patients with relapsed 
or refractory  HL (see 10.10 ). Results from the Phase I study showed that AFM13 was safe 
across the dose range tested, with the MTD not reached. The safety profile was acceptable for 
Columbia University Medical Center   CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AFM13    
 
Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_388008], 2018  Page 52 of 88 
 AFM13 doses in the range from 0.05 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg ( i.e., over a 140 -fold dose increase), 
and a more dose -intense, twice -weekly regimen of 4.5 mg/kg did not result in increased risk. 
Based on the safety data of th e Phase I trial, it can therefore be anticipated that the 
administration of AFM13 at the proposed dos e levels  and drug exposure should also be safe 
and feasible. Anti-tumor  responses were observed in patients who had received at least 1.5 
mg/kg. A range of different dose regimens  are being tested in the present study to try to gather 
as much information a s possible about the optimum dosing regimen for AFM13.  
The use of a placebo control would neither be considered ethical nor scientifically necessary  
in this exploratory study.  
Activity assessments (response rate, response duration and PFS) will be assess ed according to 
global assessment consensus recommendations for standardization of definition of response in 
skin, nodes, blood and viscera, GR  (global response)  score, and other endpoints in MF and 
Sezary syndrome . These recommendations are outlined in the consensus statement of The 
International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas, the [LOCATION_002] Cutaneous Lymphoma 
Consortium, and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European Organization for 
Research and Treat ment of Cancer in 2011 [36], and the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma  [35]. 
 
10.10  Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment  
The field of immune -oncology has been fueled by [CONTACT_315277] ( i.e., 
mAbs ,) for therapy of malignant melanoma , lung cancer, ovarian cancer so far  (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
nivolumab, pembrolizumab) [38-40]. Because tumor develop ment and growth is known to be 
associated with failure of the immune system in its surveillance capacity, it has become 
increasingly clear that immunological and biological factors must exist in the body that either 
promote tumor development, provide growt h advantage and survival, and/or abrogate the 
ability of the nascent malignant cell or that of the established tumor to survive the 
immunological attack. Knowledge of these factors is crucial to our understanding of how to 
refine the dose and schedule of o ur current drugs and drug candidates in order to develop more 
efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The main aim of this study is to identify and characterize immunological 
and biological factors that may correlate with clinical activity or resistance to therapy. Again, 
this knowledge is vital to our future efforts to design rationally drugs that are likely to have a 
positive clinical outcome for patients with lymphoma.   
This study is to be conducted  in patients with histologically -confirmed CD30 -positive 
lymphoma with cutaneous presentation  that has relapsed or is refractory  to at least [ADDRESS_388009] therapy available  (Brentuximab 
Vedotin is only FDA approved in HL and ALCL with no approval in other lymphomas) . 
AFM13 is a bispecific tetravalent CD30/CD16A chimeric antibody (TandAb) developed for 
the treatment of CD30 -positive malignancies , and  has shown promising anti-tumor  responses 
in HL patients with relapsed  or refractory  HL [29, 34]. AFM13 is a novel drug candidate for 
CD30 -positive lymphoma, which restricts its use in the current study to  patients who have no 
further standard therapy available.

Protocol AFM13    
 
Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_388010], 2018  Page 53 of 88 
 In the Phase I study in relapsed or refractory  HL, treatment with AFM13 was well tolerated; 
AEs were mainly mild to moderate, with fever and chills being the most frequently reported 
events  [29, 34]. One patient in the 0.5 -mg/kg dose cohort developed a possibly drug -related  
grade 4 hemo lytic anemia . Preclinical data did not indicate increased risk of hemolytic anemia , 
but autoimmune hemolytic anemia  has been described in HL, in particular in patients with 
stages III and IV disease  [41]. There were n o signs of hemolytic anemia noted in other patients 
treated with AFM13, even at doses that were up to [ADDRESS_388011] treatment options  are available to them . Hence, there is  
a huge medical need for safe and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315227] . Therefore , it is 
not unreasonable to  conclude  that the benefit s may outweigh the risks, especially given the 
clinical experience with AFM13 in the previous Phase I trial in patients with heavily pre -treated 
relapsed or refractory HL  [29, 34].

10.[ADDRESS_388025]  
11.1  Identity of Study Treatment  
AFM13 is a bispecific tetravalent CD30/CD16A chimeric antibody (TandAb) developed for 
the treatment of CD30 -positi ve malignancies. It was developed to promote the recruitment of 
NK cells through the binding to CD16A, and through this engagement, the killing of 
CD30 -expressing tumors. AFM13 is being manufactured in compliance with Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations enforced by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA ). AFM13 was studied in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] I trial in patients with 
relapsed or refractory  HL, using a dose -escalation (3+3) design to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and determine the MTD [ 34].  
Affimed will supply AFM13 for IV infusion to the investigator as a sterile lyophilized solid  
powder  for reconstitution for infusion. Each 20 mL clear glass type I vial contains  10 mg 
AFM13. Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_315228]13 are listed in Table  3.  
IL-CSM  (Lörrach, [LOCATION_013]) , Affimed’s clinical supplies logistics partner,  will send the 
study drug to the responsible pharmacist at the trial center through a third party drug warehouse 
and distribution contractor approved by [CONTACT_941] U S government and/or the State of [LOCATION_001] for 
drug storage and distribution.  
One vial of study treatment contains 10 mg AFM13.

Storage and handling:  The investigational medicinal product AFM13 is stored at 2 -8°C: 
After preparation, the solution may be stored at 2 -8°C for a 
maximum of 24 hours before start of infusion . 
No special storage or handling instructions are required.  
The Quality Control Standards and requirements for the study medication are described in 
separate release protocols/Certificate of Analysis.  
 
11.2 Treatment Storage  
As described in Table  3, AFM13 is to be kept at 2 -8°C. After preparation , the solution may be 
stored at 2 -8°C for a maximum of [ADDRESS_388026] with no access for unauthorized 
personnel.  
 
11.3 Treatment Packaging and Labe ling 
Clinical trial supplies will be  provided in cartons containing single -use glass vials (20  mL vials) 
of lyophylized AFM13 for infusion (10 mg).  
All vials and secondary packaging will be labeled for the purpose of the clinical trial in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements . 
 
11.4 Preparation of Study Treatment  
The solid is to be reconstituted with 7.5 mL of sterile water for injection to give a total volume 
of 8 mL at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL AFM13, with a pH specification of 6.0 ±0.5 and 
isoosmolarity (300 ±50 mOsmol/kg). Det ails on the further dilution in sterile 0.9% saline to 
produce the final volume for infusion and the drug shipment and re -supply process are 
described in a separate Pharmacy Manual.  
For a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, a patient with a body weight of 70 kg receives an  absolute dose of 105 
mg AFM13 which is equivalent to 10.5 vials. The solution of these vials will be further diluted 
in sterile 0.9% saline to a final volume of [ADDRESS_388027] dose will be given over 4 
hours; if the first dose is well tolerated, the subsequent infusion periods may  be reduced by 
30 minutes per infusion to minimum infusion duration of 1 hour.  In cohort 3 weekly treatment 
will consists of a  loading AFM13 dose of 1 mg/kg to be applied on day1 as 1 -hour infusion, 
followed by a 6 mg/kg AFM13 as continuous infusion over 5 days.  Cohort 4 will use the same 
dosing schedule as cohorts 1 and 2.   
On Day 1 each treatment week, patients should receive p remedication with antihistamines ( e.g. 
4 mg dimetindene ) before AFM13 infusion start.  
Treatment should begin immediately after the patient has been enrolled  and in - and exclusion 
criteria are checked .  
All patients should receive at least one [ADDRESS_388028] to be 
documented in the patient’s CRF on each treatment day:  
• date of treatment  
• AFM13 dose  
• reason for tre atment delay or dose deviation (if applicable)  
• date and reason for early treatment termination (if applicable).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_388029] frequently observed with AFM13 in the Phase I trial included IRRs of 
mild or moderate severity. Infectious complications such as nasopharyngitis or pneumonia 
were  significantly less frequent and were probably related to prior heavy chem otherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Only 
one DLT, a hemolytic anemia CTCAE grade 4, was reported; the patient subsequently died 
due to aspergillus pneumonia and multi -organ failure which was not assessed as drug -related. 
No further cases of anemia were documented; neither were ot her relevant laboratory findings 
reported.  
 
12.5 Management of Infusion -related Reactions  
AFM13 should be administered with antihistamine (H1/H2 antagonists)  premedication as 
described in Section 11.5 
The management of IRRs is described in detail in Table 4  In the case of the manifestation of 
an IRR, the AFM13 infusion should be stopped and, dependent on the severity of the reaction, 
the t reating physician should decide about the application of an H1/H2  antagonist and 
corticosteroids. If fever or chills occur, the administration of acetaminophen is recommended. 
Dyspnea or hypertensive/hypotensive blood pressure dysregulation might require a n intensive 
care treatment. The AFM13 infusion can be continued as described in Section 11.[ADDRESS_388030] resolved.  Subjects in Cohort 4 may be dose reduced to 1.5 mg/kg if they encounter 
persistent IRRs at 4.5 mg/kg.

12.7 Study drug adjustments  
No study drug adjustment is permitted in the trial , except for the management of IRR as 
explained in Table 4. Adjustment in this case involves infusion rate . 
 
12.8 Treatment Schedule Interruptions (Delayed or Skipped Doses)  
The treatment with AFM13 should be interrupted, if an AE occurs according to  Table [ADDRESS_388035] be discontinued if a drug -related CTCAE Grade 4 AE occurs at any time.  
Patients who  discontinue study drug should be scheduled for an end -of-treatment (EoT) visit 
one week after the last dose of study drug, at which time all of the assessments listed for the 
EoS visit (Section 10.7) will be performed. A form should be completed, giving the date and 
reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. It is recommended to have these patients return for the 
Restaging Visit on what would have been their Week [ADDRESS_388036] -treatment safety evaluations, for tumor assessments and restaging (Section  10.6). 
If a new therapy is planned to be sta rted before Week 11 , the final restaging visit should be 
performed before administration of this therapy.  
 
12.10  Concomitant Therapy  
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing 
trial.  If there is a clinical i ndication for any medication specifically prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy may be required.  The final decision on any supportive 
therapy rests with the Principal I nvestigator in consultation with the patient and/or the patie nt's 
primary physician.

 All treatments considered necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the 
discretion of the Principal I nvestigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_315234].  All concomitant medication s will be recorded  on the CRF including all prescription s, 
over-the-counter (OTC)  medications , herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If 
changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
may also be included on the CRF. All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_388038] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded.   
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315235] a nd 
Treatment Phase of this trial with exception of the treatment of AEs occurring during the study:  
• antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy , including 
immunotherapy not specified in this protocol;  
• investigational agents other than AFM13;  
• radiation therapy;  
• systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from 
an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of 
physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved at the Principal 
Investigator’s discretion. However, chronic use of systemic steroids is not allowed. 
Note:  Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma.  
Patients who, in the asse ssment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Patients may receive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications that are prohibited on entry to this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315236].  
Treatment for IRRs is provided in Table 4 . Dependent on the symptoms and the severity of t he 
infusion -related reaction the additional application of acetaminophen, and 100 mg prednisone 
as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027]/or bronchodilators might be indicated.  
No drug interactions of AFM13 have been observed so far or are likely due of the biological 
nature of AFM13. The treating physician should carefully conduct a risk  assessment based on 
the severity of clinical symptoms, and prepare a high -risk patient for intensive care 
management in an intensive care unit (ICU).

13.6 Modified Severity -Weighted Assessment Tool  
The SWAT is an objective, quantitative, severity -weighted method to assess the extent of skin 
lesions. A SWAT score is derived by [CONTACT_315283] a percentage  of total body 
surface area (%TBSA) and multiplying it by a severity -weighting factor (1=patch, 2=plaque, 
4=tumor). All individual numbers are then added to produce a total score.

 The body is divided into 12 regions with percentage of total body surface ar ea (%TBSA) based 
on methodology used to assess burns. The extent of skin disease is assessed for each region 
and quantified by [CONTACT_139918]'s palm as a “ruler” to measure the %TBSA involvement 
within each region.  
Subject’s palm with [ADDRESS_388044] to fingertips, is 
1% of TBSA. Subject’s palm without fingers is 0.5% of TBSA.

viscera, GR score, and endpoints in MF and Sezary syndrome as outlined by [CONTACT_315286], the [LOCATION_002] Cutaneous 
Lymphoma Consortium, and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment  of Cancer in 2011  [36] and the Revised Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma [ 35]. 
 
13.7 Computerized Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
If CT with contrast medium was used for disease measurement for initial staging, then the same 
modality must be used for restaging. The imaging modality used to assess the stage of disease 
and the target lesions  used at baseline must be used again for response assessment , and for  
restaging.  Additional imaging technique may be used to diagnose a new lesion (i.e. CNS 
involvement) when deemed appropriate.  
The CT/MRI will be done per the facility’s stan dard procedures.

 The investigator will check the patient’s fasting blood glucose prior to the 18FDG -PET scan 
and ensure that the fasting blood glucose is below 200 mg/dL. The investigator should also 
ensure that the patient is able to lie down for 60 minutes.  
 
13.9 Exploratory Studies  
Exploratory analyses will be conducted on stored tissues and blood at a later time to investigate 
molecular profiling of the tumors using c ytogenetics (using fluorescence in situ hybridization 
or FISH), gene profiling by [CONTACT_315287] (NGS) or other molecular techniques.  
Finally, CTCs  will be analyzed at the same time points  as those for the analysis of the biological 
effects, and will  be determined during Cycle [ADDRESS_388046] a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with t he use of a medicinal (investigation al) product, 
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Adverse R eaction  
An adverse reaction is any detrimental and unintentional reaction to an investigational drug, 
independent of the administer ed dose.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, one that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  (Report if suspected that the patient wa s at substantial risk of 
dying at the time of the adverse event, or use or continued use of the device or other 
medical product might have resulted in the death of the patient. ) 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_315237]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_388047] is stated in the current version of the 
AFM13 IB, which is to be used as a reference.  
 
14.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a case in which the occurrence 
of a serious adverse reaction that could not be expected is suspected (there is a certain or 
possible relation to the administered protocol medication), and the nature and severity of this 
reaction do not correspond to the existing information on the respective investi gational drug. 
The reaction is rated as serious and a relation between the investigational drug and the reaction 
is considered to be possible. If the relation between adverse reaction and protocol medication 
is not evaluable or not evaluated, the relation is regarded as possible in context of the S[LOCATION_003]R. 
The existing information on the respective investigational drug can be found in the IB. 
 
14.4 Causality/Relationship  
For each event that occurs, an assessment of causality has to be performed.  
• Not Evaluable  
It is not possible to assess whether there is a relation with the administered 
investigational drug(s) or not . 
• Not Evaluated  
An event that was reported as AE, but for which a relation with the administered 
investigational drug(s) was not established at the time  of reporting because further 
data were necessary or is currently being compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602] . 
• No Relation  
An event on which there is sufficient information available to assume that there is 
no relation with the investigational drug.  
• Possible Relation  
Columbia University Medical Center   CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AFM13    
 
Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_388048] been caused by a number 
of other factors.  
• Probable Relation  
An event that follows a matching chronological course after administration of the 
investigational drug, or that follows a known or expected scheme of response to the 
suspect investigational drug, and that disappears after the administrati on is 
discontinued or reduced to a lower dose, and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_315288].  
• Certain Relation  
An event that follows a matching chronological course after administration of the 
investigational drug, or an event  due to which the concentration of the 
investigational drug in the body tissues or fluids is measured, that follows a known 
or expected scheme of response to the suspect investigational drug, and that 
disappears after the administration is discontinued or reduced to a lower dose and 
reappears after repeated exposure.  
 
14.5 Recording of Adverse Events  
For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the patient's condition, after signing 
the informed ICF and up to completion of the EOS  assessments  should  be considered an AE.  
Adverse events will be recorded the signing of informed consent until the EOS visit.  
Every grade 3/[ADDRESS_388049] be documented, independent of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_315238] a causative relation with therapy or not.  
Unexpect ed AEs are to be documented on the respective CRF form (AE form). Documentation 
includes the nature of the event, beginning, duration, intensity/stage and causality.  
All AEs have to be tracked until they have subsided or stabilized.  
All AEs that are not r ated as unexpected have to be documented.  
All ongoing AEs should be followed up for [ADDRESS_388050] administration of study drug, 
with the exception of any ongoing study drug -related AEs, which should be followed until 
resolution, unless in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE is unlikely to resolve due to the  patient's 
underlying disease. Any new SAEs occurring up to [ADDRESS_388051] administration of 
study drug should be reported to spm2 – safety projects & more GmbH , the Affimed  ‘s safety 
Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) according to Section  14.3 
At any time after the follow -up visit, if an investigator learns of an SAE that can be reasonably 
related to study drug, he/she should promptly notify the IRB/EC and FDA according to 
institutional and federal guidance, respectively. Affimed ’s safety CRO spm2 shall also be 
notified. The reports will be sent to

The investigator will assess the degree of severity as follows : 
• mild  
• moderate  
• severe  
• immediately life-threatening  
The evaluation is to be based on the official CTCAE version 4.0.  
It is important to distinguish b etween serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  14. 
An AE of severe intens ity need not nece ssarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that 
persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, 
a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild st roke but 
would be an SAE.  
For an AE to be a suspected drug -related event, there should be at least a reasonable possibility 
of a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
 
14.6 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting

becomes pre gnant on study, the pregnancy will be reported to appropriate parties. Reporting of 
pregnancy will follow the guidelines outlined in Section 14.3. 
 
14.10  Abnormal Laboratory Values/Vital Signs/Electrocardiograms  
Signs and symptoms as well as changes in the labor atory values should be documented in 
summary as one AE. Unusual laboratory values have to be assessed by [CONTACT_315289] – only if they are assessed to be relevant – they have to 
be documented as an AE. Changes in th e peripheral blood count are within the scope of this 
trial. Therefore, every grade 3/[ADDRESS_388063] a dministration of 
study drug an AE form and an SAE form should be completed, detailing the AE that resulted 
in the death (NB, death is an outcome, not an event). The SAE must be reported to the IRB 
according to institutional guidelines and FDA  within 24  hours. The report should contain a 
comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should 
assign main and contributory causes of death.  
 
14.12  Overdose  
Drug overdose should be reported in the same format and within the same timelines as an SAE, 
even if they may not result in an adverse outcome.  In the event of overdose, the patient should 
be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive  treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  
AFM13 overdose is defined as any dose administration where > 10% over 7 mg/kg is 
administered whether or not associated with an AE.

15.2 Sample Size and Power  
The planned total target accrual for this study is  15 subjects.  
As this study is of exploratory nature no formal sample size calculation is done. However based 
on the prior phase I study of AFM13, it is expected that approximately 7 8% of the patients will 
show biologi cal activity. Observing 12 patients out of 15 with biological response would lead 
to 95% exact binomial confidence interval of ( 52%, 96%). The lower bound of 52% is assumed 
to be sufficient for evidence of biological activity in this exploratory study.

Deviations  
As a compliance  measure the actual number of doses of AFM13 received will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_42376]. The reason for discontinuation of study treatment and study including study 
complete d as per protocol will be presented. Concomitant medication will be coded by [CONTACT_315292]. Patients with major protocol deviations as 
defined by [CONTACT_315293]. The safety set will be 
used. All data will be listed.  
 
15.6 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the s tudy is to evaluate the biological effects of AFM13 in tumor and 
peripheral blood. For this , NK immunophenotypic characterization, proliferation, density, 
activation and effector function (cytokin e production and release, ADCC)  will be measured  in 
peripher al blood. More importantly, intratumoral NK -cell infiltrate and density, phenotypic 
characterization, cytokine production and release will also be analyzed in the tumor. Similarly, 
T cells will be assessed for the same phenotype, activation and effector fu nction (including 
CTL) both in the peripheral blood and the tumor tissue. Finally, cancer cells will be studied for 
CD30 expression, immunological receptors  and other tumor markers . Other tumor resident 
immune cells will also be characterized (myeloid -derived suppressor cells, Tregs). Details of 
immunological and biological studies to be conducted in this protocol appear in the 
Immunobiology Research Manual.  
These endpoints  will be assessed by [CONTACT_315294]. Mean, 
standard devi ation, median and range will be calculated for continues measurements, frequency 
and percentages for categorical data.  Correlation of biological and clinical outcome will be 
assed graphically. Non -parametric tests for change over time such as the Friedman -test and the 
signed rank test might be facilitated, however no adjustment for multiplicity is planned. All 
data will be listed. Only patients in the safety set that have also complete d cycle [ADDRESS_388071] 
biopsies obtained at 2 scheduled time point s for biopsy collection will be assessed and 
presented. No imputation of missing values is planned.

 16 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION  
Source data is all information contained in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_1930], observations or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents, which may include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory reports, memoranda, subjects’ diaries, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, radiology and other ancillary service  reports, subject files, patient visit notes, 
encounter forms, operative notes, patient medication diaries and electronic medical records.  
 
For FDA -regulated trials, adequate and accurate source documentation is required. According 
to 21 CFR 312.62(b), an  investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate case histories that record all observations and other data pertinent to the 
investigation on each individual administered the investigational drug or employed as a 
control in the inves tigation. Case histories include the CRFs and supporting data including, 
for example, signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, 
progress notes of the physician, the individual’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s) and the nurses’ notes. The 
case history for each individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to 
participation in the study.  
 
 
CRCs must provide direct access to source data and documents for trial -related monitoring, 
audits, IRB reviews and regulatory inspect ion.  
 
 
Columbia University Medical Center   CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AFM13    
 
Protocol Version  1.[ADDRESS_388076] of the Study  
Columbia University Medical Center (Sponsor)  shall implement and maintain quality control 
and quality assurance procedures with written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure 
that the study is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance 
with the protocol, Internat ional Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use  (ICH) Good Clinical Practice  (GCP ) and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(October  1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with FDA regulations [US Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR ), Sections  312.50 and 312.56 ] and with ICH GCP 
(CPMP  135/95).  
The investigator may not deviate from the protocol w ithout a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by [CONTACT_4215], except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazards to the subject or when the change involves only logistical or 
admini strative aspects of the study. Any deviations may result in the subject having to be 
withdrawn from the study and render that subject non -evaluable.  
 
17.[ADDRESS_388077], 2018  Page 82 of 88 
 17.5 Protocol Deviations /Violations  
All deviations from and violations of Columbia policies or IRB determinations, including 
departures from the requirement for adherence to the approved protocol, must be reported to 
the IRB.  
 
A protocol deviation is defined as a variation from the approved  protocol for one subject or to 
address a temporary situation that is identified by [CONTACT_315298].  
 
A protocol violation is defined as a variation from the approved protocol that was 
implemented without pr ospective approval by [CONTACT_315299]. Protocol violations may be considered noncompliance with the 
federal regulations and institutional policies for the protection of the IRB  Noncompliance 
Policy apply.  
 
Requests for Protocol Deviations should be submitted to the IRB via the Modification 
module in Rascal as soon as the study team becomes aware of the need for the deviation. 
When applicable, the sponsor’s concurrence (e.g., that an individual who does not  meet 
eligibility criteria may be enrolled) should be provided with the submission. The IRB 
recognizes that some deviations regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria are identified shortly 
before the subject is scheduled for randomization or entry into the st udy and that a quick 
review by [CONTACT_315300]. In time -sensitive situations, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_315243]/her submission to the IRB with an e -mail outside of Rascal to the Manager of the 
IRB that the approved the study. Please note that rep eated Protocol Deviation requests related 
to eligibility suggest that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_315244].  
 
If a Protocol Violation is unanticipated, at least possibly related to the research, and involves 
risks to subjects or others, it should be reported to the IRB within one week (5 business days) 
via an Unanticipated Problem (UP) report in Ra scal. Protocol violations related to medication 
dose errors should also be submitted as a UP whether the error involves an over - or under -
administration of medication. If the error occurred within NYP, the situation should be 
discussed with the subject, in  accordance with the underlying philosophy of NYPs Disclosure 
Policy (Policy #E145); discussion with the subject may also be appropriate for medication 
dose errors that occur outside of NYP in clinical studies under the purview of the IRB.  
 
Violations oth er than UPs of the rights or welfare of subjects, negatively affect the integrity 
of the study, or require a change to the protocol or consent document(s) are considered to be 
major violations and require prompt reporting to the IRB as a Modification.  
 
Minor violations are violations that are not UPs and do not meet the criteria to be considered 
major violations. These should be reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review, in a 
list or log that includes all UPs, deviation or major violation were  made.  
 
The description of the circumstances surrounding the deviation or violation should be clearly 
stated in the UP, in the summary section of the Modification Information Form or in the 
Renewal Form, as applicable.  
The following information should be  included:

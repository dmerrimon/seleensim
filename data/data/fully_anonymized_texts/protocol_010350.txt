Since our 2018 study, Carrot Inc. (Redwood City, CA, [LOCATION_003])  has made improvements to 
the CO breath sensor (the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644] ). The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280439] a  
stand -alone  handheld breath sensor  to measure CO in exhaled breath  with a display screen 
to show results . This breath sensor  can optionally be used with  a smartphone app  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280440] ). The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280441] a personal and mobile 
product and to be available ‘over the counter’. In April 2019, a revised Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280442] 510 (k) 171408 . 
There is anecdotal evidence that people can effectively use the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280443] e changes in their attitudes and behavior such as motivation to 
quit and reduction in cigarettes , respectively . A goal the present study is to measure these 
changes in attitudes and behavior in participants using the  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280444], 
without a complementary  programmat ic smartphone app . 
2.2 STUDY  RATIONALE  
The study duration is 84 days with a focus on assessment of  participant  use of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280445] .

 2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 Known Potential Risks  
There are minimal  anticipated risks or harms to the participant .  Risks include breach 
of confidentiality should a data breach occur, and parti cipant anxiety related to using 
the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280446] a day. We, the  study sponsor (Carrot Inc.)  
compl y with HIPAA and state  this in our privacy and terms of use on our website. As 
such, we adhere to HIPAA’s Breach Notification Rule should a data breach occur. We 
take careful measur es to prevent a data breach including use of encryptions, secure 
connections, and limited  access to data  (see section 10.1 “Data Collection and 
Confidentiality ”). Regarding the risk of participant anxiety related to using the dev ice 
multiple times a day,  while there are suggested breath sampling pa tterns provided 
during the screen ing call and with the breath sensor, participants will ultimately 
sample at their discretion.  No medical decisions are made base d on study data . 
 Known Potential Benefits  
While we do not anticipate that participant s will receive any benefit from their 
participation in this s tudy, it is possible that some participants  may experience an 
increased awareness of their smoking behavior.  It is possible this awareness and new 
information on how much carbon monoxide is in their body may help a participant 
quit smoking.  
 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Given the non -invasive nature of the breath sampling and the data collection, there are 
minimal  anticipated risks . These risks  relate  to breach of confidentiality in the 
circumstance of a data br each, and possible participant a nxiety related to using the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280447] a day. These risks have been mitigated to the 
exten t possible through data protection measures and through enabling participants to 
ultimately decide if and whe n they do breath s amples. Participants will have the 
remote support of study staff and customer support as they need over the cours e of th e 
study. Participants  are not asked  to change their smoking behavior.  No medical 
decisions are made based on study data.  
 OBJECTIVES  
We aim  to measure participants’ use of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280448] ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644] , Carrot  
Inc.; Redwood City, CA, [LOCATION_003]; 510(k) number: K171408 ) and to non-invasively measure  
their carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the ir exhaled breath.  There will be a focus to  assess 
changes in attitudes towards quitting smoking and changes in smoking behavior over the 
course of  the 84-day stud y, as well as  participant feedback on the set -up, use experience, 
impact and commercialization of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644] .

6.[ADDRESS_342132] RECRUITMENT , INFORMED CONSENT  AND ENROLLMENT  
Subjects will be recruited  in the United State s through web media (e.g. Facebook, Google 
Ads)   and/or via a clinical recruiter . Potential participants will be  asked to 
provide contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone number, email address), and answer questions on 
demographics (gender, age , employment status, location via city and state ), smartphone 
ownership  and smoking behavior using the Online Screening Form  
or through the clinical research recruiter, if applicable. Study staff will review each 
potential participant’s responses to the eligibility questions. Poten tial subjects may also  
convey their interest in participating in the study by [CONTACT_182755] t o outreach from the 
clinical recruiter . 
All study participants will undergo a screening phone call where they will be asked  
questions to confirm study eligibility  . Potential participants will be called  
on a first -come -first-serve d basis with  nonproportional quota sampling enrollment 
guidelines applied.  During this call, study personnel will inform the potential participant  
of the study details and will answer any questions. Eligible participants who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate in  the study.  
Potential subjects will then determine if they would like to proceed with registration , and 
if so, study personnel will email the potential subject  an electronic Informed Consent 
Form   The potential subject will have ample time to read the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) and the opportunity to ask questions. The subject  will sign the 

Carrot Inc.   
 Document No.   
 
 electronic ICF before participating in this study.  Once signing the ICF, the subject will be 
given a unique  identifier to protect subject privacy. Participation in this research is 
voluntary. Participants may discontinue participation at any  time without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which they are otherwise entitled . Participants  may choose to exit the study at 
any time.  They are not required to complete the study if they choose to stop . 
Participants will be considered enrolled after compl eting the following 4 tasks: 
electronically signing the informed consent form, pairing their breath sensor to the Sensor -
Only app on their smartphone, giving their first breath sample, and completing the 
Baseline Questionnaire.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_342133] STIPEND  
Participant s are compensated for doing breath samples (up to $ 220), completing the online 
questionnaires  (up to $2 20 in total for 7 questionnaires)  and for returning the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280462]  ($50) . Participant s will be compensated up to $ 490 in total. Compensation will be 
in the form of Visa gift cards that are mailed to their provided address. Payments will be 
bundled as depi[INVESTIGATOR_280463] 5 
payments over the course of the study . Bundled p ayments will be processed upon 
completion of the item (s) for which the participant is receiving payment and will take 2 -3 
weeks to arrive to the part icipant after being ordered.   
6.6 SAMPLE SIZE AND JUSTIFICATION  
This study will enroll up to 220 participants. Consideration for the sample size included 
powering the study to observe a clinical ly meaningful change from baseline for the 
primary and secondary e ndpoints using 80% power at a statistical significance of  P < 
0.05. The primary endpoint utilized prelimina ry data from a similar 37 participant pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]. Data at the 14 -day time point showed 31%, 66% and 3% of participants had 
increased, unchanged and decreased Stage of Change , respectively , from baseline. To 
detect  a statistically significant change in the se proportions requires enrolling 50 
participants.   
 
The estimated proportion of participants achieving  ≥ 1 quit attempt is 25% based on 
interim resu lts from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   Based on the median prevalence of 65.4% for past -
year quit attempts in the gener al population [13], the average monthly quit attempt rate is 
approximately 5%. To show that a proportion of 25% of participants making a quit 
attempt  by [CONTACT_4475] 28 is statistically different from 5% will require n=16.  
 
Finally, literature indicates approximate ly 1% of the general population [14 -18] and 2 -5% 
of individuals in cigarette reduction studies [19, 20] will reduce their CPD by ≥ 50% on a 
monthly b asis. Assuming that 10% of participants in the present study reduce their CPD 
by ≥ 50% by [CONTACT_4475] 28, the prese nt study will require n=185 to show a difference from 5%. 
Taking these analyses into consideration along with expected attrition, the present study 
will enroll up to 220 participants.

 completed by [CONTACT_280480] -Only app 
(participant breath sensor usage and CO values of breath sa mples) . CRFs will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_280481] . Access to 
electronic CRFs  will be limited to necessary study personnel. Study data will be kept in a 
secure database by [CONTACT_093]. This database wi ll be accessible only by [CONTACT_280482]. The database will not contain personal identifying information; all 
subject data in th e database will be associated with study identification numbers. The data 
will be kept for  a minimum of  5 years .  The data  shall be retained for a maximum period 
of time that is equivalent to the design and expected life of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280471]'s (Carrot Inc.) existence, whichever is the shortest  of 
the two.   
 
Data on the breath sensor will be accessed with an app customized for  this study. This 
Sensor -only app is our commercially available app with select func tion disabled. The app 
to be used in this study will request location permissions in order to complete the 
Bluetooth scanning and pairing process with the sensor. Other fea tures to access 
functionality (e.g camera, microphone) are disabled for this study. With regard to the 
information we will collect, we, the study sponsor, associate each logged in user to a user 
Id that is a unique identifier which is generated randomly on  accou nt creation. We will 
periodically synchronize logs from the sensor and upload them based on this user_Id only. 
The breath samples we collect only contain information regarding: Sample Id, Sample 
Type, SampleValue, Sample Time. When we upload this inf ormati on, the only additional 
information included would be the App build informatio n and user’s Sensor ID. We 
comply with HIPAA and state this in our privacy and terms of use on our website. As such 
we adhere to HIPAA’s Breach Notification Rule should a d ata br each occur. We take 
careful measures to prevent a data breach including use of  encryptions, secure 
connections, and limited access to data.  
10.[ADDRESS_342140] will be used for numerical data. Fisher’s Exact or Chi square 
tests will be used for categorical data.  Analyses will be conducted to calculate mean (SD) 
for normal ly distributed variables for actual data or mean (SE) for modeled data and 
median (interquartile range) values in instances of non -normally distributed variables.  
McNemar test will be used for 2 -category match -paired data. Cohen kappa statistic will  be 
used for 3 -category match -paired data. To evaluate changes in attitudes or cigar ettes 
smoked per day over time, repeated measures linear mixed model analyses will be 
performed using a compound symmetric correlation matrix to model the repeated 
measures  withi n subjects. To make specific comparisons across time, F statistics will be 
computed using the results from the model . Statistical significance is set at P<.05.  
Analyses for the outcomes will be evaluated for only those who complete the survey (i.e. 
comple ter) and assessed to take into account missing data. To be included in any 
completer analysis the participant must provide a baseline response and the outcome 
response. For outcomes that are missing data , these will be assessed pending the data type.

 For c ategorical data, the last response post -baseline will be carried forward for t he day [ADDRESS_342141], the data will be conside red 
unchanged from baseline.  Numerical data will use linear mixed modeling.  
All devi ations from the study protocol will be identified, recorded and analyzed.   
 
10.3 STUDY REPORT  
A final study r eport will be produced at the end of the study; PowerPoint format is

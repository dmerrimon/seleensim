Study Title
A Phase 3b, multicenter, open -label study  to evaluate the immune response to,and the safet y of,
vaccines in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosi s who receive oral ozanimo d 
compared to non -pegylate d interferon (IFN)-βor no disease modifying therapy .
Indication
Relapsing forms of mult iple sclerosis
Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerat ive disease of the central 
nervous system  (CNS) characterized by [CONTACT_874888], demyelinat ion, neuronal and 
oligodendrocy te loss, and disrupt ion of the blood -brain barrier, leading to irreversible defici ts in 
physical funct ion and cognit ion and an impaired qualit y of life(Lassmann, 2019). T he prevalence 
of MS is increasing and is current ly estimated to affect 2.3 millio n individuals worldwide (Multiple 
Sclerosis International Foundat ion, 2013 ).
Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, whi ch binds with high affinit y 
select ively to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P1 and S1P5). Ozanimod 
causes lymphocy te retention in lympho id tissues. The mechanism by [CONTACT_874889] c effects in MS is unknown but may involve reduct ion of lymphocyte migrat ion into the 
CNS (Scott, 2016; Chaudry, 2017). Ozanimod is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of 
multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults in the [LOCATION_002] (US)and for the treatment of adult subjects 
withrelapsing- remitt ing MS (RRMS )with active d isease as defined by [CONTACT_874890]  (EMA) j urisdict ions.
Based on itsmechanism of action ozanimod has the potenti al to reduce the immune response to
vaccinations ; however, the effect of ozanimod on vaccination response has not been measured. 
Because many subjects with MS receive disease modifying therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014](DMT) chronically and 
receive vaccinat ions while being treated with DMT s, the effect of ozanimod on the vaccinat ion 
response of MS subjects is of interest to patients and prescribers. This study  will evaluate the 
immune response to vaccines in subjects wi th RMS taking ozanim od com paredtoRMS subjects 
not taking ozanimod . 
The vaccines chosen to inve stigate in this study  allow f or the assessment of the hum oral immune 
response and are of clinical relevance to MS populations. 
Objectives
Primary Objective

Date 29NOV 2022 171 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 MS Disease Background 
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosi s (MS) is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory  demyelinat ing disease of the 
Central  Nervous System  (CNS ). The disease is characterized patho logically  by [CONTACT_874897] a, demyelinat ion, andoligodendrocy te and neuronal 
loss. Acute inflammatory lesio ns are initiated by [CONTACT_874898] a breached blood -brain barrier (Lucchenetti, 2000; Popescu, 2012; Lassmann 2007,
Lassman, 2019; Frisher, 2015 )
The prevalence of MS is increasing and is currently  estimated to affect 2.3 millio n individuals 
worldwide (Multiple Sclerosis Internat ional Foundat ion, 2013 ). In Europe (EU) , the highest  
prevalence of MS occurs in countri es with high latitude, including Sweden (188.9 per 100,000), 
Norway  (203 per 100,000), and Denmark (232 per 100,00 0) (Ahlgren, 2011; Grytten, 2015; Koch -
Henriksen, 2015 ). Estimates that 300,[ADDRESS_1221728] MS in the [LOCATION_002]
(US) are based largely on revisio nsof estimates from  older data (Baum, 1981; Anderson, 1992; 
Evans, 2013 ).  In an algorithm applied to private, military, and public Administrative Health 
Claims datasets, t he estimated [ADDRESS_1221729] 
been as high as 913,925 in 2017 (Wallin, 2019 ).The median age at onset is approximately 30 years 
of age and there is a consistent, 3:1 female to male ratio ( McKay, 2015; Ribbo ns, 2015 ).
Relapsing MS(RMS) has an initial presentati on of an acute attack which accounts for the initial 
presentation ofapproximately 85% of all subjects withMS (Confavreux, 2003; Reich , 2018 ). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_157696] s include numbness and weakness in the legs leadi ng to difficult y walking, visio n 
loss, incoordination, cogni tive dysfunct ion, fatigue,and pain. Almost half of relapses may resul t 
in incomplete recovery  of function and leave permanent disabilit y and impairment that 
accumulates over time ( Lublin, 2003). 
There are several Disease Modifying Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (DMTs )available for the treatm ent of MS with 
different mechanisms ofaction and differentiated efficacy  and safet y profiles. These include (1) 
the first-approved DMT s (interferon [IFN] β-1a, IFN β-1b, glatiramer acetate [GA]), (2) oral 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (fingo limod, siponim od, ozanimod, dimethyl fumarate, terifluno mide, and cladribine), 
and (3) monoclonal ant ibodies (alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatum umab, andnatalizumab ).
1.2 Com pound Background 
Ozanimod 
Ozanimod is approved for the treatment of RMS in adults in the US and for the treatm ent of adult 
subjects with relapsing -remitt ing multip le sclerosis (RRMS )with active disease as defined by 
[CONTACT_874899] ( EMA )jurisdict ions.
Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, which binds with high affinit y 
select ively to sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptor subt ypes 1 and 5 (S1P1 and S1P5). This leads to 
reversible sequest ration of  lymphocy tes in lymphoid tissues. The mechanism by [CONTACT_874900]

migration into the CNS (Scott, 2016; Chaudry, 2017) . 
Ozanimod was evaluated in two large, rando mized, double -blind, double -dummy , parallel -group, 
active controlled clinical trials o f similar design and endpo ints, in subjects with RMS. SUNBEAM 
was a 1-year study  with subjects continuing assigned treatm ent beyo nd month [ADDRESS_1221730] completed the study  (Comi, 2019 ). RADIANCE was a 2-year study (Cohen, 
2019 ).The active comparator was IFN β-1a 30 µg intramuscularly (IM) once a week in both 
studi es.The primary endpo int, annualized relapse rate (ARR) ,was met for ozanimod [ADDRESS_1221731] ically significant ly(p < 0.0001) lower 
adjusted ARR was observed for ozanimod 1 mg(0.181; [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.140, 
0.236]) compared with IFN-β-1a (0.350 ; [95% CI:0.279 , 0.440 ]), corresponding to a 48.2% 
reducti on in ARR over 12+ months. In Study  RPC01 -201B, a statistically significant ly (p < 
0.0001) lower adjusted ARR was observed for the ozanim od 1 mg group (0.172; [95 % CI :0.142, 
0.208]) compared with the IFN-β-1a group (0.276; [95% CI:0.234, 0.324] ), corresponding to a 
37.7% reduction in ARR over 24 months . Keysecondary endpo ints of new or enlarging T2 lesio ns 
and the number of gadolinium -enhancing (GdE) lesions were met for ozanimod 1mg versus IFN
β-1a. 
The safet y profile of ozanimod iswell-characterized bya phase 2 and two large phase 3 studi es
and their ongoing open label exten sion and isconsistent with the known safet y profile of S1P 
modulators ([COMPANY_001] Pharmaceut icals Corporati on, 2010; 2019 ). Treatment initiation with S1P 
receptor modulators  resultsin a transient, dose-dependent brady arrhy thmia in both healthy 
subjects and in subjects with RMS mediated through the S1P1 receptor in hu mans (Gergely, 2009; 
Horga, 2010 ; Juif, 2016; Scott, 2016 ). Ozanimod treatm ent requi res a dose escalati on regimen at 
treatment initiation, to minimize transient reduction in heart rate (Celgene Corporation, 2020).
IFN-β 
Interferons are naturally  occurring proteins produced by [CONTACT_874901]. The type I family of int erferons includes the IFN -βs, which are used to
treat MS; however, the mechanism of action of IFN-β in the treatm ent of MS isnotcompletely 
understood .
After the Interferon Beta Study Group demonstrated IFNβ-1b efficacy ( INFB SG, 1993 ), the drug 
was approved for the treatment of RMS in the USalmo st 30years ago andis approved for the 
treatm ent of RRMS in EMA jurisdictions . Forms of IFN-βfor the treatment of MS include IFNβ-
1a (administered IM once per week or subcutaneously [SC] 3 times per week) and IFN β-1b 
(administered SC every other day ).
Tdap
In this study BOOSTRIX®, a booster vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid

Date 29NOV 2022 19TheCenters for Disease Control (CDC) in the US recommends receiving the Tdap vaccine ever y 
10 yearsfor adults , ormore frequent lyif clinically  indicated . The Tdap vaccine can be safet y 
administered at the same time as other vaccines. Addi tional informat ion about the tetanus vaccine 
can be found at https:// www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap -tdap-td/hcp/index.html .  The World 
Health Organizat ion (WHO) currently recommends primary vaccinat ion against tetanus during 
childhood administering 3-[ADDRESS_1221732] 2 years of life, followed by 
[CONTACT_874902] 10 -20 years ( Weinberger, 2017). MostEuropean 
countri es followthe WHO recommendat ions.For example, in [LOCATION_013] , the Tdap vaccine is 
recommended every [ADDRESS_1221733] diphtheria and pertussis ( https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_874861]/Archiv/2019/

PPSV23
In this study  the PNEUMOVAX23®vaccine will be used. PNEUMOVAX23®is a sterile, liquid 
vaccine consist ing of a  m ixture of purified capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus 
pneumo niae t ypes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 
20, 22F, 23F, and 33F) ([COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc, 1983 ).  Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPSV23) contains antigens to [ADDRESS_1221734] 80-90% 
of capsular seroty pes causing disease (Daniels, 2016).  The CDC recommends routine PPSV23 in 
all adults 65 years and older and in adults 19 through 64 years of age with certain medical 
condi tions. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneum o/hcp/index.html.)   In [LOCATION_013], PPSV23 
vaccine is recommended in adults ≥ 60 years of age and in adul ts wi th chronic diseases including 
neuro logical diseases (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_874861]/Archiv/2019/ Ausgaben/

recommandat ions/34_2017_engl.pdf?__blo b=publicat ionFile ). Addit ionally, routine booster 
vaccination for the PPSV23 vaccine can be considered in immunoco mpromised and at-risk 
subjects with repeat vaccinat ions of intervals o f at least [ADDRESS_1221735] e 6 months and older shoul d receive a licensed age -appropriate 
influenza vaccine each year at the start of the influenza season. Vaccinat ion is particularly 
important in subjects who are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_874862]. These subjects 
include thosewith neuro logic condit ions and subjects requiring chronic medicat ions that suppress 
the immune system . The CDC recommends that the influenza vaccine is administered by [CONTACT_874903]; h owever, getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial and vaccinat ion should 
continue to be offered throughout the influenza season (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/v
pd/flu/hcp/index.ht ml.)
In Europe , the seasonal  influenza vaccine is recommended in all individuals older than 6 months 
of age with certain chronic diseases. Administratio nof a tetravalent vaccine is recommended 
before the influenza season begins (World Heal th Organizat ion, 2021 ).

multiple vaccines in MS subjects, providing no evidence that receiving multip le vaccinat ions is 
unsafe for MS subjects (Ufer, 2017; Bar -Or, 2020 ; Ciotti, 2020 )
1.3.2 Ratio nale to Study Vaccine Response in Ozanimod Subjects
Persons with MS shoul d receive vaccinations to avoid preventable diseases (Reyes ,2020; Riva ,
2021). In persons with MS not receiving immunotherapy , the disease itself does not appear to 
affect the abilit y of individuals to mount an immune response to antigenic stimulat ion,and the 
vaccine response is similar to those who do not have MS ( Moriabadi , 2001 ). Infect ions may trigger 
MS relapses, increase MS radio logic and immuno logic act ivity, and accelerate disease progression 
(Pannitch, 1994; Buljevac ,2002; Correale ,2006; Farez, 2019). Multiple sclerosi s subjects
receiving immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_874863],
including pneumococcal pneum onia and influenza infect ion, which carry the potenti al to cause 
significant morbidity and mortalit y in individuals with chronic debilitat ing diseases (De Keyser, 
1998 ; Noseworthy , 2000 ).The vaccines administered in this study  have not been associated wi th 
an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_874864] ,with an increased ri sk of relapse ,or wi th an increased ri sk of 
MS disease activit y in MS subjects; however, MS subjects are not recommended to receive 
vaccines during a relapse (Confavreux, 2001; Farez, 2019; DeStefano, 2003; Loebermann , 201 3). 
The availabili ty of vaccine immune response and safet y data insubjects treated with ozanim od 
will help guide practit ioners onthe impact of ozanimod on vaccine responses in MS subjects .
1.3.[ADDRESS_1221737]-vaccination compared to placebo
(Boul ton, 2012; Kappos, 2015 ).Healthy volunteers treated with siponim od met seroprotective 
criteria similar to those in other treatm ent groups toinfluenz a after vaccination, buttiter ratios 
were generally  lower in siponim odgroup s (Ufer, 2017 ).
Non-pegylated IFN-βs in MS subjects produce immune responses comparable to control s and do
not reduce response to vaccinat ion (Schwid , 2005 ; Olberg 2014 ;Bar-Or, 2013; von Hehn, 2017 ).

not consistent across studies, andIFN-β has not proven to be a vaccine adjuvant (Toporovski , 
2010; Rizza, 2011; Ye, 2019 ).Pegylated IFN-β has not been studied for effect on vaccine response
in MS subjects .
Ocrelizumab demonstrated asignificant ly reduce dimmune response to several vaccines with 
some subjects not achieving seroprotection (Bar-Or, 2020 ). Both dimethyl fumarate and 
terifluno mide showed no si gnificant differences in response rates; similarly , natalizumab -treated 
subjects showed no significant differences in ant igen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)response, 
but generally had lower titers, leading to an inadequate response in so me su bjects ( von Hehn, 
2017; Bar -Or, 2013; Kaufman, 2014). Glatiramer acetate vaccine studies show mixed results on 
immune response (Olberg 2014 ; Olberg, 2018 ).
1.3.[ADDRESS_1221738]-vaccinat ion immune responses to MS subjects
receiving no DMT (Olberg , 2014 ; Olberg, 2018; Mehling, 2013 )and subjects on IFN -βs have been 
successfully used as control s in other MS DMT vaccine response studi es (Bar-Or, 2013 ; Olberg ,
2020; Von Hehn, 2018 ).  Mult iple vaccines administered during a single visit are well established 
in children and recommended for adults as safe, tolerable, andare not likely to reduce immune 
response ( King, 1994 ; Broderi ck, 2016 ; Ferlito, 202 1). Open -label designs areacceptable to assess 
the effects of immune modulat ing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_874865] m anufacturers to 
assess vaccine immunogenicit y (Schwid, 2005; Bar-Or, 2013; Olberg, 2018; Von Hehn, 2018 ). 
Laboratory  studies, including the immuno logical correl ates that assess the humoral response to 
vaccines (eg,serum  antibody  concentrati ons or antibody  titers) provide object iveassessment sof 
vaccine response assubst itute endpoints for longer term studies that measure clinical protective 
effect (Madore, 2010 ). Thespecific laboratory  criteria used to establish vaccine immunogenicit y 
is vaccine dependent .  In general, vaccine responses are assessed by[CONTACT_874904]-vaccinatio n
to pre-vaccinat ion antibody  levels and by [CONTACT_874905] a minimu m 
thresho ld for seroprotection oran increase in ant ibody  titers/concentrations to produce a serol ogic 
response (WHO, 2013 ). The laboratory  criteria used in this study  arebased onguideline 
recommendat ions and correlates of humoral immunit y (EMA, 1997; Qin, 2007; FDA, 2007; 
Plotkin, 2008 ). To mitigate thedifferences in the recruited subject populat ion, this study  will define 
eligibilit y criteria to reduce potential confounding variables affect ing immune response to
vaccination. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_91184]-defined eligibilit y criteria, to account forpotential confounders that
couldaffect immune response s,serol ogical response criteria will be compared based on a model 
adjusting for appropriate factors (eg,age, sex, body  mass index [BMI ], and baseline absol ute 
lymphocy te count [ ALC ]).

discontinued any S1P modulator due to associated lymphopenia can have an ALC <0.5 x 109/Lon 
steady state ozan imodor in the control group prior toDay 1.This thresho ld corresponds to 
approximately  the 25thpercent ile of ALC levelsobserved in the ozanim od pi[INVESTIGATOR_71798] .Subjects

have been perform ed after being on ozanimod for a minimum of

enrolled who discont inued an S1P modulator due to associa ted lymphopenia must have an ALC ≥ 
0.5 x 109/Lwithin [ADDRESS_1221740] through different immune response pathways. Both T cell -dependent and T cell -
independent humoral responses will be assessed in this study . 
Tdap
The tetanus toxoi d com ponent of Tdap , whi ch has rem ained unchanged over time, has been used
consistent ly in trials with other DMTs, including fingo limod, and serves a “benchmark” 
vaccination (
Boulton, 2012 ; Kappos, 2015 ). Vaccinat ionagainst tetanus is recommended on a 
recurring 10-year basis except following certain potenti al exposures to Clostridium tetani or its 
toxoi d (CDC , 2020 
; 
STIKO , 2017 ). The inact ivated tetanus toxoid is apepti de antigen thatinduces 
a T-cell dependent response (Lesinski, 2 001
; 
Przedpelski
, 2020 ). Mos tindividuals inthe USand 
Germ anyhave been vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (Poethko -Muller, 2013 
; 
Williams, 2016
). The
tetanus vaccine is commo nly administered in adult s as a booster vaccine along with pertussis and 
diphtheria vaccines and can be administered as early as 1 year after previous vaccination as well 
as safely administered at the same time as other vaccines (Halperin 2006 
;

Detailed methodology  for summary  and stati stical analyses o f the data collected in this study  will 
be docum ented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034]. 
9.1 Overview
This is a non-rando mized, open -label study  in which all subjects remain on their pre-study 
(baseline) treatm ent per protocol. Subjects will be recrui ted by [CONTACT_874895].  The statistical 
analyses will focus on estimat ing immune response rates, adjust ing for baseline subject -level 
characterist ics.No formal statist ical hypothesis is evaluated . To mit igate for potential differences 
in the recrui ted subject popul ation in the ozanimod and non -ozanim od arm s that potenti allycould 
affect immune response ,response rates will be estimated based on a logistic regressio n model 
adjusting forseveral factors, eg,age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and baseline absolute 
lymph ocyte coun t (ALC). The resul ts of the statistical analyses for immune response endpo ints 
will be summarized for subjects receiving ozanimod (ozanimod arm) and subjects not receiving 
ozanimod (non-ozanim od arm) as their standard of care disease modifying therapy  for MS.
Analyses of safety will be summarized by [CONTACT_874935]-ozanim od arm s.

The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populat ion consists of all subjects who received at least one 
vaccination and summarized according to their initial treatm ent status (ozanimod vs. non-
ozanimod) regardless of systemic use of cortico steroi ds.
The per-protocol (PP) populat ion consists of all subjects who received the correctly  assigned 
vaccinations, had no steroid use, and did not receive any other vaccines through out the study .

expected that approximately 60% of the subjects not receiving ozanim od as standard of care 
therapy  will have a serol ogic response to vaccinat ion with Tdap (Kappos, 2015 ). 
With a sample size of 30 subjects for the ozanimo d arm, assumin g the response rate is 45%, the 
expected half width of the 95% confidence interval (based on normal approximat ion) is 
approximately  0.175.We note that in simulat ions (assuming a true response rate of 0.45), the 
estimated response rate falls within 0.267 and 0.633 among 95% of the simulated trials(across 
100,000 simulat ions).

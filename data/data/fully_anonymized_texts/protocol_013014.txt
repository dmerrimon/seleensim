Clinical Research  Consent Summary
You are  being asked to join a research study. You do not have to join the study.  Even if you 
decide to join now, you can change your mind later.
If you  decide to join, you will be asked to sign a consent form, which shows you give permission 
to be in the study, and an authorization form, which shows you give permission for us to use 
and disclose (release) your health information for the study.
1. The  purpose of this study is to learn more about pain control after surgery performed for
scoliosis.
2. In  this study, we will learn about a drug called gabapentin.  Gabapentin will be called
“the study drug” throughout this form.  We want to learn
a. If  using the study drug decreases the amount of pain felt by [CONTACT_29583];
b. If  using the study drug decreases the amount of narcotic medication needed to
control pain after scoliosis surgery;
c. If  using the study drug improves the satisfaction of the family regarding pain
control;
d. If  the study drug is safe; and
e. What  side effects, if any, are caused by [CONTACT_5257].
3. We  do not know if the study drug works.
4. The  study drug has not been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for
this particular indication.
5. The  study drug is a tablet taken just prior to surgery and then every eight hours for the
four days after surgery.
6. You  will have a 50/[ADDRESS_28824] prior to your
surgery. We will continue to track opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444], pain scale ratings, and sedation ratings
during your entire time in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. You will be asked to complete a survey at the time
of discharge to evaluate your satisfaction with control of pain after surgery.
8. There  are risks involved in participating in the study, some of which may be very serious.
These risks include allergic reaction, emotional instability, hostility, confusion, and
restlessness. Gabapentin may also cause temporary dizziness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and other
symptoms and signs of decreased consciousness. Other potential risks are listed below.

Clinical Research  Consent and Authorization Form
TITLE: Pain  Control in Pediatric Posterior Spi[INVESTIGATOR_29571]: The Effect of Gabapentin on 
Post-operative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_29572] :
CO-INVESTIGATORS:
PURPOSE:
“You” means  you or your child in this consent form.  
You have been invited to  be in this research study because you are going to have surgery for 
scoliosis. The purpose of this study is to learn if gabapentin reduces the pain of surgery and 
decreases the amount of narcotic medication needed after surgery to control post-operative 
pain.  
Gabapentin will  be called “the study drug” throughout this form.
By [CONTACT_29584][INVESTIGATOR_29573]-associated side effects after spi[INVESTIGATOR_29574], vomiting, inability to urinate and constipation. It may also decrease the overall amount 
of pain experienced after surgery for scoliosis. 
Right now,  the study drug is not approved for use for post-operative pain management after 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_29575].
This study will  require no extra visits to the clinic and will be completed during your admission 
for scoliosis surgery.
Fifty-five subjects  will be enrolled in this study at OHSU.
PROCEDURES:
You will  be asked about participating in the study either at the time you are indicated for 
scoliosis surgery in the office or on the day of surgery. This discussion can take up to one-half 
hour.
This is  a randomized study.  Neither you nor the investigator can choose whether you get 
gabapentin or the placebo. A placebo is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_29576]. Half of the subjects in this study will get the placebo.
You and the  investigators will not know which pi[INVESTIGATOR_29577].  The study is done this way 
because knowing whether you are getting the study drug can change the results of the study.  If 
Approval Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]:  8/23/2018
IRB Approved:  8/29/[ADDRESS_28825] to pain management. This should 
take less than one-half hour. 
RISKS 
AND DISCOMFORTS: 
You have been invited to be in this research study because you are scheduled to have a 
posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_29578]. That procedure is not 
experimental and is not part of this study, and the risks will be discussed with you separately.
There are risks involved in participating in the study, some of which may be very serious.
Study 
Drug Risks
Risks include allergic reaction, which may appear as a rash, hives, fever, swollen lymph nodes, 
swollen lips/tongue, unusual bruising, and/or severe fatigue. 
Other potential risks include: 
changes in blood pressure,
swelling in the extremities
joint pains.
There 
are risks of behavioral changes, emotional instability, hostility, confusion, and 
restlessness. 
The 
study drug may also cause 
blurred or abnormal vision,
temporary dizziness,
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_29579]. For these reasons it is advised not to operate
complex machinery while taking gabapentin.
The effects of gabapentin on pregnant patients, fetuses and in nursing mothers/infants have not 
been 
well studied and are potentially risky to pregnancy. 
Approval Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]:  8/23/2018
IRB Approved:  8/29/[ADDRESS_28826] because we are still learning about 
gabapentin.
One risk  to taking part in this study is that the study drug or the dose you receive may not be 
effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_29580]. This means you may spend 
time in the study and experience side effects of taking a drug that may not provide you with any 
health-related benefits.
There are  several drugs (prescription and non-prescription) that may cause problems when 
taken with the study drug.  The investigator will carefully review all of the drugs you are taking 
before giving you the study drug.  If any other health care provider prescribes any new drug(s) 
for you while you are in this study, please tell the investigator before you take the new drug.  
You could also have that provider talk to the investigator before prescribing the new drug.  Do 
not take any new over-the-counter drugs while you are in this study unless you first check with 
the investigator. The subject will be monitored for these side effects, and you are encouraged to 
report any behaviors or symptoms of concerned to healthcare providers.
BENEFITS:
You may  or may not personally benefit from being in this study.  However, by [CONTACT_6076] a 
subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.
ALTERNATIVES: 
You may  choose not to be in this study. If you choose not to be in this study you will not receive 
gabapentin during your admission for scoliosis surgery but you will continue to receive all of the 
other medications that we use to control pain in this situation including narcotic medications, 
anti-spasmodics (such as Valium), acetaminophen and ketorolac.
CONFIDENTIALITY

privacy.  
We will  create and collect health information about you as described in the Purpose and

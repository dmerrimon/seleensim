APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 11/23/2022Page 2 of 20SECTION I: RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
This is a randomized controlled trial of pregnant women with A2 GDM to use continuous glucose 
monitoring to assess glycemic metrics from the time of diagnosis of A2 GDM in pregnancy until 
delivery.
We hypothesize that women with A2 GDM who are randomized to continuous glucose monitoring 
will have a lower incidence of the composite primary outcome, which includes the following 
variables:  perinatal death, shoulder dystocia, birth weight greater than 4,000 grams, NICU 
admission for treatment of hypoglycemia (blood glucose level <40mg/dL) and birth trauma, 
including fracture or nerve palsy.
Secondary outcomes will include cesarean delivery for an arrest of labor disorder and hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy.
2.Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
Approximately 525 women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes annually in our patient 
population.  Assuming 50% of these will require medication and be diagnosed with A2 GDM that is 
around 140 patients annually eligible for recruitment and we anticipate being able to recruit these 
patients over the course of 1.5 years with 1 additional year for follow up and data analysis. 
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Diabetes complicates 6-7% of pregnancies annually and approximately 85% of these cases are 
women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM).1,[ADDRESS_1003638] four times a day [upon 
waking up (fasting) and after each major meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner)] and medication is 
added when glucose target goals cannot be reached by [CONTACT_734514].  Approximately, 15% 
of women will not reach glucose target goals with diet and exercise alone and will require 
medication.  These women are then diagnosed with class A2 GDM by [CONTACT_734515], which is the standard classification method used to categorize diabetics pregnancy and is 
standard practice for the Yale Maternal-Fetal Medicine Diabetes Clinic. 
Identification of women with GDM who require treatment is essential in optimizing pregnancy 
outcomes for these women. Treatment of GDM results in lower neonatal morbidity, reduced 
incidence of large for gestational age infants (LGA), reduced incidence of preeclampsia and shoulder 
dystocia and a reduced need for cesarean delivery.3-5 Since LGA infants are at higher risk for 
hypoglycemia which may necessitate admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 
treatment of GDM reduces the incidence of LGA infants resulting in less hypoglycemia and NICU 
admissions.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 11/23/2022Page [ADDRESS_1003639] over half of women successfully tested their blood glucose via 
finger sticks ≥ 80% of the time. About 25% of the women in the same study had <90% of the values 
matching in their glucometer and their blood glucose log.6 Given these issues with compliance the 
need for a better and more convenient monitoring system is evident.  Continuous glucose monitors 
(CGM) are a relatively new device that have yet to be fully explored for their utility in pregnancy. 
The current generation of CGM has had exponential growth in the clinical care of diabetes, driven 
primarily by [CONTACT_734516], longer duration sensor life (ranging from 7-14 
days in currently available models), and the ability to collect these data without performing 
calibration of the sensors with fingerstick glucose readings.  Continuous Glucose Monitoring in 
Women with Type 1 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (CONCEPTT), demonstrated the utility of CGM 
data to decrease the frequency of adverse neonatal outcomes in a pregestational diabetes population.7 
A more recent trial of blinded CGM data in women with GDM showed mean sensor glucose was 
significantly higher in women who delivered LGA infants. The 24-hour mean glucose was different 
between groups in this study (112 mg/dL vs. 104 mg/dL, p=0.025), driven by [CONTACT_734517] (108 mg/dL vs. 99 mg/dL, p=0.005).8  Given that this is not a time that women with 
GDM would normally be monitoring their blood sugar it is evident that CGM may be useful, not 
only in increasing patient compliance by [CONTACT_734518] a glucometer four times a day but by [CONTACT_734519].   
This study will utilize the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring device from Abbott 
Pharmaceuticals. Dexcom recently complete a trial in pregnancy utilizing this device but results are 
not yet available. This device is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) but has not 
yet been evaluated thoroughly for use in pregnancy and is not approved, at this time, for use in 
pregnant women; however, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_734520].7,8

4.Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and 
lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
This will be a randomized clinical trial assessing the use of a continuous glucose monitor on 
glycemic control for gestational diabetics requiring medication management during pregnancy. 
Women who are diagnosed as having gestational diabetes will be identified through consultative or 
new patient visits to the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Program through the Maternal-Fetal Medicine 
Division in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences. Women will be 
followed to see if they ultimately require medication for management of their gestational diabetes. 
All pregnant women who receive the diagnosis of gestational diabetes requiring medication (A2 
GDM) are managed in this clinic. 
During pregnancy all women are screened for gestational diabetes.. Women may be screened prior to 
this time based on certain risk factors (i.e. age, history of gestational diabetes, ethnicity, BMI) and if 
they pass this initial, earlier screening they will be rescreened in the third trimester.  Women 
diagnosed with gestational diabetes at any time during pregnancy are potentially eligible for this 
study.
Screening for gestational diabetes is done by a standard 2-step process.  The first test is a 50-gram 
oral glucose challenge (GCT).  If the subject fails this test (≥130mg/dL or ≥140mg/dL depending on 
the laboratory used) then they will require a 100-gram fasting glucose tolerance test (GTT). 
Alternatively, if the patient has a value of ≥200mg/dL on the 50-gram glucose challenge she would 
be diagnosed with gestational diabetes at that time.  For the 100-gram GTT the standard at for Yale 
Maternal-Fetal Medicine is to use the Carpenter-Coustan criteria to make the diagnosis of gestational 
diabetes, with the following blood sugar cutoffs at the stated time points: fasting – 95m/dL, 1 hour – 
180nmg/dL, 2 hours – 155mg/dL, 3 hours – 140mg/dL  If the patient has [ADDRESS_1003640] positive for gestational

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 11/23/2022Page [ADDRESS_1003641] of ≥200mg/dL or by [CONTACT_7661] [ADDRESS_1003642] visit with the diabetes nurse educator after failing 
their 3-hour GTT.  Patients will then be followed, as is routine practice in the clinic, for a minimum 
of 1 week to see if their blood sugar values for fasting (<95mg/dL) and 1-hour after meals 
(<140mg/dL) are mostly (>75%) at goal for all time-points tested.  Women will use the MyChart 
Diabetes in Pregnancy log that is standard practice for patients in the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy 
clinic. Those women who do not have reliable access to this technology will be allowed to use paper 
logs. Both types of logs, electronic and paper, are reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_734521]/or physician in the Yale Maternal-Fetal Medicine clinic. 
Women who do not have at least 75% of their blood sugar values at or below the previously stated 
goals require medication for management of their gestational diabetes and will be diagnosed as 
A2GDM. When these women return to the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic at Yale Maternal-Fetal 
Medicine for initiation of medication therapy for gestational diabetes they will again be approached 
about participating in the study and given time to consider their participation at that visit.  Should 
they require more time and wish to discuss with others outside the clinic visit we will contact [CONTACT_734522] 1 week to inquire about participation in the study. Women who consent to 
participation will be randomized to the control group (checking blood glucose as previously done 
with fasting and 1-hour post meal finger sticks) or to receive the Dexcom G6 CGM device, which is 
a device to monitor blood glucose continuously for [ADDRESS_1003643] practice using this device in the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic in our patients with 
pre-gestational diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes) who present to pregnancy with a CGM already 
in place and those women with pregestational diabetes who we initiate CGM for monitoring of their 
blood glucose during pregnancy. As with the women in this population, women in the study who are 
randomized to receive the CGM device to monitor their blood sugar we will instruct them how to 
place the device, use the device, change the sensor and monitor their blood sugars with the device 
website and smartphone application. The CGM has a mechanism that alerts the patient when their 
blood sugar is low, in pregnancy this is set at a blood glucose value of 60 mg/dL. The women in the 
trial will be informed that if their CGM alerts them to this blood sugar value that they should have a 
snack that is a mix of carbohydrate and protein, as we instruct all our patients with diabetes who 
have a blood glucose value of this level.  Additionally, women in both arms of the trial will be 
instructed that if they are experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, shakiness, 
weakness, confusion, visual disturbances, dizziness, nervousness or lightheadedness) they should

discuss next steps in management with either the triage nurse (Monday-Friday 8am -5pm) or the 
physician on call (Friday 5pm-Monday8am and Monday-Thursday nights 5pm-8am). 
 
In addition to approaching women who meet criteria, flyers and posters will be placed in the exam 
rooms in the office location of 1 Long Wharf Maternal-Fetal Medicine office.  Women will also be 
notified of their eligibility through a MyChart message. Information on the study will also be 
available through the YCCI website, the Ob-Gyn Department website and the Clinical Research at 
Yale Facebook Page.
Women in the control group will continue to check their blood sugar levels as previously stated 
(fasting and 1 hour after eating) and use the MyChart Diabetes in Pregnancy log or paper log as they 
were using prior to requiring medication for the treatment of their diabetes.  They will continue to be 
followed by [CONTACT_734523]-Fetal Medicine clinic. 
Women who are randomized to the CGM group will also have their CGM data followed by [CONTACT_734524]-Fetal Medicine clinic. 
At the initial visit where the CGM is placed the reading on the device will be checked against a 
fingerstick value on a glucometer in clinic. This practice is then repeated at every clinic visit to ensure 
the device is calibrated correctly.  If the blood glucose value between the CGM device and the 
glucometer differs by [CONTACT_734525] 10mg/dL the blood glucose will be rechecked with the glucometer using 
a different fingerstick. At this time if the blood glucose reading is still more than 10mg/dL different 
between the glucometer and the CGM the CGM sensor will be changed.  If the sensor cannot reliably be 
confirmed with the glucometer at any clinic visit after following these steps the patient will be instructed 
to use her glucometer to monitor her blood glucose, as in the placebo group, and return to clinic in [ADDRESS_1003645] practice for women being 
seen in the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic. Medication adjustments will be made at the visits, 
over the phone or through MyChart messages (as is currently standard practice for all women in the 
Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic) when blood sugar values are reviewed for both the control and 
study group. Blood glucose values will be assessed at least weekly for all patients in the study, as is 
standard practice for all women in the Yale Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic. The CGM data will not be 
monitored in real time.  This is the standard we currently follow for our patients with pregestational 
diabetes who use a CGM during pregnancy. After review of their blood glucose values patients will 
be called or notified at their clinic visit if adjustments need to be made to their medication 
management. Women who do not have any data logged for a week will be contact[CONTACT_734526] 11/23/2022

educator. No additional steps or care will be required at these visits if women participate in the 
study. Medication adjustments will be made at the same interval and using the same protocol for 
women in the study (both the CGM and control arm) and those who do not participate in the study. 
At a visit between 32-[ADDRESS_1003647] of their antenatal course with 
delivery occurring no later than 40 weeks’ gestation as per recommended for all women with A2 GDM 
per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Delivery outcomes will be assessed 
through MyChart. There will be no special follow-up required postpartum for women who participate in 
the study. Following delivery, the CGM group will be asked to return their study devices.  Additionally, 
both groups will be provided with a short survey regarding their perceptions of their blood glucose 
monitoring modality focusing on their preference for fingerstick monitoring versus CGM use and the 
ease of usability of the device during their pregnancy.  Once the survey is completed, participation in the 
study will be over. 
We hypothesize that women with A2GDM who are randomized to continuous glucose monitoring 
will have a lower incidence of the composite primary outcome, due largely in part to the ability to 
better track overnight glycemic control and adjust medications as needed to decrease the possibility 
of hyperglycemia overnight, as shown in the previous study using CGM in pregnancy, which will 
then decrease the incidence of adverse outcomes that are part of the composite primary outcome.

6.Subject Population: Provide a detailed description of the types of human subjects who will be recruited into 
this study.
Women with no history of pregestational diabetes, other than GDM during previous pregnancies, who 
are >18 years of age will be recruited for participation at the time of diagnosis of A2 GDM.  As all 
women are screened for gestational diabetes in pregnancy there will be adequate representation across 
all ethnic groups who receive care at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All women will be approached for 
participation in the study regardless of ethnicity. As certain ethnic groups are at increased risk for 
gestational diabetes (i.e. Asian, African-American, Hispanic) this will be represented in the study 
population; however, this should not affect the study outcome as we are looking to assess the use of a 
device to monitor gestational diabetes and will not change any intervention based on the group women 
are randomized to. Women will be randomized to receive a continuous glucose monitor or to monitor 
their diabetes in the standard fashion with finger sticks and glucometer measurement of plasma 
glucose four times daily (fasting and 1 hour postprandial).

inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Risks to participating in the research include any risk associated with wearing the continuous glucose monitor. 
The sensor wires for the CGM go under the skin and the device is placed by [CONTACT_734527].  The device has been deemed safe for use by [CONTACT_1622].  
The standard of care is fingersticks and the CGM device is deemed to be as safe as fingersticks, which the 
patients will have been doing up until the point of enrollment.
Patients will be de-identified for data analysis.
There is no anticipated increased risk to the woman or her fetus for women in the CGM group compared to 
the standard monitoring group (with the glucometer and four times a day fingersticks) based on the use of 
the CGM alone.  The risks to the pregnancy are related to the risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734506]. 
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
The patient will be properly instructed in how to wear the device and will have received previous training on 
how to take fingersticks for glucose monitoring.  All information collected for the study will be stored on a 
Yale University Laptop and in the Yale University Secure Box system, both of which are password protected.  
Once enrolled, patients will also receive a study ID number and the data will be de-identified when analyzed.
12.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this 
study? There is minimal risk to the subject for participating. CGMs are FDA approved for use in 
humans.
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating in this study? n/a
c. Data safety and Monitoring Plan:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency monthly.  During the review process the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22420], require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment.
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_158225] (IRB) have the authority to stop or suspend 
the study or require modifications.
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that 
such events occur, Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and 
unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, 
probably, or definitely related) or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that 
may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be reported immediately (if 
possible), followed by a written report within 5 calendar days of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_734507] (using the appropriate forms from the website) and any appropriate 
funding and regulatory agencies. The investigator will apprise fellow investigators and study personnel

The DSMB and IRB will be informed of the following adverse events within 5 days of the event 
becoming known to the principal investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_734509], neonatal injury at birth due to 
large for gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit admission due to hypoglycemia or other 
complication from gestational diabetes, and maternal admission for hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia for 
other reason. The previously stated risks are not related to the use of CGM but are known risks of 
gestational diabetes. Risks related to the use of the CGM include the following: CGM device breaking 
causing need for professional assistance with removal, CGM malfunctioning resulting in admission for 
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. 
13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
Assuming an incidence in the standard monitoring group of 60% and an effect size of 40% with a 
power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 we would need to recruit 134 women (67 per arm). 
Approximately 140 women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes annually in our patient 
population.  Around 50% of these will require medication and be diagnosed with A2 GDM that is 
around 60 patients annually eligible for recruitment.

7. Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining 
consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed. 
The personnel obtaining study consent will review the patient’s chart to ensure the patient has appropriate 
decision making capacity and ability to consent to the study.  The personnel will also employ the teach-back 
method to ensure the potential study subject understands the study and what it entails.
8. Non-English Speaking Subjects: Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving 
non-English speaking subjects. If enrollment of these subjects is anticipated, translated copi[INVESTIGATOR_20885]. 
Spanish speaking subjects are unable to be enrolled at this time as we no longer have a Spanish speaking 
research coordinator to aid with consent of subjects. 
As a limited alternative to the above requirement, will you use the short form* for consenting process if you 
unexpectedly encounter a non-English speaking individual interested in study participation and the translation of 
the long form is not possible prior to intended enrollment?  YES ☒  NO ☐
Note* If more than [ADDRESS_1003651] speaking that 
language is to be enrolled.
Several translated short form templates are available on the HRPP website (yale.edu/hrpp) and translated HIPAA 
Research Authorization Forms are available on the HIPAA website (hipaa.yale.edu). If the translation of the short 
form is not available on our website, then the translated short form needs to be submitted to the IRB office for 
approval via modification prior to enrolling the subject.   Please review the guidance and presentation on use of 
the short form available on the HRPP website.
If using a short form without a translated HIPAA Research Authorization Form, please request a HIPAA waiver in

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
This study may help to provide evidence that CGM is an acceptable alternative to [ADDRESS_1003652] of care.  Many women find this level of 
monitoring difficult to complete and painful, leading to fewer fingersticks and less data for clinicians attempting 
to manage their medication and their pregnancies to help ensure a good outcome for both mothers and infants 
and reduce the potential complications of poorly controlled A2 GDM (intrauterine fetal demise, macrosomia, 
polyhydramnios, postpartum hemorrhage, 3rd and 4th degree lacerations, NICU admissions, neonatal 
hypoglycemia and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]). The use of a device that would allow for glucose monitoring without 
fingersticks is an attractive alternative for both patients and providers and could improve compliance with and 
management of A2GDM, therefore, improving patient outcomes.
         SECTION VI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
The alternative to the study is to continue routine care with 4 times daily fingersticks for blood glucose 
monitoring, which half of the study population will continue to do to compare routine practice to CGM for the 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 11/23/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 11/23/2022Page 19 of 20management of A2GDM.  All patients will continue routine care (including visits, ultrasounds and antenatal 
testing, as require for A2GDM).
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
No compensation will be provided.  Study devices will be provided at no cost to the participants.
3.Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects. 
There will be no cost to the subjects.  The CGM will be covered by [CONTACT_734529]’s 
insurance will cover all routine blood glucose monitoring devices, supplies and medications needed for 
management of gestational diabetes. There will be no additional clinic visits outside what is already required 
for routine prenatal care for patients with A2 gestational diabetes.
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws).
a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? Standard measures offered 
to pregnant patients will be available and patient’s will be treated as needed in the clinic or on 
Labor and Birth at YNHH
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? The subject would receive these standard 
measures through their health care provider team (i.e. physician and nurse)
c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? No
d. Who will pay for this treatment? Insurance will be billed for any potential complications from the 
device use and the participants will be responsible for any co-pays required by [CONTACT_734530].
e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? The subject would be treated 
immediately with appropriate means available in our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734513], as is routine care

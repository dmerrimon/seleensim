Hypotheses:  
In part 1, it is expected that a dose of AMG [ADDRESS_326920]:   AMG 655/AMG 479 
Protocol Number:   20060323 
Date:   20 November 2008 Page 4 of 115 
 In part 2, AMG 655 in combination with gemcitabine and/or AMG [ADDRESS_326921]-line 
therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer.  
Study Design: 
This study is a multi-center, 2-part study of AMG 655, AMG [ADDRESS_326922]-line treatment of subjec ts with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
Part 1 is an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1b segment to determine the safety, tolerability 
and maximum tolerated dose of AMG 655 (up to a target dose of 10 mg/kg) in combination with 
gemcitabine.  Gemcitabine will be administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 
28 day cycle.  Two doses of AMG 655 will be adm inistered once every 2 weeks (on days 1 and 
15 of every 28 day cycle) and tested sequentially in up to 6 subjects per AMG 655 dose level.  Three mg/kg will be the starting dose of AMG 655.  If this dose is safe (based upon the incidence 
of dose limiting toxicities), the next dose level that will be examined is 10 mg/kg once every 
2 weeks.  If the 3 mg/kg dose level is not sa fe lower doses of AMG 655 may be tested at the 
discretion of the Data Review Team (DRT).  See Section 6 for details.  AMG 479 will not be 
studied in part 1.  
Part 2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, pha se 2 segment that will commence after dose 
selection in part 1.  In part 2, subjects (n = 120) will be randomized 1:1:1 (stratified by [CONTACT_131781] 0 or 1) to AMG 655, AMG 479, or AMG 655-placebo in combination with 
gemcitabine.  The AMG [ADDRESS_326923] experiences an unacceptable toxicity that in the in vestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_268692] 655, AMG 479, or AMG 655-placebo, the 
subject may continue to receive AMG 655, AM G 479 or AMG 655-placebo as monotherapy until 
disease progression (radiographic progression per RECIST with modifications or clinical 
progression), unacceptable toxicity, subjec t withdrawal of consent, or death.  
In the event a subject experiences an unacceptable  toxicity that is possibly related to AMG 655, 
AMG [ADDRESS_326924] who discontinues treat ment for unacceptable toxicity and who has not 
developed disease progression will continue to be followed for disease progression and overall 
survival during the long term follow-up. Radiological imaging to evaluate tumor response  will be performed every 8 weeks ± [ADDRESS_326925] had the opportunity to complete one cycle (28 days) of protocol specified treatment in part 2.

 • Baseline samples for apoptosis biomarkers and  intensive PK samples pre- and post-dosing 
(part 1 and selected sites in part 2) 
• Samples for immunogenicity and other biomarkers pre-and post-treatment 
• Serum samples for PKs of AMG 655, AMG 479 (part 2) and gemcitabine (part 1)

Statistical Considerations:   
The primary objective of part 1 of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of 
AMG 655 up to a target dose of 10 mg/kg that can be administered with gemcitabine.  
Approximately 12 subjects will be en rolled (6 subjects per AMG 655 dose level).  Before starting 
part 1, a DRT will be formed and governed by a detailed charter.  The DRT will be responsible for reviewing listings of the safety data, laborat ory data, dosing information and PK data (when 
available) from each AMG [ADDRESS_326935] completed 6 months of treatment or died. 
The analysis will be presented separately for parts 1 and 2 of the study.  For each part descriptive 
statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_268699] r selected demographic, safety, PK, efficacy, 
antibody, and biomarker data.  For part 1, the time-to-event endpoints will be listed only.  For 
part 2, overall survival, progression-free survival and duration of response will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the m edian time to event, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the median, 25th and 75th percentiles.  Time-to-re sponse will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  In addition, the 6 mont h survival rates (with 80% and 95% CIs) will be 
estimated from the Kaplan-Meier analysis of over all survival.  The proportion and corresponding 
exact 80% and 95% CIs of subjects with an objec tive response determined using RECIST with 
modifications will also be presented.  
For part 2, the difference (AMG 655 minu s AMG 655-placebo and AMG 479 minus AMG 655-
placebo) in the proportion of subjects alive at  6 months and corresponding 80 and 95% CIs will 
be presented.  For the primary analysis, the proportions will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method with the variance of the proportions esti mated using Greenwood’s formula.  The overall 
survival, time-to-progression and duration of response endpoints will additionally be analyzed 
using stratified Cox’s proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio.  The difference in objective response rate between treatment arms with corresponding exact 80% and 95% CIs will 
also be estimated firstly using the Newcombe- Wilson exact method and secondly using logistic 
regression.  Where appropriate, based on samp le size, the stratification variable ECOG and 
covariates age and sex will be used to examine selected efficacy and safety endpoints in 
subgroups or in multivariate analyses.

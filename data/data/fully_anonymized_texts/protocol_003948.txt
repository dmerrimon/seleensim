term in nature (usually up to 4- 12 weeks); however, lymphedema is a chronic condition and often worsens 
over time.  Therefore, alternative treatment modalities need to be investigated for effective and long- term 
management of lymphedema and associated late fibrosis in the head and neck cancer (HNC)  population . 
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
There has been an increase in the incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) largely related to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_286980] (HPV) associated disease.1,2 HPV-  associated HNC occurs in younger 
and middle- aged pati ents; cure rates in this population are markedly higher compared to other HNC 
groups.3,[ADDRESS_1237492] to assess lymphedema in HNC patients in a systematic manner.7,11 We demonstrated a prevalence 
rate of 75% in HNC survivors.7 We confirmed that lymphedema occurs both externally (e.g., face and neck) 
and internally (e.g., pharynx and larynx).7,[ADDRESS_1237493] on critical functions (e.g., swallowing, speaking, and breathing).13,14 Psychological 
effects (e.g., body image disturbance) were also correlated with lymphedema.13,15-[ADDRESS_1237494] HNC survivors ’ ability to function in both home and work 
environments, resulting in both emotional and financial burden for these individuals, their families, and the healthcare system.
11,[ADDRESS_1237495] of care for treatment of lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy (CDT), which 
consists of 4 main parts: manual lymphatic drainage, compression (bandaging or garments), exercise, and 
skin care. 10,19,21,22 These treatments are expensive, time- consuming and labor -intensive. CDT provided by

and often worsens over time.10,19 Therefore, alternative treatment modalities need to be investigated for 
effective and long- term management of lymphedema and associated lat e fibrosis in the HNC population.  
 
Among many alternative treatment options, low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising, noninvasive 
modality for treatment of lymphedema. LLLT, also named photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), has had a 
place in general medicine for more than 40 years.24 It has been used as a treatment option to stimulate 
wound healing and reduce inflammation, edema, and pain.24 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
accepted it as a treatment approach for breast cancer -related upper extremity lymphedema (BCRL) in 
2006.24 One recent systematic review evaluating 7 randomized clinical trials (RCT) concluded that available 
evidence supports LLLT in the management of BCRL, with clinically meaningful reductions in lymphedema -
related swelling and symptom burden (e.g., pain).[ADDRESS_1237496] study investigating the use of LLLT in the 
treatment of head and neck lymphedema. The goal of this proposed research is to determine the feasibility 
and preliminary efficacy  of the use of  LLLT on facial/neck swelling and fibrotic changes, symptom burden, 
and neck mobility in HNC survivors with lymphedema through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041] .

individuals with lymphedema.   
1.2.1  Nonclinical Data  
Findings  from nonclinical data indicate that LLLT  stimulates lymphatic vessels and lymphocytes, as well as 
increases local fluid circulation.27,28  
1.2.2  Clinical Data to Date  
Currently, only cases studies  indicate the potential value of  use of LLLT for treating head and neck 
lymphedema.29,30 No large prospective clinical trials  are available to evaluate prophylactic and/or 
therapeutic use of LLLT for lymphedema in HNC patients. However, a large body of evidence is available 
in supporting  the safety and efficacy of LLLT for management of lymphedema in breast cancer patients. 
For instance, since 1995, the use of LLLT has been investigated in the treatment of breast cancer -related 
lymphedema (BCRL).31 A meta -analysis of 9 studies (7 of them were RCTs) provided evidence that LLLT 
alone or combined with other treatments was able to reduce the arm swelling and pain in women with 
BCRL.[ADDRESS_1237498] cancer population: oral mucositis, radiodermatitis, chemotherapy -induced 
peripheral neuropathy, and osteonecrosis of the jaw.[ADDRESS_1237499] range of side effects

Statistical analysis for primary aim ( feasibility of the intervention): Descriptive statistical and graphical 
methods will summarize the rates of participation (recruited vs. consented), log data (e.g., sessions 
completed), completion of assessments throughout the study, adverse events (s afety) and satisfaction data 
within both groups. It is expected that ≥ 80% of participants will complete the study activities, and ≥ 80% 
will report acceptable levels of satisfaction with the interventions, thereby [CONTACT_884656].  
 
For the secondary objective, change from baseline value will be computed for each outcome variable at 
each follow -up timepoint. The analysis of changes over time relies on mixed- effects modeling, which 
accounts for correl ation among subjects’ repeated measures using a compound symmetry covariance 
matrix. Results will be reported as model -based mean change ± standard error.  
[ADDRESS_1237509] to monitor safety of participants during the course of the study.  
 During the course of this study, study staff will observe for any adverse side effects or events when 
interacting with participants and be trained to report these to t he PI's immediately. Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03)  will be used to document adverse events of the trial. All 
the staff members who are involved in this study will be trained how to use CTCAE version 4.03.  
 
In addition, p articipants in this study will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Participants will be educated regarding signs and symptoms related to adverse events (e.g., sudden 
increase in swelling) requiring urgent or emergent medical care.    
8.[ADDRESS_1237510], the trained staff  will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the s ource document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in t he source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately.  
 All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6283]. Deng and Lin, any contributing factors will be reviewed, and 
strategies to prevent further complications will be developed and implemented. [CONTACT_734610] will meet with 
study staff monthly t o evaluate any other safety concerns. Adverse events will be reported to the Penn IRB 
within the window required by [CONTACT_1201]. If study staff identify the following unanticipated problems related to 
the research (e.g., infection in the treated area, sudden i ncrease in swelling), which occur during the study, 
Drs. Deng, Lin, and study lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_884647]. Patients will be referred and received appropriate and timely therapy. Drs. Deng and Lin will determine if participants with a dverse 
event s or any unexpected issues will remain on the study based on safety consideration. Drs. Deng and

in order to communicate with them during the study. This information will be maintained in a participant 
tracking database that is not stored on the hard drive, accessible only to the study team members through 
a password protected computer and link to a Penn School of Nursing server that is accessible only the study team. The name [CONTACT_736756].  
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Data collectio n will be conducted by a trained staff member at a private room at the Abramson Cancer 
Center (ACC) HNC clinics (participant recruitment and baseline data collection). The following procedure will be utilized to protect the privacy of the research particip ant. All data will be coded and filed without any 
name [CONTACT_113238]. Self -reported questionnaires will be completed by [CONTACT_884660]. The research assistant will  review 
participants' completeness for each questionnaire. If participants prefer or if there are technical difficulties, 
hard copy forms will be used. All hard copy data will be double- entered into REDCap, checked for 
discrepancies, and reconciled with ha rd copy forms. All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_736742] a locking file cabinet. 
Only the study team have access to the file cabinet and electronic database. After the study is concluded, 
the research data will be stored at Penn School of Nursing.  
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
Monitoring by [CONTACT_978]: [INVESTIGATOR_736743], with assistance from the Co -I Lin, the study lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (Joy 
Cohen), and other study staff members, will monitor all the study activities to ensure safety of part icipants 
and integrity of the data collection and management. The research team will meet monthly to discuss 
recruitment, retention, study progress, and any safety concerns. Any potential issues related to the study 
activities will be discussed and address ed appropriately and timely. Participants will be educated regarding 
signs and symptoms related to adverse events requiring urgent or emergent medical care. All adverse events will be documented using CTCAE criteria, reviewed by [CONTACT_6283]. Deng and Lin. Any  contributing  factors will be 
reviewed. Strategies to prevent further complications will be developed and implemented. Although adverse 
events are highly unlikely, should they develop, they will be reported to the Penn IRB, within the required time window.

 10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_736744] -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. , 
source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).   
11 Ethical Considerations  
Although thi s is an interventional study, for eseeab le physical, psychological, financ ial, legal, or other risks 
from study participation are believed to be minimal. 
11.1 Risks  
1) Physical: No physical risks (e.g., worsening lymphedema or fibrosis)  from using LLLT in individuals 
with breast cancer -related lymphedema have been reported in the known current literature review. No 
physical risks from using LLLT were reported in the c ases studies conducted in individuals with head 
and neck lymphedema. Subjects will not have any burning sensation, warmth, or any other uncomfortable 
sensations on the sites treated with low -level laser. Currently, there is no safety data in the population 
under study. Thus, we will inform participants of reporting any physical damages they have during the 
course of the study.  
2) Psychological: There are no known psychological risks associated with LLLT.  
3) Financ ial: The LLLT  will be provided free of charge. Patients may incur e xpense of gas when driving 
to the Penn C linic.  
4) Le gal: There are no known legal risks.  
5) Other: There may be risks that are unknown at this time. 
Our planned  protections from the above -noted risks are as follows:  
1) Physical: Currently, there are no known potential physical risks for being in this study.  Given no safety 
data available in the population under study, the research may involve risks that are currently 
unforeseeable.  To minimize any potential physical risks, the following will be done: a) P articipants will be 
given the study contact [CONTACT_884661] ; b) if study staff identify any unanticipated 
problems, Drs. Deng, Lin , and study lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (Joy Cohen)  will be notified immediately.  
Appropriate evaluation and timely therapy will be  provided to the participant . Deng, Li n, and study 
lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_884652]; and c) if anyone experience an adverse event directly related to the 
study activities that are done for research, they can get reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical 
care for their adverse events  at Penn.  
2) Psychological: If study s taff identifies participants with significant distress during the course of the 
study, PI [INVESTIGATOR_884649]- I Lin will be notified immediately so that appropriate psychological evaluation and 
referrals will be made. Drs. Deng and Lin will determine if participants with significant psychological issues will remain on study.   
3) Financ ial: The LLLT  will be provided free of charge. Patients will incur ex pense  of gas when driving to 
the Penn Clinic  during study follow -up visits. To offset travel/gas cost, participants will be provided a 
financial token of appreciation for participation in the study.  
4) Legal: There are no known legal risks.  
5) Other: Should the team becom e aware of any additional risks, pa rticipants will be notified and informed 
consen ts will be modified to reflect the new information. 
11.2 Benefits  
Potential benefits to the individual: Although the potential direct benefit to study participants is unknown, individual participants will be exposed to and have increased knowledge about lymphedema and fibrosis . 
Participants may have positive feelings about participation in a research program that may benefit others.

Potential benefits to human kind: Possible future benefits for HNC survivors are potentially substantial. If 
we are able to demonstrate that LLLT  is safe, feasible and effective in HNC patients, we will be adding to 
the armamentarium of an alternative intervention that can diminish progression of lymphedema and fibrosis , 
decrease symptom burden, increase function, and improve overall quality of life.  
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Currently, there are no known potential risks for being in this study.  Given no safety data available in 
the population under study, the research may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.  
As noted abov e, potential bene fits are reasonabl e and subs tantial. Thus, based on t he risk bene fit 
assessment, it appea rs to be accep table for this research within human subjects. 
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Once the study is approved by [CONTACT_736754], the trained study team members will meet with 
potential participants who express interest in the study. Potential study participants will be provided one 
copy of the informed consent to read and review. Study team members will review the study proced ures 
and activities with potential part icipants. The informed consent  document will be written in lay language and 
cover all study activities participants will engage in during the study, define the length of time the study will 
be conduc ted, and provide instructions for par ticipant withdrawal from the study shou ld they choose to do 
so. Study staff will review and, when necessary , read the informed conse nt document to potential 
participants. Participants will be given ample time and opportunity to ask  questions, and all questions will 
be answered by [CONTACT_464]. The cons ent process  will take place in a private location, with a closed  door. 
Once participants have had an oppo rtunity to ask questions, those questions have been answered, and 
they indicate an interest in participation, they will be asked to sign a written informed consent docum ent as 
the study staff witnesses . In addition, the participant will be given a copy of informed consent signed by [CONTACT_736755]. We will not  seek waivers of the informed consent p roces s. 
[ADDRESS_1237514] Payments  
All participants will be provided with a financial token of appreciation that increases slightly the longer they 
are in the study ($15 for bas eline, $20 for end of intervention, $[ADDRESS_1237515] -intervention, and $[ADDRESS_1237516] -intervention).  
13 Benchmarks for Study /Publication Plan  
The key benchmark for success of this study is to complete recruitment goals and data collection as 
scheduled. The information gathered from this study will provide important data for designing a large clinical 
trial that tests the efficacy of LLLT on lymphedema in the HNC survivors. Additional benchmarks for success 
include: 1) dissemination of preliminary findi ngs at professional conferences and 2) submission of articles 
to peer -reviewed journals .

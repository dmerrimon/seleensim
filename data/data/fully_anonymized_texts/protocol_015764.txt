STUDY NUMBER  13-005 
STUDY PHASE  Phase 2/3 
TITLE  A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized-Withdrawal, 
Mult
icenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Xyrem  with an Open -
Label Pharmacokinetic Evaluation and Safety Extension in Pediatric Subjects with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy  
LOCATIONS  This study will be conducted globally at app roximately 70 sites  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objectives are:  
1) To evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution in the treatment of cataplexy in pediatric subjects  
with 
narcolepsy  
2) To evaluate the safety of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy in pediatric subjects with narcolepsy for up to one year (and potentially more than one year in some subjects participating in a continuation of the open- label safety evaluation ) 
Secondary objectives are:  
1) To evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of exces
sive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  (EDS) in pediatric subjects  with 
narcolepsy  with cataplexy  
2) To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Xyrem in ped
iatric subjects  (ages 7 -17 years) with narcolepsy with 
cataplexy   
3) To evaluate the safety of titrating Xyrem in pediatric subjects  
to a
n effective and tolerable dose  
DESIGN  Under Amendment 5, this study is divided into two parts: Part 1 incl
udes one year of treatment , and Part 2 , the Open -Label  
Continuation Period, provides the opportunity to continue treatment for up to an additional 2 years. 
Part 1  
Part 1 of t his study was initially designed as a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized- withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy 
and safety of Xyrem  (sodium oxybate) oral solution. As a result of a 
preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive effic acy 
results on the primary efficacy endpoint, the protocol was amended

Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem treatment. After 
Amendment 4 becom ing effective, all subjects entering the Double-
Blind Treatment Period will receive open -label Xyrem treatment. For 
administrative reasons, the term “Double- Blind Treatment Period” 
will continue to be used throughout the protocol. Following the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period (2 weeks ), this study also includes an 
open-label safety extension allowing subjects to continue Xyrem treatment for up to one year in Part [ADDRESS_328816] one month prior to the Part 1 
Screening visit for reasons other than lack of efficacy and/or 
tolerability issues (e.g., lost insurance coverage, could not afford Xyrem, changed prescribers) . 
All subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Part 1 
Screening Period (up to 30 days [if needed, additional time may be granted with permission of the Medical Monitor] ). 
Following Part 1 screening, s ubj
 ects who are Xyrem naïve will enter 
the Open -Label Titration Period of up to 10 weeks. Once the Xyrem 
dose has been optimized per the Investigator’s judgment, these subject s may enter the open -label Stable- Dose Period  with that dose. 
Subjects who are on Xyrem at study entry will remain on their stable dose and regimen  (i.e., two equally divided doses or two unequally 
divided doses) of Xyrem and enter the Stable -Dose Period following 
screening.   
Subjects are eligible to enter the Double- Blind Treatment Pe riod if the 
dose and regimen of Xyrem remains unchanged during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically 
significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant 
adverse events due to Xyrem treatment have occurred.  
Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period prior to 
Amendment 4 becoming effective,  had been  randomized 1:1 to 
receive one of the following two treatments d uring the 2- week 
Double- Blind Treatment Period (randomized- withdrawal) : 
• Xyrem : Active Xyrem will be continued as a double-blind 
treatment at the stable dose  taken  and regimen used in the prior 
2 weeks

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 of 158 • Xyrem placebo : Xyrem placebo will be initiated as a double -blind 
treatment at a volume and regimen equivalent to the Xyrem dose 
taken  in the prior 2 weeks. 
Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period after 
Amendment 4 becom ing effec tive will receive open -label Xyrem  
treatment  in this period. 
Subjects who complete the entire Double- Blind  Treatment Period will 
be eligible to contin ue in the Open -Label Safety Period . The Open -
Label Safety Period will allow subjects to continue Xyrem treatment 
for up to one year in Part 1 . 
In addition, at certain study sites, a subset of subjects on a stable dose 
of Xyrem will participate in an open- label PK evaluation  during 
Part 1. Subjects will be stratified to two age groups: [ADDRESS_328817] (DSMB), or when enrollment of [ADDRESS_328818] Xyrem dose: 0 (pre -dose), 0.75, 
1.5, 2.5, and 4 hours (pre-2nd dose) to characterize the PK of the first Xyrem dose, and at 4.75 and 8 hours to cha racterize the peak and 
residual exposure associated with the second Xyrem dose (total blood volume for PK samples is 40 mL taken over a minimum of 2 days ). 
Subjects evaluated for 
PK will also undergo all other study procedures 
specified in the protocol. 
Part 2 
Upon approval of Amendment 5, subjects who complete one year in the study (Part 1) will have the opportunity to continue open- label 
Xyrem treatment in Part [ADDRESS_328819] occurrence of any of the following: 
• Up to an additional 2 years 
• Un
til the  s ubject  reaches  18 years of age  
• Until up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of

STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  To address Primary Objective 1 and Secondary Objective 1:  
A tiered approach was planned to control the Type 1 family- wise error 
rate at the 0.05 significance level with all tests  being two- sided for 
testing of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
 Due to the positive primary efficacy results from the pre -specified 
interim analyses, the DSMB recommended to stop the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period.   T iered testin g on secondary 
endpoints, as defined below, will be conducted with a significance 
level of 0.05, with all tests being two- sided.  
Tier 1: Primary endpoint 
Change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 2  week
 s 
of the Stable-Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. 
The primary endpoint demonstrated efficacy at the interim analysis 
wit
h a significance level <0.005.  Testing will continue with Tier 2.  
Tier 2: Key s econda ry endpoint #2 
CGIc for cataplexy severity from  the  end of the Stable -Dose Period to 
the end of the Double- Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance leve
l. If Xyrem is significantly better th an placebo at this level, Tier 3  
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 3: Ke y seconda ry endpoint #3 
Change in the ESS (CHAD) score from the end of the Stable- Dos e 
Period to the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance 
leve
l. If Xyrem is significantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 4 
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 4: Other secondary endpoint #4 
CGIc for narcolepsy overall from the end of the Stable-Dose Period to 
the e
nd of the Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducte d at t he 0.05 significance 
level.  If Xyrem is significantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 5 
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 5: Other secondary endpoint #5 
Change in QoL (SF-10) from the end of the Stable-Dose Period to the 
end of t
he Double-Blind T reatment Period

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 158 The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance 
level.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be tested without multiplicity 
adjustments.  For these parameters, nominal p-values will be reported.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -
parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Ordinal categorical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) tests for row mean score 
difference.  
Efficacy data in the open -labe
 l phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].  
To address Primary Objective 2 and Secondary Objective 3:  
Safety will be summarized using descriptive statistics and reported separ
ately for Part 1 and Part 2  as well as across the entire study 
(Part  1 and Part 2) for select analyses. Adverse events will be assessed 
for subpopulations including Xyrem naïve, subjects on Xyrem at study entry, Ages 7-11, and Ages 12-17, as applicable. When summarizing data across the entire study by [CONTACT_270040], subjec ts 
are analyzed according to their initial enrollment status. For Part 1, adverse events will also be summarized b y treatment group and by 
[CONTACT_2715]. Safety analyses will also include an analysis of the nadir oxygen saturation level at each dose, and number and duration of any confirmed desaturations below 90%, 80%, 70%, 60% and 50% on PSG nights excluding the screening PSG. For Part 2, safety data will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_270041] 7-11, Ages 12-17, and overall.  
To address Secondary Objective 2:  
Concentration data for sodium oxybate will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_270042]. Dose proportionality will be assessed from the ratio of AUC and C
max values. The ratios and their 90% 
confidence intervals will be presented. If warranted, regression models will be used to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and dose on a mg/kg basis.  
An ongoing analysis of the PK data will also be conducted to 
chara
cterize the PK of Xyrem in children  and adolescents.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 158 1 INTRODUCTION 
Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution (NDA 21-196) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) 
for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (2002) and for the treatment of 
excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS) in patients with narcolepsy (2005). Xyrem is also approved in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (2005) and in the European Union ( EU) for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy 
(2005) and for use in the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy (2007).  Xyrem is currently marketed in the US, Canada, and 20 European countries. 
Xyrem ha s been on the US market for more than 14 ye
 ars. It is a Schedule III controlled 
substance available only through a restricted distribution program managed by [CONTACT_270043] a Risk  Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ( REMS ). Xyrem is a CNS 
depressant and is taken at night  in two equally divided doses. 
Narcolepsy is a life-long neurologic disease for which no cure has been identified. It affects an est
imated 0.02% to 0.067% of the population worldwide and approximately 1 in 2000 
individuals in the [LOCATION_002] ( Ohayon 2007, Majid & Hirshkowitz 2010) and 4.7 of 
10,000 (0.047%) individuals in the general population of five European countries ([LOCATION_008] ( [LOCATION_006]), [LOCATION_013], Italy, Portugal, and Spain) ( Ohayon et al. 2002). The 
symptomatology of this condition is  well described in the literature, with consensus on the 
five core symptoms of narcolepsy: EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, sleep -related 
(hypnagogic and hypnopompic) hallucinations, and disrupted nighttime sleep (DN S) 
(Morgenthaler et al. 2007 ), with EDS and cataplexy being the most common symptoms. 
Although the majority of adult patients with narcolepsy had symptoms develop before 15 yea
rs of age —in rare cases before 5 years of age—there are no approved treatments f or 
pediatric narcolepsy/cataplexy ( Dauvilliers et al. 2001 , Okun et al. 2002, Yoss & Daly 1960), 
although all treatments used for the treatment of adults are used to treat children with narcolepsy ( Mignot 2012 ). Modafinil, a commonly used treatment for adult narcolepsy, is not 
approved in children because of safety concerns related to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and, per the US product label and the EU  summary of product characteristics (S mPC), should not 
be used for any pediatric indication ( Provigil US presc ribing information (PI) 2010; Provigil 
SmPC 2012). Dextroamphetamine is the only medication that provides dosing information for pediatric  narcolepsy ( Dexedrine Spansules
® US PI  2010); however, it is not approved for 
the treatment of narcolepsy for children or adolescents in Europe. Other stimulants, which are often used for the treatment of EDS, and antidepressants, which are often used for cataplexy, may provide insufficient benefit and are associated with known risks. Clearly a need exists for safe and effective treatments for pediatric patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy.  
The detrimental effects of narcolepsy on daily functioning and activities, psychosocial 
funct
ioning, quality of life, and work performance as well as effects on personal and public 
safety, given the increased risk of automotive and equipment accidents are well described 
in the literature on adult patients  (Broughton et al. 1981, Ingravallo et al. 2012). The effects 
of narcolepsy on the lives of pediatric patients (children and adolescents younger than 18 
years of age) are less commonly described but equally burdensome. Pediatric narcolepsy is associated with limitations on children’s activities due to EDS and cataplexy, poor

Xyrem has been used to treat narcolepsy symptoms in children and adolescents. Data from 
pub

therapeutic response to Xyrem in the two age groups (<18 and ≥18 years). Post  marketing

information on Xyrem in the pediatric population.  
1.1 Background and Rationale 
This study is being conducted under the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) pediatric 
Written Request.  
On February 24, 2016, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB )  for this study 
reviewed the results from a pre -planned interim analysis of the primary efficacy results based 
on [ADDRESS_328844] 
2 weeks of the Stable -Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double- Blind Treatment Period at a 
significance level of p<0.005. Based on this analysis, the DSMB recommended that the placebo treatment in the Double-B lind Withdrawal Period  of the trial be stopped and the 
open-label portion of the study be continued, so as not to expose further subjects to placebo treatment. Amendment 4 to this protocol was based on that recommendation. The current amendment (Amendment 5) provides subjects who have completed one year in  the study 
(Part  1) the opportunity to continue treatment for up to an  additional [ADDRESS_328845]. 
1.1.1  Clinica
 l Experience  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adult Studies  
The eff ectiveness of Xyrem in treating the two main symptoms of narcolepsy —EDS and 
cataplexy —in adult subjects was demonstrated in three controlled clinical trials with 611 
patients with narcolepsy (398 subjects treated with Xyrem). Adverse events seen with  
frequ encies of ≥ 5% and twice the rate of placebo  in Xyrem -treated patients were nausea 
(20.9%), dizziness (19.7%), vomiting (8.5%), enuresis (6.5%), and diarrhea (5%). Xyrem 
was also evaluated in one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials in 
patients with fibromyalgia; however, Xyrem is not approved for fibromyalgia. Results of those studies indicate a similar safety profile to that seen in clinical trials for narcolepsy

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 158 (Moldofsky et al. 2010, Russell et al. 2011, Spaeth et al. 2012, Spaeth et al. 2013).  A study in 
patie nts with moderate to severe slee p apnea was conducted as a post marketing commitment 
(requirement).  Xyrem treatment was not associated with an increase in apnea hypopnea 
index ( AHI) but some clinically significan t desaturations were observed  (George  et al . 2010). 
The PK of Xyrem was extensively characterized in the clinical program that supported use of this
 drug for the indications of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem is 
eliminated almost exclusively by [CONTACT_270044] ( Xyrem  US PI  2016). Following oral administration, Xyrem is absorbed 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_269991], with an absolute bioavailability of about 88%. The average peak concentrations (C
max) following administration of each of two 
2.25 g doses given under fasting conditions 4 hours apart were similar. The average time to peak plasma concentration (T
max) ranged from 0.5 to 1.25 hours. Following oral 
administration, the plasma concentrations of sodium oxybate increased more than dose-proportionally, with blood levels increasing 3.7-fold as the total daily dose is doubled from 4.5 to 9 g.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pediatric Studies  
EFFICACY DATA IN THE LITERATURE  
The effectiveness of  Xyrem in pediatric patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy has been 
described in five published studies: one controlled study and four published retrospective case analyses, with a combined total of 100  patients ( Murali & Kotagal 2006, Aran et al. 
2010, Lecend reux et al. 2012, Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012, Huang & Guilleminault 2009 ). 
Overall, Xyrem was shown to be effective in treating the symptoms of cataplexy, EDS, and DNS in narcolepsy in the scientific literature reporting its effects in children and adolesce nts. 
SAFETY DATA IN THE LITERATURE  
Safety data from Xyrem in children and adolescents with narcolepsy/cataplexy were reported in six  published studies: four retrospective case analyses and two prospective studies, with a 
combined total of 109 patients who took Xyrem for 2 to 90 months (Murali & Kotagal 2006, Aran et al. 2010, Lecendreux et al. 2012, Mansukhani & Kotagal 2012, Huang & Guilleminault 2009, Poli et al. 2012) . The safety profile of Xyrem in children and 
adolescents as reported in the scientific literature is similar to the known safety profile of Xyrem in adults.  
Adverse events reported in these six studies were similar to those seen with adults. Adverse event
s reported by [CONTACT_726] 10% of patients in any one study were as follows: weight loss, 
headache, nausea, DNS, irritability, parasomnias, dry mouth, increased awakenings, dizziness, terminal insomnia, groaning, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. There were no reports of premature puberty in 11 pre-pubertal children taking Xyrem ( Aran  et al. 2010 ) or adverse effects on 
growth parameters including weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) in a study of 15 children and adolescents (Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012). In these publications, the most 
serious AEs were increased nightmares and suicidal ideation and gesture in a 9- year-old 
patient (Murali & Kotagal 2006).  
Reasons for discontinuations across the six studies included increased nightmares and suic
idal ideation, dissociative feelings, and problems receiving drug shipments ( Murali & 
Kotagal 2006); AEs  (not specified) in 18% of pre-pubertal patients, lack of efficacy in 15%

2010); sleep loss and persistent nausea, each in 2 of 27 (7%) patients (Lecendreux et al. 
2012); nausea, constipation and dissociative feelings in 1 of 15 (7%) patients, and body aches and dizziness in 1 of 15 (7%) patients who later resumed use of the drug (Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012); and nausea in 1 of 9 (11%) patients (Poli et al. 2012). Huang 
& Guillemina ult (2009) did not report discontinuations. These reasons for discontinuation are 
common in adult patients as well.  
PHARMACOKINETIC DATA  
There are no PK data on Xyrem in children under [ADDRESS_328847] consequences on absorption bioavailability, clearance, and biotransformation of drugs, is functionally mature by [CONTACT_2902] 1 year of age ( Walthall et al. 
2005). Intrav enous GHB has been used and studied in children at doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg 
(Rousseau et al. 2012) and up to 90 mg/kg for sedation ( Meyer et al. 2003); and at doses up 
to 100 mg/kg for anesthesia ( Hunter et al. 1971). The central nervous system ( CNS ) effects 
were consistent with those obtained with intravenous GHB in adults ( Kleinschmidt & 
Mertzlufft 1995, Solway & Sadove 1965 ), suggesting that post-absorption PK and 
pharmacodynamics are similar in children and adults.

antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], 2 used SSRIs, and one used an antidepressant (Xyrem IB). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_328851] ug Interaction  
Several drug -dru g interaction studies in healthy volunteers (Xyrem with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], 
protriptyline, modafinil, omeprazole, duloxetine, tramadol, lorazepam, ibuprofen, diclofenac, 
and divalproex sodium ) were conducted to evaluate the effects of co -administration of 
medications likely to be used concomitantly with Xyrem. There were no significant PK or pharmacodynamic ( PD) interactions between Xyrem and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], protriptyline, modafinil, 
omeprazole, duloxetine, tramadol, lorazepam, or ibuprofen. 
• Co-administration of Xyrem with diclofenac showed no significant differences in plasma 
PK or r 
enal excretion of sodium oxybate, and it did not appear to affect the PK of 
diclofenac. However, PD interactions , including reduced impairments to attention, were 
observed in the co- administration of Xyrem with diclofenac.  
• Co-administration of Xyrem with divalproex sodium resulted in an increase in AUC and 
an i
ncrease in renal clearance of sodium oxybate; C max was unchanged. It did not appear 
to affect the PK  of valproic acid.  Pharmacodynamic interactions were also observed 
following co- administration; these included increased impairment to cognitive function 
and increased sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
Among adverse events (AEs) occurring in at least 2 healthy subjects in any treatment group 
in the
se studies, the following AEs were seen more frequently with co -administration than 
with Xyrem alone:  
• Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]: dizziness

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Under Amendment 5, this study is divided into two parts: Part 1 includes one year of 
treatment, and Part 2 , the Open-Label Continuation Period, provides the opportunity to 
continue treatment for up to an additional 2 years.  
Part 1 of t his study was initially designed as a dou ble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-
withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral 
solution. As a result of a preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy results on the primary efficacy endpoint, the protocol was  amended (Amendment 4) to 
replace the placebo treatment in the Double- Blind Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem 
treatment . After Amendment 4 becom ing effective, all subjects entering the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period will receive open -label Xyrem treatment. For administrat ive reasons, the 
term “Double-Blind Treatment Period” will continue to be used throughout the protocol. Following the Double-Blind T reatment P eriod (2  weeks), Part [ADDRESS_328852] completed one year in the study and to monitor the long- term safety of Xyrem. 
Upon approval of Amendment 5, subjects who complete one year in the study (Part 1) may continue in Part 2, which will provide up to [ADDRESS_328853] 
occurrence of any of the following: 
• Up to an additional 2 years  
• U
ntil the subject reaches 18 years of age 
• U
ntil up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of pediatric data to the 
Xy
rem US prescribing information (PI)  
Children and adolescents, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy who are cur ren tly 
treated with Xyrem or are Xyrem naïve, with or without concomitant stable stimulant use , are 
eligible to enter the study. For this study, a Xyrem-naïve subject is defined as a subject who

Clinical Study Protocol: [ADDRESS_328856] be evaluated by [CONTACT_25899] 
(PSG
) for sleep -disordered breathing during the Part 1 Screening Period.  
Blood volumes drawn during the study should not exceed the amounts recommended in the guid
ance from Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( Appendix 4), European Union (EU) Guidelines 
(2008),  or ot
her local regulations. Therefore, for those subjects on Xyrem at study entry who 
have low body weight and are participating in the PK evaluation  during the Stable Dose 
Period , it is recommended that the screening blood draw be performed at the beginning of the 
Part [ADDRESS_328857] drug -dispensing visit; however, 
additional screening time may be granted with permission of the Medical Monitor , if needed . 
Subjects re- enrolling in Part [ADDRESS_328858] at the Part 2 Screening visit (Visit 17). For these subjects, Visit [ADDRESS_328859] drug -dispens ing visit (Visit 18) may 
occur on the same day. 
3.1.2  Open- Labe
 l Titration Period for Subjects who are Xyrem  naïve (up to 
10 weeks)  
For subjects who are Xyrem  naïve  or who re-enroll in Part 2 and require titration (i.e., have 
been off Xyrem for ≥ 1 month) , Xyrem therapy will be initiated based on the subjects’ weight 
as specified in Table 1. Xyrem doses are administered in two equally divided doses (see 
Secti
on 5.3).    
Subjects will be titrated on Xyrem to achieve a maximum clinical benefit in cataplexy and EDS
 while maintaining tolerability. Dose adjustment during the Part [ADDRESS_328860]’s weight to a dose 
level no higher than the maximum dose described in Table 1 in 10 weeks. The s tudy drug 
titration rate is ≤ 1 g/night/week for subjects <45 kg, and ≤ 1.5 g/night/week for subjects 
≥45 kg ( Table 1). Each dose must match a printed line on the dosing syringe ( Figure  4). Once 
t
he Xyre m dose has been optimized  per the Investigator’s judgment , the subject may enter 
the open- label Stable -Dose  Period  (for Part 1) or continue in the Open -Label Continuation 
(for Part 2) with that dose.

may be attempted at the Investigator’s discretion during the Open -Label Ti tration Period. 
3.1.3  Open- Labe l Stable -Dose  (Stable -Dose) Period (2- 3 weeks)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For Subjects on Xyrem at S tudy Entry  
Subjects who have been titrated to a stable dose of Xyrem prior to study entry will remain on the stable dose and regimen (i.e., two equally divided doses or two unequally divided doses) of Xyrem, and a stable stimulant dose if applicable, for 3 weeks with the exception of PK nights (if applicable) (see Section 3.1.7) . During the first week of this 3 -w
 eek period, 
subjects and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) will become familiar with methods of recor ding 
efficacy and safety data.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  For Xyrem -naïve Subjects  
Xyrem -naïve subjects w ho have been titrated to an optimal Xyrem dose and a stimulant dose 
(if applicable), during the Open- Label Titration Period, will remain on the dose that is 
established at the end of the Open -Label Titration Period for 2 weeks during the Stable -Dose  
Period. S ubjects and/ or parent(s)/guardian(s) will become familiar with the methods of

During the Double- Blind  Period, subjects will remain on  the same dosing regimen they used 
during the Stable- Dose Period , with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all 
subjects have to take two equally divided doses 4 hours apart. For subjects on concomitant 
stimulant therapy, subjects will remain on the same stable stimulant dose as at the end of the Stabl e-Dose  Period during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period.  
Subjects who complete the entire 2- week D

will receive open -label Xyrem  treatment during this period. 
3.1.5  Open- Labe l Safety Period (to allow up to 1 year Xyrem exposure)  
Subjects who are eligible to participate in the Open -Lab el Safety Period will participate in 
this period for 47 weeks if they entered the study on a stable dose of Xyrem or for a period of 38-45 weeks if they entered as Xyrem naïve, depending on the duration of the titration period in which they participated ([ADDRESS_328863] titration period will be 3 weeks for those subjects who reach an optimal response very quickly during titration).  
All study procedures and assessments will be carried out according to the planned schedule 
(chan
ges in Xyrem dose will generally not affect the schedule).  
All subjects will be seen in the clinic 4  week s after the Open -Label Safety Period begins 
(Visit 5) and then at Weeks 18, 26, 39, and 52 from study entry (Day 1). However, if in the case of subjects who are Xyrem naïve, Visit [ADDRESS_328864] clinic visit of the Open -Label Safety Period will be the Week 18 visit.

their
 optimal dose as tolerated according to the Investigator’s judgment (the maximum dose 
should not exceed the doses defined in Table 1 or the stable dose prior to study entry, whic 
hever is higher, and should not be greater than 9 g/night). Xyrem dose uptitration is 
allowed at no more than 1.5 g/night, and during dose up titration the Investigator must monitor tolerability, which includes AEs observed at night, such as confusion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], sleepwalking and other parasomnias; residual effect and AEs observed during daytime, such as confusion, somnolence, pronounced levels of depressed consciousness, depressed mood and suicidality, anxiety, abuse or misuse of Xyrem, and weight loss. 
Subjects may take two equally divided doses or two unequally divided doses with the 
exc
eption of PK nights (if applicable) when all subjects have to take two equally divided 
doses 4 hours apart. Xyrem dose adjustment due to tolerability and efficacy is permitted. Only doses that match the printed gradations (lines) on the dosing syringe are permitted.  
3.1.6  Safety Follow -up Vi
 sit ([ADDRESS_328866] Part 1 termination)   
If a subject does not complete Part [ADDRESS_328867] received up to 12 months (52 w
eeks) active treatment. The duration of Part [ADDRESS_328868] udy  sites  during Part 1, eligible subjects will additionally participate in the PK 
evaluation . Subjects will be stratified to two age groups: [ADDRESS_328869], or when enrollment of 100 subjects in the study has been reached, enrollment in th e PK evaluation  
will stop
 and existing data will be analyzed and reported.   
Eligible subjects will spend two nights in the clinic for the PK evaluation (PK Nights 1 and 
2). P
K evaluation will occur at any  time while subjects are on a stable dose of Xyrem.  
On PK Night 1, s ubj ects will receive one half of their usual and current total nightly Xyrem 
dose (administered as two equally divided doses, given while in bed  at bedtime and 4 hours 
later).  Subjects will return to the clinic for PK Night 2 and will receive Xyrem at their stable, usual dose (administered as two equally divided doses, given while in bed at bedtime and

therefore, if a dose cannot be measured using the lines on the dosing syringe, the dose should 
be decreased to the next lower printed line on the dosing syringe. F or example, if a subject is 
supposed to take a total dose of 4.25 g  on a PK night, then the two equally divided doses 
would be 2.125 g each. There is no printed line for 2.125 g on the dosing syringe. The next lower  line on the syringe would be 2 g (see Figure  4). The subject would then take the t wo 
e 
qually divided doses of 2 g each, which would equal a total nightly dose of 4 g. The actual 
doses taken will be recorded on the CRF.

A limited number of blood samples will be taken to measure sodium oxybate concentrations 
on each  o
f these PK nights . Samples will be taken relative to the first nightly Xyrem dose at 
0 (pre -dose), 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 4 hours (pre -2nd dose), to characterize the PK of the first 
dose of Xyrem, and two samples will be taken to characterize the peak and residual exposure associated with  the second dose, at 4.[ADDRESS_328870] dose of Xyrem (total blood 
volume required for PK samples is 40 mL  taken over a minimum of 2  days ). Following the 
PK nights, subjects will resume their usual Xyrem dose and regimen and their stimulant d ose, 
if applicable .  
Subject s taking two unequally divided doses ar
 e eligible to participate in the PK evaluation if 
the subject s are willing  to take two equally divided doses [ADDRESS_328871] also match the printed lines on the dosing syringe (see above) .

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
A double-blind placebo controlled randomized-withdrawal study of Xyrem in adult narcolepsy patients , OMC -SXB -21, was one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_269995]. This study design ensures that all subjects are able to receive Xyrem tr eatment and minimize s the 
duration of placebo exposure. This study is being conducted under FDA’s pediatric Written Request , in which the Agency requested a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safe ty of sodium oxybate, combined with 
an open-label evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate, and an open- label

potentially more than one year in some subjects participating in a continuation of the open-label safety evaluation ) in pediatric patients who have narcolepsy with cataplexy. Placebo is 
the only control group used in this study, there are no other medications approved for the treatment of cataplexy.  In this study, the maximal time that any pediatric subject will be 
exposed to placebo is 2 weeks.    
As a result of a preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy results on the pr
imary efficacy endpoint, the protocol has been amended (Amendment 4) to replace 
placebo  treatment in the Double -Blind Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem treatment .

3.3 Study Duration 
It is anticipated that enrollment in Part 1 will be completed within 2 years. Following the Part 
1 Screening Period of up to 30 days ( if needed, additional time may be granted with 
permission of the Medical Monitor), the expected duration of study participation for each subject in Part [ADDRESS_328876]’s duration of participation in Part [ADDRESS_328877] provided ass ent, and whose parent(s) or guardian(s) have signed the informed 
consent form  in accordance with local IRB/IEC requirements . At least 100 subjects will be 
enrolled in the study. E very effort will be made to enroll approximately  30 subjects on 
Xyrem at study entry of the anticipated 100 subjects enrolled. O ther subjects enrolled will be 
Xyrem naïve at study entry . 
A subset of the subjects who are taking Xyrem at a stable dose for their narcolepsy symptoms will pa
rticipate in the PK evaluation  during Part  1. Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age 
groups (7-11 year olds and 12-17 year olds) will be enrolled. Every effort will be made  to

5 STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment 
Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution, 500 mg/mL 
Xyrem Placebo: a sodium citrate solution prepared in equimolar concentration to sodium in 
the 500 
mg/mL Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution and pH adjusted with malic acid  
(Placebo treatment only applicable to subjects who had already entered the Double-Blind Treatment prior to  Amendment 4 becoming effective).  
The bioequivalence of the study drug prepared in a flavored diluent versus prepared in water has b
een evaluated , and bioequivalence has been established . If available, a flavor ant that can 
be added to the water  that is used as diluent will be provided for study drug preparation if 
flavored diluent is requested by [CONTACT_423]/parent/guardian for palatability.  Sucralose in the 
flavorant is equivalent to 28 mg sucralose in 60 mL, or 56 mg per daily intake of Xyrem prepared with flavored diluent. The FDA acceptable daily intake (ADI)  for sucralose  is 
5 mg/kg body weight/day ( Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 64, 1998) and the European Union 
ADI is 0 – 15 mg/kg body weight ( SCF/CS/ADDS/EDUL/ 190 Final 12/9/2000).

subjects <45 kg, and ≤1.5 g/night/week for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_328897] may enter the 2- week  Stable -Dose  Period  if in Part 1 of the 
study or continue the Open -Label Continuation Period if in Part  2.   
At the end of the Stable -Dose  P eriod, subjects who had entered  the Double-Blind Period 
prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective were randomized 1:1 to receive either Xyrem or Xyrem placebo during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 158 • Xyrem: Active  Xyrem will be continued as a double- blind treatment at the stable dose 
taken  and regimen used in the previous 2 weeks  
• Placebo: Xyrem placebo will be initiated as a double -blin d treatment at a volume and 
regimen equivalent to that of the stable dose of X yrem taken in the previous 2 weeks.  
During the Double-Blind Period, subjects will remain on the same dosing regimen they used 
during
 the Stable- Dose Period , with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all 
subjects have to take two equally divided doses 4 hours apart. 
Subjects entering the Double-Blind Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing ef fective 
will receive open -label Xyrem treatment during this period. 
During the Part 1 Open -Label  Safety Period and following titration in  the Part 2 Open -Label 
Continuation Period subjects may take two equally divided doses or two unequally divided 
doses with the exception of PK nights, if applicable. Xyrem dose adjustment due to 
tolerability and efficacy  is permitted. Xyrem dose uptitration is allowed at no more than 
1.5 g/night. Only doses that match the printed gradations (lines) on the dosing syringe are permitted . 
Study Drug will be dispensed at clinic  vis
 its and, if applicable, at intervals specified by [CONTACT_270055]. Xyrem d oses on PSG  and PK nights will be administered by [CONTACT_270056]. Each Xyrem dose will be diluted with [ADDRESS_328898] 
In the studies reported in the literature, Xyrem doses used in children and adolescents were generally lower than the mean dose reported in adults (7.5 g/night). In one of these published studies, children with pre-pubertal onset of narcolepsy took a lower maximal Xyrem dose than those with peri- or post-pubertal onset ( Aran et al. 2010).  
Data from the Central Pharmacy that dispenses Xyrem in the US also indicate that most chil
dren take lower doses than adults, as would be expected if there were no great differences 
in metabolism between children  and adults and if effective doses were generally based on a 
mg/kg dose.  
Proposed starting doses and titration increments based on weight will be assessed in this 
stu
dy (Table  1).

Subjects should not engage in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, such as operating machinery or a motor vehic le or flying an 
airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking the second nightly dose of study drug. 
On PK Night 1 , subje
 cts in the PK evaluation will receive one half of their usual (stable) total 
nightly Xyrem dose (administered as two equally divided dose s, given at bedtime and 
4 hours later while in bed ). On PK Night 2 , PK subjects will receive the ir usual nightly dose 
(administered as two equally divided doses, given at bedtime and 4  hours later while in bed). 
Subjects whose equally divided dose does not match a line on the dosing syringe will take the 
dose that matches the next lowe r printed line  on the dosing syringe (see Section 3.1.7). Blood 
samp
les for PK assessment collected on these PK nights will allow assessment of dose 
proportionality within subjects.   
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
At the beginning of the Double- Blind  Treatment  Period , subjects  who enter ed this period 
prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective had been  randomized to either Xyrem at the stable 
dose established in the previous 2 weeks o r to Xyrem placebo at a volume equivalent to the 
Xyrem dose that was established  in the previous 2 weeks.  During the Double-Blind Period, 
subjects will remain on the same dosing regimen they used during the Stable-Dose Period, 
with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all subjects have to take two equally 
divided doses 4 hours apart . 
Subjects who enter the Double- Blind  Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing 
effective will receive open -label Xyrem treatment.  
5.5 Randomization  
Randomization only applies to subjects who had entered  the Double- Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Perio d prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective. 
Prior to Amendment 4, a statistician selected by [CONTACT_270057] a dynamic random
ization algorithm to assign treatments for the double-blind portion of the trial. The 
randomization will balance treatment assignment  for each age group (7 to  11 years and 12 to 
17 years) , for prior Xyrem usage (subjects on Xyrem at study entry and Xyrem- naïve 
subjects), and for location (US and ex- US). 
If emergency unblinding is required, for subjects who entered the double-blind period prior to Am
endment 4 becoming effective, the double- blind treatment assignment will be provided 
to the Investigator by [CONTACT_270058] (IVRS) or I nteractive Web 
Response System (IWRS) . The treatment assignments for approximately 35 subjects were

will be generally available upon final unblinding of the double-blind portion of the study.   
5.6 Blinding 
Blinding only applies to subjects who had entered the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period before Amendment 4 becoming effec tive.  A double-blind approach had 
been used  during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period  for subjects entering this period before 
Amendment 4 becom ing effective. Xyrem and Xyrem placebo oral solution were matched  in 
volume, flavor, and appearance to ensure adequate blinding.

Contact [CONTACT_270066] [ADDRESS_328911]’s medical history will be taken at Part [ADDRESS_328912] (prior to any narcolepsy treatment) and current  symptoms of 
narcolepsy including cataplexy, EDS , hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and DNS  will be 
recorded. The subject’s usual Xyrem regimen, if applicable, including how Xyrem is prepared, usual times taken , and the usual bedtime and awakening time will also be recorded. 
The Investigator will assess the severity of the subject’s cataplexy and narcolepsy overall 
prior to any treatment by [CONTACT_12550] a clinical global impression of  severity (CGIs) for 
historical narcolepsy overall and a CGIs for historical cataplexy  severity (see Section 6.6.7).  
If a s 
ubject re-enrolls in Part 2, their previously recorded medical history will be reviewed 
and updated. In addition, any new medical history that occurs after the last Part 1 study visit 
(Visit 16 ) and prior to re- enrollment will be recorded.  This would include any new clinically 
significant condition with onset after Visit 16 until assent/consent in Part 2.

Period, and at Visit 15 (Week 52 or Part 1 early termination) and will include a full examination of body systems (except a breast and genitourinary examination  other than the 
observational evaluation needed for the Tanner Stage Assessment ; Appendix 5) , a brief 
neur
ological examination, and height and body weight measurements.   
An additional brief neurological exam will be performed prior to allowing the subject to be disc
harged the mornin g after PSG and PK nights  (not applicable for the screening PSG for 
subjects who are naïve to Xyrem) .

6.5 Vital Signs and Pulse Oximetry 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse/heart and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) will be monitored and recorded on the CRF after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes. Vital signs will be collected at each o nsite visit in both Part 1 and 
Part 2 (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 22, Appendix 23, and Appendix 24).   
On P
SG nights, vital signs will be measured at the times specified in the schedules of events 
(Appendix 1.2 [subjects on Xyrem at study entry] and  Appendix 2.3 [Xyrem -naïve 
su
bjects] ). While the subject is being monitored with PSG, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_270006]. At times when the subject is not undergoing PSG ,

PK nights ( Appendix 3).  
Oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_270067] 1 Screening and on the mornings prior to discharge following 
PSG (excl uding screening PSG for Xyrem- naïve subjects)  and PK nights .  
On PSG n ights , for  subjects receiving study drug, oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be 
monitored continuously via PSG from the time immediately before  the first dose through 
[ADDRESS_328914] dose and will be recorded pre-dose and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h (pre -2nd dose),

6.6 Other Assessments  
6.6.1  Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_269985] (ESS  [CHAD])  
The ESS is a self - administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a 
person’s general level of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or their average sleep propensity in daily life.  It 
has been validated in narcolepsy and has demonstrated both a high specificity and sensitivity  
(Johns 1991, 2000). In t he ESS  (CHAD) for children and adol escents  (Appendix 6) , the third  
activ
ity was modified to  adapt to a school setting, the fourth activity was shortened from

activity . 
6.6.2  SF-10 Healt h Survey for Children  
The SF -10™ Health Survey for Children ( Appe ndix 7) is a parent -com pleted survey that 
contains 10 questions adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The SF-[ADDRESS_328918] 4- week recall period.  
6.6.3  Columbia- Sui
 cide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appe ndix 8). The 
inst
rument reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted 
suicide and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011). The C-SSRS is available in versions 
for children and adolescents and for use in clinical trials. The C -SSRS Children’s 
Baseline/Screening and the C -SSRS Children’s Since Last Visit versions will b e used in this 
study for subjects under 12 years of age. The Baseline/Screening and Since Last Visit versions will be used for subjects 12 years of age and older (Posner et al. 2011 and personal communication).  
6.6.4  Children’s Depression Inventory 2
nd Edition  Self-Report Short Version 
(CDI 2:SR[S])   
The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) is a widely used pediatric self- repo rt depressive 
symptoms assessment in clinical trials ( Myers & Winters 2002). It is a comprehensive 
assessment of depressive symptoms in youth ages 7 to 17 years. The second edition of the 
CDI Self -Report (CDI 2:SR) contains 28 items to cover the age-appropriate depressive 
symptoms which cover affective, cognitive, motivational, neuroveg etative, and secondary 
impairment domains. It covers the criterion symptoms of major depressive disorder and 
dysthymic disorder as operationalized in the DSM -IV. The CDI 2:SR[S] ( Appendix 9) is the 
short
 form of CDI 2:SR. It contains 12 items and takes about half the time of the full -
length  version to administer (5 –10 minutes). The short report form covers primarily affective, 
cognitive, and neurov egetative aspects of depression. It has been shown that the Total Score 
of the CDI  2:SR[S ] is highly correlated to  a Total Score on the selected items of the full-
length version ( Kovacs 2011). Due to its brevity, the CDI 2:SR[S] is a suitable screening 
assessment ; however, this scale is not validated in pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Many 
narcolepsy symptoms overlap with items assessed in the CDI 2:SR[S], e.g., feeling tired, not having fun (in order to control cataplexy attacks); therefore, this sc ale is used only as a 
screening assessment for the risk of depression in this study. 
6.6.5  Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 10-ite
 m (MASC -10) 
The MASC -10, a short version of the MASC, is a multidimen sion al measure with ten items 
that combine the basic anxiety scales from the long version to produce one score that

6.6.7  Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIs) Ques tionnaires  
Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIs) is a 7 -poin t Likert rating scale  and is a widely 
used assessment in clinical psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness.  The 
responses of this investigator- completed scale range from 1 = normal , no signs of illness, to 
7 = among the most extremely ill patients. Using the questionnaires described below, 
Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s condition before the subject received any narcolepsy treatment (historical) and the severity of the subject’s current condition at specified times during Part 1 of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CGIs for Historical Narcolepsy Overall Severity Prior to any Narcolepsy 
Treatment  
At Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s narcolepsy overall prior to any na rcolepsy treatment ( Appendix 15).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CGIs for Historical Cataplexy Severity Prior to any Narcolepsy Treatment  
At Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s cataplexy prior to any narcolepsy treatment ( Appendix 16).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CGIs for Narcolepsy Ove rall (current condition)  
Investigators will rate their impression of the subject’s current severity of narcolepsy overall at the following time points: Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), the start of the Stable -Dose Period 
(Visit 2 [for subjects on Xyrem at study  entry]) or beginning of titration (Visit 1.1 [for 
Xyrem -naïve subjects]) and the end of the Stable-Dose Period (Visit 3) ( Appendix 17).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CGIs for Ca taplexy Severity (current condition)  
Investigators will rate their impression of the subject’s current cataplexy severity at the following time points: Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), the start of the Stable -Dose Period (Visit 2 
[for subjects on Xyrem at study entry]) or beginning of Part 1 titration (Visit 1.1 [for Xyrem-naïve subjects]) and the end of the Stable-Dose Period (Visit 3) ( Appendix 18).  
6.6.8  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc)  for
  Narcolepsy Overall  
At the end of the Double- Blind  Treatment Period (Visit 4), the subject  (if needed, with the 
help of caregiver) will rate his/her narcolepsy overall since the last visit (Visit 3 [end of Stable-Dose Period]) on a  7-point scale ranging from “very much better ” to “very much 
worse ” (Appendix 19). If the subject discontinues during the Double-Blind Treatment Period, 
he

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 158 6.11 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The PK profile for two doses of Xyrem will be e valuated over an 8 -hour period in a subset of 
subjects on two PK nights. The PK parameters for plasma sodium oxybate concentrations 
will include, but may not be limited to: the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), maximum plasma drug concentration (C
max), and time to maximum plasma drug 
concentration (T max), over the first 4 -hour dosing interval. In addition, sodium oxybate 
concentrations at 4.75 hours (0.75 hours after the 2nd dose) and 8 hours (4 h ours after the 
2nd dose) will be measured to estimate peak and residual exposure associated with the second  nighttime dose. Dose proportionality will be based on the ratio of AUC values for 
each subject. Pharmacokinetics will be summarized for the 7 -11 and 12-17 year age  groups, 
and a comparison to historical PK data in adults will also be made.

• For subjects who continue directly into P art  [ADDRESS_328934] study visit ( Part 2 Study 
Termination Visit/Part 2 Early Termination Visit) will be recorded.  
• For subjects who complete Part [ADDRESS_328935] Part 1 study visit 
(through the Safety  Follow-up Visit) and all AEs occurring after assent has been given or 
the ICF has been signed  in Part [ADDRESS_328936] study visit ( Part 2 Study Termination

illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
spec
ific symptom. The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based 
on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_941] I nve
 stigator to be 
related or unrelated to the study drug or procedure, must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the 
AE CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the study drug or procedure. An AE is deemed to be a suspected adverse drug reaction  if there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641] (or 
medicinal product) or study procedure as defined in Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a] and ICH E2A II.A.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_57746], moderate, or severe as defined  
below. When the intensity of the AE changes over time, the change in intensity will be  
recorded  on the AE CRF as a new AE . 
Mild  Symptom(s) b arely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given. 
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subj ect uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities is influenced; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causes severe discomfort; symptom(s) incapacitate or 
significantly affect subject’s daily life; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’ s relationship to study drug or procedure is part of 
the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported . The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or 
contributing to the AE will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:

The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequen ce from administration of 
the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence:  
• Follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study drug or 
proc
edure. 
• Is confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] o r

the ev
ent—i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. In such 
case, the AE is considered an adverse reaction  (AR). A suspected  AR has 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an AR.  
Not Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure Event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event.

The study will be conducted according to GCP guidelines and according to local and national 
law. Quality audits may be performed at the discretion of Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its 
designee.  
9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy in pediatric subjects. Secondary objective s are to 
evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of EDS in pediatric subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy, to characterize the PK of Xyrem given as two doses to children and adolescents (ages 7 -17 years) with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and to evaluate the safety of 
titrating Xyrem in children and adolescents to an effective and tolerable dose.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -pa
 rametric analysis of 
covariance ( ANCOVA). Ordinal categorical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be 
analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel ( CMH ) tests for row mean score difference. PK 
parameters will be assessed by [CONTACT_6484] (ANOVA) models using natural log -
transformed data. S afety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  When data are 
reported by [CONTACT_551], either ages 7 -11 years or ages 12- 17 years , subjects will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_105237] 2 (start of the Stable -Dose Period) for subjects on Xyrem at study 
entry and at Visit 1.1 (start of the Titration Period) for Xyrem-naïve subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 158 9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The study will enroll pediatric subjects who are diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy 
and who are between 7 and 16 years of age, inclusive, to ensure subjects are <[ADDRESS_328983] 100 subjects will be enrolled in the study to assess 
the safety of Xyrem in this pediatric population.   
Prior to Amendment 4, a sample size of 70 subjects was planned to enter the randomized-
wit
hdrawal  (Double- Blind Treatment)  period. This sample size was estimated based on 
repeated resampling of the data with replacement ( bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) from previous narcolepsy 
trials in adults (GHB -2 and OMC- SXB -15). The analysis showed that a sample of 35 
subjects on Xyrem (sodium oxybate) treatment had at least 40% difference from endpoint to baseline in the mean weekly number of cataplexy attacks, as a percentage of endpoint, over 95% of the time. The present study (13-005) differs from S tudies GHB -[ADDRESS_328984] 80% power to detect a difference between the two treatment groups of 40% in the percentage change in the mean weekly number of cataplexy attacks during the [ADDRESS_328985] 2 weeks of the immediately preceding stable-dose period, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  
Every effort will be made to enroll approximately 30 subjects on Xyrem at study entry of the 
anti
cipated 100 subjects enrolled. O ther subjects enrolled will be Xyrem naïve at study entry.  
A subset of the subjects who are taking Xyrem at a stable dose for th eir  narcolepsy symptoms 
will participate in the PK evaluation . Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age groups (7 -11 
year olds and 12-17 year olds)  will be enrolled to ensure a minimum of [ADDRESS_328986] (DSMB), or when enrollment of [ADDRESS_328987] took study drug during the different study periods.

used to summarize exposure to double-blind treatment. This population may also be used for summaries of safety data specific to the Double- Blind  Treatment Period.  This population 
may also be used for an additional analysis of the primary and/or secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Continued Access Population will consist of all subjects who took study drug in Part 2.  
This
 population will be used for tables and listings of Part [ADDRESS_328989] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables. Tables for the randomized population and the efficacy population will be by [CONTACT_21964] (Xyrem or Xyrem placebo) and overall. The randomized population tables will include a comparison of the treatment groups, with categorical variables analyzed using a chi-square test and continuous variables analyzed using a one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as the only 
factor.  
9.5 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
The following methods will be used to handle missing efficacy data and data from subjects who discontinue early in the Double-Blind Treatment Period. The weekly  number of 
cataplexy attacks will be computed as the average from days with non -missing data, 
multiplied by 7. School attendance will be calculated as the number of missed days, multiplied by 100, divided by [CONTACT_270082] (not including holidays) up to the point of Part [ADDRESS_328990] Stable- Dose Period assessment of all other measures will be used as the end of the

1 Statistical Analysis  
To
 address Primary Objective 1 and Secondary Objective 1:  
A tiered approach was planned to control the Type 1 family-wise error rate at the 0.05 sign
ifican ce level with all tests being two -sided for testing of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
Due to the positive primary efficacy results from the pre- speci fied interim analyses 
(described in Section 9.8), the DSMB recommended to stop the Double- Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Period.  Tiered testing on secondary endpoints, as defined below, will be 
conducted with a significance level of 0.05, with all tests being two-sided. 
Tier 1: Primary endpoint 
1. Change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 2 weeks of the Sta ble-
Dose  Period to the 2 weeks of the Double- Blind  Treatment Period. 
The primary endpoint demonstrated efficacy at the interim analysis with a significance level 
<0.005.  T es
ting will continue with Tier 2 .  
Tier 2: Key s econda ry endpoint #2 
2. CGIc for catap lexy severity  from the end of the Stable -Dose  Period to the end of the 
Double- Blind  Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level. If Xyrem is sign
ificantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 3 tests will be conducted.  
Tier 3: Key s econda ry endpoint #3

4. CGIc for narcolepsy overall from th e e nd of the Stable- Dose Period to the end of the 
Double- Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level. If Xyrem is sign

Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be tested without multiplicity adjustments. For these param
eters, nominal p-value will be reported.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -pa rametric analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA). Ordinal categor ical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be 
analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) tests for row mean score difference.  
Efficacy data in the open -labe l phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].

summarized by [CONTACT_270083]. Dose proportionality will be assessed from the ratio of AUC and C
max 
values. The ratios and their 90% confidence intervals will be presented. If warranted, regression models will be used to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and dose on a mg/kg basis. 
9.8 Interim Analysis  
A preplanned interim analysis was conducted  after 35 subjects completed or discontinued 
early from the Double- Blind  Treatment Period . The interim analysis was  performed by a 
statistician not directly involved with the design and analysis of the study. The data were reviewed by a DSMB that recommended  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270017] -Blind 
Randomized-Withdrawal Period and continue the study as an open- label safety study  because 
of positive efficacy results . 
Considerations for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270018]. Given 
now the placebo treatment is stopped after the interim analysis review by [CONTACT_32622], the DSMB will continue to review safety and PK data as outlined below.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 of 158 For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270019] , so that fewer subjects will be 
exposed to placebo: The O'Brien- Fleming approach will be used with the primary effic acy 
endpoint. This endpoint will be tested at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_328993]’s safety. If the study is not stopped, to maintain an overall alpha of 0.05, the final analysis will be conducted at a significance level of 0.048, based on one prior look at the data. 
For s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_270020]:  In
  the interim analysis, if the 
null hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint is not rejected at the 0.005 significance 
level, then a futility analysis will be conducted. The conditional power approach will be used. Assuming the trend in the data observed up to the interim analysis will continue for the data collected between the interim analysis and the final analysis, the conditional power of rejecting the null hypothesis at the final analysis will be calculated. If the conditional power is less than 15%, it will be concluded that the study is unlikely to demonstrate efficacy and the DSMB may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270021]’s safety. T he study may be  discontinued early due to futility. 
For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270022]:  Saf
 ety data, including the 
incidence of adverse events, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_270084]. Any serious adverse events or deaths will be given detai led attention. Taking all data reviewed into 
account, the DSMB will determine if the risk to subjects warrants study discontinuation.   
An ongoing analysis of the PK data will also be conducted to determine if a sufficient 
number
 of samples have been colle cted to adequately characterize the PK of Xyrem in 
children and adolescents.

 SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated w ith the act, then it can be consid ered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigge r while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual deni es intent/wish to die, it may be inferred c linically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but su icide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Did you ever do anything  to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do? 
Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all  to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get 
something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior w ithout suicidal intent)  
If yes, describe: 
 
Has subject engaged in Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior?

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_270093]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather t han an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by  [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an at tempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hangi ng: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to make yourself not alive anymore (end your life or kill yourself) but 
someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything? What did you do?

method (e.g., buying pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purchasing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by [CONTACT_20673] (e.g., giving things away, writing a suic ide note).  
Have you done anything to get ready to make yourself not alive anymore (to end your life or kill yourself)- like giving things

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated  with the act, then it can be  considered an actual suicide 
attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual deni es intent/wish to die, it may be inferred c linically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be infe rred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpin g from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but th ey thought that what they did c ould be lethal, intent may be in ferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy, or get something else to happen )?  (Self-Injurious Behavior w ithout suicidal intent)

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types ) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done any thing to harm yourself?   
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, g et 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior witho ut suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_156279]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).

Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger . Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no act ual medical damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away

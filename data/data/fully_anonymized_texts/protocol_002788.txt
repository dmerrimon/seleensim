2PRÉCIS
Background:
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and surveillance are treatment options for prostate 
cancer patients with biochemical progression after localized therapy (i.e., biochemically 
recurrent [BCR] prostate cancer). The primary goal in these patients is to prevent 
morbidity from their cancer that results from disease progression and metastatic disease 
on conventional imaging. 
ADT can lower the PSA in these patients, but because of its substantial side effect profile 
and ambiguous long-term impact, it is generally deferred by [CONTACT_605365] a 
rapid escalation in their PSA. 
Immunotherapy presents an alternative option for these patients that is especially 
attractive because it is not associated with substantial toxicity. Also, since 
immunotherapy can have lasting effects after treatment due to a sustained activated 
immune response, patients will not be required to take these treatments indefinitely to 
potentially benefit clinically.
Current and previous clinical trials have demonstrated that single agent immunotherapy 
can impact PSA in patients in this population.
The focus of this study is to determine if combination immunotherapy with immune-cell 
mobilizing vaccines can initiate an immune response in the first 4 months that is then 
augmented by [CONTACT_605366] 3 months.
In addition to PSA responses (the primary metric in this population), safety, changes in 
immune responses, and PSA kinetics will also be evaluated. 
Objectives:
Primary Objectives:
Safety Lead-In: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination immunotherapy in 
participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer
Biochemical Recurrence: To determine if the combination immunotherapy can induce a 
30% decline in PSA in 28% of participants with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. 
Eligibility Criteria (for biochemical recurrence):
Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate  
Participants with negative CT Scan and Tc-99m Bone Scan  
Participants with a PSA over 0.8 ng/ml for participants following radical prostatectomy 
or for participants following definitive radiation therapy: a rise in PSA of ≥ 2 ng/mL 
above the nadir 
Participants with a PSA doubling time of 5-15 months
No history of active autoimmune disease or history of organ compromising autoimmune 
disease
ECOG 0-1
Safety lead-in cohort will evaluate 6 participants with castration resistant prostate cancer

3Design:
Three-arm, non-randomized study
Accrual goal is a total of 37 evaluable participants (6 in an initial safety cohort, 6 
participants who received M7824 as part of the initial investigation and 25 homogenously 
treated participants) to evaluate response
Participants from an on-going study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) with nearly identical eligibility can 
serve as a contemporary control for secondary endpoints
Following the safety lead-in, all participants will be enrolled and may undergo a 
surveillance period during which up to 4 consecutive monthly PSA values will be 
captured by [CONTACT_605367]. 
After surveillance period, if applicable, participants will be treated with 2 vaccines 
concurrently, Prostvac and CV301, during months 1-4. For months 5-7, MSB0011359C 
[an anti-PD-L1 antibody (avelumab) with TGFβ-Trap molecule] will be added to the 
regimen.
oEffective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as 
part of the treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 
and 3)
Participants will be monitored for on-treatment and post-treatment PSA, immune and 
imaging responses.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary Objectives
Safety Lead-In: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination immunotherapy in 
participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer
Biochemical Recurrence: Determine if the combination immunotherapy can induce a 30% 
decline in PSA in 28% of participants with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. 
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives
Assess the safety of the combination immunotherapy regimen
Changes in PSA kinetics after treatment with the combination immunotherapy, relative to 
baseline PSA kinetics
1.1.3 Exploratory Objective
Immune changes after treatment with 2 vaccines for 4 months
Correlate changes in PET images to changes in PSA over time
Evaluate changes in the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract and correlate to changes 
in treatment, PSA and immune cell subpopulations
Evaluate the decline in PSA in participants who received vaccine as well as MSB0011359B 
prior to its being discontinued.
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Rationale for conducting the study in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients
Although surgery or radiation can cure the majority of newly diagnosed patients, 20-40% are likely 
to have recurrent disease manifested as a rising PSA despi[INVESTIGATOR_605343] 
(CT and technetium-99m (Tc-99m) Bone Scan) used to detect metastasis.[1, 2] This stage of 
disease is often referred to as biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

Version Date:  05/10/2023
10Figure 1:Poxviral vaccine strategy: Modified poxvirus contains transgenes for the tumor-associated antigen PSA and 3 T-cell 
costimulatory molecules [8, 9].
Figure 2:Prostvac improved survival in mCRPC patients in a randomized multi-center phase II trial. [11]
Prostvac 
is very well-tolerated, with common side effects of grade 1 injection-site reactions or flu-
like symptoms.[11, 12] A favorable side effect profile and the potential ability to induce a sustained 
antitumor immune response, clinical trials are ongoing evaluating strategies to use Prostvac in 
earlier disease patients. A previous study of Prostvac in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer 
suggested that this treatment could slow/improve PSA doubling in 25 patients from a median of 
5.3 months to 7.7 months.[13] A randomized prospective study is currently evaluating this 
hypothesis with the same treatment dosing and schedule as the previous study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
The treatment dosing and schedule for this combination immunotherapy study is the same as the 
previous studies.
1.2.[ADDRESS_801615] been reported as relevant immunologic targets in prostate cancer. 
CEA has been reported as elevated in the circulation of nearly 50% of 141 patients evaluated with 
advanced disease.[14] A separate study suggested that more than [ADDRESS_801616] been found to express MUC1 and over 90% of metastatic lesions in lymph nodes have also 
been found to express MUC1.[15] Furthermore, more aggressive disease (higher Gleason Score) 
has also been associated with greater MUC1 expression.[15] Immunologic studies here at the NCI 
have demonstrated that despi[INVESTIGATOR_605344]-based vaccines, increased 
immunologic targeting of MUC1 and CEA have occurred.[16] Across several other trials, broad 
immunologic targeting of multiple antigens after immunotherapy has been associated with better 
clinical outcomes.[17]

Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801617] approach based on the administration of a replicating-competent 
Vaccinia-based delivery vector followed by a Fowlpox vector. Both vectors encoded the 
transgenes for B7.1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3, together with the CEA and MUC-1. In order to establish 
its therapeutic potential, several preclinical studies were performed, showing that PANVAC 
activates antigen-specific human T cells in vitro [18],elicits antibody and cellular immune 
responses in vivo, and shows significant antitumor efficacy against tumors expressing either human 
CEA or MUC-1 in mice, resulting in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) up-regulation within 
the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, the clinical development program continued with the 
design of several clinical trials to further confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention. 
Overall, the results of Phase I and II clinical trials in different cancer populations employing 
PANVAC monotherapy or in combination with GM-CSF or docetaxel demonstrate a good safety 
profile accompanied by [CONTACT_311806].[19, 20] 
A second-generation 
cancer immunotherapy strategy was developed, giving rise to CV301 
involving a modified vaccinia. CV301 is a recombinant non-replicating poxvirus-based 
immunotherapy encoding the same 5 transgenes used in PANVAC (B7.1, ICAM-1, LFA-3, CEA 
and MUC-1) and thus designed to activate an antigen-specific response. Therefore, tumors 
expressing these antigens, including prostate cancer, qualify as a potential indication for CV301. 
Given the potential risks associated with the replicating capacity of the vaccinia-based PANVAC-
V construct, the next generation cancer immunotherapeutic candidate MVA-BN-CV301 was 
generated  It constitutes a 
recombinant non-replicating poxvirus- based immunotherapy derived from the MVA-BN 
construct. This novel viral vector was developed from the highly attenuated vaccinia virus known 
as MVA, which after more than [ADDRESS_801618] 
approximately 15% of the original vaccinia genome. Furthermore, MVA-BN differs from other 
MVA strains in its extensive plaque purification and propagation in serum-free conditions, and has 
already undergone extensive investigation as a new smallpox vaccine. Within this comprehensive 
clinical development program, MVA-BN has been administered to more than 7,[ADDRESS_801619] specific antigens.
The new CV301 strategy encodes the same 5 transgenes expressed by [CONTACT_311808]: CEA, MUC-1, B7.1, ICAM-[ADDRESS_801620] 
regimen employing an MVA-BN-CV301 priming dose followed by a Fowlpox-based FPV-CV301 
boosting dose, thus replacing the former PANVAC-V and PANVAC-F components. Given the

expected, CV-301 was well tolerated in all 12 patients with no DLT noted. The only attributable 
toxicities were grade 1 and 2 and mostly injections site reactions and flu-like symptoms, with other 
rare toxicities such as headache and nausea (also grade 2 or less) also reported. There were no 
grade 3 or greater toxicities reported in the study. 
1.2.5 PD-L1 TGFβ Trap (MSB0011359C)
MSB0011359C is a bifunctional fusion protein that combines an anti-programmed death ligand 1
(PD-L1) antibody and the soluble extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) 
receptor type II as a TGFβ neutralizing “trap,” into a single molecule. This anti-PD-L1 / TGFβ-
Trap molecule is designed to target 2 major mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumor 
microenvironment. The anti-PD-L1 moiety of MSB0011359C is identical to avelumab, except for 
three amino acid substitutions in the heavy chain constant regions, which result in a different 
human IgG1 allotype, and one amino acid substitution in the heavy chain for antibody stability. 
Avelumab (proposed international non-proprietary name [CONTACT_605400]0010718C) is currently in Phase 
II / III clinical development .
The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an important mechanism for tumor immune evasion.[21] Effector T cells 
chronically sensing antigen take on an exhausted phenotype marked by [CONTACT_4002]-[ADDRESS_801622] signaling components or through oncogenic reprogramming.[22] Upon loss of 
sensitivity to TGFβ inhibition, the tumor continues to produce high levels of TGFβ, which then 
serve to promote tumor growth.[22] The TGFβ  cytokine is overexpressed in various cancer types 
with correlation to tumor stage.[22, 23] Many types of cells in the tumor microenvironment 
produce TGFβ, including the tumor cells themselves, immature myeloid cells, regulatory T cells, 
and stromal fibroblasts; these cells collectively generate a large reservoir of TGFβ in the 
extracellular matrix. TGFβ signaling contributes to tumor progression by [CONTACT_605368], 
stimulating angiogenesis, and suppressing innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.[22] As a 
broadly immunosuppressive factor, TGFβ directly down regulates the effector function of 
activated cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and potently induces the differentiation of 
naïve CD4+ T cells to the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) phenotype.[23] In 
addition, TGFβ polarizes macrophages and neutrophils to a wound-healing phenotype that is 
associated with production of immunosuppressive cytokines.[24] As a therapeutic strategy, 
neutralization of TGFβ  activity has the potential to control tumor growth by [CONTACT_605369], blocking metastasis, and inhibiting angiogenesis. In prostate cancer, TGFβ 
has been associated in poor outcomes or disease recurrence in early stage patients, perhaps 
suggesting that it may be a therapeutic target ([25],[26]).

Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
13MSB0011359C also binds TGFβ (preferentially 1 and 3 isoforms), an inhibitory cytokine 
produced in the tumor microenvironment by [CONTACT_605370], myeloid-
derived suppressor cells, T cells, and tumor.[21, 27] Inhibition of TGFβ by [CONTACT_605371]βRII 
reduced malignant mesothelioma tumors in a manner that was associated with an increase in CD8+ 
T cell antitumor effects.[28] The absence of TGFβ1  produced by [CONTACT_195713]4+ T cells and Treg 
cells has been shown to inhibit tumor growth, and protect mice from spontaneous cancer.[29]  
Thus, TGFβ appears to be important for tumor immune evasion. 
Combining these pathways, PD-1 / PD-L1 and TGFβ, is attractive as an antitumor approach. A 
recent report found that blockade of TGFβ signaling in T cells or deletion of TGFβ1 from T cells 
in a mouse model led to diminished PD-1 expression in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells.[29] 
Concomitant PD-1 and TGFβ blockade can restore pro-inflammatory cytokines.[30] In a murine 
model of hepatocellular carcinoma, TGFβ  appeared to increase the expression of PD-L1 in 
dendritic cells, which in turn promoted T-cell apoptosis and increased percentage of CD25+, 
Foxp3+ T regulatory cells.[31] Higher levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs), a significant source of TGFβ, are associated with failure to respond to anti-PD-1 
therapy.[32]
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] is a phase 1, open label, 3+3 dose-escalation study and this preliminary data was  
presented at AACR in April, 2017. Eligible patients received MSB0011359C at 1, 3, 10, or 20 
mg/kg Q2W until confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal; 
treatment beyond progression is generally allowable. The primary objective is to determine the 
safety and maximum tolerated dose of MSB001359C; secondary objectives include 
pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and best overall response per RECIST v1.1. As of Oct 
3, 2016, [ADDRESS_801623] received 
MSB0011359C. Our PK data show a dose-linear increase in exposure; furthermore, at the 
examined dose levels, MSB0011359C saturates peripheral PD-L1 and sequesters any released 
plasma TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 throughout the dosing period. Grade 3 drug-related treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 3 patients (skin infection secondary to grade 2 
bullous pemphigoid [BP], lipase increased, anemia, and colitis); there were no grade 4-5 drug-
related TEAEs. BP and colitis responded well to steroids. Colitis and its secondary events of 
anemia and rectal hemorrhage (in a previously radiated area) were considered dose-limiting in 1 
patient. (See full table of AEs in table below). There was preliminary evidence of efficacy across 
all dose levels, including 1 ongoing confirmed complete response (cervical cancer), 1 durable 
partial response (pancreatic cancer), a 25% reduction in the sum of diameters of target lesions after 
only 2 doses of MSB001359C (cervical cancer), and 2 cases of prolonged stable disease 
(pancreatic cancer; carcinoid). Updated data will be presented. Preliminary data from this phase [ADDRESS_801624] that MSB0011359C has a manageable safety profile in patients with 
heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors. Early evidence of clinical efficacy warrants further 
study. The recommended phase 2 dose is a flat dose of 1200 mg every 2 weeks.

As of [ADDRESS_801625] 2018, clinical activity of MSB0011395C has been observed in the dose 
escalation cohorts of EMR200647-001. For the 40 participants analyzed at the 1200mg level, 
Overall Response Rate (ORR) assessed by [CONTACT_605372] 25%, with median progression-
free survival (PFS) of 2.7 months and overall survival of 17.1 months (data cutoff 15 October 
2019). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_801626] demonstrated that in vivo broadening of the immune response through 
targeting of additional antigens after immunotherapy can lead to better outcomes. This process is 
called antigen spreading or antigen cascade.[33] Although this has been seen and reported 
previously with single vaccine administration, it is possible that in vivo broadening of the immune 
response could be augmented by [CONTACT_605373].

15Preclinical models support this hypothesis using two vaccines in a female C57BL/6 (H-2b) mouse 
model.[34] These studies demonstrated that concurrent administration of two vaccines induced a 
more diverse T-cell population that lead to enhanced antitumor efficacy. These studies provide the 
rationale for clinical studies investigating concurrent administration of vaccine platforms to 
enhance the antigen-specific immune response. This strategy has not been tested in prostate cancer 
to this point and this study will be the first to explore this strategy and its impact immunologically 
and on PSA in biochemical recurrence. Given that both vaccines are well tolerated with negligible 
side effect profiles, there are limited concerns about toxicity from this combination.
1.2.[ADDRESS_801627] failed to demonstrate clear single agent efficacy 
in prostate cancer. Two studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_605345] 
3 studies.[35, 36] Anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 have demonstrated only limited benefits. The study 
that has generated the most interest to this point involves pembrolizumab in mCRPC.[37] That 
study has reported a response rate of about 15-20% in the first 30 patients, typi[INVESTIGATOR_605346]. In order to enhance response to anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 inhibition, 
combinations with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605347].[38] In this manner, immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could be 
enabled by [CONTACT_4002]1/PDL1 inhibition.
This is likely the underlying mechanism for the approved ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] /nivolumab combination in 
metastatic melanoma.[39] Anti-CTLA-4 (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) is able to activate immune cells in the 
periphery and within tumor, leading to enhanced outcomes in combination with anti-PD1 
(nivolumab), improving progression free survival (PFS) in metastatic melanoma relative to 
nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9 months; p<.001) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165] (2.9 months, p<0.001). 
Interestingly a subgroup analysis from this study indicated that patients with PDL-1 positive 
tumors had no benefit from the combination vs. nivolumab alone (PFS of 12.4 vs. 12.4 
months).[39] This data would suggest that for patients lacking immune cells  in the tumor 
microenvironment (devoid of PD-L1 upregulation) benefited from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_605348].[38] The toxicity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_605349], but it is possible that vaccine combinations could accomplish 
the same results.
Indeed, preclinical models from the LTIB have suggested that vaccine-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605350]1 in the tumor microenvironment (unpublished). As demonstrated below, in 
murine model with CEA transgenic mice, a CEA vaccine led to upregulation of PDL1 expression. 
Mechanistically, the CEA vaccine likely increased immune cells in the tumor microenvironment 
after immune activation ultimately leading to increased PDL1 expression in the tumor.
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
16Preclinical investigations with a therapeutic cancer vaccine, TEGVAX, help mechanistically 
illustrate this hypothesis. TEGVAX has demonstrated the ability to increase interferon-gamma 
production in multiple murine models.[40] One series of experiments showed that PDL1 
upregulation on tumors was interferon-gamma dependent. Another set of experiments 
demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity when TEGVAX was combined with anti-PD1 
antibody. This benefit, however, was mitigated when an interferon-gamma blocking antibody was

The sequence of the anti-PDL1 therapy in this study will allow for priming of the immune system 
and the perhaps “inflame” the tumor microenvironment prior to potentiation of a clinical response 
with the anti-PDL1 therapy. Although this treatment will only be given for [ADDRESS_801628] been associated with vivo expansion, resulting in the targeting of multiple antigens (antigen 
spread/antigen cascade) and such patients often have better clinical outcomes and are not 
associated with greater toxicity.[16] [41] The addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor does add

clinical trials using checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy. 18 patients with mCRPC were treated 
with avelumab (the anti-PDL1 antibody that is the backbone of MSB0011359C) and the toxicities 
are reported in Table 1. Immune-mediate adverse events are the greatest concern for these patients, 
and patients will have detailed informed consent discussions on this manner.

Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution the three agents will be used together in a 6 patient 
phase I lead in cohort in advanced (castration resistant prostate cancer). Once all [ADDRESS_801629] 
completed a 6-week toxicity assessment period the toxicity data will be shared with IRB before 
moving for with the planned study in biochemical recurrence.
Please note: As of December 21, 2018, the [ADDRESS_801630] completed the 6-
week toxicity assessment period and no SAEs were seen. Per the protocol design patients will now 
be enrolled to the BCR cohort. The toxicity assessment of patients in the lead-in cohort is described 
in section 1.2.13.

181.2.9 Evaluating the Immunologic Response
Our group in the LTIB has previously evaluated immunologic parameters in clinical trials with 
Prostvac among several immunotherapy studies.[12, 42] While these findings are not surrogate 
markers of response, they have improved our knowledge of a vaccine-generated immune response 
and provided a better understanding of what factors are potentially important in mounting a 
sufficient anti-tumor immune response that could be associated with improved clinical outcomes. 
These and other data may allow optimization of vaccines in subsequent clinical trials. Few groups 
are as well positioned and have the experience as the LTIB to conduct this rigorous immune testing 
from clinical samples of patients treated with Prostvac.
Antigen-Specific Immune Responses. While many clinical trials have been done in biochemically 
recurrent prostate cancer, there is little reported on the impact of those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605351]. The proposed 
immunologic studies will be done on all patients by [CONTACT_605374]. Jeffrey Schlom.  
Unlike previous studies involving Prostvac, which evaluated immune responses to a single 9 amino 
acid section of the 244 amino acid PSA protein, the immune analysis in this trial will evaluate 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15 amino acid sequences of the entire PSA protein. (Figure 3). This more extensive 
analysis will provide a more thorough understanding of the immune response initiated by [CONTACT_605375] a greater opportunity for clinical correlations. This type of analysis has not been previously 
prospectively performed in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients. Advantages of this 
approach include the ability to assess both CD4 and CD8 T cells, identification of multifunctional 
T cells (those producing ≥2 cytokines), and identification of T lymphocytes with lytic potential 
(CD107a expression) (Table 2).
The rationale for evaluating intracellular cytokine staining is that it is one method to demonstrate 
to what extent the immune system has been specifically activated by [CONTACT_605376] (vaccine) 
to target specific tumor antigens. 
Figure 3: Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_605352]. This innovative approach to evaluating immune response allows for 
assessment of immune response to the entire PSA protein using overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15 amino acid sequences. (Previous techniques have 
focused on assessing just one of these peptides).

Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
19Table 2: Preliminary Data from a trial of Prostvac in mCRPC. This table shows how this multi peptide approach can be used 
in this proposal. In this previous (unpublished) trial, 2 cohorts of patients were evaluated using the proposed methods. (Responses 
are listed as absolute # of CD4 or CD8 T Lymphocytes Producing Cytokine or Positive for CD107a per 1x106 cells plated.) This 
readout shows the breadth of this analysis as both CD4 and CD8 tell cells are evaluated using multiple parameters (cytokine 
production signifying activation – IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and lytic potential as measured by [CONTACT_398]107a expression. When only 
one peptide was used to analyze the immune responses, no immune responders were identified (unpublished).
Briefly, the methodology takes cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
patients before therapy and at the time of restaging. They are thawed and rested overnight at 37oC, 
5% CO 2 in complete media (IMDM supplemented with 10% Human AB, 2mM glutamine, 100 
units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The next day (Day 0), PBMCs are seeded in 12 
well plates (2.5 x106 in 1 mL), and stimulated with peptide mixes (0.1ug/mL per peptide); cultures 
were supplemented on days 3 and 5 with cytokines (IL7 and IL15, 10 ng/mL, PeproTech, Rocky 
Hill, NJ) and fresh media, and on day 7 are rested (with removal of cytokine and peptide). On day 
11, 1x106 cells were restimulated for 24 hours in 96 well plates with peptide mixes in the presence 
of anti-CD107a-APC (clone H4A3, BD Biosciences); brefeldin A (1ul/mL) and monensin 
(0.7ul/mL) (BD Biosciences) are added to cultures 2 hours after the start of the restimulation and 
incubated for the final 22 hours. PBMCs are then stained with anti-CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 
OKT4, Biolegend), anti-CD8-AF700 (clone OKT8, Ebioscience), and anti-TNF-PE (clone 
MAb11), anti-IFNγ-PE-Cy7 (clone 4SB3), and anti-IL-2-BV521 (clone 5344.111) (BD 
Biosciences). At least 3x105 events in the live gate are acquired with a BD LSR-II flow cytometer 
equipped with a UV, violet, blue, and red laser. FCS files are analyzed with FlowJo V.9.7 for 
Macintosh (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls are used for gaiting, 
and non-viable cells were excluded. The absolute number of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes

21Table 3: Analysis of Peripheral Immune Cells
Figure 5:  Preliminary Data of Immunoscore Associations with Clinical Outcomes. This data (unpublished) from a recently 
completed breast cancer study involving a therapeutic cancer vaccine highlights the potential of Immunoscore. In this study, 
patients with peripheral immunoscore (H, more than 13 parameters positive, measured prior to therapy) had a significant increase 
in progression free survival. This difference was only observed in the vaccine arm and not in the standard of care alone arm. A 
separate assessment is required in prostate cancer and will be done in this study. If similar findings are seen, the Immunoscore 
could be prospectively evaluated in future trials using the data from this study to establish which immune subsets are most 
relevant. 

Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801631] and 
preliminary data with prostvac alone in this population supports that hypothesis. This data comes 
from the ongoing NCI study: Prostvac in Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Of the first 20 patients enrolled, 18 are evaluable for PSA responses >9 months 
after enrollment (2 patients withdrew from the study and are not included). In a preliminary 
analysis, those patients that ultimately experienced a PSA decline had an intra study apex PSA 
determined. The intra study apex PSA is defined as the maximum on-study PSA that can be 
corroborated by [CONTACT_605377]-study PSA value within 10%. PSA values beyond 10% may represent 
lab error and therefore are not used to determine the intra-study apex (see Figure 6 below).
Figure 6:
Of those 18 evaluable patients, 5 (27.8%) have had confirmed (at least 2 consecutive) PSA declines 
from an intra-study apex PSA with 3 declines being confirmed at ≥30%  (see Figure 7). Two additional 
patients have unconfirmed declines, but are still being followed for confirmation. It is of note 
because of the 10 patients on the study thus far who had monthly PSAs evaluated as part of a 
protocol mandated surveillance cohort, no patients had any similar confirmed declines >10%. 
These findings suggest that late effects of the vaccine may impact PSA in this population. 
PSA declines similar to this have not been reported previously in this population with 
immunotherapy, but this approach (using the intra-study apex PSA) may be a reasonable way to 
assess clinical impact of immunotherapy in this setting. Correlative immune data could also 
support biomarker development in this population and have broader applications to other types of 
cancer. This proposed trial of combination immunotherapy in biochemically recurrent prostate 
cancer represents a reasonable follow-up to the current study (expected to complete accrual at the 
NCI by [CONTACT_153293] 3, 2017).

scans on other imaging, less tumor/less bone-based disease). 
1.2.1218F-DCFPyL-PET/CT
PET imaging based on prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), including use of the 
radiotracer DCFPyL (Pylarify; manufacturer: Lantheus), which binds to PSMA, has emerged as 
a sensitive modality to detect localized and metastatic prostate cancer. 18F-DCFPyL is a second 
generation, high affinity agent that has shown outstanding efficacy in detecting prostate cancer, 
that received FDA approval in May 2021. 
18F-DCFPyL appears to be a sensitive and specific modality for staging prostate cancer and  
molecular analyses are underway as correlates to previous trials to identify which patients are 
most likely to be exceptional responders. Alternatively, early 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan (e.g., 
after ~2 months) may predict which patients go on to have exceptional responses. Thus, there is 
clinical benefit that could be derived from the ability of  18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to 
monitor response to therapy.

held as per protocol section 3.3.3. The AE resolved on its own without clinical symptoms. In 
addition, patient 6 had a brief epi[INVESTIGATOR_605353] (but no associated diarrhea). Out of an 
abundance of caution he was evaluated with a colonoscopy that demonstrated internal 
hemorrhoids and diverticulitis but no findings consistent with autoimmune colitis. The patient 
then continued all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In addition, there have been no unexpected AEs to this point. At this

no unexpected safety signals therefore, we will initiate enrollment of BCR cohort per protocol 
design.
1.2.14 Rationale for removing MSB0011359C (M7824) 
We have decided to remove Bintrafusp Alfa from this study based on a global assessment of the 
risks and benefits of this agent in this population of cancer patients who have an expected 
median survival of approximately [ADDRESS_801635] six patients treated with this agent 
in the biochemical recurrence (main cohort), we saw one case of colitis and one case of 
myocarditis. The latter required extensive steroid dosing to resolve and the patient continues to 
have residual side effects from the high doses of steroids. Furthermore, through the first [ADDRESS_801636] of the Bintrafusp Alfa in any of the patients (no 
radiographic changes or PSA declines). The use of Bintrafusp Alfa was reviewed by [CONTACT_605378] a specific toxicity meeting in May 2021.
Treatment regimen without an immune checkpoint inhibitor was considered to be optimal for 
patients of castration resistant prostate cancer. Given the longevity of this population, the 
favorable response without immune check inhibitor and the life expectancy of this population 
assessing a risk/benefit analysis, it was decided that Bintrafusp Alfa will be removed.
The rationale leading to this decision was discussed and approved .

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a three-arm, open-label trial of combination immunotherapy in participants with 
biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. 37 evaluable participants will be enrolled (after the Safety 
Lead-In cohort with 6 participants (arm 1), 6 participants who received M7824 as part of the 
initial investigation for PSA response (arm 2), and 25 homogenously treated participants (arm 3) 
with an accrual ceiling of [ADDRESS_801646] an observation period for the safety 
lead-in; dosing will begin after eligibility is confirmed (see Study Calendar in Section 18.2). 
Once all [ADDRESS_801647] completed the 6-week toxicity assessment 
period and no SAEs were seen; therefore this cohort is closed.
Participants enrolled in Cohort 2 will undergo surveillance with four consecutive monthly PSA 
checks followed by [CONTACT_605383]301 during months 1-4 then Prostvac and CV301 during 
months 5-7. 
oExisting participants with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer undergoing surveillance 
and PSA monitoring at the NIH may be enrolled at any point during the surveillance period 
provided the PSA monitoring is consistent with PSA monitoring in the Study Calendar 
(APPENDIX C) and the participant meets all other eligibility criteria. For example, if an 
eligi
ble participant has 3 monthly PSA values, he may be enrolled onto the study, obtain 
one additional PSA value at a one month interval to complete the surveillance period, then 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
31begin C1D1 with vaccine therapy. In this case, the 3 PSA values obtained prior to 
enrollment will be evaluated as if they were collected during the surveillance period while 
enrolled and will factor into the determination of the intra-study apex value (See Section 
6.3.2) highest PSA that is within 10% of another peak PSA for the participant on-study. 
Any other peak PSA values that are beyond 10% of other PSA values on the study will be 
determined as potential lab variability and excluded from response assessment.
oWith Amendment v05/10/2023, participants that have at least [ADDRESS_801648] one of them sufficient to provide the doubling time from 
baseline, will not undergo any further PSA measurements in the surveillance period. 
Prostvac will be administered nearly identical to the Phase III dosing with Prostvac-V given day 
1 (week 1) followed by [CONTACT_605382]-F on weeks 3 and 5 then monthly for an additional 5 months. 
Therefore, Prostvac-V is given one time (priming vaccine) followed by 7 doses of Prostvac-F 
(booster vaccine). The administration schema for CV301 is representative of the Phase I dose 
escalation trial. MVA-BN-CV301 (priming vaccine) is administered on day 1 (week 1) and week 
3 followed by [CONTACT_227395]-CV301 (booster vaccine) administered on week 5 then monthly for an 
additional 5 months. 
MSB0011359C (anti-PDL1 TGFβ Trap) will be administered at the recommended phase II dose 
of 1200mg by [CONTACT_33433] 2 weeks for 3 months (6 doses) starting after 4 months of 
concurrent Prostvac and CV301.
Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the 
treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 and 3). This cohort will 
now receive Prostvac and CV301 during months 1-[ADDRESS_801649] participant 
enrolled and C1D1 of the fourth participant enrolled which will allow for an adequate toxicity 
evaluation period of the combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e., [ADDRESS_801650] received combination 
vaccine and anti-PDL1 TGFβ Trap before any additional participants will be treated with that 
combination).
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
3.2.1 Prostvac
The Prostvac vaccine regimen consists of Prostvac-V (priming vaccine) and Prostvac-F 
(booster vaccine).
Prostvac will be administered nearly identical to the Phase III regimen with Prostvac-V 
(2x108 infectious units per 0.5 mL) given day 1 (week 1) followed by [CONTACT_605382]-F (1x109 
infectious units per 0.5 mL) on weeks 3 and 5 then monthly for an additional 5 months. 
Prostvac is administered subcutaneously preferably in the upper thigh. Alternate 
subcutaneous sites may be used with approval of the principal investigator.
Prostvac should be handled according to the guidelines outlined by [CONTACT_605384]. Study 
staff administering the vaccine or assessing the vaccine site should wear personal 
protection consistent with the standard of practice outlined by [CONTACT_605385]. 
Participants receiving Prostvac-V should be isolated just prior to the administration of 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
32vaccine and can be removed from isolation after the vaccine is administered and an 
appropriate sterile dry dressing is secured over the injection site. 
Participants should be provided with the Vaccinia-Prostvac Participant Instruction Sheet at 
the time of or prior to administration of Prostvac-V (APPENDIX B).
3.2.2 CV301
The CV301 vaccine regimen consists of MVA-BN-CV301 (priming vaccine) and FPV-
CV301 (booster vaccine).
MVA-BN-CV301 is administered as four subcutaneous injections (4 x 108 infectious 
units/0.5 mL each) on C1D1 and C1D15 followed by [CONTACT_227395]-CV301 (1 x 109 infectious units/ 
0.5mL) administered on C2D1 then monthly for an additional 5 months. 
oMVA-BN-CV301 is administered as one injection in each of the following locations: 
upper left arm, upper right arm, upper left thigh and upper right thigh (i.e., four injection 
sites per dose). Alternate subcutaneous sites may be used with approval of the principal 
investigator.
oFPV-CV301 is administered as a subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm 
(i.e., one injection site per dose). An alternate subcutaneous site may be used with 
approval of the principal investigator.
3.2.3 MSB0011359C
Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the 
treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 and 3).
MSB0011359C (anti-PDL1 TGFβ Trap) will be administered at a dose of 1200mg by [CONTACT_170147] 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months (6 doses) starting after 4 months of 
concurrent Prostvac and CV301. Use of an in-line 0.2 or 0.22 micron filter during infusion 
administration is required.
Current experience revealed that infusion related reactions (IRRs) to MSB0011359C 
seldom occur and are generally mild to moderate in severity. Therefore, administration of 
a premedication is generally not required. 
oIf an Investigator deems it necessary to administer a premedication to a 
particular participant, an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine 25-50mg  and 
acetaminophen 650mg intravenously or equivalent oral dose) is recommended 
approximately 30 - 60 minutes prior to the MSB0011359C infusion. If Grade ≥ 
[ADDRESS_801651] two infusions, premedication 
should not be stopped. Premedication regimens may be adjusted based on local 
site procedures or participant-specific factors. Steroids as premedication are not 
permitted.    
Infusion-related reactions to MSB0011359C
oParticipants experiencing a grade [ADDRESS_801652] the infusion 
stopped immediately and will not be rechallenged. 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
33oParticipants experiencing a ≥ grade [ADDRESS_801653] the infusion 
duration extended to 120 minutes for remainder of that infusion and all subsequent 
infusions. 
MSB0011359C should be administered in a setting that allows for immediate access to an 
intensive care unit or equivalent environment and administration of therapy for 
anaphylaxis, such as the ability to implement immediate resuscitation measures. Steroids 
(dexamethasone 10 mg), epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1,000 dilution), allergy medications (IV 
antihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxygen should be available for 
immediate access. 
3.2.4 Administering multiple agents
When CV301 and Prostvac are administered concurrently, it is preferable that CV301 be 
administered prior to Prostvac. When CV301 and Prostvac are administered in the same 
appendage, the vaccines must be administered a minimum of 2 inches apart. The sterile dry 
dressing to cover the Prostvac-V site should NOT overlap or cover the CV301 injection 
site. 
When CV301, Prostvac, and MSB001359C are administered concurrently, the following 
order of administration is preferred: CV301 followed by [CONTACT_605386]0011359C infusion. Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no 
longer be given as part of the treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort 
(Arms 2 and 3).
3.3 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS
Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the 
treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 and 3).
3.3.1 Dose modifications
Dose reductions or dose escalations are not permitted for Prostvac, CV301 or MSB0011359C.
3.3.2 Dosing delays 
To account for scheduling or logistical issues, the scheduled vaccine may be given ± 3 days from 
the scheduled administration date in month one of vaccine combination. Once participants are 
beyond C2D1, there will be a ±7 day window for scheduling to allow for logistical and travel 
constraints. If the vaccines or anti-PDL1 TGFβ Trap are not given within this window, it will be 
considered a missed dose and the next dose will be given at the planned administration date. If 
one agent is delayed, all agents given concurrently should also be delayed so the agents are 
administered on the same day. However, if a dose of one agent is missed for a toxicity 
unequivocally attributed to that agent, the other agents may be administered as scheduled. If for 
any reason, the immunotherapy regimen is held for >[ADDRESS_801654] be delayed for the following drug-related AEs:
Any grade ≥ 2 drug-related AE with the following exceptions
oGrade 2 drug-related fatigue, dermatologic AEs, and asymptomatic laboratory 
abnormalities do not require a treatment delay
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
34oGrade 2 electrolyte abnormalities that can be managed with replacement therapy do 
not require a treatment delay
oGrade 2 hypothyroidism that can be managed with replacement therapy does not 
require a treatment delay
oGrade 2 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require a dose delay.
oAsymptomatic ALT/AST or amylase/lipase elevation not associated with clinical 
manifestations does not require a dose delay. Increased monitoring may be considered. 
Any grade 3 drug-related AE with the following exceptions
oGrade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require a dose delay
oGrade 3 asymptomatic electrolyte abnormalities that can be managed with 
replacement therapy do not require a treatment delay
oAsymptomatic grade 3 amylase or lipase elevation not associated with clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis does not require a dose delay. Increased monitoring is 
required. 
Criteria for resuming the immunotherapy regimen:
Participants with a required delay in treatment may resume the immunotherapy regimen 
when the drug-related AEs resolve to grade ≤ [ADDRESS_801655] their vaccine(s) 
held until injection site reaction resolves to grade ≤ 2.
oParticipants with a grade 3 dermatologic AE may resume when their skin toxicity 
resolves to grade ≤ 2.
[IP_ADDRESS] MSB0011359C 
Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the

PET scan was done prior to consent within 8 weeks, it will not need to be repeated during the 
surveillance period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging with 18F-DCFPyL (Pylarify)
When feasible, participants in the BCR cohort will undergo two 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans: one 
in the first two months during surveillance and within 8 weeks after completing treatment. All PET 
data sets will be reviewed for quality and completeness. Participants will be instructed to maintain 
good hydration for the 24 hours prior to the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT (recommended 1-2 liters of 
fluid, unless medically contraindicated). There are no dietary or food restrictions.
Participants will report to the appropriate imaging center on the day of their 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
imaging session and peripheral venous access will be obtained. 
A static whole-body PET/CT will be performed 1 hour (± 15 minutes) post injection of 18F-
DCFPyL. Only a single injection of 18F-DCFPyL is required. 
3.4.2 Assessment for immunotherapy administration 
Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the 
treatment combination for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 and 3).
Dosing and administration of CV-301, Prostvac, and MSB0011359C will be performed in the

3.[ADDRESS_801660] all subjects complete a safety visit 
approximately 28 days (± 7 days) following the last dose of study therapy.
If a participant experiences a toxicity that can unequivocally be attributed to one agent, he may 
continue on the remaining investigational agents at the discretion of the principal investigator. 
3.6.1 Criteria for removal from protocol therapy 
Participants will be removed from treatment for the following:
Clinical or radiographic progression of disease as defined in Section 6.3.1. (Clinical 
progression includes the initiation of ADT in participants with biochemical recurrent 
prostate cancer.)
AE-related treatment delays lasting > 56 days, as defined in Section 3.3.2
Any Grade 4 toxicity that is possibly, probably or definitely related to the protocol 
treatment will require a participant to be off-treatment
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the participant’s health, the 
participant may be removed from protocol therapy and reasons for withdrawal will be 
documented
Requirement for androgen deprivation therapy
Completion of protocol therapy

After the safety visit, if there are no unresolved grade [ADDRESS_801663] the participant annually to find out how they are doing and to determine survival status. If 
there are unresolved grade 3 – 4 AEs and participants cannot return for logistical reasons or refuse 
follow-up at NIH, participants may be followed by [CONTACT_250251]. In the latter case, we will 
obtain the physician’s medical notes and we will assess the status of the participant’s adverse 
events based on the physician’s reports.
Any scans performed outside of the study site will also be obtained when possible. 
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS
4.1 EXCLUDED MEDICATIONS
Concurrent hormonal therapy, anticancer treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
major surgical procedures for prostate cancer, anti-cancer radionuclides and non-protocol-
related immunotherapy will not be permitted. 
Systemic corticosteroids (daily or every other day for continued use > 14 days) will not be 
permitted. Participants requiring systemic steroids for treatment of immune-related AEs

steroids will not be permitted within 3 days prior to and within one month after receiving 
the Prostvac-V injection. 
Vaccination with live vaccines other than the investigational agents is prohibited (e.g., 
Zostavax). Administration of inactivated vaccines is allowed (e.g., inactivated influenza 
vaccine). Locally approved COVID vaccines are permitted. 
4.[ADDRESS_801664] cycle. The selection of the specific antiemetic regimen is at the 
discretion of the treating physician. Antiemetic regimens will not include steroids.
Other supportive care with blood components, analgesics, general medical therapy, etc., will be 
delivered as required. Symptomatic anemia should be treated with appropriate red blood cell or 
erythropoietin support.
Thrombocytopenia should be treated conservatively. In the absence of bleeding or a planned 
invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet count below 10,000/mm3. 
If invasive procedures are planned or the participant develops bleeding, platelet transfusions 
should be administered in accordance with the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet 
count of > 50,000/mm3.
Any evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(HUS), or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) including thrombocytopenia, hemolytic 
anemia, renal failure, fever or neurologic changes should be thoroughly evaluated and closely 
monitored and supported as clinically indicated.
4.2.2 Antibiotics
Antibiotics will be delivered as required. Co-administration of protocol treatments can be done at 
the discretion of the investigator. Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., prevention of urinary tract 
infections) may be allowed at the discretion of the investigator. 
4.2.3 Infusion-Related Reactions 
See section 3.2.3. 
4.2.4 Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs)
Immune-related AEs (irAEs) require early recognition and prompt intervention. If an irAE is 
suspected, all investigational agents must be held. See management algorithms in Error!

4.3 TREATMENT OF VACCINIA VACCINATION COMPLICATION
4.3.1 Vaccinia Immune Globulin:
First-line treatment of some of the complications of vaccinia caused by [CONTACT_195236] (severe cases of inadvertent inoculation involving extensive lesions or if comorbid conditions 
exist, severe cases of generalized vaccinia in participants that are systemically ill and whose 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801665] serious underlying immunosuppressive illnesses, eczema 
vaccinatum, and progressive vaccinia) is with VIG.
VIG is contraindicated, however, for the treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis. VIG is a sterile 
solution of the immunoglobulin fraction of pooled plasma from individuals inoculated with 
vaccinia vaccine. VIG is an investigational agent available through the CDC’s Strategic National 
Pharmaceutical Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_195187]’s Smallpox Vaccine 
Adverse Events Clinician Information Line at [PHONE_4230]. Upon receipt of a call from a 
participant or upon direct observation of a participant or contact [CONTACT_605387], the investigator should place a call to the CDC as soon 
as possible:
1) to initiate review of the clinical case, 
2) to seek consultation on the appropriateness of VIG therapy, 
3) to determine the appropriate VIG dose and dosing method for administration, if VIG
therapy is required, and 
4) to determine how to access and have the appropriate doses of VIG delivered.
Early institution of VIG therapy is advised following recognition of clinical symptoms compatible 
with some vaccinia complications (eczema vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive 
vaccinia, and some cases of inadvertent inoculation). The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to 
be time dependent. VIG has not proven to be of benefit in the treatment of post-vaccinial 
encephalitis, and is contraindicated for treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis due to the increased 
risk of corneal scarring.
An intravenous formulation of VIG is available through the CDC, which has a lower level of 
aggregated protein, allowing it to be used by [CONTACT_195238]. This formulation will most 
likely be preferred for administration and investigators will be instructed by [CONTACT_605388]. There is 
no guarantee that VIG will successfully treat complications. At present, there are no other anti-
viral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195188]-related complications.
4.3.2 Cidofovir (Vistide®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences):
Cidofovir is an FDA-approved antiviral drug for the treatment of CMV retinitis among participants 
with AIDS. Cell-based in vitro studies and animal model studies have demonstrated antiviral 
activity of this agent against certain orthopoxviruses. Currently, efficacy in the treatment of 
vaccinia-related complications in humans is unknown. According to the CDC, “VIG is 
recommended as first line of therapy. Cidofovir may be considered as a secondary treatment, and 
will only be released by [CONTACT_195240], after a 
participant fails to improve with VIG treatment, or as a last effort for a participant who is otherwise 
near death.” [Medical Management of Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Adverse Reactions: Vaccinia

415.1.3 Immunologic Assays 
[IP_ADDRESS] CD4 T Cell Proliferation Assay
It is planned that all participants will undergo exploratory analysis of the ability to detect CD4-
positive responses using a whole-protein PSA assay, as well as a peptide mix with 63 different 15-
mer peptides by [CONTACT_195242]/or ELISA. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sera Antibody Analysis
Serum will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius and there will be planned analysis for generation of 
antibodies to PSA, BCG, PAP, PSMA, PSCA, and/or MUC-1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Flow cytometry analysis of thymic emigrant
To determine recent thymic emigrants, flow cytometry analysis will be performed on peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells. Cells will be resuspended in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline 
containing 3% fetal bovine serum) and stained for 30 minutes at 4°C with the combination of 
following antibodies: APC-H7-conjugated anti-CD4, PE-CY7-conjugated anti-CD3; FITC-
conjugated CD45RA, PE-conjugated CD31, PerCP-CY5.5-conjugated Ki-67, AF-700-
conjugated-CD197, V450-conjugated CD8, APC-conjugated CD103, V500-conjugated CD27 all 
purchased from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). After that, FoxP3 intra-cellular staining will be 
performed on the cells stained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD25. They will be fixed and 
permeabilyzed using a fix/perm kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s 
manual, and will be labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-Foxp3 antibody (236A/E7 clone) or its 
isotype control antibody (eBioscience). Flow cytometry will be performed on a Becton Dickinson 
LSRII (BD Biosciences) device.
[IP_ADDRESS] Natural Killer (NK) Cells
The number and phenotype of NK cells will be determined by [CONTACT_195243]56, CD3, CD8, and CD16 by [CONTACT_4133].
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Subsets
Subsets of immune cells will also be followed in response to treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Regulatory T Cells
Regulatory T cells have been shown to inhibit the activation and function of T cells that participate 
in antigen-specific immune responses. Higher levels of regulatory T-cells have been reported in 
the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of participants with several types of tumors. The number 
and phenotype of regulatory T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from participants in this 
study will be determined by 7-color flow cytometry analysis. Cells will be resuspended in staining 
buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal bovine serum) and stained for CD4, CD25, 
CD127, FoxP3, CTLA-4, CD45RA, and CD8. The ratios between regulatory T-cells and CD4 
effector cells and the ratios between regulatory T-cells and CD8 Effector cells will also be 
analyzed.
5.1.4 Stool (optional)
Participants will be asked to provide stool in order to evaluate changes in microbiome of 
gastrointestinal tract and correlate to changes in treatment, PSA and immune cell subpopulations.

44biological specimens in support of NIH clinical studies. All specimens are stored in secure, 
limited-access facilities with sufficient security, backup, and emergency support capability and 
monitoring to ensure long-term integrity of the specimens for research. 
The subcontractor’s role is limited to clinical research databases and repositories containing 
participant specimens. It does not conduct or have any vested interest in research on human 
subjects, but does provide services and support the efforts of its customers, many of which are 
involved in research on human subjects. 
The NCI Frederick Central Repository will accept only coded, linked samples and sample 
information. Protected information will not be sent electronically or by [CONTACT_251707]. 
Sample data is stored in the BioSpecimen Inventory System II (BSI). This inventory tracking 
system is used to manage the storage and retrieval of specimens, as well as to maintain specimen 
data. BSI is designed for controlled, concurrent access. It provides a real-time, multi-user 
environment for tracking millions of specimens. The system controls how and in what order 
database updates and searches are performed. This control prevents deadlocks and race conditions. 
For security, BSI has user password access, 3 types of user access levels, and 36 user permissions 
(levels of access) that can be set to control access to the system functions. BSI provides audit 
tracking for processes that are done to specimens including shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], returning to inventory, 
aliquoting, thawing, additives, and other processes. BSI tracks the ancestry of specimens as they 
are aliquoted, as well as discrepancies and discrepancy resolution for specimens received by [CONTACT_605389]. If a specimen goes out of the inventory, the system maintains data associated with the 
withdraw request. Vials are labeled with a unique BSI ID which is printed in both eye-readable 
and bar-coded format. No participant-specific information is encoded in this ID. 
Investigators are granted view, input, and withdraw authority only for their specimens. They may 
not view specimen data or access specimens for which they have not been authorized. Access to 
specimen storage is confined to repository staff. Visitors to the repositories are escorted by 
[CONTACT_195248].
Samples will be used for research analysis, including immunologic monitoring as outlined in 
Section 5.1. All specimens for analysis will be requested from Leidos Biomedical, Inc. and will be 
delivered by [CONTACT_195249], Inc. couriers to the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and 
Biology.
5.3.2 Stool Samples (Blood Processing Core/Figg Laboratory)
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered and 
stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix 
limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of 
Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password 
restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced

participant ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material 
type, as well as box and freezer location. Participant demographics associated with the clinical 
center participant number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated 
with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).

45Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -80°C according 
to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick 
Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples 
must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195108] a manner consistent with IRB approval.
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the 
rights to use the material. 
If, at any time, a participant withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples 
to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed (or returned to the participant, if so requested), and reported as such to 
the IRB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138703] a deviation. 
Reporting will be per the requirements of section 7.2.
Sample barcodes are linked to participant demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
Labmatrix. It is critical that the sample remains linked to participant information such as race, age, 
dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.
5.3.3 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, intramural researchers can request 
access to remaining samples, provided they have an IRB-approved protocol and participant 
consent.
Samples and associated data will be stored permanently unless the participant withdraws consent. 
If the participant withdraws consent the participant’s data will be excluded from future 
distributions, but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able 
to be retrieved. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138703] a deviation.

5.4 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC/GENOMIC ANALYSIS
5.4.1 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis
Genomic sequence characterization is increasingly important in understanding tumor biology, 
host/microbial interactions, and skin conditions. The current study proposes to perform DNA 
sequencing on biologic samples, including stool samples – although the likelihood of incidental 
human genomic findings in stool sampling is expected to be very low/rare, the possibility for this 
is included in an abundance of caution.
The technology platforms used to interrogate genomic structure and function are dynamic and 
the specific methodology, e.g. DNA/RNA sequencing, DNA copy number analysis, DNA

analysis.
5.4.1 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized
Confidentiality for genetic samples will be maintained as described (Section 5.3). In addition, a 
Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained for this study.
5.4.[ADDRESS_801667] will be offered the opportunity to come to NIH (at our 
expense) to have genetic education and counseling to explain this result. If the subject does not 
want to come to NIH, a referral to a local genetic healthcare provider will be provided (at their 
expense).
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.

Development of cytologically positive pleural effusion or lymphangitic spread in the lungs.
Symptoms which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_605357].
6.3.[ADDRESS_801670] an intra study 
decline in PSA will be evaluated for PSA response. Such responses would be defined by [CONTACT_182903]-
study apex PSA, which will be established by [CONTACT_605390]-study PSA value within 10%. (The goal here is to not capture lab 
variations which may be seen as isolated PSA spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988] (i.e. greater than 10%) in the context of 
participant follow-up. Responders will then be evaluated using confirmed PSA declines (at least 2 
consecutive values after the intra-study apex) of at least 30%. Participants with intra-study PSA 
declines greater than 50% will also be identified.

9CLINICAL MONITORING
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
that the rights of the participants are protected; 
that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained. 
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.
OSRO SROS Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. The first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study site(s). 
Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or 
follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring reports 
will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, coordinating

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
10.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
10.1.1 Primary
The primary objective is to determine if the combination immunotherapy can result in a confirmed 
30% decline in PSA in a modest fraction of participants enrolled
10.1.2 Secondary 
The secondary objectives are to:
Assess the safety of the combination immunotherapy regimen
Test for changes in PSA kinetics after treatment with the combination immunotherapy, 
relative to baseline PSA kinetics
10.[ADDRESS_801677] a 30% decline from their maximum PSA anytime during treatment to the 
minimum value during treatment.
Safety data for the 6-participant lead-in will be shared with IRB before accrual commences in the 
biochemical recurrence cohort. Beyond safety, this cohort will just be evaluated in a descriptive 
manner.
Because participants may be receiving the proposed treatment and be followed for PSA changes 
over an extended period, and the evaluation of the endpoint may take place at any point during this 
potentially long period, the trial will use a single stage design for evaluating efficacy. With 25 
evaluable participants who do not receive M7824, there would be 82% power to rule out 15% and 
be consistent with 35% who may be able to experience a 30% decline in PSA, using an exact 
binomial test with a 0.10 one-sided significance level. As an illustration, if 25 evaluable 
participants are enrolled, 7 of 25 (28.0%) who experience at least a 30% PSA change from the 
maximum level would have an associated one-sided lower 90% confidence interval bound of 
16.3%, and simultaneously an associated one-sided upper 90% confidence interval bound of 
42.6%. These demonstrate that 7/25 would be a desirable result based on the parameters selected.
With the amendment v7/29/2021, the initial 6 participants who received M7824 will be evaluated 
separately in exploratory fashion and will not be included among the 25 main participants.
In addition, because a trial of participants with similar eligibility (16-C-0035) may result in 
approximately 36 participants who are undergoing surveillance for 6 months, this other trial may 
serve as a control for a secondary evaluation. The changes in PSA on this trial during the initial 6 
months can be compared to the changes in PSA during the initial 6 months on the surveillance arm 
of the control trial as a secondary evaluation. With 25 evaluable participants on this trial and 36 
evaluable participants on the other trial, there would be 81% power to identify a difference between 
35% of participants on this trial with a 30% PSA maximum change and 10% of participants on the 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
57control trial with a 30% PSA maximum change with a 0.10 one-sided significance level Fisher’s 
exact test.
It is anticipated that 1-2 participants per month can be enrolled onto this trial; thus, it expected that 
accrual of 37 evaluable participants (6 for the lead-in, 6 who received M7824 as part of the initial 
investigation for PSA response and 25 homogeneously treated participants to evaluate PSA 
response) can be completed within 1 to 2 years. To allow for a small number of inevaluable 
participants, the accrual ceiling will be set at 40 participants.
10.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Modified intention to treat: all participants who receive at least one dose of the two vaccines and 
the immune checkpoint inhibitor will be included in the statistical analyses performed. The lead-
in cohort will be evaluated separately in a descriptive fashion and for safety primarily.
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
10.4.1 General approach
Following a safety determination in 6 participants meeting separate eligibility requirements, the 
PSA decline measured from the maximal value obtained while on study to the minimum value 
obtained while on study will be obtained for each patient, and will be considered a success if the 
maximal PSA decline is 30% or more. The fraction of evaluable participants who experience at 
least a 30% decline will be determined. Quantitative parameters will be tested for changes over 
time using paired tests.
10.4.[ADDRESS_801678] a 30% decline from the maximum 
to the minimum PSA value while on study will be determined. A two-tailed 80% and 95% 
confidence interval will be formed around the fraction of participants with 30% decline to interpret 
the fraction who experience a decline of that magnitude. This primary analysis will not include the 
6 patients who received M7824 before it was removed from future use in this study.
10.4.3 Analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints
A 6-participant phase I lead in cohort in advanced (castration resistant prostate cancer) participants 
will be conducted to determine safety. Once all [ADDRESS_801679] for changes in PSA kinetics after treatment with the combination immunotherapy relative 
to baseline PSA kinetics, the changes in PSA over defined intervals (e.g., 1 to 3 months or similar) 
after administering the vaccines as well as after administering the checkpoint inhibitor will be 
determined by [CONTACT_605391]. Then, the slopes obtained after 
administering the vaccines alone or in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor will be tested vs. 
the slopes obtained prior to administering the vaccines using a two-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_801680] (if the paired differences are not normally distributed). 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
58In addition, because a trial of participants with similar eligibility (16-C-0035) may result in 
approximately 36 participants who are undergoing surveillance for 6 months, this other trial may 
serve as a control for a secondary evaluation. The changes in PSA on this trial during the initial 6 
months can be compared to the changes in PSA during the initial 6 months on the surveillance arm 
of the control trial as a secondary evaluation. The fractions of participants who experience a 30% 
PSA maximum change on the present study as well as the approximately 36 participants on 16-C-
0035 who underwent surveillance will be compared using a one-sided significance level Fisher’s 
exact test.
Please note: As of December 21, 2018, the [ADDRESS_801681] completed the 
6-week toxicity assessment period and no SAEs were seen. Per the protocol design participants 
will now be enrolled to the BCR cohort. The toxicity assessment of participants in the lead-in 
cohort is described in section 1.2.13.
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
Safety of the combination regimen will be assessed by [CONTACT_605392], and reporting the fraction with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events.
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of all participants will be reported.
10.4.6 Planned interim analyses
None will be performed.
10.4.7 Subgroup analyses
None will be performed, except to consider exploratory evaluations based on the use of M7824
10.4.8 Tabulation of individual participant data
None will be provided.
10.4.9 Exploratory analyses
The study will aim to evaluate immune changes after treatment with 2 vaccines for 4 months.
Many immune parameters (See Section 5.1) will be obtained at baseline and at several time points 
beginning at the time the two vaccines are first administered. The changes in the immune 
parameters after treatment with [ADDRESS_801682] 
(if the paired differences are not normally distributed). Since there are potentially a moderately 
large number of these tests, they will be reported as being of secondary intent and presented 
without adjustment for multiple comparisons but in the context of the number of such tests 
performed.
Willing participants will continue to be followed after cycle [ADDRESS_801683] their PSA response 
evaluated in a descriptive fashion, and may be compared informally to those from the remaining 
patients who do not receive M7824.

To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or disease 
response would be expected in one group compared with another. Efforts will be made to extend 
accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck 
between participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to 
potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one hand and the need to explore ethnic aspects 
of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic identity 
are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be written to investigate those 
differences more fully. Women are not eligible for this study as this disease occurs only in men.

12.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
This study involves clinical research with an experimental combination immunotherapy designed 
to generate an immune response against prostate cancer. Participants will undergo multiple 
vaccinations with Prostvac and CV-301. Participants in Arm 1 and Arm 2 also received multiple 
infusions of MSB001359C until that drug was removed from the study as of amendment 
v07/29/2021 due to immune related adverse events observed with M7824 in this and other studies. 
Side effects of the immunotherapy are outlined elsewhere (see Section 14 and Section 1.2). 
Potential risks are applicable for all participants on study, including those that may become 
cognitively impaired while on study. Whether the combination immunotherapy regimen will have 
any clinical effect is unknown; therefore, benefit cannot be promised, nor the chance of benefit 
accurately predicted. Potential benefits for all participants on study, including those that may

headache, metallic and/ or bitter taste in the mouth and a warm, flushing feeling. Rarely, some 
people have more severe allergic reactions to the contrast which may include skins rashes, 
shortness of breath, wheezing or low blood pressure.
There is a small risk of having a reaction to the contrast agent 18F-DCFPyL (Pylarify) and most 
often include headache, metallic and/or bitter taste in the mouth, and fatigue. Participants may 
have discomfort from lying on a hard surface for about [ADDRESS_801694] scans (chest/ abdomen/ pelvis), Tc-99 whole body 
scintigraphy scans, 18F NaF PET/CT scans, and two 18F-DCFPyL PET scans will follow clinical 
policies, no special procedures apply to these additional assessments for research purposes. In 
summary, subjects may receive additional radiation exposure in one year from up to three (3) CT 
scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, three (3) Tc-99 whole body scintigraphy scans and two 
(2) 18F NaF PET/CT scans. 
The total additional radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 7.2 rem in one 
year. 
12.5.3 Risks from other study procedures

14 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION
14.1 RECOMBINANT FOWLPOX-PSA(L155)/TRICOM   
14.1.1 Background
Other Names: PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM ; PROSTVAC-F
Classification: Recombinant fowlpox virus vector vaccine of the genus Avipoxvirus.
Product Description: Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM  is a recombinant 
fowlpox virus vector vaccine containing the genes for human PSA and three co-stimulatory 
molecules (designated TRICOM): B7.1, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and 
LFA-3 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-3). The PSA gene coding sequence is modified to 
code for a single amino acid substitution [isoleucine to leucine at amino acid position 155 of the 
PSA antigen (designated L155)], which is designed to enhance immunogenicity. This modification 
occurs in a 10-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_195197] [designated PSA-3 
(amino acids 154-163)]. An attenuated, live, plaque-purified isolate from the POXVAC-TC strain 
of fowlpox virus was used as the parental virus for this recombinant vaccine. A plasmid vector 
containing the modified PSA gene and the genes for the three co-stimulatory molecules is used 
for in vivo recombination between the plasmid vector and parental fowlpox virus genome. The 
recombinant vaccine is manufactured by [CONTACT_195255] (CED) 
cells with the recombinant fowlpox virus. Fowlpox virus can infect mammalian cells and express

Participant Care Implications and Contraindications 
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing (e.g., Telfa pad). Once the injection site is 
healed, no further barrier is necessary. As a precaution, protect injection sites that are exhibiting 
evidence of weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], oozing or ulceration with a sterile dry dressing. In these circumstances, 
instruct participants to avoid direct contact [CONTACT_195260] (e.g.; 
those who may be immunocompromised by [CONTACT_195261]). Instruct participants to avoid 
fathering a child for at least [ADDRESS_801704] 72 hours after vaccination or while there are any visible lesions at the injection site.
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal cells), 
participants with a history of allergy to eggs or egg products should not receive the vaccine.

Precautions for Healthcare Workers 
Recombinant vaccinia virus transmission risk to exposed healthcare workers is unknown. To date, 
no reports of transmission to healthcare personnel from vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_469596]. If 
appropriate infection control precautions are observed (such as covering the vaccination site and 
washing hands after contact [CONTACT_195262]), healthcare workers are 
probably at less risk of infection than laboratory workers because of the smaller volume and lower 
titers of virus in clinical specimens as compared with laboratory material. However, because of 
the potential risk for transmission, healthcare personnel who prepare or administer doses of 
recombinant vaccinia vaccine or have direct contact [CONTACT_195263]. Do not administer 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801711] three weeks after vaccination, their close household contacts (close household 
contacts are those who share housing or have close physical contact): 
have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, 
severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds), until the condition resolves.
are pregnant or intend to become pregnant within [ADDRESS_801712]-feeding.
are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including HIV 
infection.
Additionally, do not administer routine, non-emergency vaccination with the licensed vaccinia 
vaccine to healthcare workers if the vaccine:  
has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
is less than 18 years of age, unless specifically indicated.
is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_195207]; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications. 
has a history of allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination or any of the vaccine’s 
components.
As a precaution, the CDC recommends that individuals with known cardiac disease (e.g., 
previous MI, angina, CHF, cardiomyopathy, stroke or TIA) or who have > 3 known risk factors 
for cardiac disease (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, first degree relative 
with onset of cardiac complications prior to age 50, smoker), not receive routine, non-
emergency, prophylactic vaccination with the licensed vaccinia vaccine while a possible causal 
relationship between vaccination and cardiac events is being evaluated.
Avoid exposure to the recombinant vaccinia vaccine, any contaminated dressings, or other 
infectious materials from participants, or the participant’s inoculation site if you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding; have a history or presence of active eczema or atopic dermatitis; have acute, 
chronic or exfoliative skin conditions; or, are immunocompromised. More information on vaccinia 
precautions for healthcare workers can be obtained from 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm#tab2 and 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5207.pdf.
The CDC is the only source of the licensed vaccinia vaccine. The CDC will provide vaccinia 
vaccine to protect laboratory and other healthcare personnel, whose occupations place them at risk 
of exposure to vaccinia and other closely related orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia 
recombinants. The vaccine should be administered under the supervision of a physician selected 
by [CONTACT_195264]. Revaccination is recommended every [ADDRESS_801713] Drug Services, National Center for Infectious 
Diseases, CDC at ([PHONE_4237].

Complications 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
73 Participant Care Implications and Contraindications
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing ( e.g., Telfa pad). Instruct participants on proper 
hand-hygiene, sterile dressing care, bathing, laundering of clothing, etc. Treat participant bandages or 
dressings removed from the vaccination site as infectious waste and dispose in appropriate biohazard 
containers. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], or for at least three 
weeks after vaccination, their close household contacts (close household contacts are those who 
share housing or have close physical contact): 
have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions ( e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, 
severe acne, contact [CONTACT_8748], psoriasis, herpes or other open rashes or wounds), until the 
condition resolves.
are pregnant or intend to become pregnant (due to the potential risk of fetal vaccinia); or are 
breast-feeding (due to the potential risk of contact [CONTACT_195265]). 
It is currently unknown if vaccinia virus or antibodies are excreted in breast milk. Participants 
(i.e., vaccinees) should avoid fathering a child for at least 4 months following completion of 
therapy with the recombinant vaccine.
are in close contact [CONTACT_195266] 3 years of age (due to the potential risk of contact 
[CONTACT_195265]). 
are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including individuals 
with HIV infection.
Additionally, do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the vaccinee: 
has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_195208], or undergoing therapy 
with systemic steroids; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications.
At this time, until a more definitive causal relationship is determined, it is recommended that 
participants with known CHF or clinically significant cardiomyopathy, not be vaccinated with 
recombinant vaccinia-based vaccines, due to the potential for development of myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis. 
Although the CDC believes that there is no evidence to conclude that the licensed vaccinia 
vaccine used in the Smallpox Vaccination Program causes angina or heart attacks, it 
acknowledges a possible causal relationship between the vaccination and heart inflammation. 
The CDC continues to study the relationship, but in the meantime, recommends excluding 
individuals with underlying heart disease from participation in the current Smallpox 
Vaccination Program. Participants are being immunized with recombinant vaccinia vaccines 
with therapeutic intent and will be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors and recent or 
symptomatic cardiac events per protocol eligibility criteria. Participants will be encouraged to 
minimize cardiovascular disease risks and encouraged to follow risk reduction according to 
standard medical practice.  
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal cells), do 
not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to participants with a history of allergy to eggs or

74egg products. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to participants with a history of 
allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination (e.g., smallpox vaccination).
Potential Complications Associated with Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccination  
When vaccinia vaccine is administered by [CONTACT_251715], expected 
local reactions in individuals that have not previously been vaccinated with vaccinia include the 
appearance of a red papule in 3-[ADDRESS_801714] for weeks following healing of the skin lesion, 
considerable local edema, and intense inflammation from the vaccination (i.e., viral cellulites), 
which may be confused with bacterial cellulites. Systemic symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_195209] 8-
[ADDRESS_801715] been a number of complications reported in the literature associated with vaccinia 
vaccination for smallpox. Reported complications from vaccinia vaccine when given by 
[CONTACT_195268]: a) auto-inoculation of other sites with vaccinia, b) generalized vaccinia, c) 
eczema vaccinatum, d) progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum), or e) post-vaccinial encephalitis. 
In a 1968 ten-state survey, cases of these complications per million vaccinations in adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(> 20 years of age) of vaccinia primary vaccination and revaccination were:
Primary Vaccination Revaccination
auto-inoculation 606.[ADDRESS_801716] often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or progressive vaccinia.
Information has been reported by [CONTACT_154437] (DoD) during the post-vaccination 
surveillance assessment of adverse events in military personnel following implementation of a 
Smallpox Vaccination Program from the period of December 13, 2002 through May 28, 2003. 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
75Although not directly comparable to historical numbers, due to differences in multiple population 
variables, estimated cases (number of cases per million vaccinations based on vaccination of 450,293 
personnel, with a median age of 26 years and 70.5% as primary vaccinees) of these same 
complications per million vaccinations were:
auto-inoculation [ADDRESS_801717]-vaccinial 
encephalitis/encephalomyelitis. The complications of vaccinia vaccination may involve a number of 
different reactions:
1.Non-specific erythematous or urticarial rashes: These rashes can appear approximately 
10 days after vaccination and may sometimes be confused with generalized vaccinia, but 
are generally self-limiting. Patients are usually afebrile and these benign rashes usually 
resolve spontaneously within 2-4 days. Erythema multiforme can present as different types 
of lesions, including macules, papules, urticaria, and bull’s eye lesions (dark papule or 
vesicle surrounded by a pale zone and an area of erythema). These lesions may be 
extremely pruritic, lasting up to four weeks. Rarely, more serious bullous erythema 
multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) may occur, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Vaccinia 
Immune Globulin (VIG) therapy is not indicated to treat these rashes. Supportive care 
measures are warranted since these rashes are likely manifestations of an immune response 
or hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine and are not likely to contain vaccinia virus.
2.Bacterial Infection: Vaccination site infection, most likely due to staphylococcus and 
streptococcus normal skin flora, is rare. Onset is approximately [ADDRESS_801718]-vaccination 
and is more common in children. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is required.
3.Inadvertent Inoculation: This can occur in the vaccinee (autoinoculation) as well as in 
close contacts (contact [CONTACT_195269]). Accidental infection is the most common 
complication of vaccinia vaccination, accounting for approximately 50% of all 
complications associated with vaccination and revaccination. This usually results from 
autoinoculation of vaccinia virus transferred from the site of the vaccination. Sites typi[INVESTIGATOR_195210], eyelids, nose, mouth, genitalia, or rectum, but can also involve 
the arms, legs, and trunk. Contact [CONTACT_195270], with accompanying toxicities, 
may occur when a recently vaccinated individual has contact [CONTACT_4490] a susceptible individual. 
In a [ADDRESS_801719] commonly was in children  [ADDRESS_801720] 
transmission may result in a more severe syndrome than that seen in vaccinees, perhaps 
because of multiple simultaneous inoculations. About 30% of eczema vaccinatum cases 
reported in the [ADDRESS_801721] transmission would be greater in today’s population, 
due to a largely unvaccinated patient population against smallpox. Contact [CONTACT_605395]: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801722] that 
require VIG therapy. 
4.Generalized vaccinia: Generalized vaccinia (GV) is characterized by a disseminated 
maculopapular or vesicular rash of varying extent on any part of the body and typi[INVESTIGATOR_195211] 6-[ADDRESS_801723] serious underlying immunosuppressive 
illnesses.
The differential diagnosis of GV includes eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme, 
inadvertent inoculation at multiple sites, and uncommonly, early stages of progressive 
vaccinia or other vesicular diseases (e.g. , severe chickenpox or disseminated herpes). 
Several publications have investigated the reporting of GV among those individuals who 
received smallpox vaccinations during 2003. Out of 38,440 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 29 reports 
of possible GV during January 2003–December 2003 were identified but only 2 reports 
met the case definition. More than 75% of the reports received a final diagnosis of 
hypersensitivity reaction or nonspecific rash after review by [CONTACT_195272]. Of 74 cases 
investigated in 753,226 smallpox vaccinations administered in December 2002 to 
December 2004, 50 (67.6%) met the case definition of possible GV. Cases occurred more 
frequently in primary vaccinees (rate, 81 per 1 million vaccinees) than in those 
revaccinated (rate, 32 per 1 million vaccinees). However, none met the case definition of 
probable or confirmed GV, including 15 with virologically negative laboratory evaluations 
(e.g., culture, polymerase chain reaction, or skin biopsy). Twenty-one reports of postscab 
lesions were made between January and August 2003 among 37,542 smallpox vaccinees. 
The lesions (scab and/or fluid) of seven patients were tested for vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_195273]/or immunohistochemistry; all were found to be negative. In 
addition, the postscab lesions of four of the patients were biopsied. The results from two 
of the biopsies suggested an allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], and results of one each 
demonstrated chronic dermatitis and squamous cell carcinoma. None of the four biopsied 
lesions had histologic evidence of viropathic changes and no evidence supported smallpox 
vaccination as a cause for any of the lesions. 
5.Eczema vaccinatum: Eczema vaccinatum is a serious complication in persons with 
eczema and other types of chronic or exfoliative skin conditions. It can also occur among 
eczematous contacts of recently vaccinated persons. Vaccinial lesions (generalized 
papular, vesicular or pustular lesions) develop on areas of the skin that are, or had at one 
time been, eczematous. These areas become highly inflamed and lesions may spread to 
healthy skin. The rash is often accompanied by [CONTACT_195274]. 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/2023
77The fatality rate for untreated cases (prior to availability of VIG) has been reported from 
30-40%. Following availability of VIG, mortality was reduced to approximately 7%. Early 
diagnosis and prompt treatment with VIG is necessary to reduce mortality. 
6.Progressive vaccinia: Progressive vaccinia is the most serious cutaneous complication, 
occurring when the local vaccination lesion fails to heal and develops progressive necrosis, 
with destruction of large areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and underlying structures. 
Progressive lesions may spread to other skin surfaces and to bone and viscera.  Progressive 
vaccinia is associated with a high mortality rate. This complication has been seen in 
patients with a compromised immune system due to a congenital deficiency, 
lymphoproliferative disease, immunosuppressive treatment, or HIV infection. 
Management should include aggressive VIG therapy.
7.Post-Vaccinial Encephalitis/Encephalomyelitis: Vaccinial complications affecting the 
CNS are unpredictable. Post-vaccinial encephalitis typi[INVESTIGATOR_195212] < [ADDRESS_801724] ranged from 
15-25%, with 25% of patients who recover being left with varying degrees and types of 
neurological deficits. VIG has not been shown to be effective in treating CNS disease and 
is not recommended. Post-vaccinial encephalitis/
encephalomyelitis are diagnoses of exclusion and are not believed to be a result of 
replicating vaccinia virus. Although no specific therapy exists, supportive care, 
anticonvulsants, and intensive care might be required. A review of vaccinia-related deaths 
(68) during a 9-year period (1959–1966 and 1968) revealed that among first-time vaccines, 
36 (52%) patients died as a result of post-vaccinial encephalitis.   
8.Fetal Vaccinia: Fetal vaccinia is a rare, but serious complication following vaccinia 
vaccination during pregnancy or shortly before conception (e.g., within four weeks). To 
date, fewer than [ADDRESS_801725] been reported and often result in fetal or neonatal death. 
Efficacy of VIG therapy in a viable infant or used prophylactically in women during 
pregnancy is unknown. The CDC has established a National Smallpox Vaccine in 
Pregnancy Registry. This registry will follow women during their pregnancies and their 
babies, after they are born, to determine the outcome of such pregnancies. The CDC can 
be contact[CONTACT_6811] ([PHONE_4238].
9.Myocarditis/Pericarditis:  The CDC has recommended a temporary medical deferral to 
the voluntary Smallpox Vaccination Program for persons with heart disease or 
cardiovascular risk factors (March 25, 2003) and issued “interim supplementary 
information” regarding evidence that smallpox vaccination may cause myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis (March 31, 2003) in people recently vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine. The 
cardiac events reported include myocardial infarction, angina, myocarditis, pericarditis, 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801726] of 
Health strain of vaccinia from December 2002 through December 2003, 67 developed 
symptomatic myopericarditis. In the 61 ECGs that were reviewed, an identifiable 
abnormality was evident in 46 (75.4%). The most common abnormalities included ST-
segment changes observed evident in 40 patients (65.6%); 5 patients (8.2%) had normal 
variant early repolarization, and T-wave abnormalities were noted in 11 patients (18.0%). 
In addition, cardiac enzymes were elevated in 60 of 61 (98.4%) patients evaluated with this 
assay. On follow-up of 64 patients, all patients had objective normalization of 
electrocardiography, echocardiography, graded exercise testing, laboratory testing, and 
functional status; 8 (13%) reported atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], non-limiting persistent chest discomfort. 
Among 37,901 health care workers vaccinated with the identical strain, 21 myo/pericarditis 
cases were identified; 18 (86%) were revacinees. Twelve met criteria for either myocarditis 
or myopericarditis, and 9 met criteria for pericarditis only (6 suspected and 3 probable). 
The severity of myo/pericarditis was mild, with no fatalities, although 9 patients (43%) 
were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].
Treatment of Vaccinia Vaccination Complications
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG):  First-line treatment of some of the complications of vaccinia 
caused by [CONTACT_195275] (severe cases of inadvertent inoculation involving 
extensive lesions or if comorbid conditions exist, severe cases of generalized vaccinia in patients 
that are systemically ill and whose condition might be toxic or who have serious underlying 
immunosuppressive illnesses, eczema vaccinatum, and progressive vaccinia) is with VIG. VIG is 
contraindicated, however, for the treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis. VIG is a sterile solution 
of the immunoglobulin fraction of pooled plasma from individuals inoculated with vaccinia 
vaccine. VIG is only available through the CDC’s Strategic National Pharmaceutical Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_195213]’s Clinician Information Line at [PHONE_4230] or the Director's Emergency 
Operations Center (DEOC) at [PHONE_4239]. Upon receipt of a call from a patient or upon direct 
Abbreviated Title: Combination Immunotherapy 
Version Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_801727] a call to the CDC as soon as possible: 1) to initiate review 
of the clinical case, 2) to seek consultation on the appropriateness of VIG therapy, 3) to determine 
the appropriate VIG dose and dosing method for administration, if VIG therapy is required, and 4) 
to determine how to access and have the appropriate doses of VIG delivered. Early institution of 
VIG therapy is advised following recognition of clinical symptoms compatible with some vaccinia 
complications (eczema vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, and some 
cases of inadvertent inoculation). The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to be time dependent. 
VIG has not proven to be of benefit in the treatment of post-vaccinial encephalitis, and is 
contraindicated for treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis due to the increased risk of corneal 
scarring. A new IV formulation of VIG that has a lower level of aggregated protein allowing it to 
be used by [CONTACT_195276]. This formulation will most 
likely be preferred for administration and the CDC will instruct investigators regarding appropriate 
dosing and method of administration based on the formulation and availability. There is no 
guarantee that VIG will successfully treat complications. At present, there are no other anti-viral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195188]-related complications.

SAR = serious adverse reactions.
The important potential risks include hypersensitivity, irAEs/autoimmune disorders, anemia, rash 
with hyperkeratosis/keratoacanthomas/SCC of the skin, embryo-fetal toxicity, and impaired 
wound healing. The important identified risks with bintrafusp alfa observed to data were overall 
manageable. Mucosal bleeding events of mild to moderate severity were observed in participants 
treated with bintrafusp alfa in ongoing studies and are a potential risk for bintrafusp alfa. Events 
may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hemoptysis, gingival bleeding or hematuria amongst others. In general, 
these reactions resolve without discontinuation of treatment. 
In addition, after discussion among NCI investigators on multiple protocols using M7824, multiple 
bleeding events ranging from low grade gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_148332], GI bleeding and hematuria have been observed. Some of these events can be attributed 
to bleeding events related to cancer directly and others bleeding events can be attributed to colitis 
or cystitis which is a known toxicity of anti-PD-L1 agents including M7824. However, there 
remains the possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in ways that may not 
be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events described with 
checkpoint inhibitors like M7824. It is hypothesized that this possible increased bleeding risk may 
be due to TGF beta inhibition which has an effect on angiogenesis; bleeding has also been observed 
in participants receiving M7824 and may be drug-related (e.g., gum bleeding, nose bleeds, 
coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool). Accordingly, participants will be 
notified of the same possible risk in the informed consent document for this study.

87Embryofetal toxicities are known risk of the PD 1/PD L1 targeting class and are considered 
important potential risks for MSB0011359C. Animal models link the PD 1/PD L1 signaling 
pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal 
tissue. Embryofetal toxicity is an important potential risk of MSB0011359C. An appropriate 
contraception warning is provided as part of the inclusion criteria. Pregnant and breastfeeding 
women are not allowed in the MSB0011359C study, and adequate contraceptive measures are 
recommended during the study to minimize or eliminate the potential risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].
14.4.3 Formulation and preparation 
MSB0011359C is supplied as a liquid formulation packaged at a 10 mg/mL concentration in 
USP/Ph Eur Type I 50R vials that are filled with drug product solution to allow an extractable 
volume of 60 mL (600mg/mL). The liquid formulation must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride 
for injection solution to a total volume of [ADDRESS_801732] be stored at 2°C to 8°C until use. The storage condition is based on data 
from ongoing long term stability studies with M7824.
M7824 drug product stored at room (23°C to 27°C) or higher temperatures for extended periods 
of time might be subject to degradation. M7824 must not be frozen. Rough shaking of the 
reconstituted solution must be avoided.
The chemical and physical in-use stability for the infusion solution of M7824 in 0.9% saline 
solution has been demonstrated for a total of [ADDRESS_801733] in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to administration are the responsibility 
of the user.
No other drugs should be added to the infusion containers containing M7824.
14.4.5 Administration procedures
M7824 is administered as a 1-hour intravenous (iv) infusion once every [ADDRESS_801734] be in accordance with the respective clinical study protocol.

1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
2. How should you care for the vaccination site? 
3. Are there any activities I should avoid?
4. What about contact [CONTACT_195277]?
5. Who do I contact [CONTACT_152561] I have a question?
 1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
A typi[INVESTIGATOR_195219] a patient who has been previously vaccinated with vaccinia includes the 
appearance of a small swelling in 2-[ADDRESS_801736] 
very little skin reaction.  Often the leg that received the vaccine may become swollen. Swollen or 
tender lymph nodes (“glands”) in the groin may be felt. A fever to 100-101F may occur on the 
second or third day. You may notice that you feel tired for 3 or 4 days. The vaccination site may 
itch for about 2 weeks while the scab is forming. You can take acetaminophen ("Tylenol") if you 
have any aches or fever but should avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. If fever continues for more than a day or two, 
you should call to speak to the clinic nurse or the research nurse. 
In patients who have never received vaccinia or in some who received it a very long time ago, a 
red swelling is followed by [CONTACT_605399] 5 to 6 and then formation of a pustule (or "boil") 1-[ADDRESS_801737] week leaving a scar roughly 1/2 inch in 
diameter. Fever and malaise (the "blahs") may occur during the blister and pustular phases. 
Swollen and tender lymph nodes may persist for months. Many of the local toxicities described 
(e.g., pustule and scab formation) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_195220]. These reactions may be seen, but are usually not seen 
when administered via subcutaneous injection.
 2. How should you care for the vaccination site?
Live vaccinia virus is in skin cells at the vaccination site during the 1-2 weeks until healing has 
occurred. Maximal viral "shedding" from the vaccination site occurs from days 4-14, but can 
continue until the scab falls off from the skin. After that there is no vaccinia virus in your body. 
You can spread the virus to other parts of your body or to other people by [CONTACT_195278], mouth, a cut or some other break in the skin. You do not pass 
vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_195279].
In general, frequent careful hand washing by [CONTACT_195280]. You should also use two types of barriers over 
your vaccination site at all times until the scab is gone. These barriers are (1) the bandage and (2) 
clothing (pants or elbow length sleeves depending on the site of vaccination). These barriers 
should remain in place until the scab has fallen off.

gloves, and zip-lock plastic bags. If you run out of supplies between visits, you can use a dry 
sterile bandage (gauze or "First-Aid" or "Telfa") from the drug store.
The no-stick pad ("First-Aid" or "Telfa" pad) dressing should be worn until the site has healed. If it 
remains clean and dry and is not coming off, you do not need to change it. If the dressing gets wet 
either from drainage from the vaccination or from water when you are showering or if it starts 
coming off, you should remove it and put on a clean bandage. Wear the gloves when handling the 
old dressings. Put the old dressing and the gloves in the zip-lock bag, then wash your hands, put on 
the new bandage, and wash your hands again. You do not need to wear gloves for the new 
bandage. You do not need to wash the vaccination site, but while the dressing is off, you may wash 
it lightly with a cloth, soap, and water. If you do wash, blot the site dry with a towel (don't rub), 
then put the wash cloth and the towel in the laundry. Do not let the shower run on the unbandaged 
site because live virus could be washed onto other areas on your body. Do not put any steroid 
cream, medicated creams, or other ointments on the vaccination site.
Before you throw away the zip-lock bag with the old dressing and gloves in it, pour a little bleach 
(about a quarter cup) in the bag to help kill any virus.
Wash your hands after each step.
 3. Are there any activities I should avoid or take special care?
You should not go swimming until the vaccination site has healed and you no longer need to wear 
a bandage on it. 
If you wear contact [CONTACT_13276], have removable dentures, have a colostomy or any other "open" area on 
your body that needs daily care, always wash your hands very well before handling your contact 
[CONTACT_13276], dentures, dressings, etc. Take care of all of these procedures before changing your 
vaccination dressing.
 4. What about contact [CONTACT_195277]?
Remember, frequent careful hand washing by [CONTACT_195281]. During the time you need to wear 
a bandage (for 7-14 days after vaccination) there are several kinds of people with whom you 
should avoid close contact. "Close contact" means that you sleep in the same bed with the person, 
give the person baths, and/or touch their bare skin to change their clothes (or diapers), apply 
ointments, or change their bandages. 
The individuals you should avoid include children < 3years of age; pregnant women or nursing 
women; individuals with eczema, history of eczema or other skin conditions such as active cases 
of extensive psoriasis, severe rashes, generalized itching, infections, burns, chicken pox, or skin 
trauma; and/or immune suppressed individuals such as individuals with leukemia or lymphoma, 
with AIDS, or those receiving immunosuppressive treatment (for example, after organ transplant).

1  Detailed Protocol  Title: Initiating Substance use disorder treatment for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826385]: A randomized trial of recovery coaches.  Version Date: 09/04/2020  I. Background:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826386] (OUD) patients: Patients with OUD are susceptible to a variety of medical, psychiatric, and social complications, and utilize acute health services at a rate nearly [ADDRESS_1146257] increased dramatically in the context of the national opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562].3,4 Due to the complex nature of the co-morbidities, their need for acute medical care is enormous. In a study of 58,243 Medicaid patients in [LOCATION_001] State with a drug use disorder, 37.5% of HIV-negative individuals had at least one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826387], with an average of 24.5 inpatient days.5 OUD patients’ admissions incur 2.5 times the financial charges as compared to patients without OUD.6 Once discharged, patients with substance use disorders (SUD) are readmitted at much higher rates than those without a SUD.7–9 Given the frequency in which OUD patients access hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826388].10 Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is insufficient to engage out-of-treatment OUD patients: A large majority (90%) of individuals with active SUD are not engaged with any formal treatment.11 For OUD patients, the shortage of physicians willing to prescribe buprenorphine is a contributing factor.12,13 A promising approach so far in engaging out-of-treatment SUD patients has been Screening, Brief intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT).14–18 SBIRT uses universal and opportunistic screenings for substance use in medical settings using validated tools (i.e. AUDIT-C19), followed by a brief intervention and/or referral to treatment, making it one of the highest-ranking preventative services offered in general health care settings.20–[ADDRESS_1146258] been largely negative.23–28 Therefore, SBIRT alone is insufficient in reducing drug use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], and clinicians and researchers need to look at interventions that focus on engagement with SUD treatment, initiation of medication-assisted treatment, or lengthier interventions.7,28 Initiation of buprenorphine for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826389]: Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine is almost always initiated in the outpatient setting.29–31 Indeed, only a small fraction (10.7-16.7%) of patients admitted for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related issue received any FDA-approved OUD medication within 30-days of discharge.32,[ADDRESS_1146259] documented the feasibility of initiating buprenorphine during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].34–37 In our previous study of 47 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826390], 46.8% successfully continued treatment following discharge.35 In another study of 145 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826391] (intervention) or buprenorphine detoxification alone (control), those in the intervention arm were significantly more likely to continue outpatient treatment (72.2% vs 11.9%).34 However, by 6 months after discharge, only a small proportion of those subjects in either arm remained in treatment (16.7% intervention vs 3.0% control). In a randomized trial of 329 OUD patients in the emergency room, subjects received 1) screening and referral [referral], 2) screening, brief intervention, and referral [brief intervention], or 3) screening, brief intervention, and initiation of buprenorphine [buprenorphine]. Those initiated on buprenorphine, compared to those who were not, were significantly more likely to be engaged with buprenorphine treatment 
2  following discharge (78% [buprenorphine] vs 45% [brief intervention] vs 37% [referral], p<0.001).[ADDRESS_1146260] that initiation of buprenorphine in acute care settings facilitate linkage to outpatient treatment. However, because patients face numerous internal and external barriers to remaining engaged with treatment and reducing illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], a more intensive intervention that continues into the community may be needed. Interventions that improve transitions of care tailored to OUD patients are needed to reduce readmissions: In the US, almost 20% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826392] [ADDRESS_1146261] effective in reducing readmissions: 1) monitoring and managing symptoms, 2) educating and promoting self-management skills, and 3) enlisting social and community supports.40–43 Even though SUD patients, compared to those without, are 1.5 times more likely to be re-admitted due to their complex biopsychosocial needs, research to reduce readmissions has not focused on SUD patients.7–9,[ADDRESS_1146262] provided a telephone follow-up to provide education and support.45 The intervention reduced readmissions (0.695, 95% CI, 0.515 to 0.937), but patients with drug use disorders still had twice the odds of readmission (1.97, 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.63).7 Given that drug using patients receiving regular SUD treatment can experience a 15% reduction in subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], more research is needed with interventions tailored specifically for OUD patients.5 Care management may be needed during transitions of care to educate and support hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826393]: Care management interventions are designed to meet the needs of individual patients by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_826394], showing promise with a variety of illnesses including SUD. 46–[ADDRESS_1146263] (recovery coaches), or to a matched attention control consisting of health education sessions.55 The care manager helped with treatment planning following discharge, encouraged adherence to treatment, and educated about addiction and relapse prevention skills. Those in the intervention arm were more likely to be engaged with outpatient treatment at 8 weeks than compared to control subjects (44 vs 22%, p<0.01). Given the complex medical and psychosocial needs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826393], more research on care management interventions that focus on the transitions of care for OUD patients is needed.  Recovery coaches (i.e. peer-driven recovery supports) may be necessary to support OUD patients in the community: There is a growing body of evidence for the benefits of recovery coaches, who provide peer-delivered support services, to help SUD patients in the community.55–63 Tracing their origin to mutual support groups to supplement traditional clinical services, recovery coaches are individuals with lived experience of recovery, and are referred to by a variety of names in the literature (i.e. consumer providers, peer support specialists, peer workers/mentors). Recovery coaches typi[INVESTIGATOR_826395]: 1) emotional (demonstrate empathy, bolster confidence, and foster hope), 2) informational (share knowledge and help skill-building), 3) instrumental (provide assistance with housing, employment, transportation, etc.), and 4) affiliational (create community and sense of belonging).[ADDRESS_1146264] addresses these unmeet needs by [CONTACT_6310] a novel intervention to improve the treatment of OUD patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826396]. The intervention will 
3  combine 1) medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine initiated in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 2) care management to address domains known to improve transitions of care (monitoring and managing symptoms, encouraging self-management skills, and enlisting community and social supports40–43), and 3) recovery coaches to assist the patient in the community after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Previous studies lacked one or more of these components, or were not focused on OUD patients. While the use of buprenorphine has been studied with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], previous studies did not provide longitudinal support in the community following discharge.34,[ADDRESS_1146265] also not been studied to improve treatment retention of OUD patients treated with buprenorphine59. In this study, the trainings and responsibilities of the recovery coach and care management will be merged into one role. Further, this study brings these promising elements together into one novel model. If successful, this model could prove useful for engaging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826397]-of-treatment OUD patients.   II. Aims: Our hypothesis is that the recovery coach intervention will be associated with greater success not only in remaining in treatment, but also in reducing the likelihood of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394].   Specific Aim #1: To assess whether subjects randomized to the recovery coach intervention will demonstrate greater retention in treatment and better opi[INVESTIGATOR_826398] 24 weeks compared to control subjects in a randomized controlled trial. Hypothesis 1a: Subjects receiving the intervention will be more likely to remain in treatment at 24 weeks, as compared to control subjects.  Hypothesis 1b: Subjects receiving the intervention will report fewer days of illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_826399] 30 days at 24 weeks, as compared to control subjects.  Specific Aim #2: To assess whether subjects receiving the intervention will demonstrate fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449543] 24 weeks compared to control subjects in a randomized controlled trial.  Hypothesis 2: Subjects receiving the intervention will report fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449543] [ADDRESS_1146266] selection:  Inclusion criteria: • English speaking, adults aged 18-75 • DSM-5 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], severe, actively using illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_826400] • Have a working telephone • Can identify at least [ADDRESS_1146267] following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] • Willing to engage in treatment (either a psychosocial treatment program AND/OR any medication treatment with methadone or buprenorphine) • In SUD treatment for less than 6 months and/or not currently in treatment   Exclusion criteria: • Liver function test >3x upper normal limit • Pregnant • Psychotic disorder, active suicidality or homicidality  
4  • Condition likely to be terminal in 24 weeks such as cancer • Unable to perform consent due to mental status   IV. Subject enrollment:  Recruitment will be conducted at BWH and BWFH. Study population will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826401], and who are willing to engage in treatment (either a psychosocial treatment program and/or any medication treatment with methadone or buprenorphine). The electronic medical record will be programmed to produce a daily report of any patient with OUD admitted to the inpatient medical units. This program will utilize a natural language processing algorithm, which will use medical records to find patients with OUD who are not currently on buprenorphine but may be candidates for it (and therefore also potentially eligible for the study). Because the algorithm will need to be trained to correctly identify potential patients based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, there will also be a non-intervention/non-interaction group, specifically patients who do not have OUD (and thus would not be potential subjects for recruitment). The data from these patients would be obtained via RPDR, with the sole purpose of training the algorithm and confirming that it is indeed correctly excluding ineligible subjects based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826402]. Finally, all patients with OUD who are referred for an addiction consultation, and willing to engage in treatment after discharge will be approached for possible inclusion.   Either the primary medical team or the addiction psychiatry team will first inform the patient about the study. If the patient expresses interest and consents to be approached by [CONTACT_5984], the research assistant will be notified. The research assistant will first ask the patient’s inpatient nurse about the appropriateness of approaching the patient. Once the nurse agrees that the patient can be approached, the research assistant will provide further information to the patient about the study.  The patient will also be provided with a flyer that provides a concise summary of the study to allow ample time for patients to consider the study.   Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_1146268] is discharged. In this case, all preceding recruitment procedures will remain the same; either the primary medical team or the addiction psychiatry team will inform the patient about the study and ask whether the patient consents to be approached by [CONTACT_3476]. If the patient consents, the research assistant will introduce the study, answer questions, determine preliminary study eligibility, and allow ample time for the patient to consider whether to enroll. The research assistant will also leave a physical copy of the Research Study Fact Sheet, the informed consent form, and the “Notification of Changes due to COVID-19” general information sheet. These will be for the patient to keep and review in case the research assistant is unable to return for an in-person follow-up to review and sign the consent form, after the patient has had time to consider the study. In the case that enrollment will continue remotely, the research assistant will call the participant to conduct the consent discussion, and then subsequently randomize the participant and conduct the baseline measures remotely via phone. Since this is a minimal risk research study, the remote process would use a verbal consent process which requires waiver of informed consent documentation (no signature [CONTACT_826437]).  A study staff will approach potential participants to determine preliminary study eligibility. Based on prior studies of this population, we expect OUD patients to have the following characteristics: 50% male, 70% Caucasian, 40% with prior heroin use, admission diagnosis of acute pain (40%) and infection (20%), length of stay of 11 days, and 80% needing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] 
[ADDRESS_1146269] no medical or surgical contraindications. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria will then be applied.  V. Study procedures:  Randomization: After informed consent is given, participants will be randomized using a computerized random number generator with numbers in sealed envelopes in study binders.  Interventions: Control group: Participants in the control arm will receive treatment-as-usual at our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All participants will receive a thorough psychosocial evaluation to help with discharge planning. Following initiation of buprenorphine or methadone, the addiction social worker will provide the participant with the intake number for the BWH-affiliated buprenorphine programs, or contact [CONTACT_826427]. Patient preference due to geographic considerations will be taken into account when choosing the clinic to which participants are Table 2: Components of the ISTOP intervention In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826403] (adapted from MISSION manual) Session #1: (90 minutes with Recovery Coach) 1) Introduce recovery coach, and review overall intervention 2) Complete a psychosocial needs assessment 3) Create a provisional treatment plan based on identified service needs and prioritizing of goals. 4) Refer to BWH/BWFH-affiliated buprenorphine clinic 5) Use motivational interviewing to increase motivation for treatment  6) Review the following areas: A.

6  referred. The participants will be encouraged to schedule an appointment prior to discharge. Instructions on safely tapering the buprenorphine will be reviewed prior to discharge, in the event the participant does not initiate treatment before the prescription runs out. Participants will be provided with community resources including outpatient addiction programs, 12-step meetings, and referral to outpatient mental health treatment if needed. We recognize that the control group does not balance non-specific effects of the intervention (e.g. increased attention). If our finding is promising, this study will help inform better control group design to account for non-specific effects of the intervention.   ISTOP intervention group: The intervention arm will include in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212052]-discharge components (Table 2). Both components will be adapted from the MISSION-VET manual68 under supervision from the mentors to be used for the ISTOP treatment manual. The candidate and recovery coaches will meet weekly to review all participants in the study. If the participant is re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826405], the team will remain engaged with the patient, and the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826406].   In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826403]: There will be 2 sessions during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unless the patient is being discharged imminently, in which case both sessions will be completed at the same time (Table 2). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all recovery coach visits (both “in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and post-discharge) will occur remotely (either via phone or Partners Enterprise Zoom) until further notice. During the first session, the recovery coach will review goals of the intervention, complete a psychosocial needs assessment, and create a provisional treatment plan based on identified service needs. Following initiation of buprenorphine or methadone, the addiction social worker will provide the participant with the intake numbers for the BWH-affiliated buprenorphine programs and contact [CONTACT_826428]. Patient preference due to geographic considerations will be taken into account when choosing the clinic to which participants are referred. The participants will be encouraged to schedule an appointment prior to discharge. The importance of continuing treatment will be reinforced. The recovery coach will focus on monitoring and managing symptoms, educate about the nature of recovery and relapse prevention skills, and reinforce the importance of community and social supports. The MISSION-VET manual, which covers the above elements, will be used to manualize the recovery coach intervention while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].[ADDRESS_1146271]-discharge component: Following discharge, the recovery coach will meet with the participant up to 3 hours per week (Table 2). Each recovery coach will carry a caseload of no more than [ADDRESS_1146272] with essential life skills such as setting up a bank account or using public transportation. The candidate will meet 
7  weekly with the recovery coaches to review each case. If the participant successfully linked with the BWH-affiliated buprenorphine clinic, retention in treatment will be confirmed with the clinic.   Fidelity: The MISSION Fidelity Index from the MISSION-VET manual68 will be adapted for this study to ensure intervention fidelity. The index is designed to document services delivered as indicated in the manual.  Compensation: Participants will be reimbursed $50 for the baseline, 4- and 12-week follow-up visit, and $100 for the 24-week visit.  Schedule of Assessments: Baseline measures will be obtained during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Follow up assessments will occur at 4, [ADDRESS_1146273] all data. Patients who are unable to return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826407]-up assessments will complete their measures via phone call or Partners Enterprise Zoom (if participant prefers) with the research assistant.   Measures: As recommended by [CONTACT_826429]-DA-12-008, measures from the Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection of the PhenX Toolkit were chosen where appropriate. The schedule of assessments is summarized in Table 3.  • Demographic measures (Core Tier 1 measures): A questionnaire to collect demographic information on age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment, housing, education, and socioeconomic status. • Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)72: A brief structured psychiatric diagnostic interview that was designed to permit the rapid diagnosis of the major psychiatric disorders. • Pregnancy test: Females will undergo pregnancy testing at the time of screening. • Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES)74: To assess readiness. • Urine toxicology: Routine urine immunoassay screen will be obtained to assessed, including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. These will be obtained during routine clinical visits, separate from study visits. • Addiction Severity Index 5th edition (ASI)75: The ASI will assess multiple dimensions of SUD.  • Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506]76,77: A single-item questionnaire will be used to determine craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. • Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ9)78: This questionnaire will assess depressive symptoms. • Brief Pain Inventory79: Pain severity and the degree to which pain interferes with life will be assessed.  • Time-line follow back (TLFB)81: Assess past 30-day use of substances. • Verification of treatment retention: Treatment retention will be verified by [CONTACT_826430]/BWFH-affiliated clinic.  • The Health-Care Climate Questionnaire - Recovery Coach version (HCCQ-RC): A brief 15-item measure added to assess patients' perceptions of the degree to which they experience their recovery coach to be autonomy supportive. • Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ): A survey designed to collect information from adults about events they experienced in the first 18 years of their lives, including family dysfunction and exposure to violence.  • Health-Care Climate Questionnaire – Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826408] (HCCQ-HCT): A brief 15-item measure added to assess patients' perceptions of the degree to which 
8  they experienced the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219351] (e.g. nurses, doctors, social workers) to be autonomy supportive.  • PTSD Checklist (PCL-5): A 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, corresponding with DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. • Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM): A 17-item, progress-monitoring instrument for patients in treatment for a substance use disorder, used to assess risk factors for substance use, protective factors that support sobriety, and drug and alcohol use.  • Short Form 12 health survey (SF-12): A short 12-item survey that assesses mental and physical functioning as well as overall health-related quality of life.    Screening Baseline [ADDRESS_1146274] Timeline: The first 8 months of Year 1 will be devoted to hiring of the study staff, the intervention manual development, staff training, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-testing the protocol with 2 participants, and protocol refinement. During the intervention period, 6 patients will be screened for potential enrollment every month, enrolling 2 participants per month on average for 30 months, concluding by [CONTACT_468767] 4. Manuscript submission will begin in Year 1. Year 4-5 will be devoted to data analysis, and submission of an R01 grant application (Table 4). Anticipated problems:  Slow recruitment: If recruitment does not proceed as planned, we will increase outreach to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826409].  Adjustments to the intervention: The first [ADDRESS_1146275] operating procedures, recruitment, manual adaptation, and measures will be made according to these Table 3: Schedule of measures 
9  2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_389164]. Because the study procedures will be adapted from the MISSION manual, an established treatment manual, 2 participants should be sufficient to assess the need for modifications.    VI. Biostatistical analysis: Sample size/power analysis:  In a study of a care management intervention for patients with substance use disorder in primary care, individuals receiving the intervention were more likely to remain in treatment at 24 weeks (40% vs 10%).[ADDRESS_1146276] size, we plan to screen 145 participants, assuming a 60% attrition due to screening failure, allowing for a sample size of 58 available for analysis, evenly divided between the control and intervention arm. This will yield a statistical power of 0.8 and 95% confidence level to detect differences in proportions of participants who remain in treatment at [ADDRESS_1146277] sizes to adequately power future studies.  Specific Aim #1: The hypothesis that participants receiving the intervention will be more likely to remain in buprenorphine treatment at 24 weeks will be tested using logistic regression, treating the endpoint as a categorical variable. Treatment retention data will be obtained directly from the BWH/BWFH affiliated buprenorphine clinics. The hypothesis that participants receiving the intervention will report fewer days of illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_192842] [ADDRESS_1146278] for relevant covariates, including age, sex, ethnicity/race, and baseline illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_826410].  Specific Aim #2: The hypothesis that participants receiving the intervention will be less likely to be readmitted at [ADDRESS_1146279] of the proposed intervention.  Missing data: Extensive efforts will be made to avoid missing data by [CONTACT_826431]. Missing data on treatment continuation or retention will be imputed as treatment discontinuation (i.e. participant did not continue or remain in treatment). Missing urine toxicology samples will be treated as positive for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Data on possible reasons for missing observations will be collected so that missing data mechanism may be appropriately modeled statistically. Using methods to manage missing data, results will be compared to the original dataset to identify any discrepancies and verify conclusions.     VII. Risks and discomforts The well being of the study participants is of utmost importance. The in-depth screening procedure has been designed to ensure that individuals with any underlying medical or psychiatric illness are identified that may place them at greater risk for experiencing adverse effects during the study. The study procedures are designed to be minimally invasive and associated with minimal risk. Alternative procedures with lower risk are not available. Nevertheless, the protocol raises several areas of concerns: confidentiality, emotional distress, suicidal ideation, buprenorphine medication, intoxication, and overdose.  
10  Confidentiality: Confidentiality is of utmost importance given the sensitive nature of the illness and data collected. During research there is always a possibility for a breach of confidentiality, which may potentially cause personal, social, occupational, legal, and other harm. Our research team is very aware of the importance of maintaining strict confidentiality and has prior experience dealing with sensitive information. The following precautions will be used to protect the privacy of participants and maintain confidentiality of research data: all staff will be trained in confidentiality and data security procedures; privacy will be maintained by [CONTACT_598981][INVESTIGATOR_207645], sound-proof rooms; data will be de-identified and coded with unique ID numbers; data will be securely stored in locked filing cabinets in locked rooms; electronic data will be stored in password protected documents located on password protected computers and secure servers; the key linking participants names and ID numbers will be stored in a separate password protected document in a password protected computer; access to data storage areas will be restricted to authorized study personnel; and all analysis will be conducted on de-identified data. While breach of confidentiality is possible, these safeguards will ensure that such a breach will be highly unlikely.  Emotional distress: Some patients may experience discomfort or embarrassment related to providing urine samples or answering questions about substance use and other personal behaviors. They could also experience unexpected encounters with friends or associates while in the study. However, based on prior studies with this population, we expect the degree of distress to be very limited. All research personnel will be extensively trained on study procedures, including the conduct of the interviews that elicit personal information, and the importance of being sensitive to and respectful of all participants. In cases where emotional distress does occur, research personnel will be trained on how to identify and address it, and when to terminate an interview. Multiple levels of back-up support for research personnel will be developed. The candidate is a board certified psychiatrist, and will be able to ensure that appropriate services are received.  Suicidal ideation: Patients with OUD frequently have psychiatric co-morbidities, namely depression. Participants who disclose any suicidal ideation during the study (either through self-report during an assessment or self-reported on the PHQ-9) will be addressed appropriately and with sensitivity. Any disclosures will be handled within existing legal mandates, clinical practice, and social norms. Consistent with standard clinical practice, when possible, disclosures will be discussed with the participant to determine the best management options. This may include notifying the inpatient/outpatient providers or family members, referring to medical treatment, calling emergency services, or escorting the participant to the Emergency Room at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. When required by [CONTACT_2371], the police department will be notified. The candidate is a board certified psychiatrist and has extensive experience managing acutely distressed patients with mental or substance use disorders.  Buprenorphine medication safety: All subjects in the trial will be started on buprenorphine prior to randomization, and will be deemed appropriate for the medication by [CONTACT_826432] a buprenorphine-waived physician on the addiction consultation-liaison team. Buprenorphine has been tested extensively and is FDA-approved for the treatment of OUD. Indeed, medication-assisted treatment (with buprenorphine, methadone or naltrexone) is the standard of care for the treatment of OUD. Because buprenorphine is a partial mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], the medication can in some individuals cause intoxication, especially if used intravenously. As such, only the combination tablet that contains naloxone will be used, unless the participant has a documented allergy to naloxone. The combination tablet will produce a clinically significant opi[INVESTIGATOR_826411]. All participants will be told of this reaction, and will also be asked to refrain from injecting the medication. Buprenorphine can also cause a mild euphoria and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], but much less than compared to full agonists. Subjects will be monitored during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826412] 
[ADDRESS_1146280] will be obtained. Subjects will be informed that buprenorphine medication should be stored in a secure location, ideally with a lock-box, to ensure no one else can access the medication including children. Finally, studies show that after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_826413], individuals are at heightened risk of relapse to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], as well as greater likelihood of non-fatal and fatal overdoses. As such, subjects will be counseled about the risks of relapse and overdose throughout the study period. Intoxication: The study population targets OUD patients, who were actively using illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_826414]. As such, it is possible for participants to be intoxicated from illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_826415]. Participants will be required to abstain from substances other than buprenorphine for at least [ADDRESS_1146281] management options. This may include notifying the inpatient/outpatient providers or family members, referring to medical treatment, calling emergency services, or escorting the participant to the Emergency Room at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   Overdose: Patients with OUD are at heightened risk from fatal and non-fatal overdoses during and after buprenorphine treatment, especially if using alcohol or sedative drugs such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. As such, participants will be required to abstain from using these substances. However, given their underling illness, some participants may still ingest these other substances during the study period. All study staff, including recovery coaches, and all participating subjects will be trained in the recognition and initial management of an overdose using the naloxone-rescue kits. Subjects will also be asked to identify family or supports that can carry the naloxone rescue kits. The candidate is a board certified addiction psychiatrist well versed in the recognition and management of overdoses, and appropriate clinical action will be taking in the event of an overdose. In addition, all recovery coaches will be receive training on overdose prevention and the use of naloxone rescue kits.    VIII. Potential benefits:  The risk/benefit ratio for this study is relatively low, primarily because the intervention and the data collection procedures are minimally invasive. An extensive screening procedure will ensure that individuals entering the trial will have no contraindications. Trained research personnel will perform all study procedures to minimize risks, discomforts, and adverse effects. Buprenorphine treatment is a FDA-approved treatment for the treatment of OUD, and reduces illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_207656]. The recovery coaching intervention may provide benefit to the study participants by [CONTACT_826433], reducing their illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394]. 
[ADDRESS_1146282], and the minimal risk associated with participation, we believe that the risk to participants is reasonable.    IX. Monitoring and quality assurance:  1. Data Quality and Management a. Description of plan for data quality and management: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826416]. To minimize any conflicts of interest, a physician from Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826417] a collaborator or investigator on the proposed project, nor a close colleague, will serve as an independent individual to monitor the data and safety. b. Frequency of review: The candidate will complete reports every 3 months detailing the study progress and subjects’ status, any adverse events, and any protocol deviations, which will be submitted to the independent individual for review. 2. Subject Accrual and Compliance a. Measurement and Reporting of Subject Accrual, Compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria: Review of the rate of subject accrual and compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur every 3 months to ensure that a sufficient number of participants are being enrolled and that they meet eligibility criteria and the targeted ethnic diversity goals outlined in the proposal. b. Measurement and reporting of participant adherence to treatment protocol: Data on adherence to the treatment protocol will be collected weekly by [CONTACT_826434]. Fidelity to the treatment manual will be reviewed by [CONTACT_826435].  3. Justification of sample size: In a study of a care management intervention for patients with substance use disorder in primary care, individuals receiving the intervention were more likely to remain in treatment at 24 weeks (40% vs 10%). While this study is entirely community based, no other comparable studies have been conducted with OUD patients on buprenorphine. Based on this effect size, we plan to screen 145 participants, assuming a 60% attrition due to screening failure, allowing for a sample size of 58 available for analysis, evenly divided between the control and intervention arm. This will yield a statistical power of 0.8 and 95% confidence level to detect differences in proportions of participants who remain in treatment at [ADDRESS_1146283] sizes to adequately power future studies. 4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356] 5. Designation of an independent monitor: To minimize any conflicts of interest, a physician from Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826417] a collaborator or investigator on the proposed project, nor a close colleague, will serve as an independent individual to monitor the data and safety. 
13  6. Safety Review Plan: Study progress and safety will be reviewed monthly (and more frequently if needed). Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs, will be provided to the Independent Monitor following each of the monthly reviews. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771]. 7. Study report outline for the independent monitor: Study Report tables will be generated only from aggregate (not by [CONTACT_70973]) baseline and aggregate safety data for the study population. A separate Closed Safety Report, with masked group baseline and safety data, will be generated for the Independent Monitor(s) by a designated unmasked member of the team but will not be reviewed by [CONTACT_3476]. 8. Informed consent: The subject (if applicable, parent/guardian) will be asked to review the study consent form. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-Investigator (Co-I) will meet with the subject to review the form, to confirm the subject’s understanding of the study, and to answer any questions the subject might have.Once the subject demonstrates understanding of the study and agrees to participate in the study, the consent will be signed in the presence of the PI (or Co-I) and a witness 9. This study does not involve any medications or devices and carries no risk of harm from such medications or devices.  X. References  1. Stein, M. D. Medical consequences of substance abuse.

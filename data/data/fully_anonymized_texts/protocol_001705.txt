 Background:  
Cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) during cardiac surgery is well known to activate a variety of 
neurohormonal and endocrine reactions in human body that disrupt the balance of systemic 
vasculature tone and organ perfusion, which ultimately lead to vasoplegic sh ock requiring 
administration of vasopressors. Several vasopressors targeting different receptors are available, 
and often required to maintain adequate perfusion pressure after CPB in cardiac surgery. These 
are phenylephrine (alpha -adrenoreceptor agonist),  norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE, alpha - and beta - 
adrenoreceptor agonist), vasopressin (VP, V1 receptor agonist) and angiotensin II (AT1 receptor 
agonist).  Both  NE and VP are acceptable  first choice  agents  for treatment  of post -CPB vasoplegic  
shock, and the selection between the two agents is mostly dependent on the preference of 
individual  anesthesiologists.  
 
Most of the literature on the effects of NE versus VP on pulmonary vasculature is based on in 
vitro studies, which demonstrated that in contrast to NE, VP does not cause vasoconstriction in 
animal and human pulmonary artery segments.1-4 Interestingly, VP may even cause vasodilation 
in pulmonary  vasculature  under  hypoxic  conditions  through  an endothelial  V1 receptor  mediated 
nitric oxide production, which relaxes the underlying vascular smooth muscle.5 An in vivo 
experiment using anesthetized and ventilated porcine models showed that VP maintained 
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)/systemic 
vascular resistance (SVR) ratio by 45%, while NE increased PAP and PVR/SVR rati o,[ADDRESS_331950] of VP on pulmonary  vasculature.  
 
Clinical  evidence  regarding  NE versus  VP effects  on pulmonary  vasculature  during  cardiac  surgery 
is limited and unclear. In a recent large (n=300) randomized controlled trial (RCT), Hajjer et al 
focused on NE versus VP use in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery, and found 
that VP group had lower mortality or severe complicatio ns including stroke, prolonged 
mechanical ventilation, deep wound infection, reoperation or acute renal failure, with 
unadjusted  hazard  ration  (HR)  of 0.55  (95%  CI, 0.38 to 0.80;  P = 0.0014).7 However,  the study  did 
not report pulmonary or systemic arterial pressures, and the influences of NE versus VP on 
pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular (RV) function remains unclear. A small (n=20) RCT 
found that both NE and VP increased PAP in patients having coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] 
(CABG)  surgery.[ADDRESS_331951] on the pulmonary  vasculature.  
Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  is defined  as resting  mean  PAP > 20 mmHg  and pulmonary 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (PCWP) < 15 mmHg.10 Increased PAP causes RV pressure overload, 
which might lead to RV failure through multiple mechanisms including but not limited to: a) 
decreased aorta -RV pressure gradient reduces epi[INVESTIGATOR_271867] (RCA) perfusion;11 b) RV’s limited contractile reserve, despi[INVESTIGATOR_271868], limits its capacity of adaptation to an increased afterload;12 c) beta - 
adrenoreceptor  desensitization  and downregulation.13 As RV failure  requiring  intensive  care  unit 
admission and inotropic support has an extremely high inpatient mortality rate of > 45%,[ADDRESS_331952] on PAP per same unit increase in 
mean arterial pressure (mPAP -to-MAP) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It also is unclear, 
if the two agents exert different effect in patients who hav e normal PAP, versus those who have 
pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
 
The specific  aims  of our study  are to compare  1) the relative  increase  in the mPAP  with  the same 
unit increase in MAP and 2) RV function assessed by [CONTACT_271892] (GLS) , between VP 
and NE in patients with normal and increased pulmonary artery pressure, who require 
vasopressor support during cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that the use of vasopressin 
compared with norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271869]  a lower  mPAP -to-MAP  ratio,  in cardiac  surgical  patients  
with  and without pulmonary hypertension. Second, we will test the hypothesis that vasopressin 
is associated with improved right ventricular global longitudinal strain compared to 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271870].  
 
 
Study Design:  
This unblinded  alternating  trial will compare the effect of NE versus VP on mPAP -to-MAP ratio in 
patients having cardiac surgery. The treatment will be randomized in one week blocks  and not by 
[CONTACT_4676],  using the RedCap system. This means  that during  any week,  eligible  patients  will be 
exposed  to the same  vasopressor agent,.  And the following week there will be new randomization 
in place.  Allocations will be directly communicated to anesthesia personnel and by [CONTACT_271893] . 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Adults> 18 years of  age 
2. Elective cardiac surgery with the use of  CPB 
3. Patients with pulmonary artery catheter  insertion  
4. Systemic hypotension (MAP < 70 mmHg) requiring continuous infusion of  vasopressor  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Transplant  surgery  
2. Ventricular assist device implantation other than intraaortic balloon  counterpulsation  
3. Pulmonary endarterectomy  
4. Thoracoabdominal aneurysm  repair  
5.  Use of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) before or after CPB

 6. Inhalational pulmonary vasodilators (e.g. Epoprostenol) administration before insertion of 
pulmonary artery  catheter  
7. Vasopressin is started as the first choice of pressor per clinical staff  discretion  
 
Informed Consent Waver:  
We request  waiver  of informed  consent  for two reasons.  The first is, there are similar indications 
for treatment and clinical efficacy of the two agents, which minimize s the risks associated with 
the study protocol : 1) both norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271871],  and both  are used  
routinely at the Cleveland  Clinic;  2) the study is unblinded. The clinicians are aware of the 
vasopressor they administer, and completely at liberty to ignore the protocol -proposed 
vasopressor in any patient likely to benefit from an alternative approach. The second reason we 
request waived consent is that the proposed trial would be impractic al with  conventional  
consent15: 1) we cannot  predict  which  patients  will have  a pulmonary artery  catheter  inserted  for 
the surgery,  a decision  that is made  when  the attending  surgeon  and anesthesiologist “huddle” 
(standard procedure to review and discuss perioperative details and plan for the surgical case) 
just before anesthetic induction; and, 2) we cannot predict which patients will develop severe 
hypotension after CPB and require vasopressor  support.  As an alternative to the conventional 
consen t, we provide a patient information letter , which describes the study protocol and 
provides information regarding the two vasopressors. It will be included in the preoperative 
cardiac surgery package  for patient s seen at the “To Come In” Clinic (the preope rative clinic for 
cardiac surgery)  or during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271872] . 
We provide an option to opt out from participation in the study  Investigators contact [CONTACT_271894], and when a patient opted out from participation, 
the investigators will contact [CONTACT_271895]. A separate file will contain the records of all 
patients who refused participation in the study, and they will not be included in the analysis.

Standard Anesthesia Procedures  
 
At our institution, cardiac surgical patients are monitored with standard ASA monitors, pre - 
induction  brachial  arterial  line,  and central  venous  cannula,  most  commonly  placed  in the internal 
jugular  vein  post -induction.  Pulmonary  artery  catheters  are routinely  placed  in patients  with  any 
of the following: preexisting pulmonary hypertension, reduced left or right ventricular systolic 
function, multi -redo surgeries, complex aortic procedures, and other complex cardiac surgeries. 
Routinely used induction medications include midazolam, fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol, 
etomid ate, and rocuronium, although specific drugs used depends on the individual patient’s 
medical  condition  and the preference  of the staff  anesthesiologist.  Maintenance  of anesthesia  is 
with inhaled isoflurane. We maintain ventilation using tidal volumes 6 -8cc/kg and PEEP 5 -10 
cmH 2O with ventilation adjusted to maintain normal pH. At the end of surgery, patients are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_271875].  
 
 
 
Study Drug Preparation and Administration:  
The study medications norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271876]-week intervals.  Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271877] -mixed bags (4mg/250ml) in the OR main pi[INVESTIGATOR_271878], where it is readily available for use. Vasopressin is stored in each OR pi[INVESTIGATOR_271879], in 
20 U/1ml  vials, which are mixed in 100cc bags of dextrose 5% solution. Both medications are 
infused through a medication pump (SmartPump)  and infused through the medication port of the 
pulmonary artery catheter . The clinic ian enters the desired dose for norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (mcg/min), 
and for vasopressin (U/min). All clinical staff participating in patient’s care will be unblinded to the 
treatment.  
 
[ADDRESS_331958]  when  there is 
need for vasopressor support while MAP < 70 mmHg, only after volume status has been optimized 
in the presence of cardiac index > 2.0 L/min/m2 (hemodynamic management protocol - figure 1).  
If the vasopressor needs to be started in the process of separation from CPB, there are no definitive hemodynamic 
criteria to guide its initiation. Thus, it would be entirely per anesthesiologist discretion .   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The s tudy medication administration will be titrated  from  lowest to highest dose  in a step wise 
fashion every 3 -4 min . NE doses range from 2 to 18 μg/min, and VP doses  from  0.01  to 0.06  U/min  
(Table  1)16,17,18. The goal  is to return  systemic  MAP  to [ADDRESS_331959], and then the primary study 
medication  dose is decreased if necessary. Prior to reaching  the maximum  dose, and during  the 
drug titration , if acute  elevation of MAP is needed, boluses of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271880].  This practical approach to vasopressor administration and titration described in 
our protocol is consistent with the current clinical management of hypotension during cardiac 
surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.  
Study medication will be considered discontinued when it is no longer required because MAP is 
at goal. If at the end of the case, the patient still requires vasopressor support, the known study 
medication will be continued at the current dose, which provides stable vital signs.

Data Collection:  
Patient data will be collected prospectively and stored in RedCap database. Hemodynamic and 
echocardiographic parameters will be recorded after  pulmonary artery catheter insertion; 
post intervention  period  is the interval between chest closure and last stitch. If this timepoint is 
unavailable in the anesthesia record, we will take the first [ADDRESS_331960] 20 minutes before patient 
transport from the OR to the ICU . The parameters that will be recorded are as following:  
1. time  weighted  average  systolic,  mean,  diastolic  pulmonary  arterial  pressures  from ARKS  
2. time weighted average systolic, mean, diastolic systemic arterial pressures from ARKS  
3. time weighted average central venous pressure  
4. Cardiac output/cardiac index by [CONTACT_70964] – the recorded measurement is the 
average value from 3 consecutive measurements, provided the difference between the 
measurements in no more than 10%. – by [CONTACT_271896]  
5. Right ventricular global longitudinal strain – from intraoperative transesophageal 
echocardiography midesophageal [ADDRESS_331961] providing patient care with Phillips or GE echo 
machines. The right ventricular strain will be measured off line using  Syngo Velocity 
Vector Imaging (VVI) by  [CONTACT_271897].   
 
The infusion rate of the study medication s, as well as other medications, such  as inotropic  agents,  
insulin,  inhaled  epoprostenol,  antifibrinolytic  agents,  etc, on continuous infusion will be recorded 
in ARKS.

[ADDRESS_331962] summary statistics and balance on the 
baseline  variables  across  patients  given  norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271883] (differences in means or proportions divided by [CONTACT_271899]). Since vasopressor assignment  is carried by [CONTACT_271900] s, 
baseline variables will be controlled for using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). 
The propensity score for each patient will be calculated using covariate balancing propensity 
score algorithm and  the weight for each patient will be calculated as the inve rse of propensity 
score if in the norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271884] (1 – propensity score) if in the vasopressin 
group. Balance  on the baseline  variables  will be assessed  again  after  weighting  and variables  with  
ASD > 0.[ADDRESS_331963] is 
associated with baseline mPAP -to-MAP.  For the secondary analysis, right ventricular global longitudinal 
strain will be compared through a linear regression model with patients weighed accordi ng to IPTW.  
 
For the exploratory analysis, cardiac Index and creatinine level will be compared using linear mixed models, 
incorporating a random intercept for each week. Duration of inotropic/ vasopressor  support and duration 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271885] -transformed to meet the normality assumption and then compared using linear 
mixed models, properly adjusting for intra -class correlation as described above. Other binary variables will 
be compared using a generalized linear mixed model with logit link, properly adjusti ng for intra -class 
correlation as described above. For all the comparison on the exploratory variables, patients will be 
weighted according to IPTW to adjust for baseline variables. As these results are exploratory, the Bonferroni 
correction will NOT be us ed to adjust significance levels.  
 
Interim Analysis  
 
10 
 Because of the small sample size required , we will perform only  one interim at 50% of the planned 
maximum enrollment to assess for efficacy and futility using a group sequential design with gamma 
spending functions using gamma of -[ADDRESS_331964] in patients with pre -existing significant pulmonary hypertension (defined as 
mean PAP >40 mmHg after  pulmonary artery catheter placement vs.  patient  without  (mean  PAP 
<40 mmHg).  The subgroup  analysis  will be performed  by [CONTACT_271901] -group interaction 
term into the regression models. Interaction terms will be tested at a significance level of 0.10, 
and regardless of the significance of the interaction terms, treatment effect will be reported 
separately by [CONTACT_271902].  
 
2. As Inhaled or intravenous pulmonary arterial vasodilators including milrinone or epoprostenolol 
will affect post -CPB pulmonary artery pressures, we will perform a sensitivity analysis that 
excludes patients who receive milrinone or epoprostenolol post CPB.  
 
 
 
Sample size calculation:  
Based on the data query for a sample of 732 patients from 2018, mPAP -to- MAP ratio has a mean ± SD of 
0.38 ± 0.09, during the period between start and end of chest closure . We will conservatively  assume a 
standard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_331965] 2-3 cases per week, a within -cluster within -period 
correlation ρ of 0.10 and a within -cluster between -period correlation 0.01. With these assumptions and an 
average of 2.5 patients per week, total sample size needed will be 84 without adjusting for interim analysis, 
and 90 after ad justing for one interim analysis. Assuming 3 patients per week, the sample size needed will 
change to 88 before interim adjustment and 96 after adjusting for one interim19 
Within -period and intra -period correlation will be also be  assessed at interim analysis, and the total sample 
size will be adjusted if a larger within -period correlation or between -correlation were observed.  
 
Future implications:  
During this study, we will collect clinical outcomes, which will be presented in a descriptive 
analysis.  They  are listed  under  “exploratory  endpoints”  in the methods  section.  We plan  to apply 
to the American Heart Association for a grant to support a future project which will examine 
clinical outcomes of cardiac surgery patients, who were treated with norepi[INVESTIGATOR_271886].

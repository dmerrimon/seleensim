Study design Randomized, open -label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study.   
The study is composed of the following periods:
Pre-treatm ent period, including
oFGFR testing 
The FGFR1&3 RNA in situ hybridization (RNA -ISH) test is used 
for the detection of FGFR1 and FGFR3 mRNA levels in formalin -
fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from urothelial 
carcinoma patients.
Mandatory FGFR testing will be performed prior to start of 
screening (signing of informed consent fo r study treatment 
eligibility). The timing of the FGFR test is at the discretion of the 
investigator.During the FGFR testing period, and after a positive FGFR test 
result was obtained, these samples are also tested for presence or 
absence of potential FGFR inhibitor resistance mutations in 
phosphoinositide 3 -kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform 
(PIK3CA) and/or in the human orthologues of rat sarcoma (RAS) 
encoding genes. The outcome of the mutation testing will not affect the study eligibility, it will b e used for patient stratification.
oScreening
Only patients with FGFR positive tumors are eligible to continue 
to the screening which will be scheduled w ithin 28 days before 
randomization.

Patients who meet all the eligibility criteria at screening will be 
randomized 1:1 using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IxRS) to receive either an oral regimen of continuous rogaratinib b.i.d. or chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine ) adm inistered 
through intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 3 w eeks as a comparator drug 
(investigators choice). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_23587]3CA 
and/or RAS activating mutations (presence vs. absence), prior 
immunotherapy (yes vs. no), and modified 4-factor Bellmunt risk score 
(high vs. low ). 
Follow -up period, including
oActive follow -up
Safety information is collected for all discontinued patients for at 
least 30 (up to +7) days after the last administration of study 
treatment, and both safety and e fficacy information is collected for 
patients who discontinue study treatment without disease progression. Follow -up tumor evaluations will be performed (by 
[CONTACT_462]) until progression of malignancy and/or start of 
subsequent systemic anti -cancer treatmen t, whichever comes first, 
or any other criterion for withdraw al is met.
oLong- term  follow -up 
Patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (telephone contact [CONTACT_23588]) every 
month (±7 days) to determine survival status and obtain 
information on subsequent systemic anti -cancer treatment until 
either data maturation for the final planned OS analysis is reached, death of the patient or any other criterion for w ithdraw al is met.
Phase 2/3 design
This study follows a Phase 2/3 design with interim analysis, meaning the patient s recruited to the Phase 2 part of the study will automatically 
continue to the Phase 3 part without interruption if futility is not 
demonstrated at the 1
stinterim ORR analysis. 
The Phase 2 part w ill end at the time of the cut -off for the 1stinterim ORR
analysis. To help structure the protocol flow , we present this Phase 2/[ADDRESS_22637] been 
assessed by [CONTACT_456]. In the meantime, the study will continue its routine 
recruitment until trial termination or recruitment cessation decisions are announced.
If the decision is made to continue the study at the end of Phase 2 period, 
the study moves on to Phase 3 part of the study. Random ization and 
treatment continue the same as the Phase 2 part of the study until 390

remain as Phase 2. The study will remain open until the survival data is 
considered adequate for analysis by [CONTACT_456].
Methodology Efficacy
For OS (original primary variable planned for the P hase 3 part) , all patients 
who end study treatment for any reason (except death) will be contact[CONTACT_23589], or any other criterion for withdrawal is met. 
Thesecondary efficacy endpoints (PFS, ORR, DCR, and DOR) will be 
assessed based on centra l radiological tumor evaluation .Tum or 
assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced (unless 
contraindicated) computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of chest/abdomen/pelvis at screening, every 6 weeks (± 7 
days)starting from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to w eek 18, and thereafter, every 9 
weeks (± 7 days). A minimum of at least [ADDRESS_22639] “on treatment” tumor assessment. In addition, brain and bone scans are required at screening. The brain and b one scans need to 
be repeated only if metastases or symptoms are present. Tumor scans are evaluated using RECIST v.1.1. All images need to be submitted continuously for independent central imaging review.
The efficacy endpoint for the Phase 2 part of the s tudy is ORR.
OSdata w ill be collected as anexploratory efficacy endpoint for the 
Phase 2. All patients who end study treatment for any reason (except death) 
will be contact[CONTACT_23590], or any other criterion for 
withdrawal is met.
Safety
Safety and tolerability evaluations will be included in results of physical 
examinations, vital signs, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, 
adverse events, concomitant medications and laboratory tests. In addition, ophthalmological examinations will be performed. Each patient will be 
regularly monitored for potential adverse events and disease related signs 
and symptoms. AEs will be graded according to The Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. Laboratory toxicitieswill be graded according to CTCAE v.4.03 based on numerical laboratory values only.
Patient reported outcom e (PRO)
Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using EORTC QLQ -C30 and 
EQ-5D-3L (at screening, on Day 1 of every cycle, at the EOT, and at the 
safety assessment visit of the active follow -up). 
Pharm acokinetics
Plasma samples for measurement of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) 
concentrations will be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 at pre -
dose (before supervised dose administration) and 1 (±0.5) hour post -dose.

12NOV 2019 Version 3.0 Page: 11of [ADDRESS_22640] growth factor receptor (FGFR) mRNA using FGFR1&3 RNA in situ hybridization (RNA -ISH) test. The tumor 
biopsy sample will also be used to test for presence or absence of potential 
FGFR inhibitor resistance mutations in PIK3CA and/or RAS -encoding 
genes in FGFR -positive patien ts. The detection of activating mutations in 
PIK3CA and/or RAS -encoding genes will be conducted using 
commercially available assays. 
Type of control Active control: chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine). The choice of the chemotherapy is at the discretion of the investigator taking into consideration the status of the authorization or treatment guidelines in 
the given country. 
Data Monitoring Committee Yes 
Number of patients Although both PIK3CA and/or RAS mutant and w ild ty pe (WT) patients 
are recruited, this study is powered for the PIK3CA and RAS WT 
subgroup. Therefore, the recruitment will stop when approximately 450 
PIK3CA and RAS WT patients who meet all selection criteria are randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio, using IxRS, to one of the following treatment arms:
Rogaratinib, or
Chemotherapy
Based on a current assumption that roughly 75% of all study population are 
PIK3CA and RAS WT patients, at the time when 450 WT patients are 
randomized, approximately a total of 6 00patients ( 450WT + 150mutant 
patients) will be randomized in the all study population.
Prim ary variable The primary efficacy vari able of Phase 2 is ORR , and will be analyzed 
based on central review assessment. 
Overall survival (defined as the time from randomization until death from 
any cause) will be considered an exploratory efficacy variable for the Phase 
2, since t he Phase 3 part of the study will no longer be conducted .
Time point/fram e of 
measurement for prim ary 
variable(s)Due to the stop of enrollment and full data analysis , the study will not move 
forw ard to its Phase 3 and will remain as Phase 2. The study will remain 
open until the survival data is considered adequate for analysis by [CONTACT_103].Originally planned analyses are given below as reference to the original 
design. 
Final OS analysis: at approx. 390 de aths in WT population (approx. 
43months after the start of randomization).
In addition, tw o interim analyses are planned :
1
stinterim ORR analysis (Phase 2 part): at approx. the first 116 
confirmed FGFR positive patients with wild -type PIK3CA and RAS 
biomarkers complete 4.5 months of treatment

2ndinterim OS analysis (Phase 3 part): at approx. 195deaths in 
PIK3CA and RAS WT patients (50% o f 390total death events in WT 
population, approx. 22months after start of randomization)
Plan for statistical analysis The formal statistical analyses w ill be both descriptive and inferential. 
Summaries will be provided for each of the treatment arms, rogaratinib and 
chemotherapy in both PIK3CA and RAS WT and all study population. In addition, descriptive summaries of popu lation characteristics will be 
provided for the total study population. 
Efficacy analyses
In Phase 3, t he primary efficacy variable is overall survival (OS). OS data 
will be considered mature and the final OS analysis (i.e. primary 
completion) will be per formed when approximately a total of [ADDRESS_22641] died, in accordance w ith the power calculations 
specified for the full analysis set (FAS). For the primary efficacy variable of overall survival, a stratified log -rank test controllin g type I error at a 
level of 0.025 (one- sided) w ill be conducted for the WT population first 
(step 1). A full alpha of 0.025 (one -sided) will be passed on to OS in all 
study population and some selected secondary endpoints (step 2), if and 
only if the null hypothesis of OS for WT population is rejected. Details on 
controlling family -wise type I error w ithin step 2 for OS in all study 
population and selected secondary endpoints will be specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
In addition, the hazard ratio (rogaratinib / chemotherapy) for OS and its 
95% confidence interval will be calculated using the Cox model, stratified 
by [CONTACT_23591], for both PIK3CA and RAS WT 
and all study population (referred as “both populations” be low). Kaplan -
Meier (KM) estimates for OS and KM survival curves will also be 
presented for each treatment arm and both populations. The KM estimates at time points such as 3 months, 6 months etc. together with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals as well as the differences of these estimates will 
also be calculated betw een the rogaratinib arm and the chemotherapy arm 
for both populations.
The primary efficacy variable of Phase [ADDRESS_22642] to PFS in WT 
and all study population will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) document. Since the responders are not a randomized group, n o 
statistical testing will be performed for DOR. Analysis of DOR will be descriptive in nature. 
Safety analyses
Summary of adverse events (AEs) is considered a secondary objective for 
the study. Descriptive tables will be presented by [CONTACT_23592]. AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_23593] (MedDRA) terms (v.20.0 or later) and w orst grade

cases and approxi mately  165,000 death cases in 2012 (1); it is the sixth most common cancer 
in the [LOCATION_002] with an estimated 77, 000new cases in 2016 (2). Approximately  three 
times more men than women are diagnosed with bladder cancer; the majority  of patients are 
> 65 years old.
Bladder cancer can be divided into non- muscle -invasive and muscle -invasive tumors. 
Approximately  90% of all muscle -invasive bladder cancers are urothelial (transitional) tumors 
which can occur in the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.
Patients with locally  advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma are not treatable with a 
curative intent. Standard -of-care s ystemic treatment for those who are fit enough to tolerate 
cisplatin includes cisplatin- containing combination chemotherap y, e.g. GC 
(gemcitabine/cisplatin) or M- VAC (methotre xate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin) (3). 
Overall efficacy  is similar between GC and M- VAC, but GC shows a better safet y profile. 
Dose -dense M- VAC has a better toxicity  profile and is more efficacious in terms of response 
rate and 2 -year overall survival rate than conventional M -VAC .However, median overall 
survival is similar between the t wo regimens (4).
After relapse, no standard -of-care treatment exists. Most of the data are derived from 
uncontrolled trials and are variable d epending on patient selection. Potential treatment options 
after failure of platinum- containing chemotherap y include single -agent chemotherap y 
(docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) (5-7). Gemcitabine has also shown good response rates, 
but most patients alread y receive this drug as part of their first -line therapy (8). For selected 
patients, combination chemotherap y can be consider ed.Recentl y, several PD -[ADDRESS_22650] been approved by  [CONTACT_23595].

3.2 Rogaratinib
3.2.1 Mode of action
Rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) is an oral pan-FGFR inhibitor. It shows potent FGFR1, -2, -3 
and -4 inhibition in biochemical assay s that translates into strong inhibition of cellular 
downstream pERK resulting in inhibition of FGF2 -stimulated tumor cell proliferation . 
Inhibition of cell proliferation by  [CONTACT_23596] y correlates with expression of mRNA of 
FGFR isoforms as well as ac tivation by  [CONTACT_23597]. The high in -vitro potency  and

phosphory lation and inhibition of FGFR downstream signaling as shown by  [CONTACT_23598]. 
Moreover, rogaratinib exhibits strong in vivo anti-tumor efficacy  in monotherap y in FGFR 
mRNA overexpressing xenograf t models with good tolerability . Efficacy  in inhibition of 
tumor growth as well as the respective mode of action of inhibition of FGFR signal ling such 
as phosphory lation of ERK1/[ADDRESS_22652] frequently  overexpressed in urothelial carcinoma
(overexpressed in up to 50% of all cases) ( 9, 10 ). In addition, FGFR3- activating mutations 
have been frequentl y observed in earl y stages of urothelial carcinoma and in advanced 
metastatic muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma with a lower prevalence (about 10 %) (11). 
Data from a variet y of clinical trials with FGFR inhibitors confirmed a high objective 
response rate (ORR > 30%) in urothelial carcinoma patients having a tumor with genetic 
(DNA) alterations in FGFR3- encoding gene ( 12, 13). However, clinical benefits from FGFR 
inhibitor treatment have also been reported in a urothelial carcinoma patient with high FGFR1 
mRNA expression levels ( 14)and in a patient with high FGFR2 protein expression ( 15), 
although FGFR1 and FGFR2- positive UCtumor s are more rare compared to FGFR3 -positive 
tumors. In the Phase 1 S tudy [ZIP_CODE] (see Section 3.2.2 ), out of the > 120 tumor biopsies 
evaluated, 43 % were found to be positive for at least one FGFR isoform (FGFR1, or FGFR2 
or FGFR3). Out of the FGFR -positive UC samples , prevalence of FGFR3 and FGFR1 
mRNA -positivity  was 92 .4% and 5 .7 %, respectively ,whereas isolated FGFR2 -positivity  
could not be observed. It should be noted that this does not preclude future development of a 
test which is also able to identify  the FGFR2 isoform, e.g. for di fferent indication or to 
generate further data in urothelial carcinoma patients. However, asFGFR2 expression is 
considerabl y low in urothelial carcinoma patients, patient selection for Study  [ADDRESS_22653] available version 
of the investigator's brochure (IB) for rogaratinib, which contains comprehensive information on the study  drug. The IB in its most current version is available in the study  file.
Key risks of rogaratinib
Based on the cumulative evidence from the Phase 1 studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] , the following 
clinical concepts are considered keyrisks of rogaratinib:
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 1163877 / [ZIP_CODE]
12NOV 2019 Version 3.0 Page: 26of 153                                    
Retinal disorders
Retinal detachment was observed in association with the treatment with some ty rosine kinase 
inhibitors including AZD4547–a compound with pan -FGFR inhibitory  activity . Therefore, 
ophthalmological examination was implemented at the baseline and during the course of the 
Phase 1 trial (Study  [ZIP_CODE]) to assess the potential effects of the compound on the retinal 
structure and function.
Details of retinal disorders that have occurred so far can be found in the latest available 
version of the IB for rogaratinib. Patients should be closel y monitored for the risk of retinal 
disorders during the clinical trials.
Hyperpho sphatemia and soft -tissue mineralization
Hyperph osphatemia is a pharmacod ynamic effect of rogaratinib, driven by  [CONTACT_23599]1 in the kidney  and therefore is expected to occur in any  patient treated with rogaratinib. 
Hyperphosphatemia is pathophy siologically  linked to soft -tissue mineralization. Although no 
signs suggestive forsoft-tissue mineralization were observed in patients treated with 
rogaratinib, soft -tissue mineralization is regarded to represent a potential risk of rogaratinib.
Therefore, serum phosphate levels of patients treated with rogaratinib must be monitore d to 
avoid a long -lasting h yperphosphatemia bey ond the critical level defined as phosphate level 
≥7 mg/dL (study -specific measure s are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Elevation of serum 
phosphate level starts within few days after initiation of treatment with rogaratinib and may  
reach a critical level within 1 or 2 weeks. 
Nail toxicity  
Nail toxicity  manifesting as nail dy strophy ,onychomadesis, parony chia, and ony cholysis 
were observed in patients treated with rogaratinib. Based on the currentl y available 
information the clinical course of nail toxicity  can be summarized as follows:
The initial nail changes manifest as painless yellowish/brownish discoloration of the distal 
part of the nail, within 2 -3 months after the start of the therap y with rogaratinib (800 mg 
b.i.d.). The nail changes progress and affect the structure and surface of the whole nail 
resulting in a s ymmetric (all fingers similarl y affected) on ychod ystroph y. Painless 
onycholysis may  follow on some fingers or toes. Nail bed, matrix and the tissue of finger/last 
phalanx do not seem to be affected. Nail bed inflammation or nail bed infection is regarded to be secondary to ony chody strophy  and on ycholysis. No SAEs related to nail disorders have 
been observed.
Please also refer to the latest available version of the investigator’s brochure (IB) for 
rogaratinib.

Very  common side effects for paclitaxel are neutropenia, anemia , leukopenia, peripheral 
neuropath y, nausea, diarrh ea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, arthralgia, m yalgiaand 
hypersensitivity  reaction ( 17). Additional information can be found in the SmPC.
VinflunineFor vinflunine, the most common treatment- related adverse reactions reported in patients with 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium were hematological disorders, mainly  
neutropenia and anemia; gastrointestinal disorders, especially constipation, anorexia, nausea, 
stomatitis/mucositis, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and general diso rders such as 
asthenia/fatigue ( 18).Additional information can be found in the SmPC.
3.4 Rationale of the study
The preliminary  ORR of 24% as well as the toxicity  profile observed for rogaratinib in Study  
[ZIP_CODE] in the urothelial carcinoma are considered favorable compared with other treatment 
options. 
Single -agent taxanes and pemetrexed achieved response rates between 6% and 13% (reviewed 
in (19)). A Phase [ADDRESS_22656] supportive care ( BSC )reported an ORR 
of 9% i n the vinflunine treatment arm with a median PFS of 3 months for vinflunine (5).
More recentl y, the PD- L1-blocking antibody  atezolizumab has shown an ORR of 15% in the 
total patient population regardless of PD -L1 expression with a median PFS of 
2.7months (20). Pembrolizumab, a PD -1 inhibitor, reached an ORR of 21% and a PFS of 
2.1months (21). 
Additional PD-[ADDRESS_22657] recently  been approved by  [CONTACT_23600] (mUC). 
The encouraging results of Study  [ZIP_CODE] support the continuation of the development of 
rogaratinib in urothelial carcinoma .
To this end, Study  [ZIP_CODE] forms part of the sponsor’s clinical development program for 
rogaratinib. It is intended to generate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_23541] ’s registration 
for the urothelial carcinoma indication in FGFR positive patients.
3.5 Benefit-risk assessment
The pre -clinical information on rogaratinib provides a sound rationale for its clinical activity  
in several tumor ty pes including urothelial carcinoma. This is confirmed by  [CONTACT_23601]. BAY 1163877 / [ZIP_CODE]
12NOV 2019 Version 3.0 Page: 28of 153                                    
efficacy  data from the Phase 1 Study  [ZIP_CODE] indicat ingpromising single agent anti -cancer 
activity  of rogaratinib (ORR 24.0%) in patients with urothelial bladder cancer progressing 
after standard anti -cancer therap y, which is in line with the published data for other selective 
pan-FGFR inhibitors. The ORR is higher ( 30.6%) in patients with UC tumors without gain -
of-function mutations in phosphatidy linositol-3- kinase cataly tic subunit alpha gene (PIK3CA) 
or without gain -of-function mutations in genes coding for rat sarcoma (RAS) protein family . 
This data indic ates that gain-of- function mutations in PI K3CA and RAS protein family  may  
be responsible for resistance of UC tumors to treatment with pan -FGFR receptor inhibitors.
Available data in this subgroup of patients is limited and it cannot be concluded that ther e is 
no treatment benefit with rogaratinib. The relevance of these mutations to the activity  of 
standard chemotherapy is also unknown. Beyond UC, a promising anti -tumor efficacy  was 
observed in patients with FGFR -positive head and neck cancer, sqNSCL C and adenoid cy stic 
carcinoma.
The overall safet y and tolerability profile of rogaratinib is manageable with risk monitoring 
and minimization activities reflected in the clinical trial protocols and the recommendations 
given in the current investigator’s broch ure. In addition, the results of the full review and 
analysis of FORT -1 data (cut -off date of 14 June 19) were also consistent with the know n
safet y profile of rogaratinib.
Most frequent toxicities of rogaratinib such as blood phosphorus increased, diarrhe a, nail 
toxicity and alopecia as well as frequent treatment emergent ad verse events such as dry mouth, 
decreased appetite, fatigue, dy sgeusia, dry  skin, nausea, mucositis and arthralgia can be 
managed with supportive care in oncology . 
The key  risks associated with the use of rogaratinib are retinal disorders and soft tissue 
mineralization. 
Retinal disorders consistent with retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_23542] / central serous 
retinopathy  (RPED/CSR) were observed in patients treated with rogaratinib. Mainly  
asymptomatic course and mild intensity  (Grade 1, 2) of the rogaratinib associated RPED/CSR 
is in line with known benign nature of RPED/CSR. The risk of irreversible retinal damage is 
low and can be reduced by [CONTACT_23602] s ymptomatic persistent 
or progressive retinal detachment. Regular ophthalmologic visits will be performed in patients 
participating in this trial.Soft tissue mineralization was obser ved in toxicological studies with rogaratinib and other 
pan-FGFR inhibitors manifesting as ectopic calcification lesions in kidney , stomach, heart 
and blood vessels. During the course of the clinical testing of rogaratinib no events consistent 
with “soft t issue mineralization” were observed. The risk can be predicted and prevented b y 
monitoring and control of phosphate levels in serum.
Risk monitoring and minimization activities reflected in the planned examinations are part of 
general medical practice and do not expose study  participants to an undue risk or burden. 
The randomized, controlled study  design which includes single- agent chemotherapy , a 
standard of care treatment option used after failure of platinum -containing chemotherap y, 
ensures that patient s in the control arm receive an active treatment.

Overall, the non- clinical and clinical data collected cumulatively for rogaratinib are 
considered to support a favorable benefit- risk profile of rogaratinib for use in this study  for 
the planned patient po pulation.
4. Study objectives
Theoriginal objectives of the study  are provided below:
Primar y objective:
To demonstrate the superiority  of rogaratinib over chemotherap y in terms of 
prolonging overall survival of urothelial carcinoma patients with FGFR positive 
tumors. 
Secondary objective s:
To evaluate additional efficacy  including the following variables
oprogression- free survival (PFS)
oobjective response rate (ORR)
odisease control rate (DCR)
oduration of response (DOR)
To evaluate the safety of rogaratinib (a dverse events) 
Tertiary objective s:
Patient- reported outcome (PRO) 
Evaluate biomarkers to investigate the drug (i.e. mode-of- action -related effect and/or 
safet y) and/or the pathomechanism of the disease 
Pharmacokinetics
The objective for the Phase 2 part of the stud y is to demonstrate the efficacy  of rogaratinib 
over chemotherap y in terms of objective response rate of urothelial carcinoma patients with 
FGFR positive tumors (see Section 10.5). The Phase 3 part of the study  will no longer be 
conducted, therefore OSwill be considered an exploratory  efficacy  variable for Phase 2.
The procedures and variables used to address the objectives are spec ified in Section 9.
5. Study design
5.1 Design overview
This is a randomized, open -label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy  and 
safet y of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) compared to chemotherap y in patients with FGFR -
positive locally  advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have received prior 
platinum -containing chemotherap y. 
The primary  objective o f this entire study  [ZIP_CODE] is to compare rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) 
with chemotherap y (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) in terms of prolonging the overall

survival (OS) of patients with FGFR positive urothelial carcinoma. T he objective for the 
Phase 2 pa rt of the stud y is to demonstrate the efficacy  of rogaratinib over chemotherap y in 
terms of objective response rate (ORR) of urothelial carcinoma patients with FGFR positive 
tumors. For all study objectives, see Section 4.
At randomization, patients will have locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and 
have received at least one prior platinum- containing chemotherap y regimen. Only  patients 
with FGFR 1 or3 positive tumors can be randomized into the study. Archival tumor tissue is 
adequate for testing of FGFR1 and 3 mRNA expression, which will be determined centrally
using an RNA in situ hybridization (RNA -ISH) test (see Section 9.7.1).
The study  will comprise th e following periods: 
1)Pre-treatment period ,including FGFR testing and screening ,
2)Treatment period , and
3)Follow -up period ,including active follow -upand long-term follow -up. 
Patients will be considered “on stud y” during the pre-treatment , treatment and active follow -
up periods. During the long -term follow -up period the patients will be considered “off stud y”
(i.e. no study -related procedures with the patient) . An overvi ew of the study  design is 
presented in Figure 5–1.

Phase 2/3 design
This study  was originallydesign edto follow a Phase 2/3 design with interim analy sis, 
meaning the patients recruited to the Phase 2 part of the study  will automatically  continue to 
the Phase 3 part without interruption if futility  is not demonstrated at the 1stinterim ORR 
analysis (see below and Section 10.5). An overview of the Ph2/3 study  design is presented in 
Figure 5–2below. The Phase 2 and 3 parts of the study  follow the same screening, treatment 
and follow-up assessment schedule ( Figure 5–1). The Phase 2 part will end at the time of the 
cut-off for the 1stinterim ORR analy sis.To help structure the protocol flow, we present this 
Phase 2/[ADDRESS_22660] interim 
indicates the end of the Phase 2 part, and the second and final anal yses are considered the

criteria for FGFR testing (see Section 6.1). Mandatory  FGFR testing will be performed prior 
to start of screening (signing of informed consent for study treatment eligibility ).The timing 
of the FGFR test is at the discretion of the investigator.
See more about FGFR testing in Section 9.7.1 .
Only  patients with FGFR -positive tumors (high expression of at least FGFR1 or 3) will be 
eligible to continue to the screening.
During the FGFR testing period, and after a positive FGFR test result was obtained, these 
samples are also tested for presence or absence of potential FGFR inhibitor resistance 
mutations, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase catal ytic subunit alpha isoform (PIK3CA )and/or in the 
human orthologues of rat sarcoma (RAS ). PIK3CA and RAS testing is done in tumor DNA 
derived from archival biopsy  specimen. The outcome of the mutation testing will not affect 
the study  eligibility , it will be used for patient stratification. For more background information 
on the potential FGFR inhibitor resistance mutations, please refer to Section 5.4.
Screening
The screening period will start after the patient has signed the PI/ICF for study treatment 
eligibility (see Section 13.4.2) . The screening for treatment eligibility  will be scheduled 
within 28 days before randomization . Please refer to Table 9–1for the detailed schedule for 
screening assessments.
5.2.2 Treatment period
All patients who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms
using an Interactive Voice/Web Response Sy stem (I xRS) :
Rogaratinib administered as oral (p.o.) 600mg (3x 200 mg) tablets twice daily  (b.i.d.)
continuously , or
Chemotherap y as taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) or vinflunine administered through 
intravenous (i.v.) infusion every  3 weeks (on Day  1 of the cy cle).
Randomization will be stratified b y:
PIK3CA and/or RAS activating mutations (presence vs. absence)
oIn cases when PIK3CA and/or RAS genetic testing results are not available 
before randomization , those patients with unknown mutation status prior to 
randomi zation will be grouped into the mutation “presence” strata in the 
randomization process.

Withdrawal of consent
Withdrawal from the study (see Section 6.4.1 ).
After discontinuation from study treatment , patients should be treated according to local 
practice. Please refer to Section 8.2for post -study  therapy .
The end -of-treatment (EOT) visit will be performed for all patients within 14 days after 
permanent discontinuation of study  treatment .
5.2.3 Follow-up periods
[IP_ADDRESS] Active follow -up
Safety  information is collected for all discontinued patients for at least 30 (up to +7) day s 
after the last administration of study  treatment, and both safet y and efficacy information is 
collected for patients who discontinue study treatment without di sease progression. Follow -up 
tumor evaluations will be performed (by [CONTACT_462] ) until progression of malignancy  and/or 
start of subsequent systemic anti -cancer treatment, whichever comes first, or any  other 
criterion for withdrawal is met. During the activ e follow -upperiod, CT/MRI evaluations will 
be performed at the same intervals as during study treatment (every  6 weeks up to week 18,

Further variables are specified in Section 9.6(safety  variables) , Section 9.5(PK variables)

5.4 Justification of the design
Level of blinding: Due to the different dosing schedule, administration route and safet y 
profile with the control drugs, an open -label study design is deemed justified. I n addition, 
overall survival is the primary endpoint, an endpoint that is reliable and easy  to measure, 
documented b y date of death, thus bias is not a factor in this endpoint measurement.
Justification of rogaratinib dosage: in the Phase 1 Study  [ZIP_CODE], no dose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) were observed at doses ranging from [ADDRESS_22670] evaluated dose of 800 mg b.i.d. was initially  chosen as the 
recommended dose regimen for rogaratinib trials. Per DMC data review of [ZIP_CODE] study , the 
dose of 600 mg b.i.d., was recommended as the maximum starting dose of rogaratinib 
treatment. This dose regimen was accepted based on the following considerations:
In the first -in-human study  [ZIP_CODE] evaluating rogaratinib in the dose range from 50 mg 
b.i.d. to 800 mg b.i.d., exploratory  rogaratinib plasma exposure to s elected adverse 
events (fatigue, diarrhea and nausea) analy sis did not show clear correlation. 
Additionally , exploratory rogaratinib plasma exposure -clinical response analy sis also 
did not show clear correlation. Based on PK data in small number of patient s treated at 
600mg BID (n=4) in Study  [ZIP_CODE], a small difference of approximately  10% to 15% 
in rogaratinib plasma exposures was observed between 600mg b.i.d. and 800 mg b.i.d. 
dose levels. The range of rogaratinib plasma exposures after 600 mg b.i.d. and 800mg 
b.i.d. are expected to largely  overlap, although slightly  lower at 600 mg b.i.d.

Dose dependent changes in plasma phosphate concentration confirmed the mechanism 
of action related to inhibition of renal FGFR activity
Clinical responses were observe d in patients with urothelial bladder cancer and other 
tumor ty pes with reduced dose regimen schedules.
In conclusion, the new dose schedule of rogaratinib 600 mg b.i.d is considered to be able to 
provide adequate exposure to the drug with favorable benefit -risk profile.
Choice of comparator: After relapse of first line chemotherapy , no standard of care treatment 
exists for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Most of the data 
are derived from uncontrolled trials and are variable depending on patient selection. Potential 
treatment options after failure of platinum containing chemotherap y include single agent 
chemotherap y (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) (5-7). Gemcitabine has also shown go od 
response rates, but most patients alread y receive this drug as part of their first line therap y (8). 
For selected patients combination chemotherap y can be considered. Recently  immune 
checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD- L1or PD-1, including atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, durvalumab and avelumab, have shown activity  in relapsed urothelial ca rcinoma
patients and have been approved b y the FDA (20, 23).
Based on the current treatment paradigm and recommendations from US and European 
guidelines, single agent chemotherapy of either a taxane or vinflunine is chosen as the 
comparator for the proposed Phase 3 study. This ensures that study  participants in the control 
arm will receive an active treatment. The doses are in line with current practice in the majorit y 
of the countries worldwide. To ensure suitable patients are given the opportunity  of treatment 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors , where available, prior treatment with these agents will be 
allowed, but is not mandatory .
Patient selection: The FGFR1 &3 RNA -ISH assay  will be used to aid in the selection of cancer 
patients who may  benefit from the pan -FGFR inhibitor (rogaratinib ) thera py. In pre -clinical 
studies, only  xenograft models with high expression levels of either FGFR1 or FGFR2 or 
FGFR3 demonstrated significant (> 50%) anti -tumor efficacy  upon rogaratinib treatment. 
Preliminary  data from Phase 1 Study [ZIP_CODE] confirms that a trea tment benefit of having either 
a partial response or a long- lasting stable disease (SD) is observed in patients that have a high 
FGFR expression level . Therefore, having at least one FGFR isoform with a high FGFR 
expression level was selected as inclusion criterion for FGFR -positivity  for this Study  [ZIP_CODE]. 
In Stud y [ZIP_CODE], out of > 120 U C biopsies , no single biopsy was found to be positive for 
FGFR2 onl y; 83 % were found positive for FGFR3 only , and 5.7 % were found positive for 
FGFR1 onl y. Instead, 11.3 % o f samples were found to be positive for more than one FGFR 
isoform (FGFR1/2, FGFR1/3 and FGFR2/3). As either FGFR1 or FGFR3 was detected in all double -positive samples, the use of a FGFR2- specific probe would not lead to the 
identification of additional pa tients. 
Randomization: Randomization willbe stratified to ensure balance of the treatment groups 
with respect to the following important factors and to avoid any bias that may  be associated 
with an imbalance.

Stratification factors are:
PIK3CA and/or RAS activating mutations (presence vs.absence)
Rationale: It has been recently  published that activating mutations in PI K3CA and 
RAS genes (NRAS/KRAS/HRAS) are a resistance factor to FGFR inhibitors (24-26 ). 
Retrospective mutation analysis of urothelial carcinoma patients enrolled on 
rogaratinib in Study  [ZIP_CODE] revealed that none of the 1 2 patients presenting with a 
partial response (PR) as best response according to RECI STv1.1, had an activating 
mutation in the aforementioned genes. In contrast, 7out of 1 4patients presenting with 
progressive disease (PD) as best response b y rogaratinib -treatment, had an activating 
mutation in either PI K3CA and/or RAS -encoding genes. It is therefore planned to 
detect PIK3CA and RAS mutational status in tumor DNA after the FGFR test ing in 
archival tumor biops y specimen for stratification at randomization t o ensure balance of 
the treatment groups with respect to these mutations. See additional details in 
Section 9.7.1 .
Prior immunotherapy  (yes vs.no),
Rationale: To ensure suitable patients are given the opportunity of prior treatment with 
the recently  approv ed immune checkpoint inhibitors , stratification regarding use of 
prior immunotherap y ispart of the stud y.
Modified 4-factor Bellmunt risk score ( high vs. low) (see Section 9.3.3 )
Rationale: Prognostic factors have been identified for both first and second line 
treatment of patients with uroth elial carcinoma. For second line ,the modified 4-factor 
Bellmunt risk score defines ECOG performance status, hemoglobin level, liver 
metastases andtime from last systemic anti -cancer therap y dose as main prognostic 
factors for overall survival. Presence of liver metastases, ECOG PS ≥ 1, hemoglobin 
< 10 g/dL and time from last systemic anti -cancer therap y dose <90 day s are 
recognized as prognostic factors for predicting shorter overall survival (22).

6.4 Withdrawal of patients from study
6.4.1 Withdrawal
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening failure
Depending on the time point of withdrawal before randomizat ion, a withdrawn patient is 
referred to as either “FGFR testing failure” or “screening failure” as specified below:
FGFR testing failure (pre-screening failures)
A patient with low FGFR [ADDRESS_22687] not be screened for stud y treatment eligibility but needs to be withdrawn 
from the study and is regarded as a “FGFR testing failure”. The “FGFR testing failure” will 
be registered in I xRS. 
For data to be col lected for FGFR testing failures , refer to Section 11.1 (data recorded during 
FGFR testing period)Screening failure

criteria), terminate the study  before randomization ,areregarded as “screening failures”. The 
“screening failure” will be registered in I xRS.
For data to be collected for screening failures , refer to Section 11.1 (data recorded during 
screening).
[IP_ADDRESS] Re-sc reening
Patients who have signed the pre- screening informed consent and have not completed the 
FGFR test could have the FGFR test done. Re-testing for FGFR expression level after 
obtaining an initial negative result is not allowed.
Re-starting the defined set of screening procedures to enable the “screening failure” patient’s 
participation at a later time point is notallowed.
Re-screening might be possible considering the following examples :
The patient had successfully  passed the screening procedures, but could not start 
subsequent treatment on schedule.
Initial screening occurred too earl y to complete the required washout period after prior 
therap y.
The in -/ exclusion criteria preventing the patient’s initial attempt to participate have 
been changed (via protocol amendment).
Re-screening of patients is only  allowed once after discussion with the sponsor’s designated 
medical representative and after approval b y the sponsor. Sponsor’s approval of re -screening 
for a patient must be documented.
In an y case, t he investigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not 
expose the patient to an unjustifiable health risk. Also, for re- screening, the patient has to re -
sign the informed consent form, even if it was not changed after the patient’s pre vious 
screening.The screening failure will be registered in IxRS to close the patient identification number 
(PID), and re -screening will start again by  [CONTACT_2960] a new informed consent form and being 
assigned a new PID via IxRS. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal criteria
Withdrawal from study treatment 
Patient s must be withdrawn from the stud y treatment if any of the following occurs:
Unacceptable toxicity .
Any adverse reaction deemed sufficientl y serious to warrant discontinuation of 
treatment b y the investigator or his/ her designated associate(s). Use of illicit drugs or 
other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_23547]/her designated 
associate(s), have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity  or otherwise 
confound the results. For further details of toxicities leading to treatment discontinuation, please refer to Section 7.4.3 (dose modifications).

Any grade of recurrent sy mptomatic pancreatitis. 
Grade 4 non -hematological toxicities in patients treated with rogaratinib.
oFor non -hematological toxicities in patients treated with chemotherapy , refer to 
the respective SmPC; the decision of dose modification or withdrawal is at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Grade [ADDRESS_22688] or

assessment). 
Clinical progression and/or decline in ECOG PS that can be attributed to disease 
progression. 
oSymptomatic deterioration (i.e. uncontrollable pain secondary  to disease or 
unmanageable ascites, etc.) attributed to disease progression as determined by  
[CONTACT_23609].
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative. At any  
time during the study and without giving reasons, a patient may decline to participate further. The patient will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result. 
If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study  would be harmful to the 
patient's well -being. 
Start of a new anti -cancer regimen. 
Development of a malignancy  other than urothelial carcinoma or excised non -
melanoma skin cancer. 
Any decrease in visual acuity , ocular pain or discomfort, or s ymptomatic retinal 
disorders including retinal detachment / retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] / serous retinopathy  / retinal vein occlusion classified analog to CTCAE v.4.[ADDRESS_22689] Grade 1 and then 
treatment may  be resumed at one dose level below. Patients with low visual acuity  at 
baseline (best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 and up t o 20/200) have to 
undergo individual clinical evaluation to determine the maintenance in the study , 
according to investigator’s judgment and based on the individual benefit risk assessment .
Newl y diagnosed soft -tissue mineralization suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_23610]. 
Severe allergic reaction to study  drugs (such as exfoliative ery throderma or Grade 3 or 
4 hypersensitivity  reaction). 
Substantial non -compliance with the requirements of the study . 
Interruption/delay  in the administration of study  treatm ent for > 24 day s (due to 
toxicity ) or for > 31 day s (due to other reasons) from the next intended dose.

Patients with a positive ß -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test or any  other sign 
consistent with pregnancy. Pregnancy will be reported via the Pre gnancy  Monitoring 
Form. 
Patient lost to follow -up. 
Patient s may be withdrawn from the stud y treatment if any of the following occurs:
Documented radiological progression (according to RECI ST 1.1 criteria) of urothelial 
carcinoma (local and/or central assessment), unless the patient may  benefit from post -
progression treatment according to the investigator’s judgment. In case radiological 
progression is suspected by  [CONTACT_23611] y recommended to wait for the 
confirmation of progressive dise ase b y central review. The full responsibility for 
patient treatment will nevertheless alway s be with the treating phy sician.
In the event of radiological progression as determined by  [CONTACT_393] (version 1.1) 
patients may  continue to receive study  treatment if identified as having continued 
clinical benefit. For example, a patient with radiological PD per RECI ST as assessed 
by [CONTACT_23612] s ymptoms (clinical benefit defined as the 
absence of deterioration of ECOG performance status [e. g. ECOG should not 
deteriorate from baseline status: 0 to 2 or higher, from 1 to 3 or higher]) may be a 
patient identified as having continued clinical benefit from study  treatment. Decisions 
about continuing stud y treatment will be made at the discretion of the investigator, 
based on the investigator’s judgment about the patient’s clinical status, and the sponsor should be informed. The reason for continuing treatment past progression needs to be recorded in patient file.
At the specific request of the sponsor and in agreement with the investigator (e.g. 
obvious non -compliance, safet y concerns). 
Development of an y intercurrent illness or situation which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, may  affect assessments of clinical status and study  endpoints to a
relevant degree.
For patients who withdraw consent to study , no further study -related procedures will be 
allowed. The patient will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result. An y patient removed from 
the study will remain under medical supervision until disc harge or transfer is medically  
acceptable. All patients will enter the active follow- up period upon discontinuation of the 
study  treatment. Regardless of the reason for discontinuation, all patients will be followed for 
survival until death is documented, except for those who specifically  withdraw consent to 
follow-up. 
Withdrawal from active follow -up
Patients must be withdrawn from active follow- up if any  of the following occurs:
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative. At any  
time during the study and without giving reasons, a patient may decline to participate 
further. The patient will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result.

consideration the status of the authorization or treatment guidelines in the given country , and 
will be recorded in I xRS. The chemotherapy  will be provided centrall y by [CONTACT_456].
Randomization will be stratified according to 
PIK3CA and/or RAS activating mutations (presence vs.absence)
prior immunotherap y (yes vs.no)
modified 4-factor Bellmunt risk score (high vs.low) (see Section 9.3.3 )
The first administration of study  drug should take place within [ADDRESS_22692] and will assign a randomization number to the patient . 
Confirmation of adequate level of FGFR overexpression will be obtained from the central lab.
Confirmation of other inclusion and exclusion requirements will be obtained fro m the 
investigator. After confirmation of patient eligibility  in IxRS, a patient may be randomized .
The I xRS procedure is described in detail in a separate IxRS instruction manual that will be 
maintained in the electronic trial master file ( eTMF) and in each center’s investigator site file.
7.4 Dosage and administration
7.4.1 Doses , dosing schedule and route of administration
Rogaratinib 
Following randomization, r ogaratinib (BAY 1163877) 600 mg (consisting of 3 tablets à 
200mg) will be taken orally (p.o.) twice a day(b.i.d.), on every  day during a 21 -day treatment 
cycle. It is important to take the tablets at the same times each day  approximately  12 hours 
apart.

Special considerations/instructions for rogaratinib dosing:
Rogaratinib tablets should be taken with a glass of water (approximately  200 mL  / 7ounces). 
Tablets should be swallowed intact and not chewed. Rogaratinib tablets can be taken with or 
without food. 
If a dose of rogaratinib is missed, the prescribed dose should be taken as soon as the patient 
reme mbers and up to 3 hours after the usual time. If this is not possible, missed doses should 
not be replaced and the patient should continue with the next dose as planned.
Chemotherapy
Following randomization, t he assigned chemotherapy  (monotherapy ) will be given as 
intravenous (i.v.) infusion once every three weeks (on day  1 of a 21 -day cycle). The cy cle 
ends with the next infusion. 
The most current version of the SmPC will be made available to the investigator and should 
be considered whenever necessary .In the comparator arm, patients should receive standard 
premedication for chemotherap y as per l ocal standard -of-care and SmPC.
Docetaxel
The starting dose for docetaxel to be used is 75 mg/m² given as i.v.infusion. 
All patients should be premedicated prior docetaxel administration in order to prevent severe 
hypersensi tivity reactions (such as severe h ypotension, bronchospasm general rash/ery thema
and fluid reten tion). Such premedication may  consist of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone [ADDRESS_22693] developed severe hy persensi tivity  reactions (such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generaliz ed rash/ery thema which require immediate 
discontinuation of docetaxel and appropriate therapy ) should not be re-challenged with 
doce taxel.
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for dose modification guidance.
Paclitaxel
The starting dose for paclitaxel to be used is 175mg/m² given as i.v. infusion.
All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel adm inistration in order to prevent 
severe h ypersensitivity  reactions (characterized by [CONTACT_23614] h ypotension requirement 
treatment, angioedema and generalized urticaria) . Such premedication may consist of 
dexamethasone 20 mg p.o.administered approximately  12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel, or 
for i.v. administration: 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel, diphenhy dramine (or its equivalent) 
50 mg i.v.30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg)

Vinflunine
The starting dose for vinflunine to be used is 320mg/m² given as i.v. infusion.
In case of ‘ECOG performance status (PS) of 1 ’or ‘PS of 0 and prior pelvic irradiation’ , the 
treatment should be started at adose of 280 mg/m². I n the absence of any  hematological 
toxicity  during the first cy cle causing treatment delay  or dose reduction, the dose will be 
increased to 320 mg/m² every  3 weeks for the subsequent cy cles.
Dose recommendation in elderly patients :
Inpatients of at least 75 y ears and less than 80 y ears, dose o f vinflunine to be given is 
280mg/m2every  3 weeks; in patients 80 y ears old and above, dose of vinflunine to be given 
is250 mg/m2every  3 weeks.
Dose recommendation in patients with renal impa irment :
Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 40ml/min -<60 ml/min) the recommended 
dose of vinflunine is 280 mg/m2every  3 weeks. In patients with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 40 ml/min) the recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m2every 3 weeks.
Dose recommendation in patients with hepatic impairment :
The recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m² given once every  3 weeks in patient s with 
mild liver impairment (Child -Pugh grade A) or in patients with a p rothrombin time 
≥60% ULN and 1.5xULN < b ilirubin ≤ 3xULN and presenting at least one of the following

Monthly ophthalmological monitoring of the treatment associated retinal ab normality  is 
recommended to be continued until resolution of the abnormality and to be documented in the 
source data for patients whose treatment was permanently discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose modifications of chemotherapy (comparator drugs)
Before each single administration of the chemotherap y the patient will be as sessed for signs 
of hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity  by [CONTACT_23617] ( see
Section 9.1).
Findings will be graded according to CTCAE v.4.03 and it will be determined if the 
chemotherap y needs to be delay ed or if the dose has to be modified. This decision will be 
clearl y documented in the patient’s records and the eCRF. Decision for dose delay  and dose 
reduction will be based on local standard -of-care and/or SmPC.
Patients in whom doses are delayed due to toxicities should be followed up within 7 to 10 days to re -assess toxicities, if not specified otherwise.
Paclit axel,docetaxel or vinflunine dose will be reduced for toxicities attributed to these drugs. 
Once dose reductions are made, re -escalation of doses is not permitted since dose reductions 
are permanent. Patients requiring a dose delay  due to toxicity  of > 24 days (or less if required 
in the dose modification section) from the next intended dose or due to other reasons for 
> [ADDRESS_22703] of 21 days, however any delay will prolong the duration of a 
cycle. The cycle ends with the next dose administration.
Specific dose modification guidance for paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine is found in the 
subsections below. Additional considerations for the toxicity  manageme nt including other 
measurement and dose modification according to local label and/or local guidelines should be 
followed b y the investigators .
Specific dose modifications for vinflunine
In case of ’ECOG performance status (PS) of ≥ 1’ or ‘PS of 0 and prior pelvic irradiation’,
vinflunine treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m
2. In the absence of any
hematological toxicity  during the first cy cle causing treatment delay  or dose reduction, the
dose will be increased to 320 mg/m2every  3 weeks for the subsequent cycles.
The recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m2given once every 3 weeks in patients with 
mild liver impairment (Child -Pugh grade A) or in patient s with a Prothrombin time
≥60% ULN and 1.5xULN < bilirubin ≤ 3xULN and presenting at least one of the following
criteria: transaminases > ULN and/or GGT > 5xULN.
In patients who initiate vinflunine at 280 mg/m2and who experience an AE requiring dose
modification, the dose should be reduced to 250 mg/m2following the 1st occurrence and
resolution, and discontinued following a 2nd occurrence. In patien ts who initiate vinflunine at

Specific dose modifications for paclitaxel
Paclitaxel should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than
1500 cells/mm3. Patien ts should not be re- treated with subsequent cy cles of paclitaxel until
neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1500 cells/mm3and the platelet count is ≥100,000 /mm ³. 
Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 500 /mm³ [corresponding to 
CTCAE Grade 4] for ≥7 day s) or severe peripheral neuropa thy (CTCAE Grade ≥3) should 
receive a dose reduction of 20 % for subsequent cycles. If further dose reduction is needed, 
treatment with paclitaxel should be discontinued.
Severe cardiac conduction abnormalities have been reported rarely  with single agent 
paclitaxel. I f patients develop significant conduction abnormalities during paclitaxel 
administration, appropriate therap y should be administered and continuous cardiac monitoring 
should be performed during subsequent therap y with paclitaxel. A dose reduct ion or 
withdrawal from treatment is at the discretion of the investigator after individually  assessing 
the safet y of each patient. Hypotension, hy pertension, and brady cardia have been observed

In patients who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3
(CTCAE Grade 4) for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or 
severe peripheral neuropathy  (CTCAE Grade ≥3) during docetaxel therap y, the dose of 
docetaxel should be reduced from 75 mg/m2to 60 mg/m2. If the patient continues to 
experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be discontinued.
Patients with hypersensi tivity reactions :
If hypersensitivity  reactions occur, minor s ymptoms such as flushing or localized cutaneous 
reactions do not require interruption of therap y. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generaliz ed rash/ery thema r equire immediate discontinuation 
of docetaxel and appropriate therap y. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity 
reactions should not be re- challenged with docetaxel.
Patients with hepatic impairment :
For patients with the following conditions, no dose reduction can be recommended as per 
SmPC and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly  indicated: 
serum bilirubin > ULN and alkaline phosphatase > [ADDRESS_22705]

discontinued from the study  treatment for non -compliance with follow -up visits or study  
treatment , at the discretion of the principal i nvestigator or sponsor.
All reasons for non -compliance should be clearl y documented in the patients’ records and the 
eCRF.
Any discrepancies between actual and expected amount of returned s tudy drug (rogaratinib) 
must be discussed with the patient at the time of the visit, and any  explanation must be 
documented in the source records.The preparation and administration of the chemotherap y (docetaxel, pac litaxel or vinflunine) 
will be performed by  [CONTACT_11399] y trained personnel (e.g. site or pharmacy staff) that will 
ascertain and document that the patient receives all treatments as planned.Each administration of the study  drug must be recorded in the source documentation and the

duration as well as r easons for dose interruption/ delay , reduction, re- escalation (rogaratinib 
only) or omission . 
Reasons for dose interruption / delay , reduction, re -escal ation or omission will also be 
recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF.An adequate record of receipt, distribution, and return/destruction of all study  drugs must be 
kept in the form of a Drug Accountability  Form.
8. Non- study therapy
8.1 Prior and con comitant therapy
Any medication which is considered necessary  for the patient’s welfare, and which is not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study  treatment, may  be given at the discretion 
of the investigator. In general, patients should be c losely  monitored for side effects of all 
concomitant medications regardless of elimination path, especiall y those with narrow 
therapeutic indices, such as warfarin and digoxin. Guidance on recording of prior and concomitant medications can be found in Sec tion 11.1 .

Bisphophonates and denosumab as supportive treatment started prior start of study  
treatment can be continued during the course of study , but n ewlystart of treatment with 
denosumab or bi sphophonates during the course of study  drug treatment will not be 
allowed.
Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue .
Radiotherap y, except:
oConcomitant palliative radiation therap y is allowed if the target lesion(s) are 
not included within the radiation field and no more than 10% of the bone 
marrow is irradiated.
oA short course of radiotherap y during stud y treatment due to a pathological 
fracture will be allowed after consultation with the sponsor , if the underl ying 
bone lesion is not considered as a target lesion.
Biotin -containing supplements (alternative names in over -the-counter drugs might be 
used, e.g. vitamin B7, vitamin H, coenzy me R) containing more than 30 µg daily  dose 
should not be taken b ecause of potential interference with laboratory  tests (27).
Rogaratinib treatment arm only
Rogaratinib is mainly  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and to a less erextent by  [CONTACT_097]2C9.
Therefore,
oUse of strong inhibitors and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (see Appendix 16.1) is not 
permitted for 2 weeks before the start of study  treatment or during the study . 
Concomitant use of moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided as clinically  significant decrease in plasma concentrations of rogaratinib cannot be ruled 
out. 
oConcomitant use of herbal preparations containing C YP3A4 inducers (e.g. St John’s 
wort) are not permitted for 2 weeks before the start of study  treatment or during the 
study .
oGrapefruit and grapefruit juice (CYP3A4 inhibitor) consumption is not permitted during the stud y.
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23558] (i.e. antacids , 
phosphate -containing laxatives oral/rectal, potassium phosphate) are prohibited.
Chemotherap y arm onl y
Drugs prohibited according to locall y approved package insert sof paclitaxel, docetaxel 
and vinflunine are not permitted. The following information should be considered as a 
guidance based on package insert / summary  of product characteristics:
oThe metabolism of paclitaxel is cataly zed by  [CONTACT_9058] P450 i soenzy mes CYP2C8

felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and triazolam), inhibitors 
(e.g., atazanavir, clarithromy cin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromy cin), and inducers (e.g., rifampin and 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) of CYP3A4. Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel is concomitantly  administered with known substrates (e.g., repaglinide and 
rosiglitazone), inhibitors (e.g., gemfibr ozil), and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of CYP2C8.
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23559]
Fluconazole is considered a moderate to strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 and should be 
avoided, if possible.
Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are CYP3A4 , P-gp and BCRP substrates
(e.g. alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, fentany l, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], 
quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be avoided , because drug interactions caused 
by [CONTACT_23620]3A 4, P- gp and BCRP by  [CONTACT_23621] .
Chemotherap y arm onl y
Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of 
docetaxel may  be modified by  [CONTACT_23622], 
inhibit, or are metabolized by  [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4. Concomitant use of docetaxel and 
drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may  increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In 
patients receiving treatment with docetaxel, close monitoring for toxicity  and docetaxel 
dose reduction could be considered if s ystemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor cannot be avoided.
The concomitant use of vinflunine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole and grapefruit juice) or inducers (such as rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_23560] (St John’s wort) should be avoided since they  may  increase or 
decrease vinflunine and metabolite of vinflunine concentrations.
8.[ADDRESS_22712]-study therapy
At the end of stud y treatment for the individual patient , further therap y is at the discretion of 
the investigator.
At the conclusion of the study , patients who demonstrate clinical benefit may  be eligible to 
continue to receive stud y treatment . They  may  receive further treatment, assessments and/or 
be followed either via a post-trial access program, a roll -over stud y -subject to approval by  
[CONTACT_23623] -or through any  other mechanism in 
accordance with local legal and compliance rules. This applies to patients on study  treatment 
and in follow-up.

study treatment eligibility has been signed, -the patient is a FGFR test failure or screening failure (e.g. failed to meet the criteria during FGFR testing or the screenin g 
period), -for randomization , -on Day 1 of every treatment cycle so that the specific patient drug bottle/vial can be provided for dispensing purposes and also in case the 
patient has discontinued the study treatment (EOT) for any reason. 
c. Archival tumor tissue should be used, fresh tissue should only be obtained when no archival tissue is available and when there is no additional risk for the patient in the 
investigator’s judgment. Tissue will be used for central FGFR testing in all patients, and in addition for PIK3CA and RAS mutation testing inall FGFR -positive patients and 
for exploratory tumor -based biomarker analyses in randomized patients.
d. At FGFR testing , study disease characteristics are collected and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23561]. 
At screening , study disease characteristics are updated if applicable; prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23562], medica l history and non -study -indication -
related medications are collected. 
e. Limited inclusion criteria will be checked in patients before FGFR testing (see Section 6.1).
f. The radiological evaluation must include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen a nd pelvis with contrast media. Chest 
CT is strongly recommended and preferred versus chest MRI. MRI shall be performed instead of CT when local regulations do not permit the use of CT as r equested per 
protocol schedule. Note: all images need to be submitted continuously for independent central imaging review in digita l format.
g. Pre-study contrast -enhanced CT/MRI (chest/abdomen/pelvis, and other areas of disease if applicable) may be acceptable as a baseline scan if done within [ADDRESS_22719] enhanced (unless contraindicated) CT scan or MRI of the brain is required at screening to rule out brain metastases.

In this stud y, the modified 4-factor Bellmunt risk score (high vs.low) is used as one of the 
stratification factors for randomization. 
The Bellmunt risk score for stratification is divided in ‘high’ and ‘low’ as follows:
‘High’ score: 3-4 points
‘Low’ score: 0- 2 points.
Modified 4- factor Bellmunt risk score will be calculated based on the following parameters 
collected within 7 day s before randomization:
Hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL  vs.≥ 10 g/dL
ECOG performance status 0 vs. 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Liver metastases absent vs.present
Time from last sy stemic anti -cancer therap y dose (< 90 vs. ≥ 90 day s)

9.4 Efficacy
The original primary  efficacy  variable for thePhase 3partof the stud y was overall survival .
The primary  efficacy  variable of Phase 2 is ORR , and will be anal yzed based on central 
review assessment. Although OS is the primary  variable originall y planned for the Phas e 3 
part of this study , it is considered a n exploratory efficacy  variable for the Phase 2 part. The 
analysis will be performed when survival data is considered adequate for analy sisby [CONTACT_103].OSis defined as the time (days) from randomizat ion to death due to an y cause. Patients alive 
at the date of data cut-off for anal ysis will be censored at th e last date known to be alive. If a 
patient is lost to follow -up before an y assessment after randomization, this pat ient will be 
censored at D ay1.

Secondary efficacy  variable sof the study  are:
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
Objective response rate (ORR) 
Disease -control rate (DCR) 
Duration of response (DOR) 
Thesecondary  efficacy  endpoints (PFS, ORR, DCR, and DOR) will be assessed based on 
central radiological tumor evaluation.
PFS is defined as the time (day s) from randomization to date of first observed disease 
progression (radiological or clinical assessment) or death due to an y cause, if death occurs 
before progression is documented. The act ual date that the tumor scan was performed will be 
used for this calcula tion. If a tumor assessment is performed over more than one day  (e.g. 
scans for chest and abdomen done on different days for a same evaluation), the earliest date 
will be us ed for the calculation of PFS. For patients without documented radiological or 
clinical progression or death at the time of anal ysis, PFS will be censored at the last actual 
visit date of tumor evaluation.
For all patients, the best overall tumor response at each assessment will be determined locall y 
by [CONTACT_23631] (v1.1).
ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR). Patients for whom overall best response is not CR or PR, as well as patients without any  
post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non- responders.
DCR is defined as the percentage of patients, whose overall best response was not progressive 
disease (i.e. CR, PR, SD or Non CR/Non PD). Tumor assessments with SD as response, that 
is performed prematurely after randomization of the patient (i.e. substantially  earlier than the 
first planned radiological tumor assessment at 6 weeks), will not be taken into account.DOR (for PR and CR) is defined a s the time from the first documented objective response of 
PR or CR, whichever is noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurs befo re 
progression is documented). DOR will be defined for responders onl y, i.e. patients with a CR 
or PR. The actual dates the tumor scans were performed will be used for this calculation. 
DOR for patients who have not progressed or died at the time of anal ysis will be censored at 
the date of their last tumor assessment.

contraindicated) and evaluated using RECIST v.1.1 (28)(see Appendix 16.2) to determine the 
secondary  efficacy  variables (progression- free survival [PFS], objective response rate [ORR], 
disease -control rate [DCR] and duration of response [DOR]). Radiological tumor assessments 
will be done locall y, and in addition centrally  to determine the secondary  efficacy  variables 
(see details below) .
MRI  shall be performed instead of CT when local regulations do not permit the use of CT as 
requested per protocol schedule. The f irst radiological tumor evaluation will be conducted

during screening within 28 day s before randomization ( see flow chart in Table 9–1). Scans
(CT or MRI) for tumor assessments according to RECI ST v.1.1 are to be done every  6 weeks 
(± 7 day s) starting from Cy cle 1 Day  1 up to week 18, and thereafter, every  9 weeks 
(±7days). A minimum of at least [ADDRESS_22751] “on 
treatment” tumor assessment in order to achieve a valid response of stable disease. In 
exceptional cases, when it is deemed clinicall y necessary b y the investigator due to safet y 
reasons , an imaging scan at an earlier time point is allowed.
For patients who discontinue study  treatment without disease progression, follow -up tumor 
evaluation s will be performed (by [CONTACT_462]) until progression of malignancy and/or start of 
subsequent sy stemic anti -cancer treatment, whichever comes first, or an y other crit erion for 
withdrawal is met. During the active follow -up period, CT/MRI  evaluations will be performed 
at the same intervals as during stud y treatment (every  6 weeks up to week 18, thereafter, 
every  9 weeks) (see Table 9–1).
The radiological evaluation at baseline must include CT or MRI  of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis with contrast media ( unless contraindicated) . At follow -up CT or MRI  can be done 
exceptionally  without use of contrast media if this is contraindicated (e.g. renal impaired 
patients). Chest CT is strongl y recommended and preferred versus chest MRI. The same 
technique (e.g. slice thickness, field of view) andthe same image method (CT o r MR I)should 
be used within any  given patient . All CT/MR I scans must meet the standard of care for 
imaging of lesions in the respective organ s ystem(s). All suspected sites of disease will be 
imaged.
Acontrast enhanced (unless contraindicated) CT scan or MRI of the brain is required at 
screening to rule out brain metastases. Acquisition of both contrast enhanced (unless 
contraindicated) and unenhanced scans of the brain at baseline is strongly  recommended. An 
MRI  scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of central nervous s ystem 
(CNS )metastasis at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan. Patients with definitely  treated 
stable CNS metastases may  be eligible for the study .Further CT scan or MRI  of the brain is 
only to be repeate d if metastases or s ymptoms are present.
The specific contrast media rules are provided in a separate imagingmanual .
If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomograph y (PET)/CT 
scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standard for a diagnostic CT scan, i.e. 
adequate radiation dose and i.v. contrast, if intended to be used for target lesion measurements.
Bone scans (Technetium- 99m) should be performed at screening. If bone metastases are 
present at screening and cannot be seen on CT or MRI  scans, or if clinically  indicated, TC -
99m bone scans should be repeated when complete response is identified in target disease or 
when progression in bone is suspected.
New lesions in PET or bone scan should be confirmed by  [CONTACT_4654] o r MRI.
All scans should be done with the identical modality  (CT or MRI) and the identical technique 
(e.g., slice thickness, field of view) to those obtained at baseline.

9.5 Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics
Plasma samples for measurement of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) concentrations (and 
metabolite (s)concentrations, if needed) will be collected from all rogaratinib -treated patients 
as follows:
Day 1 of C ycle 1 , 2, 3, 4 and 5: 
oat pre -dose (before supervised dose administration)
o1(±0.5h) hour post -dose (between 0.5 and 1.5 after dose administration)
Oral administration of the morning dose of rogaratinib will be done under supervision 
of site staff on rogaratinib PK days.
Deviations from planned sampling time intervals will not be considered protocol deviations. 
The date and clock time of each sample a s well as dates and times of the doses will be 
recorded in the eCRF as PK calculations will be based on the sampling times relative to 
dosing times. Missed samples do not need to be collected bey ond C ycle 5. Samples may  be 
collected irrespective of any  dose modifications during the treatment cy cle. No detailed 
dosing history  is required before the pre -dose sample, but the dose that separates the pre- and 
post-dose sample needs to be taken under supe rvision and the time recorded. Data from this 
study  will be pooled with data from other clinical trials for pharmacometric anal ysis. 
Plasma concentrations of all anal ytes will be measured using a validated method. If required, 
other metabolites may  be measured. Expl oratory  measurements of other moieties may  be 
performed, if needed.
Details about the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provided in 
the laboratory  manual.

9.6 Safety
9.6.1 Adverse events
Investigators should refer to the Safety  Information section of the current investigator’s 
brochure (IB) of rogaratinib for the expected side effects. As with an y agent, there is alway s 
the potential for unexpected AEs, including h ypersensitivity  reactions. The IB will be updated 
if any  new relevant safety  data are obtained. 
For the expected side effects of the comparator chemotherap y drugs (docetaxel, paclitaxel or 
vinflunine), please refer to the respective SmPCs.
Therapeutic monitoring should be performed following dose modification of study  drugs in a 
manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care. In general, p atients should be 
closely  monitored for adverse drug reactions of all concomitant medications regardless of the 
path of drug elimination.All concomitant medications must be recorded in the patient’s source documentation as well 
as on the eCRF.
Patients mu st be carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring also includes clinical 
laboratory  tests. AEs should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity , and 
relationship to the study  drug, or chemotherapy .
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Definition of adverse event (AE)
In a clinical study , an AE is any  untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent for study  treatment 
eligibility . 
Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporall y or causall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study  by [CONTACT_23633] (however, the condition for which the surgery  is 
required may be an AE).New lesions or disease progression per se should not be regarded as AEs. Instead, the 
associated signs and s ymptoms should be recorded as AEs.
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term “condition” may  
include abnormal e.g. physical examination findings, s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory , 12-lead 
ECG.
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent for stud y treatment 
eligibility and for which no sy mptoms or treatment are present until signing of 
informed consent for study  treatment eligibility  are recorded as medical history (e.g. 
seasonal allergy  without acute complaints).
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 1163877 / [ZIP_CODE]
12NOV 2019 Version 3.0 Page: 99of 153
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent for stud y treatment 
eligibility  and for which symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed 
consent, at unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history (e.g. allergic 
pollinosis) .
Conditions that started or dete riorated after signing of informed consent for study  
treatment eligibility  will be documented as adverse events. This includes intercurrent 
illnesses.
Definition of treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE)
A treatment -emergent event is defined as an y event arising or worsening after the start of 
study  drug administration until [ADDRESS_22753] administration of study  treatment .
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any  untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets an yof the 
following criteria (a –f):
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23565]:
-The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours
- The admission is pre- planned
(e.g. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the study ; 
admission is part of the study  procedures as described in Section 9.2)
-The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
specificall y require a more stringent definition , the local regulation takes precedence.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e.Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect
f.Is another seri ous or important medical event as judged b y the investigator

sign(s) or finding(s) that have a start date after signing the IC F for stud y treatment eligibility
must be recorded as SAEs (see also Section 11.1) . This also includes all serious events with a 
start date during screening period. A condition that was present before signing the PI/ICFand 
worsens after signing the PI /ICF for study  treatment eligibility  must also be recorded as an 
SAE if the serious criteria are met.
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_22755] be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity
The intensity  of AEs should be documented using the National Cancer Institute’s Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE, version 4.03) ( 29).
The intensity  of AE sis classified according to the following categories for events not listed in 
the CTCAE v.4.03 (e.g. soft- tissue mineralization):
Grade 1: Mild; as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of D aily Living ( ADL ; instrumental ADL  refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], usi ng the telephone, managing 
money , etc.).
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately  life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23566]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL (self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressin g and undressing, feeding self, using 
the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5: Death related to AE.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a decision to be made by  [CONTACT_093], who is a qualified phy sician, based on all 
information available at the time of the completion of the eCRF.
Causality  should be assessed separatel y for each study treatment as detailed in the eCRF. If 
the investigator feels that the event cannot be firmly  attributed to one of the study  drugs 
(e.g. owing to a suspected underly ing interaction), the same assessment will be documented 
for each study treatment.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”
An assessment of “no” would include:
1.The exist ence of a highl y likely  alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
or

developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that that the AE is reasonabl y associated with the use of the 
study  treatment.
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to stu dy treatment 
include:
-The temporal sequ ence from drug administration: The event should occur after the drug 
is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
-Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction 
(re-challenge): Patient ’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should be considered 
in view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
-Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the patient may have.
-Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might have caused the event in question.
-Known response pattern for this class of drug: Clinical/preclinical
-Exposure to phy sical and/or mental stresses: The exposure to stress might induce advers e 
changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event
-The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study  treatment, coupled with the individual patient ’s pharmacod ynamics should be 
considered.

Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).
Possible answers are “y es” or “no” .

The following procedure applies after signing of the PI /ICFfor FGFR testing :
For patients with AE or SAE related to the procedure of taking a fresh biopsy  for 
FGFR testing the corresponding AE and SAE have to be reported in the eCRF and 
must be fully  documented in the source data.
For all other events, these have to be fully  documented in the source data and will be 
reported in the medical history  only for t hose patients who have signed the PI /ICF for 
study  treatment eligibility .
The following procedure applies after signing of the PI /ICFfor stud y treatment eligibility. 
For screening failures, the investigator must record every  SAE (see Section 11.1) and

For all serious adverse events (SAEs) the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for 
expectedness, seriousn ess and causal relationship to study  drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of serious adverse events
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Each SAE must 
be followed up until resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_23636][INVESTIGATOR_841].
All of the following events are to be reported to the sponsor as SAEs following the reporting 
instructions detailed in this section (a cop y of the pathology  report should be sent, if 
available):
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurring 
after chemotherap y for cancer .
Any new primary cance rs(or malignancy) during the course of the study  (including 
skin cancers) regardless of relationship to study treatment .
Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required b y the

[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse events
For this study , the applicable reference document is the most current version of the Section 8 
of the investigator’s brochure (IB) for rogaratinib. For chemotherap y (paclitaxel, docetaxel, 
vinflunine), applicable SmPCs will be used.
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical developme nt are 
shown in the current IB. If relevant new safet y information is identified, the information will
be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed to all participating sites.The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor according to the applicable 
reference document and according to all local regulations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events of special safety interest
Rogaratinib is an investigational drug and current knowledge of the AEs associated with this 
compound is limited. As with any new chemical entity , there is alway s potential for 
unexpected AEs, including h ypersensitivity  reactions.
Signs and sy mptoms suggestive for soft -tissue mineralization ,and retinal disorders (classified 
analog to CTCAE v.4.03 as Grade ≥ 2)are defined as AEs of special interest (AESI). AESIs 
should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours using a safet y report form as outlined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Reporting of serious adverse events).
Soft-tissue mineralization
Clinical manifestation of soft -tissue mineralization caused b y rogaratinib is expected to be 
similar to hy perphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (congenital disease caused b y loss -
of function of FGF23 -FGFR/Klotho signaling pathway ). Therefore, an y events consistent 
with ectopic calcification should be reported as AESI  (e.g. MedDRA lowest level terms 
[LLTs ]tissue calcification, metastatic calcification, calcification of muscles, intestinal 
calcification, cutaneous calcification). 
Any patient with newl y diagnosed soft -tissue mineralization suspected to be caused b y 
rogaratinib should permanently  discontinue the study  treatme nt.
Retinal disorders (CTCAE Grade ≥ 2)
Any symptomatic retinal disorders including retinal detachment /retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_23553] / serous retinopathy / retinal vein occlusion (classified analog to CTCAE v.4.03 
as Grade ≥ 2) should be reported as AESI. The results of the ophthalmologic examination

9.7 Other procedures and variables
9.7.1 Biomarker investigations
Only  urothelial carcinoma patients with high FGFR1 or 3 mRNA expression levels will be 
eligible for study  treatment. Therefore patients need to provide written PI /ICFfor FGFR 
testing to be enrolled; archival tumor tissue is adequate for testing of FGFR1 and [ADDRESS_22768] the study  eligibility .
If archival tissue is not available in sufficient quantity  or quality  for the FGFR1 and 3 RNA -
ISH assay  and/orfor the PI K3CA and RAS mutation testing to be performed, then a new
biopsy  procedure would be necessary  if the patient wants to pursue the option of entering the 
trial. This procedure would be performed at the discretion of the investigator and consent 
from the patient. The tumor material should be derived by  a biops y pro cedure associated with 
a non- significant risk, e.g. ultrasound -guided and will be limited to superficial ly mph nodes, 
and other anatomical regions suited for non- invasive biopsy  procedures. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_23572] a biopsy  procedur e for biomarker testing. No major organ should 
be biopsied, e.g. biopsy  of the brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures 
extending bey ond the esophagus, stomach or bowel are excluded.
The UC tumor tissue embedded into paraffin will be shipped to a central laboratory  to confirm 
high expression levels of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mRNA (see Section 6.1: 
Inclusion criteria) in all patients and in addition for testing the absence or presence of 
PIK3CA and/or RAS activating mutations in all FGFR -positive patients who have signedthe 
PI/ICF for FGFR testing (see Section 5).
Method applied for patient selection in trial [ZIP_CODE]
The FGFR1&3 RNA in situ hybridi zation (RNA -ISH) test is intended to be used for the 
detection of FGFR1and FGFR3 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from urothelial carcinoma patients. The FGFR1 and [ADDRESS_22769] will be used to aid in the selection of cancer patie nts who may  benefit from the 
pan-FGFR inhibitor (rogaratinib) therap y. The RNA -ISH technology  allows for the respective 
FGFR probe to bind to the target FGFR mRNA, and in combination with detection chemistry  
results in visualizat ion of the FGFR mRNA signal s. The signals are then quantitated by  a 
trained pathologist using light microscopy . The final outcome can be used to assess the level 
of FGFR1 and 3 mRNA transcript overexpression. The anal ysis will be performed centrally .
In pre -clinical studies, only xenograft models with high expression levels of either FGFR1, or 
FGFR2 or FGFR3 demonstrated significant (> 50%) anti -tumor effica cy upon rogaratinib
treatment. Preliminary  data from Phase 1 study  [ZIP_CODE] confirms that a treatme nt benefit of 
having either a partial response or a long -lasting stable disease (SD) is observed in patients

Details about the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provided 
separately  (laboratory  manual ).
PIK3CA and RAS mutation testing
The presence or absence of PI K3CA and/or RAS activating m utations is used as one of the 
stratification factors of the study  and will be tested only  in FGFR -positive patients who have 
signedthe PI/ICF for FGFR testing. The detection of activating mutations in PI K3CA and/or 
RAS -encoding genes will be conducted b y a central laboratory . Please refer to Section 5.1 for 
justification of the mutation testing.
Exploratory t umor -based biomarker analysis
For all randomized patients exploratory  biomarker anal yses will be performed from UC tumor 
specimen provided bey ond the number of slides needed for FGFR1 and 3 testing and for the 
testing for PIK3CA and RAS mutations. This pro cedure is covered b y the PI /ICF for FGFR 
testing .
These tumor tissue specimens may  be used for the following purposes: (1) to evaluate 
mutations, copy  numbers or gene rearrangements in FGFR encoding genes and in known 
oncogenes such as p53, PTEN, and cM yc in DNA extracted from tumor tissue specimens; (2) 
to analy ze the gene expression of genes that may  explain resistance or hy per-responsiveness 
to FGFR inhibitors, such as cMet, cM yc and FGF 19in RNA extracted from tumor tissue 
specimens; (3) to evaluate expression of non-coding tumor relevant RNAs, such as 
microRNAs; (4) to evaluate protein expression of immune ma rkers, such as PD -L1 and CD8A 
in tumor specimen, e.g. by  [CONTACT_4658].
Exploratory p lasma -based biomarker analysis
All FGFR positive patients will be asked to provide blood samples for biomarker anal yses, 
which will be obtained during regular stud y visits in which blood will be drawn for other 
scheduled but unrelated laboratory  tests. The following procedures are covered b y the PI/ICF 
for study treatment eligibility .
Genetic biomarkers from plasma:
These samples are intended forisolat ion of plasma to study  tumor markers circulating in 
blood such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor RNA. Candidates of genes for the evaluation fr om ctDNA are RAS -encoding gene s, PIK 3CA, and cM etwhich 
have been described as contributors to acquired FGFR inhibitor resistance but also FGFR 
DNA alterations including but not limited to FGFR3 activating mutations and translocations to correlate with the respective FGFR DNA status detected in tumor specimen from the same 
patient . The ty pes of analy ses may  comprise the identification of mutations or splice variants.

12NOV 2019 Version 3.0 Page: 113of 153
Furthermore, these plasma samples will serve as source for non -coding microRNA, as 
possible markers describing treatment response.
Non-genetic biomarkers from plasma:
Plasma samples will also be used to quantify  the circulating levels of various proteins of 
interest, to attempt to identify  a protein signature [CONTACT_23684]. 
Plasma samples for the analy ses of tumor biomarkers (genetic and non-genetic biomarkers) 
will be prepared from blood samples obtained at the following time points:
At screening visit (within 7 day s prior to randomization), 
on Day  1 (pre -dose) of each tr eatment cy cle, and
at the end-of-t reatment (EOT) visit.
On treatment day s, blood will be drawn for preparation of plasma samples prior to drug 
administration, if possible. In addition to the proteins and genes listed above, other 
biomarkers deemed relevant to this study  will be measured if they  will be identified as 
possible resistance mechanisms during the course of the study . Data from these additional 
biomarker anal yses may  also be correlated with measures of clinical efficacy .
9.7.2 Patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Group’s EQ- 5D-3Lquestionnaires will 
be used tocollect patient -reported outcomes (PRO). The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a 
multidimensional validated cancer -specific quality  of life questionnaire developed by  [CONTACT_23644]. It includes five 
functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive functioni ng),3 symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), a global health status scale, and a number of 
single items assessing additional sy mptoms (dyspnea, sleep disturbances, constipation, and 
diarrhea), and perceived financial impact. The EORTC QL Q-C30 will be used to evaluate the 
total score, s ymptom scales / items and global health status of the patients.
The EQ -5D- 3L is a generic, validated quality  of life preference -based instrument to measure 
both utility  and health status. It contains a descr iptive sy stem which measures 5 health 
dimensions: mobility , self -care, usual activity , pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression . The 
five health dimensions are summarized into a single score, the EQ -5D index score that ranges 
between 0 and 1 ([ADDRESS_22771] health) . The EQ -5D also contains a visual analog scale (EQ -visual analog scale 
[VAS]), which records the respondent’s self -rated health status on a vertical graduated visual 
analogue sc ale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health 
state). The EQ -5D- 3L will be used to evaluate the index and VAS scores.
Data collection for both instruments would be completed at screening and on Day  1 of each 
cycle, at the EOT visit and at the safet y assessment visit of the active follow -up.

9.7.3 Healthcare resource utilization
Healthcare resource utilization information will be recorded once a patient has a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/healthcare visit, during the course of the study . Information on the start date, 
end date, ongoing status, location, scheduling status, main diagnosis at discharge, and number 
of working day s missed must be recorded. Data will be anal yzed on an ad hoc basis. 
9.8 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements
All efficacy  and safet y parameters, as well as the methods to measure them are standard 
variables / methods in clinical studies and/or clinical practice. They are widely  used and 
generall y recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. To ensure data can be compared 
between the treatment groups, all examinations (except blood sampling for PK analy ses) will 
be the same in both treatment arms.

as Phase 2.The study will remain open until the survival data is considered adequate for 
analysis by  [CONTACT_456]. The anal ysis details of the Phase 3 as well as the transition from 
Phase 2 to Phase 3 are provided in the following sections as a reference tothe original design.
Statistical analy sis will be performed using SAS; the version used will be specified in the 
statistical analy sis plan.
To help structure the section, we present the statistical m ethods for this Phase 2/[ADDRESS_22773] interim indicates the end of the Phase 2 part, 
and the second and final anal yses are considered the Phase 3 part including Phase 2 patients in 
the anal yses.
Patients w ill be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms:
Rogaratinib
Chemoth erapy (taxane or vinflunine)
More details on the treatments are provided in Section 7.
All patients enrolled to this study  are expected to have FGFR positive testing results. Due to 
inter-evaluator variability  in the scoring of FGFR test, a confirmation test could be done at the 
discretion of the sponsor to identify  the FGFR positive patients which will be referred to as 
confirmed FGFR positive.
Although both PIK3CA and/or RAS mutant and WT patients are recruited, this study  is 
powered forthe PIK3CA and RAS WT subgroup. Theref ore, the recruitment will stop when
450 PI K3CA andRAS WT patients are randomized . In the meanwhile, based on current 
assumption that about 75% of all study  population are PIK3CA and RAS WT, roughl y 600

patients in all study  population (450 PIK3CA and RAS WT + 150 PIK3CA and/or RAS 
mutant) will be recruited to the study . 
Randomization will be stratified b y:
PIK3CA and/or RAS activating mutations (presence vs. absence)
Prior immunotherapy  (yes vs.no)
Modified 4-factor Bellmunt risk score ( high vs.low) (see Section 9.3.3)
The following rule will be applied for WT and mutant subgroups to potentially  remove some 
stratification factors from the subgroups to avoid over -stratification: if the smallest group 
within one stratification factor (other than activating mutation status) is less than 15% of all 
randomized patients in either subgroup (450 patients for WT, and the corresponding number 
of mutant patients for mutant subgroup), and all study  population (with the exception of 
alway s including activating mutation status for all population), then this stratification factor 
will not be introduced into the model for the stratified statistical analy sis of efficacy  endpoints. 
As the majority  of patients are anticipated to be randomized by  [CONTACT_23645], this rule will be applied to both the 2ndinterim analysis and final anal ysis of 
OS for consistency .
Data from patients who are transferred to a roll- over study  may  be pooled and anal yzed
together with the data from the study  in which the patient was initially  included. The results 
from these analy ses will be reported separatel y.
10.2 Analysis se ts
Full analysis set (FAS) 
The primary  population for the efficacy anal ysis is the Full anal ysis set (FAS) population 
(also considered the Intent- to-treat (ITT) analy sis set) , which is defined as all randomized
patients. Patients will be anal yzed as randomized, meaning even if a patient was randomized 
and received no drug or if randomized and received incorrect study  drug at any  time, these 
patients will still be analy zed for effi cacy under FAS, as randomized. The FAS population is 
identical to the ITT population.
Safety analysis set (SAF)
The population for the safety  anal ysis will be comprised of all patients who received at least 
one dose of stud y treatment (rogaratinib or chemotherap y). Patients will be anal yzed as 
treated. Using a conservative approach, patients randomized to the chemotherapy  arm will be 
analyzed under the rogaratinib arm if the pat ient received at least one dose of rogaratinib
treatment , whereas patients randomized to the rogaratinib arm will still be anal yzed under the 
rogaratinib arm regardless of receiving an y chemotherap y. Only if a patient randomized to the 
rogaratinib arm rece ived chemotherap y treatment only  would the patient be anal yzed under 
the chemotherap y arm. Note, given the study  is designed as open- label and study  drug 
between the two arms will be administered differently  (i.e. oral versus intravenous) the 
possibility  of a patient receiving incorrect treatment is unlikely .

10.3.1 Efficacy variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy variable
Objective response rate (ORR) is the primary  efficacy  variable for the P hase 2 part .ORR
will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher ’sexact test , based on independent 
central review assessments for both populations. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals will 
be computed for each treatment arm. The differences in ORR between the rogaratinib and chemotherap y arms and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will also be calculated. 
Overall survival was the primary  efficacy  variable ( see Section 9.4for definition )of the
originall yplanned Phase 3 part .OS data will be considered mature and the final OS analy sis 
(i.e. primary  completion) will be performed when approximately  a total of [ADDRESS_22776] controlling t ype I error at a level of 0.025 (one -sided) will be conducted for the WT 
population first (step 1). A full alpha of 0.025 (one- sided) will be passed on to OS in all study  
population and some selected secondary  endpoints ( step 2) if and onl y if the null hy pothesis 
of OS for WT population is rejected. In case of failing to reject null hy pothesis of OS for WT 
population, step 2) will not be tested. Details on controlling famil y-wise t ype I error within 
step 2) for OS in all study population and selected secondary endpoints will be specified in the Stati stical Analy sis Plan (SAP).

If the analy sis in s tep 1) based on final OS data in WT population is positive, the efficacy  of 
rogaratinib monotherap y in PIK3CA andRAS WT FGFR -positive locally  advanced or 
metastatic urothelial bladder patients is considered established; Moreover , if the anal ysis in 
both step 1) and the OS in all study  population part in step 2) are positive based on the testing 
details specified in SAP with the corresponding alpha level allocated for OS in all study  
population, the efficacy  of rogaratinib mono therapy  in all FGFR -positive locally  advanced or 
metastatic urothelial bladder patients is considered established. 
Therefore, t o compare OS between the rogaratinib armand the chemotherapy  arm, the 
following hypothesis will be tested for the PIK3CA and RAS WT patients first and then all 
study  population:
H0: hazard ratio ( rogaratinib / chemotherap y) ≥ 1
versus
H1: hazard ratio ( rogaratinib / chemotherap y) < 1
The primary  efficacy  variable of OS in step 1) will be formall y compared based on 
approximately  [ADDRESS_22777], stratified by  [CONTACT_23646] , 
with consideration of the rule specified in S ection 10.1. 390 death events plus the 
corresponding number of events occurred in the PIK3CA and/or RAS mutant patients during 
the same period of time will be included for the evaluation of the all study  population in 
step2) mentioned above, using the stratified log- rank test apply ing the same rule.
The primary  stratified analy sis for OS (and all other efficacy  endpoints) will be based on 
stratificat ion information as entered in I xRSfor both s tep 1) and 2) .
In addition to the stratified log -rank test , for the PIK3CA and RAS WT patients first and then 
all study  population, the hazard ratio ( rogaratinib / chemotherap y) for OS and its 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated using the Cox model, stratified by  [CONTACT_23647]. Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates for OS and KM survival curves will also be 
presented for each treatment arm. The KM e stimates at time points such as 3 months, 
6 months etc. together with corresponding 95% confidence intervals as well as the differences 
of these estimates will also be calculated between the rogaratinib arm and the chemotherapy  
arm, for both PI K3CA and RAS WT population and all study population (referred toas “both 
populations” below ).
The sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed b y only including confirmed FGFR positive 
patients for WT population and all study  population, respectively.
See Section 10.5 for additional details on the planned interim anal ysis of OS .
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy variables
Secondary  efficacy  variables includ ingprogression- free survival ( PFS), disease control rate 
(DCR )and duration of response ( DOR )(see Section 9.4for definitions) will be anal yzed 
based on final database .
Further anal ysis details with respect to PFS, DCR and DOR are summarized below.

confidence interval will be provided. KM estimates and KM curves will also be presented for 
each treatment arm. The KM estimates at time points such as 2 months, 4 months etc. together 
with corresponding 95% confidence intervals as well as the differences of these estimates 
between the rogara tinib armand the chemotherap y armwill also be calculated.
DCR will be anal yzed similarly  to ORR .
For both population s, summary statistics will be display ed for all best response categories: 
CR, PR, SD, Non CR/Non PD, PD by  [CONTACT_23648] , and PD by  [CONTACT_23649]. Frequency  counts and percentages with exact 95% confidence intervals will be 
display ed.
Since the responders are not a randomized group, no statistical testing will be performed for DOR .Anal ysis of DOR will be descriptive in n ature for both populations based on 
independent central review assessments. KM estimates and KM curves will be display ed for 
each treatment arm.
Analy ses based on investigator’s review assessments will also be performed for PFS, DCR 
and DOR as sensitivity analy ses.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup analyses
For both populations, s ubgroup anal yses for ORR ,PFS and OS will be performed in a 
descriptive fashion if data are warranted . These may include, but may  not be limited to, 
subgroups defined b y demographics such as sex, race, ethnic group, geographic regions and 
age (calculated at the date of randomization using date of birth), baseline ECOG performance status, baseli ne cancer characteristics and stratifica tion factors at randomization (such as prior 
immunotherapy -treated subgroup etc.) . Descriptive statistics and hazard ratio estimates with 
95% CI  for OS and PFS will be provided at least within each category  of the subgroup, 
provided there are sufficient numbers of events in total for the category  within the subgroup 
across the treatment arms.
10.3.2 Safety variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events (AEs)
Summary  of adverse events is considered a secondary  objective for this study . All AEs, 
whether considered drug -related or not, will be reported on the eCRF with start / stop dates, 
dates of an y grade change, action taken, whether treatment was discontinued, any correctiv e 
measures taken, and outcome. For all events, the relationship to treatment and the severit y of
the event will be d etermined by  [CONTACT_093]. Adverse events will be coded using Medical 
Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) terms (version 20.0 or later), and graded 
according to National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI CTCAE), version 4.03.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic variables
The samples collected on Day [ADDRESS_22783] -dose will document a longitudinal exposure under stead y state condition. The 
longitudinal exposure data will be used in exposure -response modelling of adverse events and 
clinical responses. Evaluation of the data described above will be presented in a separate 
report.
The details of the modeling anal ysis will be described in a separate Modelling and Simulation 
(M&S) Analy sis Plan and the results may  be reported in a sepa rate M&S Report.
In the clinical stud y report, only p lasma concentration data for all analy tes will be listed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker variables
Patients’ biomarker status at baseline will be correlated with treatment effect in OS, PFS and 
response to explore which biol ogical targets may  be particularly  important in defining the 
appropriate therapeutic population for the agent. Biomarker anal yses and results will be 
provided in a separate report.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
PRO data as measured by  [CONTACT_20368] -C30 a nd EQ-5D will be anal yzed to assess 
differences in health -related Quality  of L ife (HRQoL )and health utility  values between 
treatment arms based on time -adjusted Area Under the Curve (AUC) using all available data.
The scoring of the PRO endpoints and hand ling of missing data will be detailed in the 
statistical analy sis plan. Summary  statistics will be presented for each of the PRO endpoints at 
each assessment time point and for change from baseline b y treatment group for both 
populations.
Primary  Anal ysis of PROs: If there is sufficient data, a n anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model will be used to compare the time -adjusted AUCs between the two treatment groups 
with covariates for baseline HRQoL score and the same stratification factors as used in the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint at the end of the stud y for both populations. L east-squares mean 
estimates; standard errors and 95% CIs will be estimated for each treatment group and for the 
treatment group difference for both populations . The treatm ent b y covariate interactions will 
be explored in the ANCOVA models and the consistency  of the treatment effect on HRQoL 
across different subsets defined by [CONTACT_23655]. In the event that the ANCOVA model assumptions (e.g., normality  and homogenous variance of the error

analysis of covariance may  be used (30, 31 ).
Secondary  Anal yses of PROs: Sensitivity  analysis using different imputation methods for 
imputing missing assessments may  be performed. Additional exploratory  analy ses may  be 
carried out using the linear mixed effect models to explore the effects of treatment, time and 
other covariates on the endpo ints, assuming the missing data mechanism is missing at random.

Phase 3.As a reference, the following details provide the number of patients originally 
planned for the entire study :
The determination of sample size contains two aspects: Phase 2and Phase 3 part of the stud y. 
The sample size for the Phase 2part of the study  (the first interim) is powered on ORR for 
FGFR positive PI K3CA and RAS WT population. The Phase 2part of the study  is designed 
to achieve 90% power to detect the difference in ORR between rogaratinib over 
chemotherap y in FGFR positive WT population with the assumption of 30% response rate in 
rogaratinib and 10% in chemotherapy . Assuming one -sided alpha of 0.1 for the P hase 2part, 
power of 90 %, and a randomization ratio of 1:1 between the rogaratinib and chemotherap y 
arms, a total of approximately  116 confirmed FGFR positive patients with wild- type PIK3CA 
and RAS biomarkers are required for the P hase 2part, based on Fisher’s exact test. 
The sample size for the Phase 3part of the study  is powered on the pr imary  efficacy  variable 
of OS for PIK3CA andRASWT population . The study  is designed to have 90% power to 
detect an approximately  40% increase in median OS (i.e. a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.72, 
rogaratinib over chemotherap y)for the WT population . Assuming one -sided alpha of 0.025
for the Phase 3part, power of 90%, and a randomization ratio of 1:1 between the rogaratinib
and chemotherap y arms for the WT population , and one futility  interim analy sis of OS 
(payinga slight alpha penalty  of 0.001) , a total of 390death events are requi red for the final 
OS analy sis. If the futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23573],the 
study  will continue after the second interim for the study  and the final OS anal ysis will be 
performed when approximately  390 death events are observed (see Table 10–1).
It is projected that 390death events will have accumulated approximately  43months after the 
start of randomization, assuming approximately  450 PIK3CA andRAS WTpatients are 
randomized for two treatment arms combined at a rate of 20 patients per month after an initial 
4-month ramp- up period for a 25-month long enrollment period, a dropout rate of 3%, 
exponentially  distributed event times for OS, and 7 and9.76 month median OS time for the 
chemotherap y and the rogaratinib arms, respectively . With the assumption that 75% of the 
patients in the all study  population are PI K3CA and RAS WT, roughly 600patients in all 
study  population will be randomized in the two tr eatment arms combined.

10.5 Planned interim analyses
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be instituted in order to ensure ongoing safet y of 
study  patients with respect to a risk/benefit assessment during periodic data review meetings, 
review results from the planned interim anal ysis and provide a formal recommendation for 
continuation/termination of the study  and monitor study  conduct to ensure the overall 
integrit y of trial in maintained .
Before achieving the criteria for the first interim analy sis, the study  recruitment was put on 
hold after a recommendation of the study  DMC. The sponsor decided to perform a full 
analysis and review of all study  data and stopped the recruitment permanently . 
Due to the stop of enrollment and full data analy sis, the study  will not move forward to its 
Phase [ADDRESS_22785] approximately  116
confirmed FGFR positive patients with wild -type PI K3CA and RAS biomarkers (58patients 
each arm) complete 4.5 months of treatment. The study  will continue with the Phase 3 part if 
the fisher’s exact test for ORR based on central review assessments for the first approximately  
116WT patients y ields a one -sided p- value less than 0.15. The second interim analy sis (Phase 
3 part) is planned when approximately  50% of the planned total number of required death 
events occurred in the WT subgroup (about 195 deaths in WT). The study  continues if the 
observed HR for OS in WT subgroup is less than 0.96 ( corresponding to greater than 4% 
improvement in OS for rogaratinib comparing to chemo), which is determined using O’Brien 
Fleming t ypeboundary  based on 195 death events. The actual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23574]. 
Please note in both interim analy ses, only  WT subgroup will be anal yzed and tested for 
futility . Anal yses in all study  population, as well as analy ses with additional efficacy  
endpoints (such as DoR, PFS, etc.if data warrants) beyond the ones mentioned above as 
futility  rules in both popul ations (defined earlier) will be performed and provided to DMC as 
supplemental information to assist decision making. 
Recommendation for trial continuation will be guided by [CONTACT_23656] y evaluations from all data review meetings according 
to the DMC charter. All anal yses to be presented to DMC to aid recommendations for trial 
continuation will be explicated in the DMC charter.
The DMC will be explicitly  asked to give re commendations on the continuation or 
termination of the trial. Decisions on trial termination, amendment or cessation of patient
recruitment based on risk benefit assessments will be made after recommendations from the 
DMC have been assessed by  [CONTACT_941] s ponsor .

The DMC is scheduled to receive the interim efficacy  and safety  data. Data which may  
compromise the integrity of the study  (e.g., comparative data) will be anal yzed and discussed 
only in the closed session of the DMC meetings. The closed session will be restricted to the 
DMC members and a non-voting and independent facilitator (a biostatistician from an 
independent statistical analy sis center). Closed session minutes will be maintained by  [CONTACT_23657]. All 
data provided to the DMC and all deliberations of the DMC will be privileged and confidential. DMC members will sign Confidentiality  Agreements prior to acceptance of 
participating on the DMC committee.

monitoring boundaries.In case of earl y termination of the study at either interim due to futility , all the anal yses 
specified (as appropriate) in Section 10.3 will be performed for the clinical study  report 
including all data available at the time of study  termination.

Limited data will be recorded for all patients in the FGFR testing period as described in Section 9.1. For patients not being eligible for randomization additional information is 
recorded: the reason for premature discontinuation and date of las t visit.
Source documentation
The site must implement processes to ensure availability  of all required source 
documentation. A source document checklist (not part of this protocol) will be used at the site 
to identify  the source data for key  data points collected and the monitor will work with the site 
to complete this.
It is the expectation of the sponsor that all data entered into the eCRF have source 
documentation available at the site. 
Data recorded from FGFR testing failures (pre-screening failures)
At minimum, the following data should be recorded in the e CRF for patient s who do not meet 
the eligibility  criteria during pre -screening :

not available )the corresponding AE and SAE have to be report ed and must be fully  
documented in the source data
End of FGFR testing period, primary  reason for discontinuation
Date of last visit 
Data recorded from main screen ingfailures 
At minimum the following data should be recorded in the eCRF for patients who do not meet 
the eligibility  criteria during screening :

Data recorded o f prior and concomitant medication
From signing of PI/ICF for study  treatment eligibility  up to [ADDRESS_22789] 
administration of study  treatment , all concomitant medications (including start/stop dates, 
dose, frequency , route of administration and indication) must be recorded in the patient’s 
source documentation, as well as on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. At the EOT visit and 
during active and long term follow- up periods , any  new systemic anti-cancer therapy  has to be 
reported. With regards to other concomitant medications, only  those that are administered to 
treat AEs related to study -specific procedures are mandatory  to be reported during active 
follow -up. Administration of contrast media for protocol-specified radiological procedures 
(CTscan or MRI) does not need to be reported on the concomitant medication e CRF page, 
unless there is an AE related to the contrast medium injection (e.g. allergic reaction).
11.2 Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s procedures, m onitors will 
contact [CONTACT_8977] y to review with the site staff the protocol, study 
requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethica l, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification and documentation of source data items.
Thesponsor /designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete.
Safety  and rights of patients are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
(including stud y treatment being used in accordance with the protocol)
Any other study  agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements are met.
Site completes all the logist ic and administration tasks required for efficient study  
conduct in a timely  manner.
The monitors will be guided by  [CONTACT_23660]/decrease dependent on the numbers of patients recruited at the site and
outstanding tasks that need completing at each site.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
11.3 Data processing
Data will be collected as describ ed in Section 11.1. Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s standards and data cleaning procedures. 
This is applicable for data recorded on eCRF as well as for data from other sources (e.g. IxRS, 
laboratory [FGFR test results] ).
For data coding (e.g. AEs, medication), internationally  recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.

After its initial release for anal ysis(i.e. locked database) , the clinical database is planned to be 
re-opened for the inclusion of additional data e.g. pharmacokinetic data, biomarker data . 
11.4 Missing data 
In order to achieve the goal of a well conducted clinical trial according to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP), every  effort should be made to resolve incomplete or missing dates during the 
course of the stud y (i.e. edit checks, data cleaning / monitoring etc.) . However, in rare 
circumstances, missing parts of either date of last contact [CONTACT_23661]
(SAP) .
Missing or unevaluable tumor assessments (includi ng a scheduled assessment that was not 
done and an incomplete assessment that does not result in an unambiguous tumor response 
according to RECI ST v.1.1) will not be used in the calculation of derived efficacy  variables 
related to tumor assessments unless a new lesion occurred or the lesions that were evaluated alread y showed progressive disease. No imputation will be performed for missing lesion 
assessment and tumor response. For example, if a patient misses a scan visit and PD is 
documented at the next available scan visit, the actual visit date of the first documented PDwill be used to calculate PFS.
Further information related to the handling of missing parts of a tumor assessment date or last 
contact / death date for the derivation of efficacy  endpoint s, such as overall survival and 
progression free survival, will be detailed in the SAP.
For handling of missings in the QoL  questionna ires, refer to the EORTC QLQ -C30 Scoring 
Manual (32)and the EuroQol EQ -5DUser Guide (33), respectivel y.
11.5 Audit and inspection
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality  assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study  site and of the stud y documents originating there. The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by r egulatory  health authority  representatives and IEC(s)/I RB(s) are 
possible. The investigator should notify  the sponsor immediately  of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may  occur at an y time during or after 
completion of the study .

the required period.
The investigator /institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change 
(e.g. relocation or transfer of ownership).
The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval.The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the stud y 
center.
12. Premature termination of the study
The sponsor has the right to close this study  (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof 
[e.g. treatment arms; dose steps; centers]) at an y time, which may be due but no t limited to the 
following reasons: 
If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
-Safety  findings from this study  (e.g. SAEs)
-Results of any  interim analy sis
- Results of parallel clinical studies-Results of parallel animal studies 
(on e.g. toxicity , teratogenicity , carcinogenicity  or reproduction toxicity ).
If the stud y conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data qualit y; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame.
Strat egic reasons (e.g. the clinical development of the drug is stopped) .
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consulta tion between involved pa rties. Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; 
head of stud y center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) m ust be 
returned to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In the event of a partial study  closure, ongoing patients, including tho se in post study  
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.
Details for individual patien t's withdrawal can be found in Section 6.4.1.

Lytic bone lesions, with an identifiable soft- tissue component, evaluated by  [CONTACT_23677] I
can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft -tissue component otherwise meets the 
definition of meas urability
Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable
Cystic lesions:
Lesions that meet radiographic criteria for simple cysts should not be considered 
malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable)
“Cystic lesions” thought to be cystic metastases c an be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they  meet the definition of measurabilit y. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in 
the same patients, these should be preferabl y selected for assessment
Lesions with prior local treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previousl y irradiated area, or in an area patiented to other 
loco- regional therap y, are usually  not considered measurable. Previously  treated lesions 
can onl y be selected as target lesions when they have progressed until baseline.
Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and mea sured at baseline 
(this means in instances where patients have onl y one or two organ sites involved a maximum 
of two and four lesions respectivel y will be recorded). Target lesions should be selected on 
the basis of their size (lesions with the longest dia meter), be representative of all involved

measured reproducibly  should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum dia meters. If ly mph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension ofthe disease.
Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes (with short axis 
≥10mmand < 15 mm) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded 
at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). I n addition, it is 
possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the 
case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic l ymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
Best Response: The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study  treatme nt until the end of treatment. The patient’s best overall response assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. While some non -target lesions may  actuall y be 
measurable, they  need not be measured and instead should be assessed only  qualitativel y at 
the time points specified in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non -
target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological l ymph nodes 
(whe ther target or non -target) must have decreased in size to have a short axis of < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study . 
Non-CR/Non -PD ( to be used for patients with non -target lesions onl y): Persistence of one or 
more non- target le sion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ).In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. For non -target lesions, unequivocal progression (see 
comments below) of existing lesions represents progressive diseas e.(Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
Lym ph nodes identified as target lesions should alway s have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination) , 
even if the nodes re gress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when ly mph nodes are

included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response 
criteria are met, since a normal ly mph node is defined as having a short ax is of <10mm.
To achieve unequivocal progression in patients with measurable disease on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target dise ase, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficientl y to merit discontinuation of therap y. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 
one or more non -target lesions is usually  not sufficient to qualify  for unequivocal.
In the absence of measurable disease, the same general concepts appl y here as noted above.

Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported a s “symptomatic deterioration”. Every 
effort should be made to do cument the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.
Response duration
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectivel y documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded on study ).
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectivel y documented.
Stable disease duration
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression a re 
met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is 
the reference for calculation of PD).

Computed tomograph y (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)-CT and MR I might be the 
best currentl y available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions sel ected for 
response assessment. As a general rule, the minimum size of a measur able lesion at baseline 
should be no less than double the slice thickness and also have a minimum size of [ADDRESS_22826], abdomen and pelvis. Head & neck and extremities usually  require 
specific protocols.
Ultrasound –Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entiret y for 
independent review at a later date and, because they  are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed th at the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next. I f new lesions are identified by  [CONTACT_12153] , confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about the radiation exposure at CT, MR Imay be 
used instead of CT in selected instances. Tumor markers: tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they  must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in co mplete response. 
When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. angiogenesis inhibitors), the cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.

16.4 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculation
In accordance with established nephrology  practice and guidelines, renal function at baseline 
and throughout the study  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_23640] 
(GFR), calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study  
abbreviated formula.
This equation of 4 variables (serum creatinine level [SCR], age, sex, and race) is 
recommended b y the National Kidney  Foundation for use in individuals 18 y ears or older.
The GFR calculator can be fo und at the following website ( 36): 
http://www.kidney .org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.
NOTE: This equation should be used only  with those creatinine methods that have not been 
recalibrated to be traceable to isotope dilution mass spectroscop y (IDMS).
The above result should be multiplied by 1.212 for African- Americans and by  1.227 for 
Chinese (mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong). Due to the lack of confirmed information on Korean patients the results for these patients will not be multiplied by  [CONTACT_23678] (37).

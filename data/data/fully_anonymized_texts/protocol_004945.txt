2. INTRODUCTION  
 
Intracranial aneurysms are a significant health problem in the [LOCATION_002] with 
an estimated 1% to 6% of the adult population harboring cerebral aneurysms.1,[ADDRESS_1022715] intracranial aneurysm is estimated to be 
approximately 1.9%.2 If an intracranial aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the 
highly sensitive subarachnoid space around the brain, resulting in a subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH). SAH is known to be a major risk factor for a stroke due to the 
irritation of the outer layer of the nearby [CONTACT_579309].  
This condition is associated with a high rate of mortality; close to half of ruptured 
aneurysms result i n death within six months.2-4 Patients who survived the initial 
SAH are at significant risk of subsequent re -rupture.  Various reports indicate that 
if left untreated, there is a re -bleeding rate of more than 50% within the first six 
months from initial pr esentation of a SAH.4,5 
 
Even if an intracranial aneurysm does not rupture, it can lead to severe 
complications.  As the aneurysm grows, it can press on nerves, put pressure on 
brain tissue, or interfere  with other arteries or veins. Blindness, paralysis, and 
other morbidities often result.  Thrombus can also form within the aneurysmal sac, 
break off, travel downstream , and cause an ischemic stroke.  It has been reported 
that 2.2% to 23% of patients with unruptured aneurysms may eventually 
experience a ruptur e.7,8 The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial 
Aneurysms evaluated the natural history of 1,937 unruptured aneurysms in 1,449 
patients with a mean follow -up of 8.3 years.8 It reported that 2.2% of these 
patients had a confirmed rupture during fol low-up, but 66% of them were fatal.  
Juvela et al. reported on the long term natural history of unruptured intracranial 
aneurysms in a series of 142 patients.7 With a median follow -up of 19.7 years, 
23% of the patients experienced a SAH, which corresponds to an annualized rate 
of 1.3%. The cumulative rate of SAH tended to increase with time, with a rupture 
rate of 10.5% at 10 years, 23% at 20 years, and 30.3 % at 30 years after diagnosis. 
Approximately half of the  SAH patients did not survive. Thus, regardle ss of the 
rate of occurrence, fatality associated with this event is high in this cohort.7, 8 
 
Prior to 1995, the traditional treatment for intracranial aneurysms was surgical 
clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], in which the skull is surgically opened so metal clips can be applied to 
the aneurysm’s neck to occlude it from the parent artery to prevent a rupture.1 
This treatment, while effective, is high risk, highly invasive, requires an extended 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579301], and is technically difficult to perform in certain regions of 
the brain (such as the posterior circulation).  Thus, this treatment modality is not a 
viable option for a significant number of patients, particularly during the acute 
phase of SAH, when the presence of cerebral edema and evolving thrombi 
formation render a neurysm  access  difficult, if not impossible.  
  
In the early 1990’s, an endovascular treatment technique for intracranial 
aneurysms was first introduced by [CONTACT_579310], who used electrolytically 
detachable platinum coils to pack and embolize the aneurys mal sac.9, 10 The 
 
Penumbra Coil System  
CLP 4492.D  Confidential     Page 6 of 18 
rationale was to exclude the aneurysm from the circulation and thus reduce the 
risk of a rupture and SAH.  The Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) was not 
universally accepted at first but gained significant  credibility after obtaining 
approv al from the FDA for the intracranial aneurysm indication.  Moreover, a few 
well-conducted, prospective, randomized studies of both ruptured and unruptured 
aneurysms have demonstrated that angiographic and clinical outcomes from this 
treatment modality were  equivalent, if not better, than those obtained from 
surgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].6,8,11,[ADDRESS_1022716] important landmark study was the International 
Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) in which a total of 2,143 patients with 
ruptured intracranial aneurysms were randomized to either neurosurgical clippin g 
or endovascular GDC coiling. The results showed that at one year follow -up, 
30.6% of the patients treated by [CONTACT_579311][INVESTIGATOR_747456]. 23.7% of those treated by [CONTACT_579312], which resulted 
in a risk reduction rate of 22.6%. And thus, embolic coiling has now become the 
standard of c are worldwide for endovascular occlusion for both incidental and 
ruptured intracranial aneurysms.   
 
In light of the natural history of the disease, the primary focus for management of 
an intracranial aneurysm must be to prevent its rupture and sequelae.   
 
The Penumbra Coil 400 (PC 400)  System is a new generation of detachable coils 
developed by [CONTACT_747462].  It has recently received the CE Mark in Europe  and 
is 510k cleared in the U.S . This coil system is  specifically designed to promote 
aneurysm healing that is equivalent to standard platinum coils.  This System 
consist s of: an implantable Coil attached to a Detachment Pusher as well as a 
Detachment Handle. The Detachment Pusher is comprised of a shaft wi th a 
radiopaque positioning marker, a Distal Detachment Tip, and a pull wire.  The 
Detachment Handle is used to detach the Coil Implant from the Detachment 
Pusher. The P C [ADDRESS_1022717] 
received appropriate training in interventional radiology.   
  
The Penumbra Embolization Coil is indicated for the endovasc ular embolization 
of aneurysms.  The Embolization Coil functions to selectivel y embolize aneurysms 
by [CONTACT_579315] a sufficient quantity of soft platin um coils to achieve occlusion. The 
Coil Implant  is constructed of 92% Platinum and 8% Tungsten round wire with a 
diameter appr oximately 0.0015in ± 0.0001in. The maximum primary diameter is  
0.022in and the coil implant will have a semi -spherical atraumatic distal tip.  
 
The Coil Implant is available in a standard Frame  configuration, a soft Fill 
configuration, a Soft Fill/Finish  configuration, and a n Extra S oft Fill/ Finish  
configuration.   
 
 
Penumbra Coil System  
CLP 4492.D  Confidential     Page [ADDRESS_1022718] allow for atraumatic interaction with the aneurysm wall.  
 
The Fill Coil Implant has a three dimensional complex shape that conforms to the 
size and shape of empty space within an aneurysm.  The Fill Coil Implant is 
available in sizes to treat aneurysms in the 3-24mm diameter range. The Fill Coil 
Implant’s stiffness must allow for atraumati c interaction with the aneurysm wall. 
The distal -most loop of a Fill Coil Implant is sized to prevent the coil from 
herniating into the parent vessel.  
 
The Soft Fill/ Finish  Coil Implant is a straight coil that will allow it to conform to 
empty space withi n an aneurysm with no preferential shape. The Soft Fill/Finish  
Coil Implant has a J-shaped tip to allow for atraumatic interaction with an 
aneurysm and its stiffness must allow for atraumatic interaction with the 
aneurysm wall. The Soft Fill/Finish  Coil Im plant fill s small empty pockets within 
an aneurysm .   
 
The Extra S oft Fill/Finish Coil Implant is either a helical shape  or complex shape  
coil that will allow it to conform to empty space within an aneurysm. The Extra 
Soft Fill/Finish  Coil Implant’s stiffness allow s for atraumatic interaction with  the 
aneurysm wall.

a copy is provided to the patient or legally authorized representative.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1022734] -market single center experience  is to determine 
the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra Coil System in a cohort of patients 
treated for intracranial aneurysm .   
 
Approximately 2,000 patients will be enrolled.  With this sample size the 
precision is greater than ± 2.5% for the procedural device -related serious adverse 
event rate based on a binomial 95% confidence interval. Hence , the sample size 
provides a sufficient level of precision for the primary endpoint.  
 
This study is a single -treatment design.  Hence, descriptive statis tics will provide 
a basis for the majority of the analyses with a 95% two -sided confidence interval 
presented.  For binary outcomes, the 95% two -sided confidence intervals will be 
calculated using exact binomial intervals.  For numeric measures, a confidenc e 
bound for the mean or mean change from admission will be constructed.  
 
Standard descriptive statistics for categorical endpoints will be the number and 
percent of patients with each level of the endpoint.  For numeric endpoints, the 
standard descriptive statistics include the number of missing observations (n), the 
mean, the median, the standard deviation, the minimum value, and the maximum 
value.  
 
Results collected at multiple visits will be summarized at each visit  for which they 
are collected. Summarie s for all measures will include all observed data for each 
visit.  
  
9.2 Safety  
 
All serious adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_747468]. Events will also be reported by 
[CONTACT_747469]. The denominator for the analyses is all 
enrolled patients.  
 
The proportion of deaths for any reason through one year follow up  will be 
calculated and a 95% confidence interval will be presented.  The cause of death 
and tim e-to-death will be summar ized. The proportion of patients with 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage will be summarized and reported.

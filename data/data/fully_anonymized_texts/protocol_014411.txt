4 1.0 SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor:  Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  
Product:  CF102 
Study Title:  
CF102- 201HCC: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- Controlled Study of the 
Efficacy and Safety of CF102 in the Second -Line Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma in Subjects with Child -Pugh Class B Cirrhosis 
Estimated N umber of Trial Centers:  
Multicenter, up to 22-24 sites in 5 countries 
Phase of Development : 2 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this trial is to:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of orally administered CF102 25 mg twice daily (BID) as compared to 
placebo, as determined by [CONTACT_761831] (OS), when used as second -line therapy in 
subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child -Pugh Class B (CPB) 
cirrhosis.  
The secondary objectives of this trial are to:  
• Evaluat e other indicators of efficacy of CF102 as compared to placebo, including time to 
progression (TTP), progression- free survival (PFS), objective response (OR) rate, and 
disease control (DC) rate in this population; 
• Explore exposure-response relationships using sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling; 
• Characterize the safety profile of CF102 in subjects with advanced HCC and CPB cirrhosis; 
• Characterize the effects of CF102 on laboratory parameters associated with viral hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction, and cirrhos is; and  
• Explore the relationship between white blood cell (WBC) adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) 
expression  and clinical response. 
Methods:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial in subjects with 
advanced HCC and CPB  cirrhosis who did not tolerate prior sorafenib therapy or experienced 
disease progression on prior sorafenib therapy. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
CF102 as compared to placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:[ADDRESS_1043173] 
experiences unacceptable drug -related intolerability ( Section 8.2). Subjects will return for a 
follow-up visit [ADDRESS_1043174] dose of study drug, and every attempt will be 
made to obtain survival data on all randomized subjects. Subjects who discontinue will be 
followed indefinitely for survival status. 
Once the requisite number of even ts ha s occurred and the blind is opened for analysis of the trial 
results, any surviving  subjects who remain on blinded drug will be offered the opportunity to 
continue dosing with open- label CF102 25 mg BID indefinitely, following the protocol -specified 
schedule of events ( Table 1 –2). 
Number of Subjects Planned:  
Approximately 78 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CF102 
or matching placebo.

Eligibility Criteria for Open Label 
• The subject signed the ICF for the Open Label treatment. 
• The subject received double blind treatment with CF102/placebo and is still taking the 
investigational medication when Amendment [ADDRESS_1043179], Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
CF102 is a small molecule agonist of the A 3AR. Study drug  will be supplied in child - and 
tamper -resistant bottles as hard capsules containing either 25 mg of CF102  or matching placebo . 
CF102 or placebo will be self -administered  orally BID on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 
2 hours after meals) beginning on Day 1 of the trial and thereafter at approximately the same 
times each day of the 28 -day cycle.  
Dosing Interruptions  and Reductions:  
In the case of any Grade [ADDRESS_1043180] “possibly” drug-related, the dose of study drug  will be interrupted for up to 7 days. If 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
8 toxicity does not resolve to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_1043181] will be discontinued from 
treatment. If toxicity does resolve to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_1043182] “possibly”  drug-related, the dose of study drug will be 
withdrawn permanently. 
Only [ADDRESS_1043183] “possibly” drug- related occurs upon re -challenge at the reduced dose, 
study drug dosing will be withdrawn permanently. 
Duration of Treatment:  
Each treatment cycle will be [ADDRESS_1043184] experiences unacceptable drug -related intolerability.  
Once the requisite number of event s has occurred and the blind is opened for analysis of the trial 
results,  any surviving  subjects who remain on blinded drug will be offered the opportunity to 
continue dosing with open- label CF102 25 mg BID indefinitely, following the protocol -specified 
schedule of events ( Table 1 –2). 
Criteria for Evalua tion: 
Efficacy : 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be OS, defined as  the number of days from first dose to death 
due to any cause. Secondary endpoints to be evaluated are TTP, PFS, OR rate consisting of 
Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) for subjects who enter the trial with 
measurable disease by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 , and DC rate which includes  both subjects who experience 
OR as well as those who experience S table Disease (SD). Survival status will be assessed 
continuously. Tumor status will be assessed at the Pre- Study Visit and every 8 weeks thereafter 
(i.e., at the end of even- numbered cycles) by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix A , [Eisenhauer 2009 as 
modified by [CONTACT_761834] 2013]).  
Alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) levels will be asse ssed at baseline and every [ADDRESS_1043185], bilirubin, and albumin levels, prothrombin time ( PT), and International Normal ized Ratio 
(INR), will be assessed every cycle. W here applicable, viral load measurements will be 
performed every odd- numbered  cycle.  WBC  A
3AR expression  will be assessed at baseline and, 
unless waived by [CONTACT_1034], every odd- numbered cycle (at selected sites only).  
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
9 Safety:  
Assessments of adverse events (AEs) will include characterization of the type, incidence, 
severity (graded by [CONTACT_3989] v 4.0), seriousness, and relationship to treatment . Changes in  vital 
signs , laboratory parameters  including thyroid functions, electrocardiograms (ECG), physical 
examinations , and ECOG PS from baseline will be assessed . 
Pharmacokinetics:  
CF102 concentrations will be determined from EDTA plasma samples obtained on Day 1 of 
Cycle s 1 and 2, as well as  from trough samples on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. A composite PK 
profile  following the morning dose of the BID regimen will be generated for subjects receiving 
CF102 treatment. 
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample S ize: 
Approximately 78 subjects will be enrolled during an accrual period estimated to be 
approximately 78 weeks (18 months) in duration and randomized to either CF102 or placebo 
using a 2:[ADDRESS_1043186] ratio of 0.5, 75 events will provide 80% power for 
the logrank test at level 0.05. 
General  Considerations: 
Time to event variables will be summarized  using the number observed, number censored, 
median, and 25th and 75th percentiles from Kaplan -Meier curves . Continuous variables will be 
summarized using number of subjects  (n), mean , median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum. Categorical  variables  will be summarized using frequencies and percentages . 
Efficacy Analyses : 
Between -treatment comparisons with respect to OS, TTP, and PFS will be performed using 
logrank tests, with Cox’s proportional hazards regression model used for secondary analyses to assess the impact of covariates. Tumor lesion measurements and changes from baseline will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_761835].  Objective response rates and DC rates will be presented and 
between -treatment compari sons will be performed using the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution by [CONTACT_761836] -numbered cycle. Between -treatment 
comparisons with respect to AFP will be performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) 
with the baseline value used as a covariate and frequencies of subjects with AFP levels <20, 20-
200, or >200 ng/mL will be presented by [CONTACT_761837]. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
PK analysis will include population PK analysis bas ed on sparse sampling, and the estimation of 
Cmax, Cmin and AUC (0-12h) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2; and trough plasma levels on Days 8 and 15 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
10 of Cycle 1. Exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate the relationship between these PK 
parameters  and WBC  A3 receptor expression and clinical responses to CF102. 
Safety Analyses:  
Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects receiving at least 1 dose of CF102 or 
matching placebo. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570], rela tionship to study drug, and severity. AEs will be coded 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ™) terminology. Listings of 
subjects who experienced dosing interruptions  and dose reductions, withdrawal due to an AE, 
serious AEs and/or death will be presented. Laboratory parameters , other than Liver Chemistry 
Tests (see below),  INR, and viral load, will be summarized using descriptive statistics and data 
listings of clinically significant abnormalities. Liver Chemistry Tests,  INR, and viral  load will be 
presented as exploratory efficacy variables. Vital signs, ECOG PS, physical examination, and 
ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_761838].  
Exploratory Analyses: 
Certain l aboratory parameters associated with hepatic dysfunction and cirrhosis  will be 
examined. These include: Chemistry ( bilirubin [direct and total], ALT, AST, and albumin, 
referred to collectively as “Liver Chemistry Tests”); INR; and v iral load. These parameters  will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics and clinically significant abnormalities  will be listed. 
Additionally, between -treatment comparisons will be performed using ANCOVA with the 
baseline value used as a covariate. The relationship between WBC  A3AR expression and clinical 
response will be assessed by [CONTACT_761839] (CFB) in A
3AR expression  categorized as less than or at least the median 
by [CONTACT_99432].

22 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Overview of CF102 
CF102 is a synthetic ribose -based purine nucleoside with adenosine A3 receptor (A 3AR) 
selectivity. CF102 selectivity for the A 3AR is 4750- fold over A 1AR and 1770- fold over A 2AR. 
The A 3AR is overexpressed in the tumor and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  CF102, an A 3AR agonist, inhibits tumor cel l 
growth by [CONTACT_761840] -κB and the Wnt signaling 
pathways ( Olah , 1995; Bar-Yehuda, 2008; Fishman, 2002a ; Fishman, 2002b; Fishman, 2003; 
Fishman, 2004; Madi, 2003; Ohana, 2003 ). A 3AR agonists also stimulate natural killer cells in 
vivo, which further potentiates the antitumor activity of this class of compounds ( Fishman 2000; 
Fishman 2002a; Fishman 2002b; Madi 2003; Bar -Yehuda, 2002; Bar-Yehuda, 2007). 
A3AR expression is also elevated in PBMC isolated from patients with hepatitis C viral (HCV) 
infections. HCV infection is associated with elevated and persistent NF -κB levels that inhibit 
apoptosis of the infected cell s and lead to chronic HCV infection. The observation that CF102 
inhibits the replication of HCV in a culture system assay using human hepatoma Huh- 7 cells 
transfected with HCV plasmid (JFH -1wt HCV) suggests that CF102 and other A 3AR agonists 
may provide new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_761818]. In addition, CF102 acts as a protective agent 
against liver damage in acute hepatitis, isc hemia and partial hepatectomy. These findings suggest 
a role for CF102 in preventing liver tissue damage associated wit h HCV in fections and hepatitis. 
CF102 is a relatively low clearance compound in nonclinical species suggesting that there is little 
first pass effect and that absorption is the major limiting factor that dictates bioavailability. 
Plasma protein binding of CF102 is  high, gr eater than 99% in all species. Studies with human 
hepatic microsomes indicate that drug -drug interactions related to CF102 inhibition of 
cytochrome p450 metabolism are unlikely to occur. 
CF102, given orally, induced a marked inhibitory effect on the growth of N1S1 HCC in an 
orthotopic model in rats. The drug was also efficacious in inhibiting the development of 
xenografted Hep -3B tumors inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice. 
CF102 has a favorable safety profile in nonclinical toxicology testing. I n safety pharmacology 
studies, there were no adverse effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_761819]. In monkeys, 60 mg/kg was associated with increased heart rate and 300 mg/kg caused 
increased heart weight in rats, likely seco ndary to increased heart rate. No toxicity was identified 
at 1000 or 300 mg/kg in 14- day toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, respectively. Higher doses

23 in monkeys were not tolerated and were associated with decreased food consumption and 
vomiting.  
CF102 was not genotoxic in the Ames, mouse lymphoma, and mouse micronucleus assays. 
4.2 Previous Human Experience with CF102 
4.2.1 Phase 1 Trial in Normal Volunteers (CF102-101) 
A Phase 1 randomized, dose -escalation trial was conducted in 25 male normal volunteers. Single 
doses of CF102 as high as 40 mg were not associated with intolerability, clinically important 
AEs, or changes in electrocardiograms (ECG) or laboratory assessments [data on file]. 
Absorption of CF102 following oral administration of 1, 3, 10, [ADDRESS_1043211] cohort (40 mg). CF102 showed good oral 
bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics ( PK) behavior. Single - and repeated -dose plasma 
concentrations of the drug were dose -proportionate. Decline of CF102 plasma concentration was 
at a moderate rate, with mean half -life estimates consistently ranging between ~11 and ~12 hours 
at all doses.  
Increases in C max and AUC values were dose -related up to a 20 mg dose. However, the mean 
Cmax and mean AUC (0-t) with the [ADDRESS_1043212] reached a plateau between 20 mg and 40 mg. Pharmacokine tics parameters are summarized in Table 4 -1 below.

24 4.2.2 Phase 1/2 Trial in Subjects with HCC (Study CF102 -102HCC) 
An open- label trial was conducted in 19 subjects with advanced unresectable HCC to evaluate 
the safety and PK profile of CF102 given orally (1, 5, and 25 mg BID) in 28 -day cycles  
(Stemmer, 2013). Evaluation of the antitumor effects and the utilization of A 3AR as a biological 
predictive marker of response to CF102 were secondary objectives.  
CF102 demonstrated good oral bioavailability and linear PK behavior in subjects with Child -
Pugh A and B hepatic dysfunction. The  best response by [CONTACT_761841] 5/17 
subjects (29.4%). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.[ADDRESS_1043213] that 63% of the subject populati on had disease 
progression on sorafenib and that, for these subjects, CF102 tre atment was second -line therapy.  
The most common adverse events (all causalities combined) were decreased appetite (52.6%); 
fatigue (42.1%); abdominal pain, constipation, and dia rrhea (31.6% each); ascites and pyrexia 
(26.3% each); and nausea, asthenia, back pain, and pain in extremity (21.1% each). CF102-
related AEs included fatigue (26.3%), asthenia and decreased appetite (21.1% each), and pyrexia 
and constipation (15.8% each). Grade 3  drug-related AEs included: cerebral hemorrhage, 
headache, hyponatraemia, fatigue, asthenia, and back pain. One death (5.3%) due to cerebral hemorrhage was judged possibly related to CF102 by [CONTACT_737]. SAEs with fatal outcomes 
in [ADDRESS_1043214] on 
normal liver tissue in an experimental model of liver inflammation ( Cohen, 2011) , and suggest 
that CF102 could be used in patients with cirrhosis and/or hepatic impairment.  The highest dose 
tested of [ADDRESS_1043215] frequently diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, and is the second 
leading cause of cancer -related death in the world ( Jemal, 2011) . In women, it is the seventh 
most commonly diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death s. In the United 
States, live r cancer is the ninth leading cause of cancer death ( Altekruse, 2009) . The number of 
deaths per year in HCC is virtually identical to the incidence throughout the world (between 
250,000 and 1 million cases annually), underscori ng the high case fatality rate of this aggressive 
disease (Jemal, 2011). Almost 80 percent of cases are due to underlying chronic hepatitis B and 
C virus infection ( Perz, 2006). 
Treatments for HCC can be divided into those delivered with the intention to cure and those that 
are palliative and/or delay disease progression. Surgery and transplantation have the potential to cure the disease, but they are generally offered to only 30- 40% of patients at early stages of the 
disease. There is no accepted standard treatment for advanced HCC. Palliative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_761820], transarterial chemoembolization, and chemotherapy. None of these treatments have been shown to improve survival. 
The Child- Pugh classification s ystem is used to assess the severity of liver disease, the prognosis, 
and the appropriate treatment. A Child- Pugh score of 5 -6 is considered Class A (well -
compensated disease); a score of 7 -9 is Class B (significant functional compromise); and a score 
of 10- 15 is Class C (decompensated disease).  
Sorafenib (Nexavar
®) is a new oral drug indicated for advanced HCC in patients with 
unresectable liver cancer.  A randomized controlled trial comparing sorafenib to placebo in 
patients with advanced HCC and Child- Pugh Class A disease found that median survival and 
time to progression were nearly 3 months longer for patients treated with sorafenib compared to 
placebo (SHARP trial ( Llovet, 2008) . The median overall survival was 10.[ADDRESS_1043216] Child-
Pugh Class B (CPB) or Child -Pugh Class C cirrhosis . 
4.4 Rationale for Amendment 5 
Amendment 5 implements the transition to open -label (OL) dosing for patients who are 
surviving and remain on drug at the time of analysis; and establishes the assessments and 
schedule of visits for the OL dosing aspect of the trial. This includes defining the OL eligibility 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
26 criteria; detailing the visit and assessment schedule; and specifying  that the only patients still on 
treatment in  this trial at the time of this amendment are in Romania. 
An ancillary change has been made to remove reference to the Modified Intent to Treat (MITT) 
Population, as such an analysis is deemed to be non- contributory to trial objectives.  
4.5 Potential Risks and Benefits of Therapy  
4.5.1 Risks  
Adverse events observed during CF102 therapy in the CF102- 102HCC trial  included the 
following: 
• Most common AEs (4 or more occurrences, all causalities combined): abdominal pain, 
ascites, diarrhea, edema, fatigue, fever, lack of appetite, pain, and weakness.  
• AEs considered possibly or probably related to CF102: pain in various bodily locations, fatigue, diarrhea, lack of appetite, weakness, and fever.  
• Of the [ADDRESS_1043217] possibly related to CF102. 
For additional information, please refer to the Investigator Brochure. 
4.5.2 Potential Benefits  
Previous experience has shown that the OS for Child-Pugh Class B patients with HCC is in the 
range of 3.5–5.5 months ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_61813], 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_61813], 2011; Hollebecque, 2011). More importantly, data 
emerging from a number of recent trials have indicated that the median OS for patients with CPB 
and HCC who have failed treatment wi th sorafenib is generally no more than 2 months 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_61813],  2009; Wörns, 2009; Kim, 2011; Hollebecque, 2011; Abou- Alfa, 2011; Chiu, 2012; 
Køstner, 2013; Pressiani, 2013; Zugazagoitia, 2013). 
Considering that Child -Pugh Class B pa tients with HCC have few available treatment options, 
and that these patients  when treated with sorafenib generally have poor outcomes with very 
limited OS due to underlying liver dysfunction, CF102 may offer a therapeutic option for this 
sub-population of  patient s. CF102 has the further advantage of lacking, to date, any evidence of 
hepatotoxicity, making it highly suitable for use in patients with CPB cirrhosis.

27 5.0 TRIAL  OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this trial is to:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of orally administered CF102 25 mg BID as compared to placebo, as 
determined by [CONTACT_761831] (OS), when used as second- line therapy in subjects with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child -Pugh Class B (CPB) cirrhosis. 
The secondary objectives of this trial are to:  
• Evaluate other indicators of efficacy of CF102 as compared to placebo, including time to progression (TTP), progression- free survival (PFS), objective response (OR) rate, and 
disease control (DC) rate in this population; 
• Explore the exposure-response relationships of oral CF102 using sparse PK sampling; 
• Characterize the safety profile of CF102 in subjects with advanced HCC and CPB cirrhosis; 
• Characterize the effects of CF102 on laboratory parameters associated with viral hepatitis, 
hepatic dysfunction, and cirrhosis ; and  
• Explore the relationship between white blood cell (WBC)  adenosine A
3 receptor (A 3AR) 
expression and clinical response. 
6.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Trial  Design and Plan Description  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with 
advanced HCC and CPB cirrhosis  who did not tolerate prior sorafenib therapy or experienced 
disease progression on prior sorafenib therapy. 
The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CF102 as co mpared to placebo. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with oral doses of either CF102 25 mg  capsules  or 
matching placebo capsules administered twice daily ( BID) for consecutive, 28- day cycles. 
Treatment will continue until the s ubject experiences unacceptable drug -related intolerability.  
Subjects who discontinue will be followed indefinitely for survival status. The primary efficacy endpoint will be OS , defined as the number of days from first dose to death 
due to any cause . Seco ndary endpoints to be evaluated are TTP, PFS, OR  rate (consisting of 
Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in subjects who enter with measurable 
disease by [CONTACT_393] v1.1), and DC rate which includes subjects with  OR as well as those with  
Stable Dis ease (SD) . Survival status  will be assessed continuously. Tumor status will be assessed 
at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter (i.e., at the end of even -numbered cycles) by [CONTACT_33456] (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  according to RECIST v1.1 criteria 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
28 as modified by [CONTACT_761834] (2013)  (Appendix A ). Alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) levels will be assessed at 
baseline and every [ADDRESS_1043218], bilirubin, and 
albumin levels ; PT; and INR, will be assessed every cycle where applicable . Hepatitis B 
and/or C v iral load measurements will be perform ed every odd-numbered cycle.  White  blood cell 
A3AR expression will be assessed at baseline and, unless waived by [CONTACT_1034], every odd -
numbered cycle (at selected sites only).  Sparse PK blood samples on Day [ADDRESS_1043219] survival data.  
Once the requisite number of events ha s occurred and the blind is opened for analysis of the trial 
results, any surviving  subjects who remain on blinded drug will be offered the opportunity to 
continue dosing with open- label CF102 25 mg BID indefinitely, following the protocol -specified 
schedule of events ( Table 1 –2). 
6.[ADDRESS_1043220] for Phase 2 trials of new drug 
treatments for HCC ( Llovet, 2008; Thomas, 2010).  
Randomizing subjects in a 2:1 ratio ensures that 67% of subjects will receive t he active agent, 
thus decreasing the number of subjects receiving placebo from that for a balanced randomization. 
Because overall survival is the primary endpoint of the trial, the potential impact of unintentional 
unblinding is considered to be minimal.

29 6.3 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 78 subjects  will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_1043221] accrual period is estimated to be approximately 102 weeks (~24 months)  in duration. 
Each treatment cycle wi ll be [ADDRESS_1043222] experiences unacceptable drug -related intolerability  (Section 8.2).  
The post- accrual treatment per iod will continue until a total of [ADDRESS_1043223] died. 
Once the requisite number of events ha s occurred and the blind is opened for analysis of the trial 
results, any surviving  subjects who remain on blinded drug will be offered the opportunity to 
conti nue dosing with open- label CF102 25 mg BID indefinitely, following the protocol -specified 
schedule of events ( Table 1 –2).

47 Disease parameters to be assessed:  
• Diagnostic imaging/measurement of target  lesions 
• Response assessment  
10.1.1 Disease Classification  
Details of the primary diagnosis should be docu mented at the Pre- Study Visit. The histological/ 
cytological type (if known) and stage of disease should be noted on the CRF. 
10.1.2 Diagnostic Imaging/Measurement of Target  Lesions 
Subjects should be followed with the same imaging procedure (CT scan o r MRI) throughout  this 
trial. I f PD is documented at any time, no further imaging or lesion measurements will be 
required . Diagnostic studies documenting response must be available for Sponsor review.  
10.1.3 Response Assessment  
Response will be assessed as detailed in Appendix A . Efficacy will be assessed for the Intent -to-
Treat (ITT) Population ( Section 12.3.2).  
10.2 Time to Event  
The time to event assessments include OS, TTP, and PFS. Overall Survival (OS) is the number 
of days from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to the day of death+1, where a death can be due to any cause. 
Subjects who discontinue will be followed indefinitely to obtain survival status. Time to Progression (TTP) is the number of days from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to the day of PD +1. Progression -
Free Survival is the number of days from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to the day of death or PD +1. 
10.3 Laboratory Assessments for Exploratory Efficacy

in a - 20°C freezer may be permitted.  
The complete procedure is detailed in the laboratory manual provided by [CONTACT_2237].  
11.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
11.1 Safety Parameters  
Safety parameters assessed throughout the trial  include ECOG performance status; vital signs; 
weight; physical examinations; laboratory parameters; ECG; concomitant me dications, and 
adverse events. Any clinically significant change from baseline in a laboratory parameter will be 
reported as an AE. Liver Chemistry Tests,  INR, and viral load will be presented as exploratory 
efficacy variables, as will WBC  A3AR expression. 
Anticipated toxicities that may occur with CF102 are detailed in Section 4.4 of this protoc ol as 
well as in the Investigator Brochure (IB).  
11.[ADDRESS_1043267], will be reported beginning with the Cycle 1 Day 1  (Baseline) Visit. Final saf ety 
evaluations will be performed at the 28- day Follow -Up Visit (28 ± [ADDRESS_1043268] End of Dosing) / 
OL Follow-U p Visit (28 ± [ADDRESS_1043269] OL End of Dosing) . If the subject begins an alternative 
treatment, then the Follow -Up visit will be performed as soon as possible. Every effort will be 
made to obtain and record survival information for each subject, who will be followed indefinitely for survival with, for example, monthly telephone calls. 
If an observed toxicity thought to be at least possibly related to study drug has not resolved by 
[CONTACT_941] 28- Day Follow -Up Visit/ OL Follow -Up Visit , the subject will continue to be followed until 
the event has resolved or stabilized. 
11.3 Safety Data Review During the Trial  
The M edical Monitor will review safety data on an ongoing basis throughout the trial. 
• All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the SAE ( Section 11.5).  
• Adverse events resulting in a subject’s permanent discontinuation from the trial, regardless 
of seriousness or relationship to study drug, must be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 
• The AE pages of each subject’s CRF must be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or 
designee within 2 weeks of each visit. 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
50 Availability of these data will also enable the Sponsor to notify other participating trial  centers 
and regulatory authorities of events occurring during the trial. 
Safety d ecisions will be documented and communicated in writing to sites.  
11.4 Adverse Event Definitions/Reporting Requirements  
11.4.1 Adverse Event  
An AE  (also known as an “adverse experience”) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considere d drug related (CFR 
312.32). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug, without any 
judgment about causality. 
All clinical AEs n oted during the trial  will be reported on the appropriate AE page of the CRF  
(paper or electronic) . 
11.4.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility 
(i.e., evidence to suggest a caus al relationship between the drug and the AE)  that the drug caused 
the event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction . Document suspected adverse reactions  on the AE page of the CRF. 
11.4.3 Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is a subset of all suspected adverse reactions, and is defined as any AE caused by a drug. Document any adverse reactions  on the AE page of the CRF . 
11.4.4 Unexpected Adverse Event/Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An unexpected AE  (or unexpected suspected adverse reaction) is any AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed, if an IB is not required/available, is not consistent with the risk information described 
in the general investigational plan. This also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the study drug. 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
51 The Sponsor  should be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator  becoming aware of  the event . 
Document unexpected AEs on the AE page of the CRF . 
11.5 Serious Adverse Event Definitions/Reporting Requirements  
11.5.1 Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious  if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
1. Death . This includes any death that occurs while the subject is enrolled in  the trial and/or 
within [ADDRESS_1043270] caused death. 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . In the absence of an 
AE, h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_761823]: 
□ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761824] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_760]. 
□ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761825].  
□ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486502]. 
□ For a h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_281785] (and documented) before the start of the trial  for a pre -
existing co ndition which has not worsened. 
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
5. A congenital anomal y/birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The Sponsor  should be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator  becoming aware of  the event . 
Document SAEs on the AE/SAE  page (s) of the CRF . 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
52 [IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
For safety reporting purposes, any pregnancy occurring during the trial will be considered an 
“important medical event” ( Section 11.5.1). It is not known whether study drug can cause fetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can  affect reproductive capacity. 
There have been  no studies in pregnant women. Study drug should only be administered to 
women of childbearing potential when appropriate contraceptive measures have been taken and 
when  pregnancy tests are negative. A negative  serum β -hCG pregnancy test must be documented 
on the CRF prior to the first dose of study drug and periodically throughout the trial. 
Studies have not been performed to determine whether CF102 affects reprod uctive function in 
males. Men and women with childbearing potential will be informed as to the unknown risks to a 
pregnancy and will be advised that they must both use effective contraception during the trial 
and for [ADDRESS_1043271]. Effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier method, or 
(b) [ADDRESS_1043272] has discontinued 
the trial. Once the newbor n is determined to be healthy, as defined by [CONTACT_761845], additional follow-up will no longer be required. 
11.5.2 Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any SAE  related to study drug, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current protocol 
and/or IB. This also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions mentioned in the IB 
as occurring with a class of dru gs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug. 
The Sponsor  should be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator  becoming aware of  the event . 
Document S[LOCATION_003]Rs on th e AE/SAE page(s) of the CRF . 
11.6 Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs (including SAEs ) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event/Serious Adverse 
Event page(s) of the CRF. The Investigator will carefully evaluate the seriousness, severity, 
duration, and causality of AEs  and document the following on the CRF:

Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
53 • Severity.  In most cases the NCI -CTCAE v4.0 criteria will preferably be used to grade 
severity; however, if an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading scale may be 
used: Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), Severe (Grade 3), Life -Threatening  (Grade 4), 
or Fatal (Grade 5).  
• Duration of the event. The date of onset, duration of the event, method used to treat the AE, 
and the outcome of the AE should be noted. 
• Relationship to study drug: Unrelated, Possibl y Related , Probabl y Related , or Related.  
11.7 Determining Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The following definitions adapted from Karch (1 975) will be used to determine the relationship 
of AEs to study drug. 
11.7.1 Unrelated  
Category applies to adverse events which are clearly felt to be due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.) that are unrelated  to the study drug. 
11.7.2 Possibly Related 
The relationship to the study drug can be considered possible if (must have first 2): 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could readily have been a result of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factor s, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
11.7.3 Probably Related  
The relationship to the study drug can be considered probable if  (must have first 3): 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upo n cessation of drug or reduction in dose.* 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
*There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug relatedness clearly exists, e.g., 1) tardive dyskinesia; 2) fixed drug eruptions. 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
54 11.7.4 Related  
The relationship to the study drug can be considered related  if (must have first 3): 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or drug levels 
have been established in body fluids or tissues. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction on dose  and appears upon 
rechallenge.*  
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
*There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug relatedness clearly exists, e.g., 1) tardive dyskinesia; 2) fixed drug eruptions. 
11.[ADDRESS_1043273] be 
promptly reported to the Sponsor ( within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event)  by [CONTACT_756], telefax, or e- mail transmission . 
11.8.2 Events Excluded from Expedited Reporting to FDA  
The Sponsor does not plan to report several types of individual SAEs to FDA in an expedited 
manner because they are known consequences of the underlying disease and/or anticipated to occur in the trial population at some frequency, independent of drug exposure. These include:  
• Progres sion of the underlying malignancy 
• Death due to the under lying malignancy 
• Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761826] 
• Previously scheduled elective surgery  
These events will be reported to FDA /other regulatory authorities  and all partic ipating 
Investigator s as an IND safety report only if there is evidence, based on an aggregate analysis, to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event. 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment [ADDRESS_1043274] for prompt reporting is essential in that the Sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities as 
well as all other participating Investigators of the event. 
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the ICH 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, the Sponsor is required to submit written documentation, in the form of an IND 
Safety Report, on the following: 
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs . 
• Unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions.  
• Findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to drug. 
• Findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to 
drug. 
• Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions from what is reported in the Investigator Brochure or the protocol. 
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_281807]/other regulatory authorities  (and 
by [CONTACT_56481] e IRB/EC ) as soon as possible, and in no event later than 15 calendar 
days  after the Sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The Sponsor shall 
also inform all Investigator s. 
In addition, the Sponsor is further required to report, b y either telephone or facsimile 
transmission or in writing to the FDA /other regulatory authorities  the occurrence of any 
unexpected fatal or life- threatening event associated with the use of the drug (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) no later 
than 7 calendar days  after notificatio n of the event, followed by a written report no later than 
15 calendar days  after the initial report receipt date. The Sponsor shall also inform all 
Investigator s. 
The Sponsor will provide expedited reports of the following S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Investigator s for 
reporting to their IRB/EC : 
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in the clinical trial that was assessed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in other clinical trials of the same Sponsor and with the same 
medicinal product, and that could have consequences for the safety of the subjects involved 
in the clinical trial that was assessed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment 5  
Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
56 Investigators are required to promptly report to the IRB /EC all unanticipated problems involving 
risk to human subjects, including adverse events that should be considered unanticipated 
problems (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.66, and 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1)). 
11.8.[ADDRESS_1043275] transmit sufficient initial information to the Sponsor (or designee) should 
an SAE report meet the criteria for completion of an IND Safety Report.  As much of the 
following information about the subject and the event will be requested: 
• Subject identification code, gender, and age or date of birth 
• Underlying diagnosis and extent of disease 
• Lot number and expi[INVESTIGATOR_703572] (if available) 
• Dose, route, frequency, and duration of study drug administered 
• Date of study drug administration  
• Description of event, including date of onset and duration 
• Date of death (if applicable)  
• Intervention(s) required  
• Concomitant therapy (including regimens and indications) 
• Pertinent laboratory data/diagnostic study (including dates) 
• Pertinent medical history  
• Study drug status (dose interrupted, discontinued) 
• Did event abate after interruption of study drug administration (if applicable)?  
• Did event recur after study drug was reintroduced (if applicable)? 
• Severity of the AE  
• Relationship of the AE  to study treatment 
• Outcome of the AE  
11.8.5 Follow-up Information 
Follow- up data concerning the SAE (e.g., diagnostic test reports, physician's summaries, etc.) 
must also be submitted to the Sponsor as they become available, preferably by [CONTACT_702510] e- mail,

Confidential  6 November 2018  
 
57 Based on the Investigator ’s and Sponsor ’s assessment of causality of the adverse event and 
discussions with the Medical Monitor, a decision will be made by [CONTACT_761846]. The primary consideration 
governing further action is whether new findings affect the safety of other subjects participating 
in the clinical trial. If the discovery of a new AE  related to study drug raises concern over the 
safety of its continued administration to subj ects, the Sponsor will take immediate steps to notify 
FDA, other regulatory authorities, and all Investigator s participating in clinical trials  with the 
study drug. 
Further action required may include any of the following: 
• Alteration of the existing resear ch program by [CONTACT_124938]. 
• Discontinuation or suspension of the trial. 
• Alteration of the informed consent process by [CONTACT_761847].  
• Modification of previously identified expected suspected adverse reaction lists to include 
adverse events newly identified as study drug- related.  
12.0 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES  
12.1 General Considerations  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with 
advanced HCC and CPB cirrhosis whose disease has progressed while taking 1 prior systemic 
drug therapy for HCC. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CF102 as compared to placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a  2:[ADDRESS_1043277] v1.1, and DC which includes 
both subjects with OR as well as those with  SD. Survival status will be assessed continuously.

will be presented as exploratory efficacy variables , as will WBC adenosine  A 3 receptor 
expression. PK blood samples collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 and trough samples collected 
on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 will be used to generate a composite PK profile for  subjects 
receiving CF102 treatment, and allow exploratory analysis of exposure-response for this trial. 
12.2 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 78 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either CF102 or placebo using a 
2:[ADDRESS_1043278] ratio of 0.5, 75 events  will provide  
80% power for the logrank test at level 0.05 (two-sided). It is assumed that the 78 subjects will 
be enrolled in approximately 78 weeks and the trial will continue for a total of 104 weeks ( SiZ: 
Logrank Test with Given Accrual Duration and Study Duration, Version 2.0, Cytel, Inc. 2011). 
The required number of deaths and the required number of subjects are reasonably stable with respect to the duration of accrual and length of the post -accrual follow -up period, being between 
[ADDRESS_1043279] power of 80% for an assumed hazard rate of 0.5, especially for studies with a post- accrual follow -up period.

The Per Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all subjects in the ITT Population with no major 
protocol deviations, including major violations of inclusion and exclusion criteria and violation 
of RECIST requirements regarding the number of target lesions at Screening . Exclusion of 
subjects from the PP Population will be determined prior to unblinding. Tumor response  will be 
analyzed for the PP Population. 
Can-Fite BioPharma, Ltd.  Protocol CF10 2-201HCC, Amendment [ADDRESS_1043281] completion status, dose reductions, and t erminations from the trial will be summarized 
for each of the treatment cycles and for the trial overall. Subjects with major protocol violations 
will be listed. Demographics will be summarized along with baseline  characteristics such as

who are excluded from either the ITT Population or the PP Population will be identified. 
12.4.2 Efficacy  Data  
All efficacy analyses will be performed for the ITT Population. Tumor response will be analyzed 
for the PP Population, with the analyses for the ITT Population being primary. 
Time to event variables will be summarized using the number observed, number censored, 
median, and 25th and 75th percent iles from Kaplan -Meier curves. Data will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables . Categorical variables will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages.  
Between -treatment comparisons with respect to OS, TTP, and PFS will be performed using 
logrank tests, with Cox’s proportional hazards regression model used for supportive analyses to assess the impact of covariates. Tumor lesion measurements and changes from baseline will be 
summ arized by [CONTACT_761835]. Objective response rates and DC rates will be presented and 
between -treatment comparisons will be performed using the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution by [CONTACT_761836] -numbered cycle. Between -treatment 
comparisons with respect to AFP will be performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with the value at baseline value used as a covariate and frequencies of subjects with AFP levels <20, 20-200, or >200 ng/mL will be presented by [CONTACT_761837]. 
Liver Chemistry Tests,  INR, and viral l oad will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 
clinically significant abnormalities will be listed. Additionally, between -treatment comparisons 
with respect to these laboratory parameters will be performed using ANCOVA with the baseline 
value used as a covariate.

NOTE:  RECIST v 1.1 as modified by  [CONTACT_761834] [2013] : 
Up to 5 target lesions in the liver and 2 target lesions in other organs are measured.  
RATIONALE:  Because HCC often presents as a multifocal disease in the liver and the standard RECIST 
limitation to a maximum of 2 target lesions in the liv er was considered too restrictive for a study with

Response criteria
Solid tumoursGuidelinesABSTRACT
Background: Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the
clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response)
and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials. Since RECIST was publishedin 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities haveadopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number ofquestions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECISTguideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special
issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation
studies and literature reviews.
Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed : based
on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis pur-poses, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determinationhas been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of ﬁve total (and from ﬁve to twoper organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes
with a short axis ofP15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions.
The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation oftumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. Conﬁrma-
tion of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer
required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of inter-pretation of data. Disease progression is clariﬁed in several aspects: in addition to the previ-

1. Background
1.1. History of RECIST criteria
Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important
feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics. Both
tumour shrinkage (objective response) and time to the devel-opment of disease progression are important endpoints in
cancer clinical trials. The use of tumour regression as the
endpoint for phase II trials screening new agents for evi-dence of anti-tumour effect is supported by [CONTACT_657187]-dence suggesting that, for many solid tumours, agentswhich produce tumour shrinkage in a proportion of patientshave a reasonable (albeit imperfect) chance of subsequentlydemonstrating an improvement in overall survival or othertime to event measures in randomised phase III studies (re-viewed in [1–4] ). At the current time objective response car-
ries with it a body of evidence greater than for any otherbiomarker supporting its utility as a measure of promising
treatment effect in phase II screening trials. Furthermore,
at both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development,clinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasinglyutilising time to progression (or progression-free survival)as an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn,which is also based on anatomical measurement of tumoursize.
However, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re-
sponse and time to disease progression, are useful only ifbased on widely accepted and readily applied standard crite-ria based on anatomical tumour burden. In 1981 the World
Health Organisation (WHO) ﬁrst published tumour response
criteria, mainly for use in trials where tumour response wasthe primary endpoint. The WHO criteria introduced the con-cept of an overall assessment of tumour burden by [CONTACT_337378].
5However, in the decades that
followed their publication, cooperative groups and pharma-ceutical companies that used the WHO criteria often ‘modi-ﬁed’ them to accommodate new technologies or to addressareas that were unclear in the original document. This ledto confusion in interpretation of trial results
6and in fact,
the application of varying response criteria was shown to leadto very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the sameregimen.
7In response to these problems, an International
Working Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardiseand simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub-
lished in 2000.
8Key features of the original RECIST include
deﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instruc-tions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximumﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, ratherthan bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tu-mour burden. These criteria have subsequently been widelyadopted by [CONTACT_337379], cooperative groups, andindustry for trials where the primary endpoints are objectiveresponse or progression. In addition, regulatory authoritiesaccept RECIST as an appropriate guideline for these
assessments.
1.2. Why update RECIST?
Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators have
conﬁrmed in prospective analyses the validity of substituting
unidimensional for bidimensional (and even three-dimen-sional)-based criteria (reviewed in [9]). With rare exceptions
(e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seemsto perform well in solid tumour phase II studies.
However, a number of questions and issues have arisen
which merit answers and further clarity. Amongst theseare whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed withoutaffecting the overall assigned response for patients (or theconclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST inrandomised phase III trials where progression, not response,is the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients havemeasurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imag-ing technologies such as FDG-PET and MRI; how to handleassessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmationis truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST intrials of targeted non-cytotoxic drugs. This revision of the
RECIST guidelines includes updates that touch on all these
points.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– [ADDRESS_1043301] of the revision processwas to create a database of prospectively documented solidtumour measurement data obtained from industry and aca-demic group trials. This database, assembled at the EORTCData Centre under the leadership of Jan Bogaerts and PatrickTherasse (co-authors of this guideline), consists of >6500 pa-tients with >18,[ADDRESS_1043302] of a variety of questions (e.g. number of
target lesions required, the need for response conﬁrmation,
and lymph node measurement rules) on response and pro-gression-free survival outcomes. The results of this work,which after evaluation by [CONTACT_337380], are reportedin detail in a separate paper in this special issue.
10Larry Sch-
wartz and Robert Ford (also co-authors of this guideline) alsoprovided key databases from which inferences have beenmade that inform these revisions.
[ADDRESS_1043303] elected to name [CONTACT_337405]1.1, rather than 2.0.
1.4. What about volumetric or functional assessment?
This raises the question, frequently posed, about whether it is
‘time’ to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of
tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment
orto functional assessment (e.g. dynamic contrast enhanced
MRI or CT or (18)F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomographic (FDG-PET) techniques assessing tumour metab-olism). As can be seen, the Working Group and particularlythose involved in imaging research, did not believe that thereis at present sufﬁcient standardisation and widespread avail-ability to recommend adoption of these alternative assess-ment methods. The only exception to this is in the use ofFDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progres-sion, as described later in this guideline. As detailed in paper
in this special issue
12, we believe that the use of these prom-
ising newer approaches (which could either add to orsubstitute
foranatomical assessment as described in RECIST) requires
appropriate and rigorous clinical validation studies. This pa-
per by [CONTACT_337381]. illustrates the type of data that will beneeded to be able to deﬁne ‘endpoints’ for these modalitiesand how to determine where and when such criteria/modal-ities can be used to improve the reliability with which trulyactive new agents are identiﬁed and truly inactive new agentsare discarded in comparison to RECIST criteria in phase IIscreening trials. The RECIST Working Group looks forwardto such data emerging in the next few years to allow theappropriate changes to the next iteration of the RECISTcriteria.
2. Purpose of this guideline
This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour
measurement and deﬁnitions for objective assessment ofchange in tumour size for use in adult and paediatric cancerclinical trials. It is expected these criteria will be useful in alltrials where objective response is the primary study endpoint,as well as in trials where assessment of stable disease, tu-
mour progression or time to progression analyses are under-
taken, since all of these outcome measures are based on anassessment of anatomical tumour burden and its change onstudy. There are no assumptions in this paper about the pro-portion of patients meeting the criteria for any of these end-points which will signal that an agent or treatment regimen isactive: those deﬁnitions are dependent on type of cancer inwhich a trial is being undertaken and the speciﬁc agent(s) un-der study. Protocols must include appropriate statistical sec-tions which deﬁne the efﬁcacy parameters upon which thetrial sample size and decision criteria are based. In addition
to providing deﬁnitions and criteria for assessment of tumour
response, this guideline also makes recommendationsregarding standard reporting of the results of trials that utilisetumour response as an endpoint.
While these guidelines may be applied in malignant brain
tumour studies, there are also separate criteria published forresponse assessment in that setting.
13This guideline is notin-
tended for use for studies of malignant lymphoma sinceinternational guidelines for response assessment in lym-phoma are published separately.
14
Finally, many oncologists in their daily clinical practice fol-
low their patients’ malignant disease by [CONTACT_337382]. It isnot intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in thatdecision making, except if determined appropriate by [CONTACT_337383].
3. Measurability of tumour at baseline
3.1. Deﬁnitions
At baseline, tumour lesions/lymph nodes will be categorised
measurable or non-measurable as follows:
3.1.1. Measurable
Tumour lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least one
dimension ( longest diameter in the plane of measurement is
to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•[ADDRESS_1043304] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than5 mm; see Appendix II on imaging guidance).
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesionswhich cannot be accurately measured with calipers should
be recorded as non-measurable).
•[ADDRESS_1043305] X-ray.230 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –247
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically en-
larged and measurable, a lymph node must be P15 mm in
short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and infollow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed
(see Schwartz et al. in this Special Issue
15). See also notes be-
low on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non-target le-
sions’ for information on lymph node measurement.
3.1.2. Non-measurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with P10 to <15 mm
short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions
considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal dis-ease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inﬂammatorybreast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung,abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identiﬁed by[CONTACT_337384].
3.1.3. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated
with local therapy require particular comment:
Bone lesions:.
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain ﬁlms are not considered ade-
quate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. How-ever, these techniques can be used to conﬁrm thepresence or disappearance of bone lesions.
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identi-
ﬁable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_657188]-sidered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component
meets the deﬁnition of measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
Cystic lesions:.
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁnedsimple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions(neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by[INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition, simple cysts.
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases canbe considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the deﬁ-nition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are pre-ferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment: .
•Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, orin an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usu-ally not considered measurable unless there has been dem-onstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols shoulddetail the conditions under which such lesions would be
considered measurable.
3.2. Speciﬁcations by [CONTACT_12009]
3.2.1. Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation,
using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluationsshould be performed as close as possible to the treatment
start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning ofthe treatment.
3.2.2. Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique
should be used to characterise each identiﬁed and reportedlesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evalu-ation should always be done rather than clinical examinationunless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but areassessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered mea-
surable when they are superﬁcial and P10 mm diameter as
assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skinlesions, documentation by [CONTACT_12151] a ru-ler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As notedabove, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_337386], imaging evaluation should be undertaken sinceit is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of thestudy.
Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particu-
larly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT ismore sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new le-
sions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered
measurable if they are clearly deﬁned and surrounded by [CONTACT_657189]-ated lung. See Appendix II for more details.
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible
method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.This guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions on CTscan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is5 mm or less. As is described in Appendix II , when CT scans
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum sizefor a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for bodyscans). More details concerning the use of both CT and MRI
for assessment of objective tumour response evaluation are
provided in Appendix II .
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion
size and should not be used as a method of measurement.Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their en-tirety for independent review at a later date and, becausethey are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed thatthe same technique and measurements will be taken fromone assessment to the next (described in greater detail inAppendix II). If new lesions are identiﬁed by [CONTACT_337387], conﬁrmation by [CONTACT_657190]-vised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT,
MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilisation of these techniques for
objective tumour evaluation is not advised. However, they
can be useful to conﬁrm complete pathological responsewhen biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trialswhere recurrence following complete response or surgicalresection is an endpoint.
Tumour markers: Tumour markers alone cannot be used to as-
sess objective tumour response. If markers are initially aboveE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– [ADDRESS_1043306] normalise for a
patient to be considered in complete response. Becausetumour markers are disease speciﬁc, instructions for theirmeasurement should be incorporated into protocols on adisease speciﬁc basis. Speciﬁc guidelines for both CA-125response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (inrecurrent prostate cancer), have been published.
16–18In addi-
tion, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125progression criteria which are to be integrated with objectivetumour assessment for use in ﬁrst-line trials in ovariancancer.
19
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differenti-
ate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990](for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germcell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can re-main). When effusions are known to be a potential adverseeffect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds orangiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological conﬁrmation of the
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens dur-
ing treatment can be considered if the measurable tumourhas met criteria for response or stable disease in order to dif-ferentiate between response (or stable disease) and progres-sive disease.
4. Tumour response evaluation
4.1. Assessment of overall tumour burden and
measurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is nec-
essary to estimate the overall tumour burden at baseline and
use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline shouldbe included in protocols where objective tumour responseis the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is deﬁned by[CONTACT_12155] (as detailedabove in Section 3). In studies where the primary endpoint
is tumour progression (either time to progression or propor-
tion with progression at a ﬁxed date), the protocol must
specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable diseaseor whether patients having non-measurable disease only arealso eligible.
4.2. Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’
lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline
all lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a max-
imum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved
organs should be identiﬁed as target lesions and will be re-
corded and measured at baseline (this means in instances
where patients have only one or two organ sites involved amaximum of two and four lesions respectively will be re-
corded). For evidence to support the selection of only ﬁve tar-get lesions, see analyses on a large prospective database inthe article by [CONTACT_150064].
10.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size
(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all in-volved organs, but in addition should be those that lendthemselves to reproducible repeated measurements .I tm a yb e
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it-self to reproducible measurement in which circumstance thenext largest lesion which can be measured reproduciblyshould be selected. To illustrate this point see the examplein Fig. [ADDRESS_1043307] in which the imageis obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane;
for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or
coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis.For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being20 mm ·30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualiﬁes as a
malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm shouldbe recorded as the node measurement (See also the examplein Fig. 4 in Appendix II ). All other pathological nodes (those
with short axis P10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered
non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mmare considered non-pathological and should not be recordedor followed.
Asum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculatedand reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only theshort axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters
will be used as reference to further characterise any objectivetumour regression in the measurable dimension of thedisease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological
lymph nodes should be identiﬁed as non-target lesions and
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not re-
quired and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘ab-
sent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more detailsto follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item onthe case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymphnodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
4.3. Response criteria
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to
determine objective tumour response for target lesions.
4.3.1. Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target ornon-target) must have reduction in short axis to<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference thebaseline sum diameters.232 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –247
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum
of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference
thesmallest sum on study (this includes the baseline
sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition tothe relative increase of 20%, the sum must also dem-
onstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for
PR nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD, taking asreference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
4.3.2. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identiﬁed as target lesions should
always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (mea-
sured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examina-
tion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. Thismeans that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions,the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete responsecriteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as havinga short axis of <[ADDRESS_1043308] achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR,SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes isto be included in the sum of target lesions.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on
study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baselineshould have their actual measurements recorded at each sub-sequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). How-ever, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recordedas target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan thatthe radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exactmeasure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded onthe case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_337331], the measurement should be
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and isfaintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mmshould be assigned ( Note: It is less likely that this rule will be
used for lymph nodes since they usually have a deﬁnable sizewhen normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_337388]; however, if a lymph node is believed tobe present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a de-fault value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance aswell). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_1043309] slicethickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice
thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially
non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value willprevent false responses or progressions based upon measure-ment error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist isable to
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even ifit is below 5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. As noted in Appen-
dix II, when non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diame-ters of the fragmented portions should be added together tocalculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce,
a plane between them may be maintained that would aid inobtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individ-
ual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that theyare no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameterin this instance should be the maximal longest diameter forthe ‘coalesced lesion’.
4.3.3. Evaluation of non-target lesions
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteriausedto deter-
mine the tumour response for the group of non-target lesions.While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable,they need not be measured and instead should be assessed onlyqualitatively at the time points speciﬁed in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target le-
sions and normalisation of tumour marker level. Alllymph nodes must be non-pathological in size(<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target le-
sion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker levelabove the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see com-
ments below) of existing non-target lesions. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
4.3.4. Special notes on assessment of progression of non-
target disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires
additional explanation as follows:
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting,
to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the
non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substan-tial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in pres-ence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumourburden has increased sufﬁciently to merit discontinuationof therapy (see examples in Appendix II and further details
below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-tar-get lesions is usually not sufﬁcient to quality for unequivocal
progression status. The designation of overall progression so-
lelyon the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of
SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
When the patient has only non-measurable disease. This circum-
stance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of
study entry to have measurable disease. The same general con-cepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance thereis no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inter-pretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden.Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easilyquantiﬁed (by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non-measur-
able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients
for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase inoverall disease burden based on the change in non-measurabledisease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that wouldberequiredtodeclare PDfor measurabledisease: i.e. an increasein tumour burden representing an additional 73% increase in‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in ameasurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleuraleffusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangiticE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– 247 233
disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in
protocols as ‘sufﬁcient to require a change in therapy’. Someillustrative examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in Appendix II .
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be con-sidered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would beideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable dis-ease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do
so, therefore the increase must be substantial.
4.3.5. New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease
progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new
lesions are important. There are no speciﬁc criteria for theidentiﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnd-ing of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributableto differences in scanning technique, change in imagingmodality or ﬁndings thought to represent something otherthan tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be
simply healing or ﬂare of pre-existing lesions). This is partic-
ularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions showpartial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liverlesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cysticlesion, which it is not.
A lesion identiﬁed on a follow-up study in an anatomical
location that was notscanned at baseline is considered a new
lesion andwill indicate disease progression. An example of thisis the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while onstudy has a CTor MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases.The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its
small size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will
clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con-ﬁrm there is deﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression shouldbe declared using the date of the initial scan.
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use ofFDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessmentof progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New le-sions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identiﬁed
according to the following algorithm:
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive
lFDG-PET
at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at fol-
low-up:
If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to anew site of disease conﬁrmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not conﬁrmed asa new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CTscans are needed to determine if there is truly progres-sion occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will bethe date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progress-
ing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.4.4. Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from
the start of the study treatment until the end of treatmenttaking into account any requirement for conﬁrmation. On oc-
casion a response may not be documented until after the end
of therapy so protocols should be clear if post-treatmentassessments are to be considered in determination of bestoverall response. Protocols must specify how any new therapyintroduced before progression will affect best response desig-nation. The patient’s best overall response assignment willdepend on the ﬁndings of both target and non-target diseaseand will also take into consideration the appearance of newlesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the studyand the protocol requirements, it may also require conﬁrma-tory measurement (see Section 4.6). Speciﬁcally, in non-ran-
domised trials where response is the primary endpoint,conﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the‘best overall response’. This is described further below.
4.4.1. Time point response
It is assumed that at each protocol speciﬁed time point, a re-
sponse assessment occurs. Table [ADDRESS_1043310] non-measurable (therefore non-tar-
get) disease only, Table 2 is to be used.
4.4.2. Missing assessments and inevaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular
time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at anassessment, usually the case is also considered NE at thattime point, unless a convincing argument can be made thatthe contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) wouldnot change the assigned time point response. This would bemost likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa-
tient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_1043311] overall response: all time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the
patient is known.
Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com-
plete or partial response IS NOT required : Best response in these
trials is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for
example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at sec-
ond assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overallresponse of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, itmust also meet the protocol speciﬁed minimum time frombaseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is other-wise the best time point response, the patient’s best responsedepends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a pa-tient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and doesnot meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best responseof PD. The same patient lost to follow-up after the ﬁrst SDassessment would be considered inevaluable.
lA ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue

plete or partial response IS required : Complete or partial re-
sponses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are metat a subsequent time point as speciﬁed in the protocol (gener-
ally 4 weeks later). In this circumstance, the best overall re-sponse can be interpreted as in Table 3 .
4.4.4. Special notes on response assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they may
still have a measurement reported on scans. This measure-
ment should be recorded even though the nodes are normalin order not to overstate progression should it be based onincrease in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means thatpatients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on thecase report form (CRF).
In trials where conﬁrmation of response is required, re-
peated ‘NE’ time point assessments may complicate best re-sponse determination. The analysis plan for the trial mustaddress how missing data/assessments will be addressed indetermination of response and progression. For example, in
most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time
point responses of PR-NE-PR as a conﬁrmed response.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requir-
ing discontinuation of treatment without objective evidenceof disease progression at that time should be reported as‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made todocument objective progression even after discontinuationof treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is nota descriptor
of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_657128]-apy. The objective response status of such patients is to bedetermined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease
as shown in Tables 1–3 .
Conditions that deﬁne ‘early progression, early death and
inevaluability’ are study speciﬁc and should be clearly de-
scribed in each protocol (depending on treatment duration,treatment periodicity).
In some circumstances it may be difﬁcult to distinguish
residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation ofcomplete response depends upon this determination, it isrecommended that the residual lesion be investigated (ﬁne

a If a CR is truly met at ﬁrst time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline,
makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration
for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the
patient had PR, not CR at the ﬁrst time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.Table 1 – Time point response: patients with target (+/–

a ‘Non-CR/non-PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non-target
disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for assessment
of efﬁcacy in some trials so to assign this category when no
lesions can be measured is not advised.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– 247 235
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of complete
response. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CRin a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residualradiographic abnormality is thought to represent ﬁbrosis orscarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should beprospectively described in the protocol and supported by [INVESTIGATOR_93478]-ease speciﬁc medical literature for the indication. However, it
must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to
false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy res-olution/sensitivity.
For equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g. very small and
uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existinglesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduledassessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progressionis conﬁrmed, the date of progression should be the earlierdate when progression was suspected.
4.5. Frequency of tumour re-evaluation
Frequency of tumour re-evaluation while on treatment
should be protocol speciﬁc and adapted to the type and sche-dule of treatment. However, in the context of phase II studieswhere the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow-upevery 6–8 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) isreasonable. Smaller or greater time intervals than these couldbe justiﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The proto-col should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated atbaseline (usually those most likely to be involved with meta-static disease for the tumour type under study) and how often
evaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non-target
sites are evaluated at each assessment. In selected circum-stances certain non-target organs may be evaluated less fre-quently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeatedonly when complete response is identiﬁed in target diseaseor when progression in bone is suspected.
After the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tu-
mour evaluations depends on whether the trial has as a goalthe response rate or the time to an event (progression/death).If ‘time to an event’ (e.g. time to progression, disease-freesurvival, progression-free survival) is the main endpoint of
the study, then routine scheduled re-evaluation of protocol
speciﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomised com-parative trials in particular, the scheduled assessmentsshould be performed as identiﬁed on a calendar schedule(for example: every 6–8 weeks on treatment or every 3–4months after treatment) and should not be affected by [CONTACT_337391], drug holidays or any other events that might leadto imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of diseaseassessment.
4.6. Conﬁrmatory measurement/duration of response
4.6.1. Conﬁrmation
In non-randomised trials where response is the primary end-
point, conﬁrmation of PR and CR is required to ensure re-
sponses identiﬁed are not the result of measurement error.This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results inthe context of historical data where response has traditionallyrequired conﬁrmation in such trials (see the paper by [CONTACT_337392]. in this Special Issue
10). However, in all other circum-stances, i.e. in randomised trials (phase II or III) or studieswhere stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints,conﬁrmation of response is not required since it will not add va-lue to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination ofthe requirement for response conﬁrmation may increase theimportance of central review to protect against bias, in partic-ular in studies which are not blinded.
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval(in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is deﬁned in thestudy protocol.
4.6.2. Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time
measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR/PR (whichever is ﬁrstrecorded) until the ﬁrst date that recurrent or progressive dis-ease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progres-sive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measured
from the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR untilthe ﬁrst date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
4.6.3. Duration of stable disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in
randomised trials, from date of randomisation) until the crite-ria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest
sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the
reference for calculation of PD).
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease var-
ies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of pa-tients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of timeis an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocolshould specify the minimal time interval required betweentwo measurements for determination of stable disease.
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as
theprogression-free survival are inﬂuenced by [CONTACT_657191]-up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of thisguideline to deﬁne a standard follow-up frequency. The fre-quency should take into account many parameters includingdisease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard
practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the
measured endpoint should be taken into account if compari-sons between trials are to be made.
4.7. Progression-free survival/proportion progression-free
4.7.1. Phase II trials
This guideline is focused primarily on the use of objective re-
sponse endpoints for phase II trials. In some circumstances, ‘re-
sponse rate’ may not be the optimal method to assess thepotential anticancer activity of new agents/regimens. In such
cases ‘progression-free survival’ (PFS) or the ‘proportion pro-
gression-free’ at landmark time points, might be consideredappropriate alternatives to provide an initial signal of biologiceffect of new agents. It is clear, however, that in an uncontrolledtrial, these measures are subject to criticism since an appar-ently promising observation may be related to biological factorssuch as patient selection and not theimpact of theintervention.Thus, phase II screening trials utilising these endpoints are bestdesigned with a randomised control. Exceptions may exist236 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –247
where the behaviour patterns of certain cancers are so consis-
tent (and usually consistently poor), that a non-randomisedtrial is justiﬁable (see for example van Glabbeke et al.
20). How-
ever, in these cases it will be essential to document with carethe basis for estimating the expected PFS or proportion progres-sion-free in the absence of a treatment effect.
4.7.2. Phase III trials
Phase III trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed
to evaluate progression-free survival or time to progression asthe primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progressionis relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all pa-tients to have measurable disease. However, restricting entryto this subset of patients is subject to criticism: it may resultin a trial where the results are less likely to be generalisable if,in the disease under study, a substantial proportion of pa-tients would be excluded. Moreover, the restriction to entrywill slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri-
als allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as
well as those with non-measurable disease only. In this cir-cumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the ﬁnd-ings which would qualify for progressive disease for thosepatients without measurable lesions. Furthermore, in this set-
ting, protocols must indicate if the maximum number of re-corded target lesions for those patients with measurabledisease may be relaxed from ﬁve to three (based on the datafound in Bogaerts et al.
10and Moskowitz et al.11). As found in
the ‘special notes on assessment of progression’, these guide-lines offer recommendations for assessment of progression
in this setting. Furthermore, if available, validated tumour mar-
ker measures of progression (as has been proposed for ovariancancer) may be useful to integrate into the deﬁnition of pro-gression. Centralised blinded review of imaging studies or ofsource imaging reports to verify ‘unequivocal progression’may be needed if important drug development or drug ap-proval decisions are to be based on the study outcome. Finally,as noted earlier, because the date of progression is subject toascertainment bias, timing of investigations in study armsshould be the same. The article by [CONTACT_337394]. in this specialissue
21provides a more detailed discussion of the assessment
of progression in randomised trials.
4.8. Independent review of response and progression
For trials where objective response (CR + PR) is the primary end-
point, and in particular where key drug development deci-sions are based on the observation of a minimum number ofresponders, it is recommended that all claimed responses bereviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study. If the studyis a randomised trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded totreatment assignment. Simultaneous review of the patients’
ﬁles and radiological images is the best approach.
Independent review of progression presents some more
complex issues: for example, there are statistical problems
with the use of central-review-based progression time inplace of investigator-based progression time due to the poten-tial introduction of informative censoring when the formerprecedes the latter. An overview of these factors and otherlessons learned from independent review is provided in anarticle by [CONTACT_337395]. in this special issue.
224.9. Reporting best response results
4.9.1. Phase II trials
When response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients
must have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients
included in the study must be accounted for in the report of
the results, even if there are major protocol treatment devia-tions or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assignedone of the following categories:
1. Complete response2. Partial response3. Stable disease4. Progression5. Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early
death, malignant disease; early death, toxicity; tumourassessments not repeated/incomplete; other (specify)).
Normally, all eligible patients should be included in the
denominator for the calculation of the response rate for phaseII trials (in some protocols it will be appropriate to include all
treated patients). It is generally preferred that 95% two-sided
conﬁdence limits are given for the calculated response rate.Trial conclusions should be based on the response rate forall eligible (or all treated) patients and should notbe based
on a selected ‘evaluable’ subset.
4.9.2. Phase III trials
Response evaluation in phase III trials may be an indicator
of the relative anti-tumour activity of the treatments eval-uated and is almost always a secondary endpoint. Ob-served differences in response rate may not predict theclinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt for the populationstudied. If objective response is selected as a primary end-point for a phase III study (only in circumstances where adirect relationship between objective tumour response anda clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt can be unambigu-
ously demonstrated for the population studied), the same
criteria as those applying to phase II trials should be usedand all patients entered should have at least one measur-able lesion.
In those many cases where response is a secondary end-
point and not all trial patients have measurable disease, themethod for reporting overall best response rates must bepre-speciﬁed in the protocol. In practice, response rate maybe reported using either an ‘intent to treat’ analysis (all ran-domised patients in the denominator) or an analysis whereonly the subset of patients with measurable disease atbaseline are included. The protocol should clearly specify
how response results will be reported, including any subset
analyses that are planned.
The original version of RECIST suggested that in phase III
trials one could write protocols using a ‘relaxed’ interpreta-tion of the RECIST guidelines (for example, reducing the num-ber of lesions measured) but this should no longer be donesince these revised guidelines have been amended in such away that it is clear how these criteria should be applied forall trials in which anatomical assessment of tumour responseor progression are endpoints.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– [ADDRESS_1043313] 1.1 Rationale Reference in special issue

Appendix II. Speciﬁcations for standard
anatomical radiological imaging
These protocols for image acquisition of computed tomogra-
phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recom-mendations intended for patients on clinical trials where
RECIST assessment will be performed. Standardisation ofimaging requirements and image acquisition parameters isideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within astudy and results between studies. These recommendationsare designed to balance optimised image acquisition proto-cols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob-
ally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices.
These guidelines are not applicable to functional imagingtechniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size.
Scanner quality control is highly recommended and should
follow standard manufacturer and facility maintenanceschedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RE-CIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate toproduce reproducible measurements. Imaging quality controlfor CT includes an analysis of image noise and uniformity andCT number as well as spatial resolution. The frequency ofquality control analysis is also variable and should focus on
clinically relevant scanning parameters. Dose analysis is al-
ways important and the use of imaging should follow theALARA principle, ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’, whichrefers to making every reasonable effort to maintain radiationexposures as far below the dose limits as possible.
Speciﬁc .notes
Chest X-ray measurement of lesions surrounded by [CONTACT_657193]-
ary parenchyma is feasible, but not preferable as themeasurement represents a summation of densities. Further-
more, there is poor identiﬁcation of new lesions within the
chest on X-ray as compared with CT. Therefore, measure-ments of pulmonary parenchymal lesions as well as medias-tinal disease are optimally performed with CT of the chest.MRI of the chest should only be performed in extenuating cir-cumstances. Even if IV contrast cannot be administered (forexample, in the situation of allergy to contrast), a non-con-trast CT of the chest is still preferred over MRI or chest X-ray.
CT scans: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should
be contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest.As a general rule, the minimum size of a measurable lesion at
baseline should be no less than double the slice thickness and
also have a minimum size of 10 mm (see below for minimumsize when scanners have a slice thickness more than 5 mm).While the precise physics of lesion size and partial volumeaveraging is complex, lesions smaller than [ADDRESS_1043319] studies, they should still be measured.Lesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ shouldbe assigned a default measurement of [ADDRESS_1043320] administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval.
a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for mostsolid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Cover-age should encompass all areas of known predilectionfor metastases in the disease under evaluation and240 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –[ADDRESS_1043321] administration : Optimal visualisation and
measurement of metastases in solid tumours requiresconsistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrastas well as timing of scanning. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], most abdomi-nal imaging is performed during the portal venousphase and (optimally) about the same time frame afterinjection on each examination (see Fig. [ADDRESS_1043322] on lesion measurement).Most solid tumours may be scanned with a singlephase after administration of contrast. While triphasicCT scans are sometimes performed on other types ofvascular tumours to improve lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], forconsistency and uniformity, we would recommend tri-phasic CT for hepatocellular and neuroendocrinetumours for which this scanning protocol is generallystandard of care, and the improved temporal resolutionof the triphasic scan will enhance the radiologists’ abil-ity to consistently and reproducibly measure these
lesions. The precise dose and rate of IV contrast is
dependent upon the CT scanning equipment, CT acqui-sition protocol, the type of contrast used, the availablevenous access and the medical condition of thepatient. Therefore, the method of administration ofintravenous contrast agents is variable. Rather thantry to institute rigid rules regarding methods foradministering contrast agents and the volume injected,it is appropriate to suggest that an adequate volume ofa suitable contrast agent should be given so that themetastases are demonstrated to best effect and a con-
sistent method is used on subsequent examinations for
any given patient (ideally, this would be speciﬁed inthe protocol or for an institution). It is very importantthat the same technique be used at baseline and on fol-low-up examinations for a given patient. This willgreatly enhance the reproducibility of the tumour mea-surements. If prior to enrolment it is known a patient isnot able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due toallergy or renal insufﬁciency, the decision as to
whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV
contrast) should be used to evaluate the subject atbaseline and follow-up should be guided by [CONTACT_337398]. For patients who develop contraindica-tions to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done,the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI(enhanced or non-enhanced) should be performedshould also be based on the tumour type, anatomiclocation of the disease and should be optimised toallow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.
Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to
determine if substitution of these other approaches ispossible and, if not, the patient should be considerednot evaluable from that point forward. Care must betaken in measurement of target lesions on a differentmodality and interpretation of non-target disease ornew lesions, since the same lesion may appear to havea different size using a new modality (see Fig. [ADDRESS_1043323] and MRI of the same lesion). Oralcontrast is recommended to help visualise and differ-entiate structures in the abdomen.
c.Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: RECIST measure-ments may be performed at most clinically obtainedslice thicknesses. It is recommended that CT scans beperformed at [ADDRESS_1043324] on lesion measurement and on detection ofnew lesions. However, consideration should also begiven for minimising radiation exposure. With theseparameters, a minimum 10 mm lesion is considered
measurable at baseline. Occasionally, institutions may
perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknessesgreater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of
measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice

FDG-PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for
detecting, staging and restaging several malignancies. Criteriafor incorporating (or substituting) FDG-PET into anatomicalassessment of tumour response in phase II trials are not yetavailable, though much research is ongoing. Nevertheless,FDG-PET is being used in many drug development trials bothas a tool to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy and also in assessmentof progression.

PET camera speciﬁcations arevariable and manufacturer speciﬁc, so every attempt shouldbe made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner,for serial scans on the same patient. Whole-body acquisitionscan be performed in either 2- or 3-dimensional mode with
attenuation correction, but the method chosen should be con-
sistent across all patients and serial scans in the clinical trial.
PET/CT scans : Combined modality scanning such as with
PET–CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modal-ity/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recom-mendations in this paper may change rather quickly withtime. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT por-tions of a combined PET–CT are of limited use in anatomicallybased efﬁcacy assessments and it is therefore suggested thatthey should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic con-trast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST mea-
surements. However, if a site can document that the CTperformed as part of a PET–CT is of identical diagnostic qual-
ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CTportion of the PET–CT can be used for RECIST measurements.Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces addi-tional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinelyor serially performed.
Ultrasound examinations should not be used in clinical trials
to measure tumour regression or progression of lesions be-
cause the examination is necessarily subjective and operator
dependent. The reasons for this are several: Entire examina-tions cannot be reproduced for independent review at a laterdate, and it must be assumed, whether or not it is the case,that the hard-copy ﬁlms available represent a true and accu-rate reﬂection of events. Furthermore, if, for example, theonly measurable lesion is in the para-aortic region of theabdomen and if gas in the bowel overlies the lesion, the lesionwill not be detected because the ultrasound beam cannotpenetrate the gas. Accordingly, the disease staging (or restag-ing for treatment evaluation) for this patient will not be
accurate.
While evaluation of lesions by [CONTACT_337399], it is permitted when lesions are
superﬁcial, at least [ADDRESS_1043327], spatial and temporal resolution; however, thereare many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_657132]-
surement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variableglobally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technicalspeciﬁcations of the scanning sequences used should beoptimised for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-upshould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesionsshould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with T1and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium enhancedimaging should be performed. The ﬁeld of view, matrix,
number of excitations, phase encode steps, use of fat sup-
pression and fast sequences should be optimised for the spe-
Fig. 2 – CT versus MRI of same lesions showing apparent ‘progression’ due only to differing method of measurement.242 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –247
ciﬁc body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. It
is beyond the scope of this document or appendix to pre-scribe speciﬁc MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scan-ners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type ofscanner should be used and the image acquisition protocolshould be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Bodyscans should be performed with breath-hold scanning tech-
niques if possible.
Selection of target lesions : In general, the largest lesions rep-
resentative of involved organs (up to a maximum of two per
organ and ﬁve total) are selected to follow as target lesions.However, in some cases, the largest lesions may not be easilymeasured and are not suitable for follow-up because of theirconﬁguration. In these cases, identiﬁcation of the largest most
reproducible lesions is advised. Fig. [ADDRESS_1043328] and follow:
Measurement of lesions
The longest diameter of selected lesions should be measured
in the plane in which the images were acquired. For body CT,this is the axial plane. In the event isotropic reconstructionsare performed, measurements can be made on these recon-structed images; however, it should be cautioned that notall radiology sites are capable of producing isotropic recon-structions. This could lead to the undesirable situation ofmeasurements in the axial plane at one assessment pointand in a different plane at a subsequent assessment. There
are some tumours, for instance paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_18179], which
are better measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. It wouldbe acceptable to measure these lesions in these planes if thereconstructions in those planes were isotropic or the imageswere acquired with MRI in those planes. Using the same planeof evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesionshould always be measured at subsequent follow-up timepoints even if this results in measuring the lesion at a differ-ent slice level or in a different orientation or vector comparedwith the baseline study. Software tools that calculate the
maximal diameter for a perimeter of a tumour may be em-
ployed and may even reduce variability.
The only exception to the longest diameter rule is lymph
node measurement. Because malignant nodes are identiﬁedby [CONTACT_337400], this is the guide used todetermine not only whether they are pathological but is alsothe dimension measured for adding into the sum of target le-sions. Fig. 4 illustrates this point: the large arrow identiﬁes a
malignant node: the shorter perpendicular axis is P15 mm
and will be recorded. Close by (small arrow) there is a normalnode: note here the long axis is greater than 10 mm but the
short axis is well below 10 mm. This node should be consid-
ered non-pathological.
If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time
point it should continue to be measured. However, the pa-tient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reap-pears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions.For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR statusand the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be consid-ered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumourstatus was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappearedthen reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the
sum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in
other words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’single lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en-
Fig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target. In this example, theprimary gastric lesion (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the top two images) may be able to be measured with thinsection volumetric CT with the same degree of gastric distention at baseline and follow-up. However, this is potentiallychallenging to reproduce in a multicentre trial and if attempted should be done with careful imaging input and analysis. Themost reproducible lesion is a lymph node (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the bottom two images).E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228– 247 243
ough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to
meet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorisation isbased upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyondthe resolving power of the imaging modality employed.
The identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a
lesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embed-ded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pan-creas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumouraloedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distin-guish on certain modalities between this oedema and actualtumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cellswithin the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is mostcritical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible
manner from baseline and all subsequent follow-up time-
points. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilisethe same imaging modality.
When lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters
should be added together to calculate the target lesionsum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between themmay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximaldiameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the le-sions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer sep-arable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instanceshould be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged
lesion’.
Progression of non-target lesions
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ there must be an overall
level of substantial worsening in non-target disease that is of
a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in targetdisease, the treating physician would feel it important tochange therapy. Examples of unequivocal progression areshown in Figs. 5 and 6 .

Appendix III. Frequently asked questions
Question Answer
What should be done if several unique lesions at
baseline become conﬂuent at a follow-up
evaluation?Measure the longest diameter of the conﬂuent mass and record to add into the sum of
the longest diameters
How large does a new lesion have to be to countas progression? Does any small subcentimetre
lesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least
measurable?New lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it isclear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its
deﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the
techniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until nextscheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the
date of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798], or it disappears and one may then
consider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists
How should one lesion be measured if on
subsequent exams it is split into two?Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum
Does the deﬁnition of progression depend on
the status of all target lesions or only one?As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum ofdiameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of [ADDRESS_1043329] criteria accepted by [CONTACT_337401]?Many cooperative groups and members of pharma were involved in preparing RECIST1.[ADDRESS_1043330] adopted them. The FDA was consulted in their development and supportstheir use, though they don’t require it. The European and Canadian regulatory
authorities also participated and the RECIST criteria are now integrated in the European
note for guidance for the development of anticancer agents. Many pharmaceuticalcompanies are also using them. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1043331] slice thickness is >5 mm?RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1043332] a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and theminimum size for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is
<5 mm). If scanners with slice thickness >[ADDRESS_1043333] when target lesions
become so small they are below the 10 mm
‘measurable’ size?Target lesion measurability is deﬁned at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements,
even if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists
indicate they are ‘too small to measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, ifthe lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of [ADDRESS_1043334]
decreased in size to meet PR criteria and one
has actually disappeared, does that patient havePD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears?Unless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or
SD) is not PD. The lesion should simply be added into the sum.
If the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify forPD
When measuring the longest diameter of targetlesions in response to treatment, is the sameaxis that was used initially used subsequently,
even if there is a shape change to the lesion that
may have produced a new longest diameter?The longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis isdifferent from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time pointduring follow-up)
The only exception to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1043335] been selected at baselineand followed but then one of these targetlesions then becomes non-evaluable (i.e.different technique used)What may be done in such cases is one of the following:
What is the effect this has on the other targetlesions and the overall response?(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the centre to be sure that future evaluations aredone with the baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable(b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by [CONTACT_337402]...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from
that technique you retrieve the lesion evaluability
(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is possible then it is a judgement call about whether you deletethe lesion from all forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that
its being non-evaluable makes the overall response interpretation inevaluable without
it. Such a decision should be discussed in a review panelIt is NOT recommended that the lesion be included in baseline sums and then excludedfrom follow-up sums since this biases in favour of a response

Question Answer
What if a single non-target lesion cannot be reviewed, for
whatever reason; does this negate the overall assessment?Sometimes the major contribution of a single non-target lesion may be inthe setting of CR having otherwise been achieved: failure to examine one
non-target in that setting will leave you unable to claim CR. It is also
possible that the non-target lesion has undergone such substantialprogression that it would override the target disease and render patientPD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of the measurable
disease is stable or responding
A patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does conﬁrmation of PR have to
take place in sequential scans or is a case like this conﬁrmed PR?It is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark.
In this case, most would consider PR to have been conﬁrmed looking at
this overall case. Had there been two or three non-PR observationsbetween the two time point PR responses, the most conservativeapproach would be to consider this case SD
In the setting of a breast cancer neoadjuvant study, wouldmammography not be used to assess lesions? Is CT preferred inthis setting?Neither CT nor mammography are optimal in this setting. MRI is thepreferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting
A patient has a lesion measurable by [CONTACT_337403]. Which should be followed?CT scan. Always follow by [CONTACT_337404]ﬁed
A lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic in thecentre. How should this be measured?The longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually,necrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. Inreporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this
phenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis
inhibitors) may produce this effect
If I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size
for measurability?MRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but notlung. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm)
as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm and nogap. In the event the MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of ameasurable lesion at baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In
the event there are inter-slice gaps, this also needs to be considered in
determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline
Can PET–CT be used with RECIST? At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a
combined PET–CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for usewith RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented thatthe CT performed as part of a PET–CT is of the same diagnostic quality as
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the PET–CT can be used
for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CTintroduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is notroutinely or serially performed246 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 –[ADDRESS_1043336], Cascino TL, Schold Jr SC, Cairncross JG.

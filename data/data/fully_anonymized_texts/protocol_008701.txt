Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, [ADDRESS_724421] disease (GVHD), increase the graft-versus-leukemia 
(GVL) effect and reduce the risk of post-transplant graft rejection.  
 
Through incremental transplant clinical trials we have shown that by [CONTACT_551398] (CD34+ 
cell) and T lymphocyte (CD3+ cell) dose, severe GVHD can be reduced whilst beneficial GVL effects can be preserved. We found that T cell depleted transplants using the Nexell/Baxter Isolex 300i system 
and subsequently, the Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34+ system to obtain high CD34+ doses depleted of 
lymphocytes were safe to administer and associated with less severe acute GVHD and promising response 
rates and overall survival. Our previous trials have helped us to create the transplant environment 
(significant lymphodepletion and minimal post-transp lant immunosuppression) that make for an ideal 
platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy. Adoptive cell transfer is the passive transfer of immune 
cells, into a new recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551328].  
 
This protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD [ADDRESS_724422] to IDE# [ZIP_CODE], and all other 
aspects of clinical management on this protocol ar e standard care. The target CD34+ dose range will be 
>3 x 10
6/kg and the target CD3+ dose range will be 5 x 104/kg to 1 x 106/kg. Once we demonstrate 
adequacy of this platform for engraftment and absence of significant GVHD in ten consecutive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
we will seek IRB permission to proceed with planned adoptive cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 The protocol will accrue up to 96 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379334] 10-80 with a hematological malignancy and 
their HLA-matched sibling donors, in whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched 
sibling would be routinely indicated. Diagnostic categories will include acute and chronic leukemia, 
myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphomas, multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative syndromes.  
 
Subjects will receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg total), 
fludarabine (125 mg/m
2 total) and total body irradiation (1200 cGy with lung shielding to 600 cGy), 
followed by [CONTACT_60801] a stem cell product selected for CD34+ progenitors using the Miltenyi 
CliniMACS® system.  Older subjects will receive a lower dose of irradiation (800 or 600 cGy based on 
age) to reduce the regimen intensity.  
The overall objective is to assess the feasibility of using this system as a platform for cellular 
immunotherapy initiatives. The primary study endpoint  will be overall survival at day +200. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_551329]-relapse mortality at day +200. Secondary endpoints will be standard 
transplant outcome variables such as non-hematolo gic toxicity, incidence and severity of acute and 
chronic GVHD and relapse of disease.

 4 1.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 To determine the safety and efficacy of using the Miltenyi CliniMACS CD34 selection system for 
graft manipulation in HLA-matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 
 
1.2  To characterize the feasibility of using the Miltenyi CliniMACS CD34selection system as a 
platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation. 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation 
 
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has long been recognized as a curative treatment for a variety of hematologic malignant diseases (Armitage 1994). Over time this technique has improved mainly 
through significantly diminished non-relapse mortality. One notable advance has been the use of 
reduced-intensity transplants for toxicity reduction and the use of T cell depletion for graft versus 
host disease (GVHD) control. However, these transplants often fail to control the hematological 
malignancy (Georges and Storb 2003, Marmont , et al  1991, Platzbecker , et al  2004).  Relapse of 
disease is now the main problem (Barrett and Battiwalla 2011). Data from the Center for 
International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (http://www.cibmtr.org/) on over 30,[ADDRESS_724424] remained unchanged (20% for early disease, 40% for intermediate disease, and 
60% for advanced disease subjects).  Disease-free survival follows the same trend (65% for early 
disease, 40% for intermediate disease, and 20% for advanced leukemia). 
 
2.2 Complications of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation 
 
Death after stem cell transplantation can be ca tegorized as relapse and non-relapse mortality 
(NRM). NRM includes GVHD, infection and organ toxicity.  
 
2.2.1 Relapse 
 
The curative potential of allogeneic stem cell tran splantation is largely dictated by [CONTACT_551399] (see 2.1 above) and disease free survival for advanced hematological malignancies has not 
changed significantly in recent years. To prevent relapse, subjects receive a chemo-radiotherapy 
conditioning regimen which is as intensive as they can tolerate. Based on previously reported experience for the treatment of elderly subjects with stem cell allografts we will use a reduced 
intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine (Flu), cyclophosphamide (Cy) and reduced-dose 
total body irradiation (TBI) for subjects 55 years and older of age (Khoury et al. 2001, Weisser et 
al. 2004). The use of reduced-intensity conditioning for elderly subjects is a broadly accepted 
standard of care treatment and will not be part of the scientific questions addressed in this research 
protocol. In addition, there is a powerful immune  response (graft-versus-leukemia, GVL effect) 
from the donor’s T cells and natural killer cel ls. However because transplants also cause GVHD, it 
is necessary to give immunosuppression after th e graft which reduces but does not eliminate 
GVHD, but decreases the GVL effect.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_724425] disease (GVHD) represents a major complication of allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) or peripher al blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), leading to significant 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 5 transplantation associated morbidity  and mortality. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_551330] (CSA) or 
methotrexate (MTX) or both, acute GVHD occurs in 30% to 50% of subjects receiving transplants 
from HLA-identical siblings. Long term survival in subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_551331] 30% (Barrett 1993, Barrett 1997, Beatty , et al  1991, Storb , et al  1986, 
Weisdorf , et al  1990).   
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_724426] greatly improved the management of infection after transplant. 
Infectious death now mainly occurs when infection complicates GVHD in the setting of intense immunosuppression. 
 
2.2.4 Other complications  
  Some subjects die from major organ failure due to conditioning regimen toxicity and to the 
consequence of pre-transplant treatments fo r their malignancy. Depending on the underlying 
transplantation approach (e.g. conditioning regimen) th e transplant can fail to engraft in up to 5% of 
cases.    
 
2.3   Ex Vivo T Cell Depletion 
 
 T cell depletion is a technique where lymphocytes are removed from allografts. T cell depleted 
transplantation can prevent GVHD but results in delayed immune recovery which increases the risk of viral infections (HSV, CMV or EBV), graft rejection as well as relapse of the malignant 
disease (Appelbaum 2001, Barrett 1993, Barrett 1997, Barrett and Malkovska 1996, Goldman , et 
al 1988, Marmont , et al  1991).  
 
Prior Hematology Branch protocols utilized the Nexell/Baxter Isolex 300i system to obtain high CD34+ doses depleted of lymphocytes to a fixed CD3+ T cell dose. The use of the cell separator 
and the monoclonal antibodies was covered by [CONTACT_551400] 8139 and the protocol series 99-H-0046, 02-
H-0211, 03-H-0192, 03-H-0209 and 04-H-0112.  Between 1997 and 2004, 138 subjects were 
treated on these protocols (Montero , et al  2006).They received a myeloablative T cell depleted 
peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The T-cell dose was adjusted to 0.2-1x10
5 CD3+ cells/kg.  The CD34+ dose was 2.7 –16 x106/kg.  Subjects 
with less than grade II acute GVHD received 1 or 2 donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) of 107 
CD3+ cells/kg between days [ADDRESS_724427] (n=77) or high (n=61) relapse risk according to their pre-transpla nt characteristics. Overall survival (OS), relapse 
free survival, relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 58%, 46%, 40% and 20%, 
respectively, after a median follow up of 4 years. Fifty-three (39%) and 21(15%) subjects 
developed grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD.  Forty-two (36%) had limited and 29 (25%) 
extensive chronic GVHD. In multivariate analysis, disease risk was an independent factor for OS 
and relapse, the day 30 lymphocyte count (LC30) for OS and NRM, and chronic GVHD for OS 
and relapse. In summary, these results show promising overall survival with low non-relapse 
mortality. 
 In 2006, we utilized the Miltenyi CliniMACS immunomagnetic selection system to select for 
CD34+ cells (IND [ZIP_CODE])achieving ~4-log CD3+ lymphocyte depletion on protocol # 06-H-
0248(Battiwalla , et al  2011). At last analysis, the protocol continues to exceed its primary 
endpoint goal of day 200 overall survival >75%. Fifty-five subjects with hematologic

Version date: April 12, [ADDRESS_724428] em cell transplantation (HSCT) with a graft 
from their HLA-identical siblings. The median age was 43 years (range 13-68), 25/55 were 
males. Transplant indications were AML(27), ALL(14), acute biphenotypic leukemia(2), 
MDS/MPD(6), NHL/CLL(4), CMMoL(1) and CML(1). 47% were standard risk and 53% were at 
high risk for relapse. Subjects received myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide (60 
mg/kg/dose x 2), fludarabine (25 mg/m2/dose x 5) and total body irradiation (12 Gy in 8 fractions, 
lungs shielded to 6Gy). Fifteen subjects, who were 55 years of age or older, received 4 Gy 
divided in 8 fractions without lung shielding. G- CSF mobilized peripheral blood grafts from the 
donor were CD34+ selected (Miltenyi CliniMACS), with infusion of a target CD34+ dose of 
6x106/kg and a fixed CD3+ dose of 5x104/kg. Low-dose cyclosporine (100-200ng/mL) till day 21 
was the only GVHD prophylaxis. Delayed lymphocyte add back (5x106 CD3+/kg) was given at 
day 90 if subjects had no significant GVHD. CD3+ and myeloid chimerism analyses were 
performed with early lymphocyte add-back in cases with falling chimerism. Day 200 overall 
survival (the primary study endpoint) was 86.7%. One subject, who was postpartum, failed to 
engraft and required a second transplant. Thirty seven out of 39 subjects achieved complete 
(>95%) donor myeloid chimerism by [CONTACT_4475]14. The median times to complete donor CD3+ 
chimerism were day30 for 12 Gy subjects and >6 months for 4 Gy subjects (Mann Whitney test, 
p=0.004). The incidence of acute GVHD grade II, III and IV were 29%, 18% and 0%, 
respectively for all subjects and significantly lower for those who did not receive the routine DLI. 
The incidence of chronic limited or extensive GVHD was 34 and 11%, respectively. At a median 
follow up of 2.5 years, Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse, NRM and OS were 31%, 37% and 
50% respectively without any significant difference based on conditioning intensity.  
 Figure 1: Overall survival, relapse and NRM observed in subjects treated on protocol 06-H-0248 
 
Outside the NIH, equally encouraging results with ex vivo T cell depletion using CD34+ depletion 
have just been reported from the multicenter Clinical Trials Network (CTN) protocol #0303 (Devine , et al  2011). A total of 44 subjects with AML in CR1 (n = 37) or CR2 (n = 7) with a 
median age of 48.5 years (range, 21-59 years) received myeloablative chemotherapy and 
fractionated total body irradiation (1375 cGy) followed by [CONTACT_551401]34-
enriched, T cell depleted allografts from HLA-identical siblings. No pharmacologic GVHD 
prophylaxis was given. All subjects engrafted. The incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV was 22.7%, and the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 6.8% at 24 months. The relapse rate for 
subjects in CR1 was 17.4% at 36 months. With a median follow-up of 34 months, DFS for all 
subjects was 82% at 6 months, and DFS for subjects in CR1 was 72.8% at 12 months and 58% at 
36 months. 
 
In 2012, protocol# 06-H-0248 was replaced by a more complicated ex-vivo graft manipulation 
protocol 12-H-0028, which also utilized the Miltenyi CliniMACS platform and combined CD34+ 
progenitor selection with depletion of CD3+ (T-lymphocytes) responsible for acute GVHD as well 

Protocol # 13-H-0144

Version date: April 12, 2018  
 7 as depletion of CD19+ (B-lymphocytes) responsible  for chronic GVHD. This method was designed 
to preserve NK cells and CD34+ cells, while achiev ing a comparable degree (~ 3.5 log) of CD3+ 
depletion. Preservation of NK cells in protocol 12-H-0028 was intended to provide the theoretical 
advantage of reducing viral infections and relapse without impacting GVHD. We found that target 
cell doses were attained, however there was an unexpected increase in early acute GVHD when a T 
cell addback of 50x104CD3+/kg was given (Table 1). In contrast, in subsequent subjects with a T 
cell addback as low as 5 x 104 CD3+/kg, (equating with the CD3+ dose in the 06-H-0248 protocol), 
subjects experienced low donor chimerism including outright engraftment failures despi[INVESTIGATOR_551332].

The reason for these outcomes on 12-H-0028 is unclear, but cannot be simply explained on the 
basis of CD3+ dose alone. More problematic is that the dynamic range of CD3+ dosing is 
unacceptably narrow (1-log), and not controlled by [CONTACT_551402]3+ addback dose. In summary, 
while overall survival on 12/16/2012 was 100% for the cohort of 13 subjects transplanted, the 
unpredictability of outcome, characterized on the one hand by [CONTACT_551403] 12-H-0028 unacceptable for continued development as a 
platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.  
 
The current protocol will revert to positive CD34+ selection as used in the 06-H-[ADDRESS_724429].  
 
Ex Vivo T Cell Depletion: 
Our prior T cell depletion protocols achieved promis ing results for overall survival and significantly 
reduced non-relapse mo rtality (Battiwalla , et al  2011, Montero , et al  2006).The extramural 
published experience with CD34+ selection also s hows reductions in GVHD without increase in 
relapse(Devine , et al  2011). The Isolex system employed for stem cell selection up to 2005was 
withdrawn from the market. The CliniMACSCD34 se lection system preservesCD34+ cells (yield is 
reliably >50% but typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 75%), but induces a 4- log reduction in T lymphocytes (responsible for 
acute GVHD) along with a similar degree of reduction in B lymphocytes (contributes to chronic 
GVHD). We expect the final CD3+ counts at the end of the selection process to range between 
5x104/kg to 1x106/kg, providing sufficient protection from GVHD on the one hand, and yet 
providing adequate T cells for safe engraftment on the other hand. The delayed T cell add-back at 
day [ADDRESS_724430] until day +21, or until engraftment is stable. 
However, CSA cessation will provide an immunos uppression-free environment for the T cells to 
expand sufficiently and develop strong GVL effects as required for relapse-control. We will select

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THIS PROTOCOL  
 
Distinctive features of this pr otocol are shown in context of serial protocol development in Table 2 . 
 Table 2: SEQUENTIAL PROTOCOL CHANGE SUMMARY TABLE 
 
 
Generation of T cell depleted stem cell product: We will continue to utilize the Miltenyi 
CliniMACS system but will revert to using CD34+ selection alone to deplete the donor stem cell 
graft of lymphocytes. The Miltenyi CliniMACS is a clinical-scale immunomagnetic system widely 
used in Europe and is available in the [LOCATION_003] under an IND/IDE. This system uses CD34antibody-
coated magnetic bead reagent manufactured for clinical use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) Cell Processing Section has extensive 
experience in generating CD34+ enriched stem cell products. 
 
Intensity of the TBI conditioning for older subjects (≥55 years):  In this protocol, we will continue to 
include older subjects. Based on previously reported experience for the treatment of the elderly we 
will use reduced intensity conditioning with Flu/Cy and reduced dose TBI for these subjects 
(Khoury et al. 2001, Weisser et al. 2004). However, in the 06-H-0248 protocol, 400 cGy TBI resulted in sluggish conversion to full donor CD3+ chimerism compared to 1200cGy (median 180 
days versus 30 days, p <0.001). This has often required premature DLIs to rescue failing grafts.

We will therefore increase the intensity of TBI to 600cGy for the reduced-dose cohort in this 
protocol. This increase to 600 cGy was well tolerated in subjects above 55 years in the 12-H-0028 
protocol and will continue. 
 The TBI dose will be further increased for some of the older subjects by [CONTACT_551404] 
12/2015 in a graded fashion. [Age ≥55 to <65 yrs =1200 cGy(with lung shielding to 600 cGy); ≥65 
to <75 yrs = 800 cGy (with lung shielding to 600 cGy); ≥75 to 80 yrs =600 cGy] The rationale is to 
reduce the risk of relapse (which is usually lethal),  currently at 58% in subjects over age 55. TBI at 
600cGy has been extremely well tolerated in these subjects over age 55 and the TRM rate is actually 0% at the time of this amendment, which makes room for increasing TBI dose. The 
justification is based upon the relatively lower toxi city of our TBI approach, measures taken to 
reduce TBI toxicity, existing practice at other centers and evolving evidence to maximize 
conditioning intensity when possible. 
 Avoidance of Routine Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI):  Before PBSCT, the donor will undergo 
leukapheresis in order to collect lymphocytes for possible future transfusion to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The leukapheresis collection will be divided and stored as 2 or more products in DTM. In our previous 
protocols, we had gradually postponed a DLI till day 90. The extramural experience with T 
lymphocyte depletion has avoided delayed DLI entirely (Devine , et al  2011).  Additionally, both 
acute and chronic GVHD were increased in frequency and grade in 06-H-[ADDRESS_724432] clinical indications: for relapse, falling or delayed chimerism.  
 
Platform for adoptive immunotherapy strategies: Our goal for advancing allogeneic HSCT 
strategies is to develop a T cell depletion platfo rm for adoptive cellular immunotherapy to minimize 
GVHD and optimize antiviral and antimalignancy immune responses. In sequential clinical trials at 
NIH we have used ex-vivo T cell depletion to develop an HSCT with minimal graft versus host 
disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising low dose cyclosporine alone till day +21. Tcell depletion 
creates the lymphodepleted environment for preferential homeostatic expansion of adoptively 
infused cells, while minimization of post-transp lant immunosuppression promotes expansion of the 
adoptively transfused cells. The adop tive transfer concept will be explored in this protocol, once [ADDRESS_724433] enrolled and demonstrat ed satisfactory outcomes (full engraftment in at 
least 9 subjects and acute GVHD of - grade II-IV <40%), Section 11.5. This criterion has been met

7.6 Preparative Regimen  
 
x Fludarabine (Flu):  25 mg/m2/dose IV infusion once daily over approximately 30 minutes 
(e.g. 20 to 60 minutes)  on Days -8, -7, -6, -5, and -4 (total dose of 125 mg/m2). Dose 
adjustment for reduced creatinine clearance is required per the product label. 
 
x Total body irradiation (TBI) : 
 
Energy 
All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389594] a linear accelerator using energies higher than 4MV.  Timing 
It is anticipated that TBI will be delivered on days -7, -6, -5, -4  
 
Technique 
TBI will be delivered with lateral fields using extended SAD values of 600cm.  For subjects receiving 1200 cGy, partial transmission lung blocks will be used combined with AP/PA 
Mediastinal Boost fields using full blocks in the lung area.  Tissue compensators will be used 
as appropriate for all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Gonadal shielding will not be used.  
Dose/Fractionation 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317933] [ADDRESS_724446] 6 hours apart (eight total treatments in four 
days).  The mediastinal boost fields will be delivered at a dose of 75cGy per fraction for a total dose of 600cGy, also at least six hours apart. The median lung dose goal is 600 cGy 
from the total treatment. 
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 65 years to <[ADDRESS_724447] 6 hours apart (eight tota l treatments in four days).  The mediastinal 
boost fields will be delivered at a dose of [ADDRESS_724448] 6 hours apart (eight total treatments in four days).  No mediastinal boost 
field will be used. 
 
Dose Modifications 
Occasionally, the total dose/technique of TBI may require modifications due to patient factors (unexpected or serious (grade 4-5) adverse events, serious medical illnesses not conducive to stable patient transfer, patient refusal, etc.) or treatment factors (linear accelerator machine 
offline, etc.) Modifications to the radiation trea tment will be at the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist and will be discussed with the PI.

Version date: April 12, 2018  
 17 x Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 60 mg/kg/dose IV infusion administered over approximately 1 to 2 
hours  once daily for 2 doses on Days -3 and -2 (total dose of 120 mg/kg).  Infusion rate may be 
extended if necessary for infusion associated toxi cities. Mesna and intravenous hydration will be 
given concurrently with the cyclophosphamide doses as based on current NIH BMT Consortium 
Supportive Care Guidelines. 
 
7.7 Stem Cell Transplantation Day 0  
 
The target and acceptable range of cell doses (given in terms of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148]) are: 
 
CD34+ cells   
Target dose:  6 x 106/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551341]: maximum- None; minimum- 3 x 106/ kg  
  
CD3+ cells (T cell add back)   
Target dose: Based upon our experience with previous protocols 06-H-0248 and 
12-H-0028, for relatively chemo-naïve subjects (e.g. MDS, CML), and for those who 
receive 600cGy TBI, the target dose will be 5 x 105CD3+/kg. All other subjects will 
receive 5 x 104 CD3+/kg. Target doses may be further individualized based upon 
engraftment kinetics as the protocol progresses. As of amendment dated July 1, 2016, 
subjects receiving adoptive cell therapy such as multiviral T lymphocytes between days [ADDRESS_724449] graft will not require the CD3+ addback. 
 
Acceptable range: maximum 1 x 10e6 CD3+/kg; minimum 0 CD3+/ kg  
 
The source of CD3+ cells will be an aliquot of the G-CSF mobilized apheresis product. 
 
If the final CD3+ dose is greater than 1 x 106/kg this is designated a technical failure of the 
selection process. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551342] (and additional methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis- Section 8.5) but their outcome will be analyzed separately.  
 
The ex vivo processing and required product safety testing is detailed in section 8.5.  
 
7.8 GVHD prophylaxis 
Cyclosporine (CSA) will be initiated at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg IV every twelve hours day –6 to day 
+21 to reduce the risk of graft failure.  (Change to equivalent oral dose when able to tolerate with 
dose adjusted to achieve levels 100-200 ng/ml).  The initial cyclosporine dose (1.5 mg/kg IV 
every 12 hours) will be based on the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s  actual body weight unless the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551343] 
(body mass index > 35); in which case the cyclosporine dose will be based on an adjusted / practical body weight (mid-point between ideal body weight and actual body weight; see NIH 
BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines). Cyclosporine may continue beyond day 21 if 
there is risk of incomplete donor CD3+ engraftment. Cyclosporine may be substituted at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_551344]. 
 
Subjects who have a technical failure of graft processing and receive a CD3+ dose >1 x 106/kg, 
will receive additional methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis at a dose of 5mg/m2 which will be given by [CONTACT_12781] [ADDRESS_724450]-transplant on days 1,3 and 6. Methotrexate dose adjustments 
for renal or hepatic dysfunction will be based on NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care 
Guidelines.

Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 19 x Fit to donate: Orientation - visit to Department of Transfusion Medicine - inspection of veins to 
determine the need for a central line for apheresis. It is estimated that about 50% of the donors 
will require apheresis catheter placement to successfully complete apheresis.  
x Counseling on filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilization and donation of leukocytes 
 
8.2  Pre-consent Evaluation and Concurrent Care of Minor Donors (donors less than age 18 
only) 
For donors less than age 18, a social worker and/or mental health specialist (psychologist or 
psychiatrist) will meet with the minor prior to the assent process to confirm willingness to 
participate. For donors less than age 18, a separate pediatric provider who is charged solely to 
consider the health and welfare of the minor donor will be provided. This practitioner will serve as the donor’s health care provider and advocate  during the minor’s participation on the clinical 
trial. 
 
8.3 Donor Lymphocyte Collection – Pre-transplant 
 
One 10-15 liter apheresis will be collected prior to or 2 or more days after filgrastim (G-CSF) 
mobilization and stem cell collection, to obtain 1 x 10
10 lymphocytes for cryopreservation of DLI 
(at least one aliquot of 5 x 106/kg, additional aliquots for clinical use, and an aliquot for in vitro 
laboratory research studies [section 10.0]). If a central catheter is necessary, please refer to NIH 
BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines. 
 
8.4 Donor Mobilization with G-CSF 
After medical evaluation and clearance for suitability as an allogeneic donor by [CONTACT_389689], the donor will undergo  mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF) as an 
outpatient. Filgrastim (G-CSF) will be administered based on body weight (see below) for up to 6 
days, subcutaneously.  Filgrastim (G-CSF) will be administered according to a vial-based 
algorithm to reduce wastage, improve donor compliance, and optimize CD34 yields. The doses 
for days 1-[ADDRESS_724452] one hour prior to starting apheresis.  Predictable side effects of 
filgrastim (G-CSF), including headache, bone pain, and myalgia, will be treated with 
acetaminophen or ibuprofen or oxycodone. Prophylactic treatment of these side effects with the 
same medications may be elected.  Other side effects will be evaluated and treated accordingly.  
Donor Wt           Total daily filgrastim (G-CSF) Dose (range) 
19-30 kg  300 mcg (10.0 to 15.8 mcg/kg) 31-37 kg  480 mcg (10.0 to 13.0 mcg/kg) 
38 - 48 kg 600 mcg (12.5 to 15.8 mcg/kg) 49 - 56 kg 780 mcg (13.9 to 15.9 mcg/kg) 
57 - 60 kg 900 mcg (15.0 to 15.8 mcg/kg) 
61 - 67 kg  960 mcg (14.3 to 15.7 mcg/kg) 
68 - 108 kg         1080 mcg (10.0 to 15.9 mcg/kg) 
> 109 kg             1200 mcg (11.0 or less) 
 
8.5 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Co llection &Ex Vivo Processing   
 
PBSC apheresis will be done on days 5 and 6 of filgrastim (G-CSF), i.e., after the 5th and 6th 
doses of filgrastim (G-CSF) (which are given in the early morning).  All apheresis procedures 
will be done using a 2-armed approach or by [CONTACT_551408]. If a central catheter is necessary, please refer to 
NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines . 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018

Anticoagulation will be accomplished with ACD-A.  If the donor is small or intolerant to ACD-
A, and the adverse citrate effects cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_389692] (slowing flow rate, oral or 
IV calcium), consideration will be given to using heparin anticoagulation.   
 
Donors will receive divalent cation prophylaxis to prevent citrate toxicity during apheresis, in accordance with standard DTM policies. The volume processed per apheresis procedure will be 
determined by [CONTACT_389691], based on peak CD34 cell mobilization 
response to GCSF and the CD34 cell dose needed, based on kilogram weight of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  This 
will range from 15 to 30 liters processed per day for up to 2 days, not to exceed a total of 60 liters 
over 2 days.  In donors weighing less than 40 kg, a maximum of 8 blood volumes will be processed per day, for up to 2-3 days. 
 
The second day apheresis collection will not be required if the CD34+ dose is 4 x10
6/kg or more 
after the first day of collection, processing and selection.  
 
The aim is to provide a CD34+ selected graft with a minimum of 3x 106/kg and a maximum of 10 
x 106/kg CD34+ cells within the constraint of a maximum CD3+ cell dose of 1 x 106kg.  
 
If the minimum CD34+ cell dose is not achieved after the first apheresis and if it is predicted, 
based on the circulating CD34+ cell count prior to the first apheresis and the CD34+ yield in the 
apheresis component, that the minimum cell dose will not be achievable with a second 
consecutive apheresis, then plerixafor may be a dded to a sixth dose of filgrastim prior to the 
second procedure. The dose of plerixafor is 0.24 mg/kg SC given at [ADDRESS_724453] one 
hour prior to the start of the second apheresis procedure.  
 
If the minimum CD34+ cell dose has not been achieved after one cycle of mobilization, a 2nd 
mobilization with up to two full apheresis collections to achieve the minimum post-selection 
CD34+ cell dose may be performed after an interval of at least 14 days.  
 
In the event insufficient number of CD34+ cells are mobilized to allow for efficient selection by 
[CONTACT_551409], subsequent courses of mobilization will only be processed through the Miltenyi system if the minimum target of total CD34+ cell dose (3 
x 10
6/kg) is predicted to be obtained following Milteny i selection.  If the post Miltenyi processing 
total CD34+ cell dose is predicted to be less than the minimum total target CD34+ cell dose, the 
CD34 positively selected cells from the first apheresis procedure will be combined with the 
CD34+ unselected  cells collected following subsequent mobilization procedures so that the 
minimum target stem cell dose is provided.  
 
Because the unselected CD34+ fraction (containing the required additional stem cell number) will 
retain all lymphocytes, the graft will be considered  a T-replete stem cell graft with associated 
increased risk of GVHD.    This technical failure of the mobilization process will be reported to 
the IRB and the FDA. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551346].  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551347].

 21 Stem cell products will be cryopreserved after each collection and stored until transfusion into the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (see NIH Clinical Center, DTM, Cell Processing Section’s SOPs).  From experience 
with over [ADDRESS_724455] cases both the CD34+ 
cell target and the CD3+ T cell target will be achieved.  In the majority of donors, peripheral 
blood stem cell processing with the Miltenyi system will result in doses of CD3+ cells well below 
5 x 104/kg. In such cases the T cell dose will be adjusted to ensure that at least 5 x 104/kg are 
transfused with the allograft. The source of CD3+ T cells for the addback will be an aliquot from 
G-CSF mobilized lymphocytes. 
 
The erythrocyte content of the apheresis product is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_724456] operating procedures of the DTM Cell

Donors will be contact[CONTACT_551411] [ADDRESS_724457] care protocol 94-H-0010. 
 
9.0 MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS 
 
The major complications are reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV), acute and chronic GVHD, 
leukemic relapse, and graft failure. Subjects with these complications will be treated as follows: 
9.1 Viral Reactivation: Will be managed according with standard antivirals according to NIH BMT 
Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines.  
 
Overwhelming Viral Infection: Additional unscheduled add-back of lymphocytes (a bulk DLI, 
please see section 7.12), may be given at any time if  an indication arises such as viral infections, 
EBV lymphoproliferative disorder. Add-back may be given in the presence of GVHD, if the 
investigator considers the risk from overwhelming viral infection to outweigh the risk of 
exacerbating GVHD.  
 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 22 9.2 Acute GVHD ( See NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines). GVHD markers have 
been recently validated in the clinical setting and will be utilized to guide therapy when available. 
Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_551348] (MSCs) or other clinical trials. 
 
9.3 Chronic GVHD ( See also NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines ) 
x Cyclosporine at standard dose. 
x Prednisone dosed according to severity. 
x Change to alternate day steroid and cyclosporine therapy when response is established. 
x Non-responding subjects may be treated with other standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389610], extracorporeal photopheresis, low-dose IL2, mycophenolate, 
azathioprine, photopheresis, daclizumab, infliximab, rituximab, MSCs (on clinical trial), 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors or thalidomide at  the discretion of the attending physician.   
 
9.4 Graft Failure:  Failure to achieve a neutrophil count of 200/ μl by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_724458]-transplant and the 
aplastic appearance of a marrow sample taken 21-28 days after transplant will be deemed primary 
graft failure (also known as failure to engraft).  
 
 Delayed (secondary) graft failure after initial achievement of ANC recovery to >500/ PL for three 
consecutive occasions is a recognized risk from T cell depleted transplantation. In such cases, loss of donor CD3+ chimerism precedes loss of donor myeloid chimerism. Donor CD3+ chimerism 
will be carefully monitored and falling donor CD3+ chimerism will be treated with escalating 
dose DLI +/- prior conditioning. 
Stem cell rescue/boost from a CD34+ selected graft from the original donor may be necessary in 
cases of graft failure. This is permissible under  the protocol after suitable preconditioning, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_164346] +cyclophosphamide + either ATG or Campath. However, stem cell boost 
for primary graft failure will declare the subjects as having reached an end of study criterion, and 
the subjects will at that point be taken off study and be offered a standard care protocol or an 
experimental protocol if available. Note:  Stem cell boosts for secondary graft failure or other 
cytopenias will not represent an end of study event.  
9.5 Relapse of Hematologic Malignancy: Markers for minimal residual disease will be 
incorporated, where available, into  the management of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
Standard approaches to 
minimal residual disease monitoring include  flow cytometry, PCR and array-based 
techniques, which are unique to each type of malignancy.   
 
As the mortality for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551349] +[ADDRESS_724459] relapsed will be managed as detailed in section 11.6.2.  
 
x Subjects with detectable disease may receive pre-transplant chemotherapy as clinically indicated 
to decrease disease burden and increase the chance of successful transplantation as detailed section 7.1).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_551350] e transplant therapy or initiating similar post-
transplant antineoplastic therapy (such as rituximab for CLL, imatinib for CML, sorafenib for 
Flt3-ITD AML or other standard care treatments) on an individual basis (especially in the setting 
of detectable disease at or after transplant).

Version date: April 12, 2018  
 23 9.6 Pulmonary Engraftment Syndrome:  Subjects who develop pulmonary engraftment syndrome 
(most likely 10-[ADDRESS_724460]-transplant ) will be treated with steroids.  
 
9.7 Delayed or Falling Donor Chimerism: This will be detected by [CONTACT_551412]. DLI, 
with or without pretreatment by [CONTACT_551413], may be given in the setting 
of poor chimerism, falling chimerism or delayed chimerism which places the subject at increased 
risk of relapse. Subjects showing poor engraftment unresponsive to standard treatments may be 
offered treatment with bone marrow stromal cell infusions on another applicable NHLBI 
protocol.  
 
9.8 Organ failure: Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_551351] (pulmonary, GI, GU or hepatic) unresponsive 
to standard treatments may be offered treatment with bone marrow stromal cell infusions on 
clinical trial.  
 
9.9 Reactions to the graft and ABO incompatibility:  Instances of infusional reactions and ABO 
incompatibility are expected to be rare given the manipulation of the stem cell graft. For 
management please refer to NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines.  
 
9.10 Endothelial Damage Syndromes: These comprise a spectrum of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_551352], posterior reversib le encephalopathy syndrome, diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage, idiopathic pneumonitis, sinusoidal occlusive syndrome/veno-occlusive disease and 
delayed cardiovascular disease. Management includes removal of triggers (calcineurin 
inhibitor/sirolimus) and defibrotide according to NIH BMT Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines.  
 
9.11 Cytokine release syndrome/cytokine storm:  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_36882] (engraftment 
syndrome) but may occur beyond 1 ye ar. A triggering event such as viral infection or PTLD may 
be identifiable. The diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_551353]. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946] (with anasarca, hypoalbuminemia, pre-renal azotemia, 
effusions, lung infiltrate) is a distinctive manifestation and may respond to IL6 blockade. Other 
findings are non-specific- cytopenias, coagulopa thy, high fevers, transaminitis, delirium, 
cardiopulmonary, rash and organ failure. Char acterization could involve CRP, ferritin, 
triglyceride, soluble CD25 receptor, IL1/TNF-a/IFN-g/IL6 levels, endothelial damage markers, coagulation parameters, imaging, marrow/skin biopsy. The severity of inflammation and clinical 
features may mimic that of secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis(HLH) / 
Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and there ma y even be features of vasculitis on tissue 
biopsy.  Management is supportive with anti-inflammatory therapy and treatment of an 
underlying trigger. 
 
10.0 ANCILLARY LABORATORY RESEARCH STUDIES 
 
10.1 Research Sample Collection 
 With Amendment Q, Sept 2017, research sample collection will cease. 
 
During the course of participating on this study, specimens will be collected for correlative 
studies as follows:  
 
10.1.1   Blood Sample from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551354], cytokines, lymphocyte subsets, malignancy 
antigen expression, minimal residual disease, graf t-versus-leukemia effects will be collected as 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, [ADDRESS_724461] of IRB approv ed Hematology Branch Research Studies. Note: 
per NIH guidelines, the amount of blood that may be drawn from adult patients and volunteers for research purposes shall not exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any 
eight week period.  For pediatric patients, no more than 5 mL/kg may be drawn for research 
purposes in a single day, and no more than 9.5 mL/kg may be drawn over any eight-week period. 
 
x Preconditioning: 100 ml peripheral blood draw any time before starting conditioning 
(this blood draw replaces an apheresis session). 
x *Weekly peripheral blood draw (interval +/- 4days): Not to exceed 40 ml starting 
after day+ 14 through day+120or weight-based maximum. [* not collected on weeks 
of 120 mL collection] 
x Days 30, 60, 90,120 blood draw (+/- 7 days):  Not to exceed 120 ml or weight-based 
maximum 
x 6 month interval visits (+/- 3months): Not to exceed120 ml or weight-based 
maximum 
 
10.1.2  Apheresis: One apheresis collection of approximately [ADDRESS_724462]-transplant (when feasible per the PI).   
 
10.1.3  Blood sample from the donor (Optional). 30 ml peripheral blood day 14, 21, 30 and 60 
(when available). Donor leukocytes obtained at leukapheresis additional to those 
required for T cell add-back will be used for research studies investigating graft-versus-
leukemia effects and testing new T cell depletion techniques.  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s leukemia 
cells and normal lymphocytes will serve as targets for all subsequent testing of donor-
anti host responses.  
 
10.1.4 Patient Bone Marrow Samples: An extra volume (up to 25 ml) of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_551355]. The cells will be used to 
investigate lymphocyte interactions with bone marrow progenitor cell proliferation. No 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_551356] . 
 
10.2 Collection, Storage and Disposition of Sample s 
Intended use: These specimens will not be read by a pathologist or used for diagnostic purposes.   
These studies will not be used in assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken for 
descriptive or exploratory ancillary research, and have been approved by [CONTACT_551414] A  of the protocol.  Research data is the confidential property of the 
generating party, hence all such information sha ll not be disclosed outside of NIH for any purpose 
other than as described in section 12.6.  
Tracking:   Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS Research Screens.  Should a 
CRIS screen not be available, the NIH form 2803-[ADDRESS_724463]. John Barrett and will not be sent outside NIH without IRB notification and an 
executed MTA.  
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 25 Storage:   Research samples will be stored with identifiers in the secure laboratory of the [CONTACT_551429] using the NHLBI’s BSI tracking system . 
End of study procedures :  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no 
longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed.  
Loss or destruction of samples :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan for 
tracking and storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_724464] consistently used the day 200 overall survival endpoint for serial T cell depletion trials in the Hematology Branch, enabling us to identify potential problems early. The 
primary hypothesis is that the 200-day survival rate for subjects treated with allogeneic transplant 
using the Miltenyi CliniMACS CD34selection system will exceed 75%. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_724465] transplant outcome variables such as relapse, non-
relapse mortality, disease free survival, engraftmen t kinetics of donor neutrophils, platelets and 
lymphocytes, incidence and severity of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD (limited and extensive) 
and GVHD-free survival.  Technical failure rates and the use of DLIs will be tracked as will 
concurrent participation on adoptive antiviral/ antimalignancy cellular therapy protocols. 
Outcomes of transplants in subjects with advanced age will be tracked.  
Subjects who co-enroll onto any antiviral adoptiv e cellular therapy protocol (under IND# [ZIP_CODE]), 
will continue to have their primary and secondary endpoints measured on 13-H-0144 and will not 
be “removed”. Also, sinc e this is an objective of the 13-H-0144 protocol, we will compare 
primary and secondary endpoints in patients receiving the antiviral adoptive cellular therapy versus those who do not for various reasons such as: a. belonging to the first cohort of ~11 
subjects who did not receive antiviral cellular therapy  b. refusal to receive antiviral 
lymphocytes  c. death prior to administration of antiviral lymphocytes or  d. technical failure of 
manufacture and/ or release of the antiviral lymphocyte product. We also have the option of 
including in this comparison subjects on our pr ior CD34+ selected transplant trial (concluded 
protocol 06-H-0248, under this same IND), none of whom received antiviral lymphocytes. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_724466] 75%, and our treatment would be determined to be 
ineffective if the 200-day survival rate under this protocol is not higher than 75%. Our experience 
in protocol 06-H-0248 also suggests that the 200-day survival rate may be as high as 86%. Thus, 
we consider here the Simon’s “Optimum Two-Stage” design for testing the null hypothesis H0: 
“the 200-day survival rate is at or below 75%” versus the alternative H1:“the 200-day survival

Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 26 rate is 86% or higher” with 0.[ADDRESS_724467] stage if the true 200-day survival rate is likely to 
be 75% or lower.  Based on this design, we will accrue [ADDRESS_724468] stage, and the trial 
will be continued to the second stage if 25 or more patients are to survive to day 200. Otherwise, 
the trial will be stopped and the treatment will be  determined ineffective, i.e., the null hypothesis 
H0 will be accepted. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 96 patients will be accrued, and the treatment will be determined ineffective, i.e. the null hypothesis H0 will be accepted, if 
the total number of patients to survive to day 200 is less than or equal to 78. If the treatment is 
actually not effective, i.e., the null hypothesis is true; there is a 0.[ADDRESS_724469] a 20% probability of concluding  that it is not. The computation is carried out 
using the R Package “clinfun” version 1.0.5.  
 
11.4     Methods of Statistical Analysis  
 
Although the primary endpoint for this protocol occurs at 200 days, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551357] 36 months on protocol and then indefinitely on the long term follow up protocol (05-H-0130) 
so that the incidence of chronic GVHD, long-term disease-free and overall survival can be estimated.  At the completion of follow-up for all subjects, time-to-event distributions (disease-
free survival, non-relapse mortality and overall survival) will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method and 95% confidence intervals for the median time to events will be calculated (T. 
Therneau and P. Grambsch, “Modeling Survival Data, Extending the Cox Model”, Ch. 2, 2000, 
Springer: [LOCATION_001]). When deemed appropriate, regression models in survival analysis, such as the Cox Proportional Hazard model, competing risk models and frailty models, will be used to 
evaluate the effects of covariates, such as age, treatment group, disease, baseline history of prior 
transplant, use of DLI in response to infection on time-to-event distributions (T. Therneau and P. 
Grambsch, “Modeling Survival Data, Extending the Cox Model”, Ch. 3&8, 2000, Springer: New 
York). Logistic regression models (or other generalized linear models when deemed appropriate) 
will be used to evaluate the effects of covariates on the event rates of graft failure, chronic 
GVHD, leukemia relapse, NRM and other secondary endpoints.  
 
Subjects will not be replaced however their outcome will be analyzed separately if they receive a 
final product that is designated a technical failur e of the selection process (i.e. if the final CD3+ 
dose is greater than 5 x 10
5/kg CD3+ after reducing the CD34+ dose to 3 x 106/kg) (see section 
7.7) 
 
11.5     Dose Limiting Toxicity, Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_551358]-relapse mortality (NRM), a useful composite and early endpoint for overall safety . For safety NRM at day +[ADDRESS_724470]-transplant we will also analyze overal l survival at day +200. Overall survival reflects 
death from relapse and NRM. Subtracting NRM from overall survival provides an estimate of 
relapse since most subjects die after relapse of disease.  Although, not all subjects destined to 
relapse will have done so by [CONTACT_4475] +200, most relapses do occur by [CONTACT_221774]. The early estimate of 
relapse on day +[ADDRESS_724471] a tendency towards precocious relapse caused by [CONTACT_12695].   
 
Interim analysis for optimization of engraftment and GVHD prior to any adoptive cellular

Version date: April 12, 2018  
 27 The intended use of this trial is as a stab le, low-GVHD platform for adoptive immunotherapy. 
Engraftment and GVHD rates will be analyzed on an ongoing basis. Since lymphocyte depletion 
increases the risk of slow donor CD3+ engraftment,  adjustments in the dose of T cells added back 
on day [ADDRESS_724472] block of 10 
consecutive subjects will be analyzed. Future a doptive cellular transfer protocols will not start 
until the cohort of 10 consecutive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551359]:

x Complete (>95%) donor CD3+ lymphocyte chimerism achieved at no later than a 
median of [ADDRESS_724474]-transplant AND  
x Acute GVHD (grade II-IV) <40% AND  
x Formal IRB approval prior to adoptive cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

With amendment version 6-5-14, this protocol will now permit enrolled subjects to participate in adoptive cellular therapy protocols.”
 
 
Interim Analysis for Futility 
 
One interim analysis is planned based on overall survival after the first [ADDRESS_724477] been 
transplanted, section 11.3. In order to proceed to the second stage, 25 out of these 31 subjects 
need to survive beyond day 200. 
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16140] (Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]- Non-relapse mortality at day 200 & Late 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_551360] 2 years) 
 
To prevent the possibility of having an unacceptable rate in early non-relapse mortality (NRM) 
for the study, NRM at day 200 will be monitored as a safety endpoint. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_551361]. W e adopt 
the Bayesian approach of Geller et al. (2004) (Nancy L. Geller, Dean Follmann, Eric S. Leifer,

12.2.1  Definitions 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 33  
Adverse Event (AE):   Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s particip ation in the research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research. 
 An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: 
 
x Results in discontinuation from the study 
x Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
x Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
x Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
x Is judged by [CONTACT_52374] 
x If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  A serious adverse event that: 
x results in death; 
x is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred); 
x results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
x results in a persistent or significant incapacity; 
x results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
x based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
Serious event: An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if 
it requires immediate corrective action by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or rights 
of subjects. 
 Unanticipated Problem (UP) :  Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 
1. unexpected  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
2. related or possibly related  to participation in the research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event :  An unanticipated problem that does not fit 
the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involves risk 
to the subject, affect others in the research study , or significantly impact the integrity of research 
data.  For example, report occurrences of breaches  of confidentiality, accidental destruction of 
study records, or unaccounted-for study drug.

referring home physicians will be entered into the system. The principal investigator, associate 
investigators/research nurses and/or a contra cted data manager will assist with the data 
management efforts to ensure that data is verifiable and evaluable.   
 
Research data will be prospectively collected by [CONTACT_551415] a NHLBI Database.  
 
The database will maintain complete data records on each research subject. Subjective and 
objective patient experiences during the duration of the study will be documented in the patient 
medical record notes. These protocol notes will serve as the primary source material from which 
data will be collected and research analyses will be performed. Any pertinent supplementary 
information obtained from outside laboratories, outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], radiology reports, laboratory 
reports, or other patient records will be used as additional source for data collection. 
 Neither individual personal identifiers nor the key linking coded data to individuals will be 
released to Miltenyi Biotec, Inc . without prior IRB approval and an executed MTA or CTA. 
 
End of study procedures :  Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected 
database until it is no longer of scientific value. Identifiable data will not be sent outside NIH 
without prior IRB approval or appropriate conditions for disclosure outlined in the executed MTA 
or CTA.
 After closure of this protocol at this time as all primary endpoints for this study have been 
met, all remaining samples and data will be transferred to protocol 17- H- N001 “Retrosp ective Data

 41 There is no payment or compensation to subjects for their participation in this protocol. 
 
Reimbursement for travel, food, and lodging will be consistent with NHLBI DIR Travel and 
Lodging Compensation of Clinical Research Subjects policy or institutional guidelines.  
 
13.2 Participation of Children  
 
13.2.1 As recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
 
Pediatric subjects under 10 years of age are exclude d from participating in the protocol because in 
children less than age 10, the risk of severe GV HD (one of the secondary endpoints of the study) 
is substantially less than that experienced in tr ansplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551391] 10.  It is 
therefore, not appropriate to expose children unde r the age of 10 to an experimental protocol 
designed to evaluate the incidence and severity of acute GVHD after transplant. 
 
13.2.2 As donors: 
 
We are excluding from participation as donors, children who weigh <18 kg and are < 2 years of 
age. The risks of the apheresis procedure are rela ted to the weight of the child, more precisely 
his/her extracorporeal volume, which is weight-dependent.  The risks have to do with (1) need for 
a central line, (2) need for an allogeneic red cell prime, (3) need for systemic heparinization 
because subject is too small to get citrate:     
 25 kg :  the procedure and associated risk is the same as that in an adult, however a central 
line is often needed (at the discretion of the apheresis department). 
 
19 to 25 kg :  A central line is usually required (at the discretion of the apheresis department). 
With concurrent magnesium and calcium infusion, children may be safely anti-coagulated with 
citrate. 
 
Two apheresis procedures will be performed in minor donors - one for the collection of 
lymphocytes and the other for the collection of stem cells.  Collecting stem cells and lymphocytes 
in two apheresis sessions is widely practiced in donors of all ages including children  (Elmaagcli 
et al 2003, Barge et al. 2003, Reviewed in Baron and Beguin 2002) DLIs may be given post-
transplant to treat relapse, to treat recurrent in fection, or to promote engraftment of stem cells 
when at risk of rejection after a SCT regardless of how the stem cells are prepared.  
 
13.2.3  As participants in research studies:   
 
Pediatric donors may participate only in those laboratory studies that the IRB finds involves no 
greater than minimal risk to children provided th at adequate provisions are made for soliciting the 
assent of the children and the permission of their parents or guardians. 
 
13.3  Hazards and Discomforts 
  
13.3.1  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_453886]:  
 
Blood and marrow stem cell transplantation is a major procedure, which entails serious 
discomforts and hazards for the patient. The mortality from the transplant procedure itself may be 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 42 as high as 40%. It is therefore only appropriate to carry out the procedure with its experimental 
component in the context of a life-threatening condition and with full informed consent from the 
patient and donor and immediate family. The major hazards (GVHD, infection, graft rejection, 
and leukemic relapse) have already been mentioned. Some poorly understood post transplant 
complications can lead to multiorgan failure includ ing: inflammatory states such as a cytokine 
release syndrome and the endothelial damage syndr omes (transplant microangiopathy, posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pneumonitis, 
sinusoidal occlusive syndrome/veno-occlusive disease and delayed cardiovascular disease). 
Inevitably after transplantation, blood counts will de crease with an associated requirement for red 
blood cell and platelet transfusions, as well as a need for empi[INVESTIGATOR_551392].  At the time of count re covery, there is also a small risk of pulmonary 
engraftment syndrome, manifested by [CONTACT_105]-infectious fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and dyspnea, 
which can be treated effectively with prompt administration of corticosteroids.  The major 
discomforts during the post-transplant period are those of nausea, mucositis, anorexia, diarrhea, 
fever, malaise, and intolerance of the isolation period.  Possible organ toxicities related to the 
high-dose preparative regimen include hepatic veno-occlusive disease and interstitial 
pneumonitis, which can be fatal. 
 
The procedure will render the patient infertile.  Because of this, we will discuss the possibility of 
sperm banking or egg retrieval with the subject before undergoing the transplant.  There is no effect 
of the treatment on male hormone production or potency.  Women stop ovulating and menstruating 
after the treatment, which also reduces estrogen production to low levels, inducing premature 
menopause.  This is treated by [CONTACT_141523], which is important in order to conserve the body’s store of calcium, amongst other reasons.  In children before puberty, th e 
treatment produces infertility, but with a small possibility of delayed recovery (about 10 years 
later).  Puberty may be delayed, but often progresses normally.  Although the whole transplant 
procedure may be accompanied by a stunting of growth, normal growth is subsequently resumed in 
the majority of children.  In only a few cases, is it necessary to give growth hormone, testosterone 
(male hormone) or estrogen (female hormone) to complete normal growth and sexual development. 
 
Allogeneic SCT is increasingly being offered to older individuals (> age 70) with the realization 
that chronological age alone is not as important as comorbidities, performance status or disease 
risk. Careful selection of patients with advanced age will mitigate the risk of complications. Nevertheless, older individuals will need to be carefully counseled prior to transplant regarding 
higher risks from transplant related mortality. 
 
With amendment in April 2017, the protocol will no longer exclude subjects with prior allogeneic 
transplantation. In order to minimize risk and maximize benefit, candidates with a prior transplant will be carefully selected; they will be excluded if their prior transplant involved fully 
myeloablative conditioning or if their malignant disorder is highly refractory and deemed unlikely 
to benefit from an allotransplant approach. Analysis of patients on this protocol is standardized by 
[CONTACT_551419], that will allow merging of the data of subjects with and 
without prior transplantation. 
 
Related to the apheresis procedure:  
 
The apheresis procedures will be performed in accordance with standard apheresis donation 
policies and procedures operative in DTM and will be in compliance with the Blood Donor 
Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks and the rules and regulations of the Food 
and Drug Administration. Adverse reactions to apheresis procedures are rare, but include: 
 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 43 x Pain and hematoma at the needle placement site 
x Vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], characterized by [CONTACT_551420], dizziness, nausea and rarely, 
syncope are seen in less than 2% of the procedures. Hypotension secondary to volume depletion is known for the rare potential for a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event.  
x Cutaneous or circumoral parasthesias, chills, nausea, heartburn and rarely muscle spasms 
may result from the use of citrate anticoagulant used to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate reactions are usually relieved by [CONTACT_389705].  
Prior to each apheresis, the potential risks associated with the procedure will be explained to the 
patient and a separate informed consent obtained. 
 
Related to the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent Systems :  
 
Theoretical risks to the patient could include system failure, user error, or patient reaction to 
selected product components (i.e. residual amounts of unbound CliniMACS CD 34 Reagent, Iron 
dextran, or human anti-mouse antibodies). For ful l text see Investigator’s brochure for Miltenyi 
CliniMACS CD34+ system, Version 6, dated 5/27/2008, section 6, Summary and Guidance for the Investigator). 
 
Related to the common transplant related drugs and radiotherapy.  
  
 Cyclosporine: CSA is metabolized primarily in liver but the major toxicity is renal. Side effects 
include renal impairment, reversible renal insuff iciency, hemolytic uremic syndrome, elevated 
bilirubin and transaminases that normalize wi th continued administration or reduced dose, 
hypertrichosis, headaches, nausea, gingival hypertrophy, parasthesias (painful hands and feet), 
hypertension, hypomagnesium, bilirubinemia, hypertrichosis, nausea, tremor, and seizure.  An 
extremely rare complication of cyclosporine is blindness, which may be irreversible. Posterior 
Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized neurologic disorder 
seen in 1% of subjects on cyclosporine which manifest with acute to subacute hypertension 
and/or seizures. In the event of hypertension, subjects will be prescribed 1 or more medications to 
control blood pressure in an effort to decrease the risk of this complication. 
 
Cyclophosphamide: immediate: tingling and metallic taste, nausea and vomiting, ADH-like 
effect, cardiotoxic at high doses (>70 mg/kg). Ra re - pulmonary toxicity, urticaria and flushing, 
mucositis. Delayed: marrow suppression, nausea, mucositis, rash, hemorrhagic cystitis, myocardial damage, alopecia, infertility.  
 
Fludarabine : myelosuppression, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, 
weakness, and rarely hemolysis and pulmonary toxicity, hemolytic anemia and interstitial 
pneumonitis. Serious opportunistic infections have oc curred in CLL subjects treated with fludarabine.   
 
Methotrexate (used in the event of technical failure of graft processing resulting in CD3+ cells>1 
x 106/kg): mucositis, nausea, dizziness, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, malaise, fatigue, fever, 
melena, headaches, blurred vision, rashes, alopecia, elevated liver functions,  
Hematologic: myelosupression (leukopenia [nadir 7 days] thrombocytopenia, anemia) 
Hepatic: acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatic toxicity. 
Chronic toxicity has generally occurred after prolonged use (generally 2 years or more) and 
after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 44   Urogenital :  severe nephropathy or renal failure, azotemia, cystitis, hematuria; defective 
oogenesis or spermatogenesis, transient oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction and vaginal 
discharge; infertility, abortion, fetal defects. Wi th high doses of methotrexate, close attention 
to renal function including adequate hydration, and urine alkanization are essential for safe 
administration.  
Gastrointestinal: gingivitis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
hematemesis, melena, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, enteritis. Should be used with 
extreme caution in the presence of peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis. Therapy may be 
discontinued if ulcerative stomatitis or other severe GI adverse reactions occur. 
Pulmonary: interstitial pneumonitis deaths have been reported, and chronic interstitial obstructive 
pulmonary disease has occasionally occurred. Pulmonary symptoms or a nonspecific 
pneumonitis may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion and require interruption of 
treatment and careful investigation; infection needs to be excluded. This lesion can occur at 
all dosages. 
Skin: erythematous rashes, pruritis, urticaria, ph otosensistivty, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], alopecia, 
ecchymosis, telangiectasia, acne, furunculosis. 
Central Nervous System: headaches, drowsiness, blurred vision. There have been reports of 
leukoencephalopathy following intravenous administration of methotrexate to subjects who 
have craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25360]. Aphasia, hemiparesis, paresis, and convulsions have also 
occurred following administration of methotrexate. Following low doses, occasional subjects 
reported transient subtle cognitive dysfunction, mood alteration, or unusual cranial 
sensations. 
Other: opportunistic infections, arthralgia/myalgia, loss of libido/impotence, diabetes, and 
osteoporosis. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. 
 
 Related to antimicrobials in general : Allergic reactions, renal impairment (gentamicin, 
vancomycin, amphotericin, acyclovir), "red man" syndrome (vancomycin), hepatic damage 
(acyclovir, rifampin), nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, pancytopenia, neutropenia, 
peripheral neuropathy, renal damage (Ganciclovir) (reversible on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395]). 
 
Related to the total body radiation : side effects of radiation have been well described. The most 
common include nausea and mucositis. Mucositis is associated with bacteremias and sepsis. There 
also exists a risk of hypothyroidism, cataracts,  interstitial pneumonitis, nephropathy, and an 
unspecified long term risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_551393]. Importantly, the majority of the 
nonneoplastic effects were sub clinical and/or reversible.  
 
13.3.2 The Donor  
 
Related to filgrastim (G-CSF).  The hazard to the donor is low. The discomfort from G-CSF 
mobilization and leukapheresis for collection of blood stem cells are probably lower than those 
associated with marrow harvesting. G-CSF has been given to large numbers of normal donors 
without major side effects or long-term conseque nces. The immediate side effects of G-CSF are 
bone pain, fatigue, insomnia, myalgia and headache. These are usually mild and are self-limiting. 
Reversible thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts falling to the region of 100,000 /cu mm is 
frequent. Although regarded as safe and well tolerated, G-CSF administration could result in splenic rupture, a potentially life-threatening complication. Up to now five cases of splenic 
rupture have been reported in healthy donors (Bec ker et al. 1997, Falzetti et al. 1999, Balaguer et 
al. 2004, Dincer et al. 2004, Nuamah et al. 2006). Donors will be asked to avoid vigorous 
activities and to report any left upper abdominal and/or shoulder pain to the research team or the 
on-call physician for the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine at [PHONE_4366].

temporally-related to G-CSF administration and apheresis (Kopp , et al  2007, Vij , et al  1999). In 
addition, a rare occurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported in a healthy donor who 
was a cigarette smoker and had underlying pulmonary disease (Kopp , et al  2007). Finally, donors 
with sickle cell trait have been reported to develop vaso-occlusive crises when treated with G-CSF, necessitating special precautions (Kang , et al  2002). 
  
Related to central line placement . It is estimated that about 50% of the donors will require 
intravenous line placement to successfully complete apheresis. Intravenous line placement in the 
central vein using an apheresis catheter carries a small risk of bleeding, bruising or pain and a very low risk of accidental injury to the adjacent artery and nerve. Central line placement in the upper 
circulation carries a small risk of puncture of a pneumothorax. Some subjects may experience a 
vasovagal reaction (lightheadedness, or, rarely , fainting due to temporary lowering of blood 
pressure).Using only experienced staff for the procedure minimizes these risks. 
 
In exceptional instances the donor does not mobilize well and is required to receive plerixafor or 
to donate PBPC a second time. Plerixafor is an FDA approved mobilizing agent and would have a 
standard indication in this setting. The risks of plerixafor are mainly GI upset. There is no 
additional risk to the donor from a second PBPC donation.  
 
Related to Apheresis : see section 13.3.1. 
 13.4 Research Risks in Relation to Research Benefits  
 
13.4.1 For Adult Transplant Subjects 
 
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for many subjects with leukemia 
and other hematologic malignancies, however it entails serious discomforts and hazards for the 
patient (section 13.3). -The investigational component of this transplant protocol aims to decrease 
non-relapse mortality and improve overall surv ival by [CONTACT_551421]. This approach is theoretically likely to increase the risk of 
infections, relapse/progression and slow donor lymphoid engraftment 
 
Clinically, this approach is ethically acceptable because we will target a patient group with lethal 
hematologic malignancies and no other curative treatment options who have made an informed 
decision to opt for a procedure which they understand offers a chance of prolonged disease-free 
survival but with a risk of death from treatment failure. Implicit in this decision is the opportunity to weigh all treatment options after full information has been given to them by [CONTACT_551422].  
 
Therefore for adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389655], the research involves greater than minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 CFR 46.102). 
 
Exclusion of pregnant women: The exclusion of pregnant women is justified on medical grounds 
as pregnancy is an absolute contraindication for myeloablative doses of chemo-radiation.  
 
13.4.2 For Pediatric Transplant Subjects   
 
The investigational component of this transplant protocol aims to decrease non-relapse mortality 
and improve overall survival by [CONTACT_551423] # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 46 immunosuppression. This approach is theoretically likely to increase the risk of infections, 
relapse/progression and slow donor lymphoid engraftment. The inclusion of children satisfies the 
criteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46, Subpart D: 46.405 as follows: 
 
 (a) the risk is justified by [CONTACT_32117] : We are offering pediatric 
subjects with a probably lethal hematological disease, incurable with conventional treatments other than allogeneic stem cell transplantat ion, an alternative to symptomatic therapy. 
 
(b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that 
presented by [CONTACT_167899] . The protocol aims to decrease the risk of transplant-
related mortality, thus making more subjects candidates for potentially curative therapy and  
 (c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting th e assent of the children and permission of their 
parents or guardians, as set forth in 46.408. 
 
Therefore for pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389655], the research involves greater than 
minimal risk but presents the prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects (45 CFR 
46.405). 
 
 13.4.3 For Adult Donors: 
 
An HLA 6/[ADDRESS_724498] procedure (13.3.2), potential benefit does exist for family donors. The donor derives 
psychosocial benefit from donating stem cells both at the time of donation and possibly into the 
future, especially in view of the reduced life expe ctancy due to this disease in a family member.  
Other potential benefits include detection of il lnesses, determination of blood cell counts, and 
evaluation of kidney and liver function in the potential donor at the time of screening. Therefore, 
participation as a stem cell donor on this protocol involves minimal risk to subjects. For those 
who choose to participate in the Laboratory Research Studies involving bone marrow sampling, 
the risk is greater than minimal but presents the prospect for direct benefit(45 CFR 46.102).  
 
13.4.4  For Pediatric Donors: 
 
Stem cell transplant is an accepted standard  clinical intervention for the diseases under 
investigation. The donor would be donating stem cells and lymphocytes collected separately 
during two apheresis procedures to his/her family member regardless of the objectives of this 
research protocol. The stem cell and lymphocyte co llection procedures are not considered part of 
the research for the donors and the risks of the stem cell and lymphocyte collection procedures 
would not be considered risks of the research for the pediatric donors. Therefore, participation as 
a stem cell donor on this protocol is considered exempt from the criteria set forth in 45 CFR 46, 
Subpart D
. 
 
13.4.5 For Pediatric Donors – Healthy Volunteers- Involved in Laboratory Research Studie s. 
 
The inclusion of children satisfies the criteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46, Subpart D: 46.404 as follows: 
 
(1) The research does not involve greater than minimal risk .  There is no added risk 
associated with the amount and method of collection for the additional blood for research 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 47 obtained concurrently with clinically indicated sampling.  We are not collecting bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_551394]. 
 
Researc h specimens will be stored in the PI’s laboratory. Samples will be assigned a unique 
code known only to the PI , which will serve as a link to the child’s name [CONTACT_551428].  No samples will be provided to investigators outside the branch without permission of the IRB, therefore confidentiality will 
be protected. 
Only those laboratory tests approved by [CONTACT_551424] (See Appendix A). Research will not include genetic testing, 
thus there is no risk related to genetic testing.  
 
(2) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their 
parents or guardians, as set forth in 46.408.   
 
Therefore, participation of pediatric donors in laboratory research on this protocol does not 
involve greater than minimal risk (45 CFR 46.404). 
 13.5 Informed Consent Processes and Procedures 
 
Adults:  The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedure and its 
attendant risks and discomforts will be carefully explained to the subject and a signed informed 
consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto this study.  Drs. Barrett or Battiwalla or other senior physicians who are specifically listed as associate investigators capable of obtaining 
consent on the front page of the protocol will lead this discussion. 
 
If the patient is a minor , a minor assent will be sought.  Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_551425]'s parent or guardian, the child will also be included in all discussions about 
the trial and a minor's assent will be obtained.  The parent who signs the consent for the minor 
must be a parent or legal guardian.  The parent or guardian will sign on the designated line on the 
informed consent attesting to the fact that the child had given assent.  When the assent is not age 
appropriate, the study will be explained to the child and the assent will be obtained verbally from 
the child. In cases where parents share joint legal custody in making medical decisions of their 
child (e.g. by a custody agreement or court order) both parents must give their parental 
permissions regardless of level of risk of the re search. Exceptions may be made if one parent is 
deceased, becomes incompetent or is not reasonably available (e.g. in prison).  
 
If the donor is a minor , assent will not be sought until an evaluation by a social worker and 
mental health specialist (psychologist or psyc hiatrist) is completed to determine the minor 
donor’s willingness to  participate.   As detailed above, the parent who signs the consent for the 
minor must be a parent or legal guardian.  Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_15370], and the 
child's parent or guardian, the child will also be included in all discussions about the trial and a 
minor donor’s assent will be obtained. The investigators are requesting a waiver from the IRB to 
allow only one parent to sign the informed consent to enter a child on the protocol.  The parent or 
guardian will sign on the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the 
child had given assent. In cases where parents share joint legal custody in making medical 
decisions of their child (e.g. by a custody agreement or court order) both parents must give their 
parental permissions regardless of level of risk of the research. Exceptions may be made if one 
parent is deceased, becomes incompetent or is not reasonably available (e.g. in prison).  
 
If a child (donor or transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) dissents, the IRB and Bio-ethics will be consulted. 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, [ADDRESS_724499] is positive, we will counsel her and help her tell her 
parents or we will tell her parents with her permission. Is she does not agree she will be advised 
not to sign the assent. 
 Decisionally impaired: The IRB and Bio-ethics Department will be consulted should there be a 
decisionally impaired patient (donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) identified as a potential candidate for 
enrollment in this protocol.  
  
At any time during participation in the protocol that new information becomes available relating to risks, adverse events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to all 
enrolled or prospective patient participants.  Do cumentation will be provided to the IRB and if 
necessary, the informed consent will be amended to reflect relevant information. 
 
Re-Consent for Minors when they reach the age of majority:  When a pediatric subject 
reaches age 18, continued participation will require re-consenting of the now adult with the 
standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed consent has been obtained. Should sample or data analysis continue following completion of active participation 
and the subject has reached [ADDRESS_724500].  
 
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d), each of which must be 
addressed in relation to the protocol: 
 
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. 
a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to subjects. 
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. 
a. This is an FDA-regulated study and as such, we are mandated to retain all samples, 
once collected, regardless of the age of the subject at the time of collection.  Retention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects.  
(3) The research could not practicably be carr ied out without the waiver or alteration. 
a. Considering the length of time between a minor’s enrollment and their age of 
majority, it is possible that more than a few subjects may be lost to follow up.  A 
significant reduction in the number of samples analyzed could impact the quality of the research.  
(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation. 
a. We only plan to request a waiver of reconsent for those subjects who have been lost 
to follow-up.   
 
Non-English speaking subjects:  If there is an unexpected candidate for enrollment of a research 
participant for which there is no translated extant IRB approved consent document, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551395] M77-2, 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2), and 21 CFR50.27 
(b) (a) 0. The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB approved 
consent document.

14.0 PHARMACEUTICALS 
 
14.1     CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System (see Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6, dated 5/27/2008)  
 
 14.1.[ADDRESS_724503]: the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is a medical device that 
is used in vitro to select and enrich specific cell populations. When using the CD34 Reagent, the 
system selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematological cell populations for transplantation 
in cases where this is clinically indicated. The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is comprised of 
four primary component s: 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 50 • CliniMACS CD34 Reagent: a sterile monoclonal antibody reagent specific for CD34+ cells  
• CliniMACS plus Instrument: a software controlled instrument that processes the blood sample 
(cell product)  
• CliniMACS Tubing Sets: single-use, sterile, disp osable tubing sets with two proprietary cell 
selection columns (CliniMACS Tubing Set and CliniMACS Tubing Set LS)  
• CliniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer: a sterile, isotonic phosphate-buffered, 1 mM EDTA, saline 
solution, used as external wash and transport fluid for the in vitro preparation of blood 
cells.  
14.1.2 Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Information  
x CD34 Reagent Description:  the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is a dark amber, non-
viscous, colloidal solution containing the antibody conjugate in buffer. The conjugate consists of a monoclonal antibody towards the class II epi[INVESTIGATOR_16164]34 antigen. The murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody is covalently linked to dextran beads that 
have an iron oxide/hydroxide core and are super paramagnetic. 
x Safety testing of the CD34 Monoclonal Antibody:  cell banking, cell culture, as well as 
subsequent purification of the antibody, fo llow the applicable current international 
guidelines as described in Section 4. The te sting of the CD34 Master Cell Bank, the End 
of Production Cells, the CD34 mAb pooled cell culture harvest (unprocessed bulk) and 
the purified CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) have been completed and the purified 
CD34 mAb has been released for manufacturing of the CD34 Reagent. Additionally, the 
viral inactivation/removal steps used in the purification of the CD34 monoclonal antibody have been validated.
 
x Safety testing of the CD34 Reagent: detailed toxicity studies have been undertaken to 
assess the safety of the CD34 Reagent when delivered in dosages significantly greater 
than the projected maximum dosage anticipated in clinical use. The testing was 
performed in accordance with 21 CFR §58, Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical

14.1.3  Safety Testing of CliniMACS® System Components (Instrument, Tubing Sets and PBS/EDTA 
Buffer) Biocompatibility Testing of the CliniMACS System components (Tubing Sets and 
PBS/EDTA Buffer) was performed according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]. The requirements of ISO [ZIP_CODE] were fulfilled for the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System.   The CliniMACS plus Instrument has 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, [ADDRESS_724505] been reduced by [CONTACT_2329] a design to meet European standards 
EN [ZIP_CODE]-1. It is UL and CSA listed and approved. 
14.1.4 Overall Safety of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System:  The results summarized in this 
Investigator’s Brochure support that CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is sufficiently safe for 
clinical use with human subjects. The potential application of the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is broad. Infusion of purified CD34+ cells is indicated in a number of clinical applications after 
myeloablative or lymphoablative therapy including reduction of tumor cells in the transplant and 
depletion of T cells for autologous (autoimmune diseases) and allogeneic transplantations. 
Individual risk analysis on the therapeutically used target cells isolated in conjunction with 
CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System should be addressed by [CONTACT_16172]. A European safety study, ACS 950101, for the CliniMACS System was published in Bone Marrow 
Transplantation 25; 243-49, February 2001. The study was designed to meet European Essential 
Requirements 3 and 14 (MDD 93/42/EEC) and was conducted per EN540 to support the CE 
Marking of the device (received December 1997).  
 
The initial clinical study with the CliniMACS System was conducted in subjects undergoing high-
dose chemotherapy for breast cancer. The purpose of the European Safety Study was to show:   
• Suitability of the CD34 Reagent and other CliniMACS components for selection of 
CD34+ cells with high, yield, purity viability and safety  
• CD34+ cells can safely be administered to subjects after myeloablative chemotherapy  
• Selected CD34+ cells are effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic system after 
myeloablative chemotherapy  
• Rate of device failures  
 
Cells were isolated from leukapheresis products from sixty-five subjects enrolled in the study. Fifty-
four subjects received selected CD34+ cells and fifty-two were evaluable for engraftment as summarized in the table below (one patient died [ADDRESS_724506]-transplant and prior to engraftment and 
one patient did not recover platelet counts even after back-up cells were infused). All subjects 
receiving selected cells completed 60 and 100-day follow-up after infusion, during which time their 
hematological and immune status were monitored, as was HAMA production. A summary of the 
results of the European Clinical  Trial is provided below.

The following conclusions were made regarding this clinical study:  
 
• The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematological 
cell populations. The resulting CD34+ product is  of high purity (median of 96.1 %, range 27.4 
Protocol # 13-H-0144 
Sawa Ito, MD 
Version date: April 12, 2018  
 52 – 99.4 %); the median recovery of CD34+ cells was 52.3 % (range 15.2 – 146.3%). The 
reported performance results are similar to those seen in pre-clinical studies.  
• Infusion of selected, autologous CD34+ cells after high dose chemotherapy resulted in rapid 
engraftment (see Table 2). These data are compar able to previously reported results, using bone 
marrow or peripheral blood cells as stem cell source. Following cyclophosphamide, thiotepa 
and carboplatin (CTCb), Weaver et al. report ed median times to platelet and neutrophil 
engraftment of 9 days (range 0-53 days) and 9 days (range 5-26 days), respectively. Also after 
CTCb, Elias et al., reported median times to plat elet and neutrophil recovery of 12 days (range 
8-134 days) and 14 days (range 10-57 days), respectively (Elias , et al  1992, Weaver , et al  1995) .  
• The selection process has no discernable effect on cell viability or sterility.  
• There were no adverse events or device malfunctio ns reported as related to the infusion of the 
cells or use of the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System. None of the subjects were reactive for 
HAMA post infusion. There were no reports of late engraftment failure or evidence of delayed 
immune reconstitution.

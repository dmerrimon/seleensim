H. Background and Significance: (Describe succinctly and clearly t he past findings which justify the 
plan for this project.  A summary of the relevant literature in the area of interest and reports of previous studies should be included.)     
1. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_75140], mortality and disability. It has been estimated that over [ADDRESS_81603] 
resulted in fatalities.  A substantial percentage of these Veterans experience clinically significant pain and many require treatment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467].  Clark et al. randomly selected and reviewed 300 charts of U.S. Veterans from a general medical population. They found that 50% of patients suffered from chronic pain and approximately 75% of the patients with chronic pain were prescribed at least one 
analgesic.  Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly 
prescribed class of analgesics, 44% of patients receiving an analgesic received opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Wu et al. have also reported a rise in the prevalence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75141].  Within the VA, chronic pain management and thus opi[INVESTIGATOR_75142]. 
 
2. Risky Alcohol Use in Returning Service Personnel and Veterans 
Alcohol misuse is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and is associated with increased mortality.  Alcohol is, after nicotine, the most frequently abused substance among Veterans.  The Veterans Health Study found that 12.1% of outpatients 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 3 of 39 
 had alcohol-related problems, and more recent studies found that 11-14% of Veterans in 
primary care screened positive for hazardous alcohol use. Several studies among 
Veterans recently returning from Iraq have found prevalence of alcohol misuse ranging from 24-39%, likely reflective of the younger age cohort.  One other study found that of the OEF/OIF Veterans treated at VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64572] 2005, almost half screened positive on the AUDIT-C for likely risky/hazardous alcohol use. Alcohol misuse has tremendous individual and societal costs.  For instance, Veterans who reported drinking during the 
previous year and who had a positive alcohol screening test experienced a 1.[ADDRESS_81604] many known adverse effects including gastrointestinal complaints, cardiac problems, hormonal changes, immunologic effects, sleep disorders, sedation, addiction, and overdose. Of particular concern, there has 
been a substantial increase in fatal poisonings involving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. For 
example, the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related fatal poisonings tripled from 4,000 to 13,800 deaths from 1999 through 2006 and approximately 40% of all deaths by [CONTACT_75223] [ADDRESS_81605] on respi[INVESTIGATOR_75143]. Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network 
in 2010 revealed that pain relievers were involved in 23% of e mergency department 
visits involving the ingestion of both that alcohol and prescription medicine. Based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_75144], alcohol is implicated more frequently in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related deaths 
than any other substance.  However, in 2006 approximately 50% of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related 
deaths in the US involved more than one substance, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_75145] 17% of these deaths. Also, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_75146]-intoxicants in 
methadone-related deaths. These data highlight the importance of prevention of such 
adverse outcomes, which can be accomplished by [CONTACT_75224][INVESTIGATOR_75147]/hazardous alcohol use, and providing interventions to 
those individuals who screen positive.  
 Similar issues have been noted with regard to other substance use in patients receiving 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_75148].  In a recent national study of Veterans receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_75149]-cancer pain, the strongest predictor of the development opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]/dependence was a non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_75150].  However, research results have raised some concern about how well Veterans receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_75151].  For example, Wu 
et al. found that nearly 80% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75152], and that only 31% of patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_75153]. 
 
4. Screening and Brief Interventions in the VA:  Current Practice 
In 2004, the VA Office of Quality and Performance (OQP) began requiring annual alcohol 
screening using the AUDIT-C.  Since implementation of this policy, medical record reviews conducted for the VA External Peer Review Program (EPRP) have shown that an average of 86% of patients are screened with the AUDIT-C.  The vast majority of this screening occurs within primary care.  In 2007, the VA implemented a performance 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81606] of brief interventions and referral after a positive 
screen.  This performance measure was temporarily associated with an increase in the 
delivery of brief interventions from a baseline of 5.5 % of Veterans who were screen positive getting a brief intervention to 29% after the implementation of the performance measure.  These low rates of brief intervention and referral contrast sharply with patients’ expressed desire for help.  In the VA Large Health Survey, only 12% of heavy drinkers and 17% of very heavy drinkers reported getting the help they needed (30). 
Similarly, the seven-site ACQUIP study showed that only 30% of VA patients with 
alcohol misuse reported receiving advice to decrease or stop drinking, despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 83% reported contemplating or taking steps to change their drinking.  Most recently concerns have been raised about the validity of screening done in clinical practice. As many as 61 percent of risky/heavy drinkers are not being identified by [CONTACT_75225], most likely because of improper screening techniques.  Moreover, there was 
substantial variation between VA facilities suggesting marked implementation problems with screening.  These data demonstrate that many patients with risky alcohol use are not receiving adequate diagnostic evaluations or preventive care to reduce their drinking.  These problems take on increased significance with VA patients receiving 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], because of the potential for harmful interactions between opi[INVESTIGATOR_75156], which can be compounded by [CONTACT_22888]-ingestion of other drugs.   To address some of these concerns, the VA is an industry leader in integrating a comprehensive set of services for mental health conditions in primary care.  At the CMCVAMC, this program is known as the “Behavioral Health Lab” or BHL.  During the 
last 5 years, there has been a complete reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_75157]’s primary care system so 
that today it is organized as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) similar to medical home programs, a key characteristic of which is the integration of mental health services with primary care.  A driving force leading to the PACT model was the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that treating depression and alcohol misuse in 
the primary care setting within the VA leads to improved symptom-based outcomes, 
including reduced all-cause mortality.  VA wide, BHL programs have served Veterans in two million patient encounters in less than five years and are a central aspect of the interdisciplinary care in the PACT programs.   The principles of the BHL program are to deliver patient-centered care while adhering to 
recommended treatment algorithms, modeled from the VA/DOD Depression Treatment 
Guidelines, including the use of structured assessments to facilitate care (instruments like the PHQ-9) at nearly every encounter.  At the CMCVAMC and nationally, the BHL program is guided by a set of training guides entitled, “Foundations for Integrated Care.”  The training program was recently released to the field and embodies the 
evidence base for care management and co-located collaborative care.  The goal of the 
program is to deliver care where the Veteran wants care and consistent with the resources needed to provide that care.  The BHL program is designed to be the 
principal point of entry for any Veteran seeking mental health care or who has screened 
positively on any mental health screening questionnaire including the AUDIT-C.  Thus, 
in general, the BHL program provides care to Veterans with milder disorders or those 
who need prevention services, while specialty care services are reserved for more 
complex or severe illness.  Specifically for alcohol misuse, the BHL program provides a structured brief intervention (it is VA policy for Veterans to be administered the AUDIT-C and for anyone scoring a 5 or higher to be referred to BHL for clinical assessment).  In reference to this proposal, the BHL program receives requests from the primary care 
team to conduct assessments and deliver brief interventions for Veterans who screen 
positive on the AUDIT-C.  Currently more than 300 Veterans are evaluated in the BHL per month with 25% screening positive for alcohol misuse.  This program will serve as the standard care arm of the study.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_75158], we are well aware that not all Veterans who screen positive on the AUDIT-C are referred for follow-up care 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81607] 
likely NOT be referred by [CONTACT_75226] (PCP) to the BHL for a Brief 
Intervention. However, as the National Institute on Alcohol abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) defines drinking while taking contraindicated medications as risky alcohol use: (https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking), and thus a BI is still warranted. For subjects enrolled in the study with a low AUDIT score, the study counselors will perform the BI. 
 
March [ADDRESS_81608] indicated that brief interventions delivered in primary care are 
effective in reducing rates of risky/hazardous alcohol use.  However, two other reviews have indicated that brief interventions in primary care and other settings may not be effective for individuals with more severe alcohol problems.  A recent study in a sample 
of Veterans showed that providing patients who had screened positive for risky alcohol 
use with a web-based brief alcohol intervention in addition to brief alcohol counseling from a primary care provider did not im prove drinking outcomes over the primary care 
provider only control condition.  However, several other studies have shown positive effects for web-based brief alcohol interventions in military samples.  
 
6. Beyond the Brief Intervention 
Although research on brief interventions (BIs) for risky alcohol use has generally shown positive results, several important gaps in evidence remain.  First, there is considerably less information on whether such interventions are effective with other substances.  Second, despi[INVESTIGATOR_75159], significant percentages of patients fail to 
respond to BIs.  There is essentially no research on what types of interventions might 
be efficacious and feasible with individuals who continue to drink at risky levels after receiving a BI.  Third, no studies have focused on the efficacy of BIs for risky alcohol use in patients receiving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75160].   
One possible approach for BI non-responders is to provide additional BI sessions.  
Only a small number of studies have compared a single session of BI to an extended version of the same or similar intervention in primary care patients.  Longabaugh et al. and Maisto et al. examined the impact of [ADDRESS_81609] of 4 and 6 addition sessions, respectively, whereas Aalto et al. compared 2 and 6 additional sessions to a single 
session. The additional sessions in these studies were provided over periods ranging 
from a few days after the initial session up to 24 months later.  Results varied across these studies, with some showing positive effects for the extended intervention and others showing no positive effects.  However, none of these studies tested an adaptive 
approach to BIs, in which follow up after the BI is determined by [CONTACT_102]’s response, 
such as through the use of an algorithm directing additional sessions to individuals 
who did not respond to an initial session.    
 In adaptive prevention and treatment interventions, the services provided to any given individual are tailored over time on the basis of response.  In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_75161]:  03-2015       Page 6 of 39 
 protocol, after an initial intervention, non-responders receive an augmented 
intervention or are switched to a new intervention.  The tailoring variable is usually a 
measure of the targeted symptom or behavior (e.g., risky drinking, depression, tumor markers), assessed regularly over some period of time. Adaptive interventions have several important advantages over conventional interventions. First, they provide guidelines for how to modify interventions for non-responders, to improve outcomes for this group. Second, they lower patient burden and overall cost by [CONTACT_75227].    
7. Preventing Risky Drinking and Other Drug Use in Veterans on Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_75162], in Veterans receiving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75163].  This 
patient-centered intervention provides integrated screening, brief intervention, monitoring, and extended prevention services that are delivered through a combination telephone calls, and text messages.  Moreover this intervention is ideally suited to be disseminated within the primary care/mental health initiatives for patient centered 
medical home teams.  The intervention is intended for Veterans who are receiving 
prescriptions for daily doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75164]/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438]; who also screen positive for risky/hazardous drinking. At the beginning of the intervention, a brief intervention (BI) is provided to reduce alcohol to safe levels, and a health screening is provided to flag other medication use that could interact negatively with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]).  Following administration of the BI, alcohol use 
is monitored for one month to determine whether the intervention has been effective.  
Veterans who reduce their drinking to non-hazardous levels will continue in a monitoring track, which consists of tailored text messages and brief monthly telephone contacts.  Veterans who continue to use alcohol at unsafe levels will instead be placed in a track that provides tailored text messages and more frequent telephone calls.  In 
addition to monitoring, these calls provide further prevention to help the Veteran 
reduce alcohol use to non-hazardous levels.  These services address motivational issues and identify more effective ways to cope with stress and other factors that trigger unsafe substance use. 
 
8. Rationale for Intervention Components 
a. Extended monitoring in responders.  BIs typi[INVESTIGATOR_75165]-up 
contacts, which raise questions about the need for ongoing monitoring in responders.  However, studies have indicated that Veterans receiving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75166] a number of adverse health outcomes, and would be at even higher risk if they were to resume hazardous drinking.  Brief monthly 
monitoring calls, supplemented by [CONTACT_75228], represent a low-burden, low-cost 
method to detect the resumption of hazardous alcohol use.  Providing monitoring over 12 months allows for the possibility that some Veterans will do well initially, but increase their use of alcohol at a later point, perhaps due to stressors related to the transition to civilian life, including family or employment problems.  If increased substance use occurs, additional prevention interventions can be delivered.   
b. Enhanced prevention efforts for non-responders.  Examination of results from BI 
studies suggests that 20-50% of participants who receive these interventions do not reduce alcohol use to non-hazardous levels, with a higher percentage of non-responders among individuals who are also using drugs.  Very few of these individuals are appropriate for specialty addiction treatments which typi[INVESTIGATOR_75167].  Therefore, additional prevention services are needed that are feasible to implement, of relatively low burden, and acceptable to Veterans.  The combination of text messages and brief prevention counseling provided via the telephone meets these requirements.  In our prior work (see below), we have 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 7 of 39 
 demonstrated that it is possible to deliver interventions to increase motivation and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_75168], with good fidelity to treatment 
manuals.   These interventions directly address the factors that contribute to nonresponse to brief interventions—low motivation for change, low self-efficacy, and problems with copi[INVESTIGATOR_75169].   
c. Inclusion of text messaging (SMS) interventions.  Mobile interventions, specifically 
SMS interventions, are well suited for ongoing monitoring and prevention 
interventions for risky alcohol and drug use because they can be tailored to the 
individual through decision support features, are flexible enough to meet individuals in their natural environment, and can adapt to their current needs in real-time using ecological momentary assessment.  Numerous studies have shown that text messaging can improve outcomes across physical and mental health 
disorders. SMS interventions have been found to have small-to-moderate effects 
against no treatment controls with the largest effects being for smoking cessation and HIV medication adherence. In the largest SMS study to date, “txt2stop,” an SMS intervention for smoking cessation doubled quit rates in a sample of over 5,[ADDRESS_81610] that the addition of text messaging and other prompts improves the effects of web-based interventions, highlighting the use of SMS as a component to enhance other interventions. Although messaging interventions may work via mechanisms similar to those of telephone-based interventions (e.g. by [CONTACT_75229], reaching people in the moment 
without a computer connection), they offer several unique benefits that can 
enhance phone-based interventions. Text messaging allows for increased confidentiality, invulnerability to missed calls, and convenient continual viewing of messages sent and received. Text messages are less intrusive than phone calls, expend less labor, and do not require the phone to be active (the message will be 
resent for several days until the phone is active. This is especially important as low 
income individuals may have their phones turned on and off due to difficulties in paying bills.   SMS interventions have several other important features that warrant their integration into prevention models. First, messaging interventions inherit the 
benefits of computer-based interventions (e.g. low cost, standardized, 
individualized, adaptable and tailored, allowing for data collection) but there is no need for an internet connection or a computer. Second, unlike mobile applications (apps), SMS interventions do not require a smart phone, custom software programming for specific phones, or application updates, and are accessible on 
most phones, making the intervention significantly more accessible and 
generalizable than smart phone apps. Third, SMS-ready phones can perform nearly all of the functions of stand-alone ecological momentary assessment (EMA) devices without additional hardware or custom programming. There is an emerging literature on the using of text messaging to capture EMA data and results reveal outcomes similar to those of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and interactive 
voice response technology (IVR). Additionally, most studies have also indicated 
that SMS interventions are well accepted by [CONTACT_75230].  Muench, Adams, McKay and Morgenstern found that only [ADDRESS_81611] a mobile phone and all participants’ phones were SMS ready with 60% of 
participants having unlimited messaging plans. Interestingly, weekly SMS questions about appointment attendance were perceived to be as helpful to keep appointments as daily reminders highlighting the fact that minimal prompts may be all that is needed to reinforce change.

9. Prior Studies.  We have conducted a series of studies that examined the efficacy of the 
telephone for the provision of follow-up care to individuals with risky drinking or 
substance use disorders.  The interventions that were evaluated in these studies were telephone care management for heavy drinkers in primary care, motivational interviewing for patients with alcohol or cocaine use disorders who failed to engage in or dropped out of treatment, and telephone continuing care for patients with alcohol or 
cocaine use disorders who had completed several weeks of addiction specialty care 
treatment.   
a. Telephone Care Management for Heavy Drinkers in Primary Care.  Helstrom and 
colleagues randomized Veterans who screened positive for risky/hazardous alcohol use in primary care to a standard session of brief advice from their primary care 
provider or to the brief advice plus 3 telephone care management (TCM) follow-up 
sessions at 3, 6, and 9 months.  At the 12-month follow-up, rates of risky/hazardous drinking were 51% in the TCM condition vs. 56% in the usual care condition ( p= ns).  
The results of this study highlight the persistence of risky drinking in Veterans (i.e., almost 50% were still engaging in risky drinking after 12 months), and suggest that providing three follow-up prevention sessions is probably not adequate to decrease 
the rate of risky drinking in this population.    
b. Motivational Interviewing (MI) Delivered by [CONTACT_10880].  We recently completed two 
studies in which patients with alcohol or cocaine use disorders who dropped out of treatment were provided with 1-2 telephone-based MI sessions in an effort to re-engage them.  Half of the participants in these two studies were Veterans.  The MI 
sessions were audio recorded, and coded to assess the quality of the MI.  On 
average, MI fidelity as measured by [CONTACT_75231] “beginning proficiency” thresholds.  The skill level for MI-consistent strategies was at threshold level and the use of “fundamental” MI strategies and skill level was above threshold level.  Results indicated that MI designed to re-engage patients in their original treatment program produced better alcohol use outcomes than MI coupled with a 
menu of other treatment options.  
c. Telephone-Based Alcohol Disease Management Study.  We developed an 18-month 
telephone-based intervention, which we compared to standard care in 252 alcohol dependent patients who completed 3-4 weeks of outpatient treatment.  Telephone Monitoring and Counseling (TMC) consisted of 20-minute telephone calls that were 
provided weekly for 8 weeks, twice monthly for 10 months, and monthly for the final 
6 months.  Each call began with a 5-minute structured assessment of risks and protective factors, followed by [CONTACT_75232]-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_75170].  During the 18-month treatment period, rates of any alcohol use (OR= 1.88) and any heavy alcohol use (OR=1.74) were significantly higher in 
standard care (TAU) than in TMC.  Significant group x time interactions were 
obtained on the percentage days alcohol and heavy alcohol use, in which the advantage for TMC over TAU increased over time.  Subgroup analyses over the full 24 month follow-up period showed effects favoring TMC over TAU on percent days drinking were greater in women (OR=0.47, p=.04) and those with prior treatments 
(OR= 0.59, p= .02); and in those with social networks that supported continued 
drinking (OR=0.44, p=.02) and low readiness to change (OR=0.53, p=.05) after 3 weeks of IOP.  
d. Telephone-Based Cocaine Disease Management Study.  In a similar continuing care 
study with cocaine dependent patients (N=321), there were interactions between 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 9 of 39 
 cocaine and alcohol use at baseline and the continuing care conditions (p= .03) on 
the primary outcome, a measure of abstinence from cocaine, other drugs, and heavy 
alcohol use (confirmed by [CONTACT_75233]).  In patients with any days of cocaine or alcohol use in the 30 days prior to baseline (i.e., the week prior to intake and the first 3 weeks of treatment), abstinence rates were higher in TMC than in TAU, with the treatment effect larger in those who had been drinking at baseline (OR=2.47, p= .007) than in those who had been using cocaine (OR=1.95, p= .04). 
Conversely, in patients with no days of cocaine or alcohol use in the 30 days prior to 
baseline, there were no treatment effects. Of note, incentivizing participation in the telephone sessions dramatically increased the number of sessions completed, but did not further improve outcomes.      
e. Summary of Findings from Our Research Program.  These studies demonstrate our 
ability to recruit large samples in a timely fashion, enroll Veterans who are engaging 
in risky drinking into research studies, deliver interventions over the telephone, and maintain high follow-up rates across periods as long as 24 months.  Three of these studies also provide evidence to support the effectiveness of enhanced or extended interventions for patients who do not evidence a good initial response to 
alcohol/drug treatment. 
 
I. Purpose of the Project: (Clearly provide the purpose of this research project.)  In this application, 
we propose to test an integrated prevention intervention, designed to reduce rates of risky 
drinking in Veterans receiving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75171]. For Veterans on opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438], they must have a chronic 
pain diagnosis.  This adaptive, patient-centered intervention provides integrated clinical 
assessment, brief intervention, monitoring, and extended prevention services delivered through a combination of telephone calls, and text messages.  
J. Describe the Research Questions or Hypotheses (that is, what questions are you trying to 
address by [CONTACT_75234]. ) 
1. Primary objective: To compare the effectiveness of a 12-month prevention intervention (PI) 
with a brief intervention only group (BIO) over an 18-month follow-up period, for Veterans treated with prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75172]/hazardous drinking, based on NIAAA guidelines.  
 Hypothesis 1 :  PI [INVESTIGATOR_75173], as indicated by [CONTACT_75235]/hazardous alcohol use across the follow-up period. 
2. Secondary objectives:  To examine secondary outcome measures, moderator effects, and 
mediation effects:  
 Hypothesis 1 :  PI [INVESTIGATOR_75174], biological measures of heavy drinking (i.e., GGT and CDT), urine toxicology tests to assess other drug use, depression, and pain.  
 Hypothesis 2:  Rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75175]  
 Hypothesis 3 :  Intervention effects will be greater in higher-risk Veterans, including 
those with higher prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75176], co-occurring benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_2597], poor social support, and low readiness for change.   
 Hypothesis 4 : Results favoring PI [INVESTIGATOR_75177], self-efficacy, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
 
K. Primary Outcome Variable(s): (Define the primary outcome variable(s) used to support the study 
objectives (e.g. if the objective is to show that treatment A is superior to treatment B in the treatment of subjects with essential hypertension, the primary outcome variable is blood pressure measurement.)    The primary outcome measure will be rates of risky drinking (i.e., more than 4 
drinks at any one sitting or more than 14 drinks/week for men; more than 2 drinks at any one 
sitting or more than 7 drinks/week for women) (5) within each follow-up period, as determined 
by [CONTACT_75236].

 L. Secondary Outcome Variable(s): (Define the secondary outcome variables. Such measured 
variables should also include the timing of measurement.)   Secondary outcomes in the study will 
be self-reported frequency of heavy drinking days (TLFB), biological measures of alcohol use 
(%dCDT and GGT), urine toxicology tests to assess other drug use, VA records of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], depression, and pain.

2.2. Describe how randomization or other treatment assignment will be made.  Veterans 
who meet criteria for participation will be randomly assigned to one of the two 
treatment conditions.  Urn randomization will be used to balance the groups on three factors: gender, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_75180], and age.  We will also be blocking on whether the person admits use or not when we do the randomization, 
so we get equal numbers of non-users in each condition.  Urn randomization is a 
kind of biased-coin randomization where probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented. As the sample size increases, the randomization shifts from perfect balance to complete randomization.

O. Study Procedure  
1. Study Procedures 
Outline all study procedures - (If necessary, include a table or flow chart, showing the 
schedule of the procedures and interactions.  Distinguish between interventions that are experimental and carried out for research purposes vs. those that are considered 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81614] of care. Routine procedures that are performed solely for research purposes 
should also be identified.) Recruitment for this study will happen in a few ways. For 
the majority of our potential participants, we will be using pharmacy records and 
reaching out by [CONTACT_75237] (Letter and phone script provided). We will use VA pharmacy records to identify Veterans who are currently being prescribed daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_75182]. Veterans already in treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD) will then be excluded from the study. 
Veterans in treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_75183] a daily medication 
assisted regimen (i.e. OTP program) will be included as long as they have a chronic pain diagnosis and no AUD. For potentially eligible patients, we will send an encrypted email to the prescribing physicians (See email content below).   If a PCP objects to our intent to recruit their patient, we will not send that Veteran a 
letter.  If the clinician does not object to the study team contact[CONTACT_75238]-up with a telephone call to invite them to participate (phone script provided). We respect the time of all the Veterans we are recruiting for this study. We want to ask these other questions because if we can clearly determine a 
Veteran is not eligible, we do not want to make them come in for a long 
consent/screening/baseline appointment and then be told they cannot participate. The Veteran may have to pay to take public transportation to the VAMC, or may be upset after completing the long first session and finding out they cannot participate. We want to limit unnecessary costs and agitation experienced by [CONTACT_75239].  
There are a few potential outcomes of the screening call: 
 If they are not eligible for the study and the Participant will not be 
contact[CONTACT_49496]. No referral or communication of results will be made.  If they are ineligible due to screening positive for a substance use disorder (by [CONTACT_7661] [ADDRESS_81615]), then they are drinking (or using) at too high a level and the results of this screening will be communicated to BHL for further clinical care. 
 If they are not currently receiving mental health services at the MHC, and 
eligible: If Veteran decides to participate, a study counselor will complete 
the Brief Intervention only after participant has been consented to 
participate in the study and admits to any drinking. If the counselor determines their alcohol use is severe enough to necessitate more intensive treatment (i.e. inpatient treatment), the Veteran will be referred to the higher level of care and will be removed from our study. If Veteran decides not to participate, the technician will thank them for their time and 
end the call. A research note describing the outcome of screening call will 
be created in CPRS. 
 If they are currently receiving mental health services at the MHC, and 
eligible: If Veteran decides to participate, a study counselor will complete the Brief Intervention only after participant has been consented to participate in the study. If Veteran decides not to participate or is later found to be ineligible, standard care through the MHC will continue as if 
he/she had never been contact[CONTACT_33634]. A research note 
describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS. 
 If they are not currently receiving mental health services at the MHC, and 
ineligible: A research note describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS. 
 If they are currently receiving mental health services at the MHC, and 
ineligible: Standard care will continue through the MHC as if the Veteran had never been referred to the study. A research note describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS. 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 13 of 39 
  It is possible through the course of receiving care at the CMCVAMC that a 
Veteran has received a BI in the past. However, this treatment could have occurred far enough in the past (i.e. greater than 3 months) that the BI 
would need to be repeated. As we cannot ensure a Veteran has received a 
recent (within the past 3 months) BI through the MHC, the study staff will perform the BI’s for those Veterans.  
 If enrolled in the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_75184]: If Veteran decides 
to participate, a study counselor will complete the Brief Intervention only after participant has been consented to participate in the study. If Veteran decides not to participate or is later found to be ineligible, standard care 
through the OTP will continue as if he/she had never been contact[CONTACT_75240]. A research note describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS. 
 If enrolled in the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_75185]: Standard care 
will continue through the OTP as if the Veteran had never been referred to the study. A research note describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS.

Our recruitment entails sending Mr./Ms. XX a letter and then following up with 
him/her via phone one week later.   If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact [CONTACT_1758]’s principal investigator, James R McKay at [EMAIL_1514]  
 
Thank you,  Margaret Lawlace  
Referrals from BHL 
In addition, we will take referrals from BHL.  BHL will refer subjects based on any 
alcohol and/or use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480].  If a Veteran expresses interest in our study to a member of the BHL team, study staff will be notified and will call the Veteran to further explain the study and perform a screening (phone script provided).  
In this scenario, there are a few potential outcomes of the screening call: 
 If referred from the BHL and eligible: Results of screening call and 
patients’ decision to participate will be communicated to the BHL. A counselor from the study team will perform the Brief Intervention. If participant decides not to participate, services at the CMCVAMC will continue as if participant had never been referred to the study. A research note describing the outcome of screening call will be created in CPRS. 
 If referred from the BHL and ineligible: Results of screening call and 
ineligibility to participate will be communicated to the BHL. Services at the 
CMCVAMC will continue as if participant had never been referred to the 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81616] a mobile phone and all participants’ phones were 
SMS ready with 60% of participants having unlimited messaging plans.  For those who are potentially eligible following the phone screen (and interested in participating), the next step is coming to the VA for consent.  After consent, 
subjects will complete the first research visit. Final eligibility is determined after 
consent using the SCID and MINI. If after learning more about the study during the consenting process, the Veteran decides not to consent, or if they are ineligible following the SCID and MINI, then the Veteran will continue to receive services at the CMCVAMC to which they are eligible and entitled to. This could include 
services through the BHL or MHC. Similarly, Veterans can also elect to stop their 
participation in the study and can withdraw without penalty in writing using the revocation form at any time after they have consented to the study. In this case, their normal care at the CMCVAMC will continue.  Veterans who meet criteria for participation will be randomly assigned to either 
receive the usual care (that which they would have gotten if they had not chosen 
to be in the study); or Prevention Intervention (PI).   As a result of relaxing our inclusion criteria, it is likely that we will randomize Veterans who have not consumed alcohol in the past three months. For those 
Veterans, we will monitor their alcohol use during the research follow up visits at 
3, 6, and [ADDRESS_81617] the Brief Intervention or Prevention Intervention. 
 
Brief Intervention (BI) 
Both groups will have received or will be scheduled to receive Brief Intervention (BI).  A brief intervention includes providing feedback linking the Veteran’s drinking to their health issues, in addition to providing education and advice 
about recommended drinking limits, and how to reduce alcohol use. In general, a 
BI involves increasing an individual’s insight about the risk of drinking on opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and how to cut down. However, each Veteran presents with a different situation, and thus the BI can be flexible in terms of content. Sometimes the BHL will send the NIAAA workbook “rethinking drinking” to a Veteran, sometimes they won’t. Sometimes a Veteran will get a follow up call, and sometimes they won’t. It 
depends on what the Veteran needs. So in terms of what exactly the research 
staff will do during BI’s, it will follow a similar structure to the BHL BI’s (raise insight, identify strategies on how to reduce) but the details on how to accomplish those goals will vary based on each Veteran’s individual situation.  
For Veterans not enrolled in the Mental Health Clinic (MHC), study staff will 
administer the BI since as a result of broadening our inclusion criteria these are individuals that would likely not be serviced by [CONTACT_75241]. If during the baseline visit study staff determine that the Veteran’s drinking warrants a referral to the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL) then the BHL will administer the BI. For Veterans 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81618] all of their material and can perform BI 
according to standards set in the BHL protocol.  Study staff will get ongoing supervision from the BHL staff, to make sure that we are following their protocol. The research counselors are Masters level clinicians trained in recovery counseling and the administration of Brief Interventions. On average, BI’s take about 20 minutes, and will be done over the phone. Subjects will not be 
compensated for the BI done for study purposes. While not all BI’s require a 
follow up call, following the same procedures done by [CONTACT_75242], the research staff providing the BI at times will complete one or two follow up calls one month after the initial BI, to check in on an individual’s progress. 
   
The reason why study staff needs to provide BI to subjects recruited from MHC is 
that BHL provides services to primary care patients.  Patients already using mental health specialty care are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_75186].  
Brief Interventions for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75187]’s 
for Veterans recruited from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75188]. These BI’s will follow the same structure as BI’s that occur at the Crescenz VA, they will be over the phone and take about 20 minutes to complete.  
Brief Intervention Only Group (BIO) 
This group only receives a Brief Intervention (BI) that is recommended in 
response to risky alcohol use. Participants in this group will have [ADDRESS_81619] designed an adaptive monitoring intervention, delivered 
primarily through text messages and brief telephone calls that can provide 
extended prevention services for Veterans engaging in risky/hazardous alcohol 
use. These services address motivational issues and identify more effective ways to cope with stress and other factors that trigger unsafe alcohol use. The intervention is adaptive in two ways. Veterans who reduce alcohol use to safe levels will be placed in a monitoring track, which consists of tailored text 
messages (see appendix which contains examples of text messages to be used) 
and brief monthly telephone contacts. Conversely, Veterans who continue to use alcohol at hazardous levels will instead be placed in a track that provides tailored text messages and more frequent telephone calls. In addition to monitoring, these calls provide further prevention/brief intervention services to help the Veteran reduce alcohol use to non-hazardous levels and reduce the use of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_75189].  Phone calls will be 
audio recorded to ensure adherence of the Research prevention counselors to the manuals.  We will remind subjects that calls are being recorded and they can refuse the recording, but still participate in the research call.  
The Wellpass system will automatically send text messages to Veterans either 
within messaging windows or at specific days and/or times depending on the goal of the message (e.g. appointment reminder vs. motivational message vs. just-in-time support for at-risk Veterans).  On average, Veterans will receive between 1-14 tailored text messages per week, depending on whether they are reducing 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81620] on average weekly ecological 
assessments. (Ecological assessments are research questionnaires that happen in the “real world.” Ours will entail text messages such as: “Have you met the goal you set for yourself over the past week? Please respond 1 (not at all), 2 (somewhat) or 3 (mostly).” These are different from the motivational messages and are used to track progress and inform phone counseling sessions.)  Veterans 
who are having trouble meeting their goals will receive more assessment 
messages. Veterans who initially reduce alcohol use to safe levels and are therefore placed in the monitoring track will transfer over to the more intensive prevention track if their alcohol use increases to risky levels at some point in the 12-month intervention. Veterans whose alcohol or drug use escalates to DSM-V 
moderate to severe substance use disorder levels will be given a referral to 
specialty care and their progress will be evaluated at regular follow-up visits.  Although the research counselors will be able to alter the messaging frequency and scripts based on the progress of the Veteran, decision support rules based 
on change will help guide messaging content and frequency to reduce research 
counselor burden. The system will alert research counselors to reductions in motivation or other red flags that may indicate the Veteran needs more support and will include proactive “help messages” for Veterans in the moment, which will trigger just-in-time messages and system alerts. In addition, Veterans can decide on the minimum and maximum number of messages they wish to receive 
per week.
  The text message conversations between our research counselors and 
the study participant will also be recorded and kept in an encrypted database.  
All participants will be using their own cell phones during their participation in the 
study. We will instruct participants to inform us if they lose/damage their phone. 
However, we will not replace Veterans’ personal cell phones. If data security is 
breached, we will follow VA and HIPAA mandatory disclosure procedures. If data 
is lost but not breached (e.g. to server malfunction), we will assess the situation 
and alert the study sponsor. 
 
Study visits: 
In addition to the intervention, all participants will be seen at 3, 6, 9, 12, and [ADDRESS_81621] baseline for research follow ups. Participants enrolled after 4/1/[ADDRESS_81622] baseline for research follow ups. These will be done at the CMCVAMC and will take approximately 1.5 hours. The schedule of assessments (all of which are for research purposes only and not 
part of standard care) is as follows: SCID and MINI (B); Blood samples (%dCDT 
and GGT) (B and 18m); Time Line Follow-Back, SIP (B, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18); Drug urine toxicology tests (B, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18); Self-efficacy, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Social Support, Readiness to Change, pain, depression, quality of life (B, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18).  October 2015 Amendment 
Because of the potential subjects were concerned about the “integrated” aspect of the study and how it might influence their clinical care, we submitted an amendment to remove the integration of the study and leaving research notes summarizing their status will no longer be the default.  We have contact[CONTACT_75243], and they are fine with it.  The “integrated” nature was not 
an important pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  At a yearly progress meeting for DoD grant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], most 
of the other SUD related project have made it a point to NOT integrate their interventions with veterans¹s medical care, as it sharply reduces recruitment rates. 
 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81623] randomized 7 subjects.  We will notify them of the change, and re-
consent them. 
 January 2016 Amendment - An amendment to the protocol has been made adding 
two sites to the study, with the CMCVAMC being the coordinating site. We are adding VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75190]. These sites are being opened up to address 
the poor recruitment numbers at the CMCVAMC site. 
 There is also a change to where the data is housed. Now instead of data being housed on a secure server in the VA, it is housed on a secure server at the University of Pennsylvania. An Off-Site Storage form is included. Additionally, the 
Penn/PVAMC MOU is included. 
 Paper based data will ultimately be kept at the CMCVAMC. However, electronic data will be combined and stored at Penn. The direct data entry can be done at Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], CMCVAMC, and Penn, as long as there is internet access. 
 
July 2016 Amendment – An amendment to the protocol has been made to change 
the server back to the secure server at the VA. The reason for this is an issue with software and being able to get through the VA firewall for data entry.   Paper based data will ultimately be kept at the CMCVAMC. Electronic data for 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75191]. Penn data will be 
stored at Penn as there is no way to access the VA server from outside the VA.  January 2017 Amendment - Previously Veterans had to score a four or greater 
(females 3 or great) on the AUDC during the initial phone screen to be eligible to 
participate in the study. We have lowered this threshold to a score of two, as this 
score can still be indicative of regular/heavy alcohol use that would place Veterans prescribed chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_75192].   According the NIAAA, any alcohol use with contraindicated medications (like opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]) is considered risky:  
 
Certain people should avoid alcohol completely, including those who:  
 Plan to drive a vehicle or operate machinery 
  
 Take medications that interact with alcohol 
  
 Have a medical condition that alcohol can aggravate 
  
 Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant 
 
(https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-
consumption/moderate-binge-drinking ) 
 
Risky drinking will be ascertained during the AUDIT-C. Usually when administering the AUDIT-C, individuals will give vague answers (i.e. “every now and then”) that require follow up questions. For instance, if a Veteran affirms a 
period of time when they drank 6+ drinks in the past year, the interviewer could 
ask, “When was the last time that happened?” When asking about consumption the interviewer will be able to ascertain if the Veteran’s level of consumption meets this threshold (questions two and three) either with the Veteran’s initial response or with follow up questions. 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81624] care through the 
BHL. As Veterans will be referred with lower levels of alcohol use (but still risky), after BHL triage it is possible that these Veterans will not receive a brief intervention.   Further, our business office is moving away from using petty cash to compensate 
research participants. Instead, we are switching to the Greenphire ClinCard 
system. ClinCard functions like a Visa debit card, and money can be loaded on to the card remotely by [CONTACT_464]. Our protocol has been updated to describe the system, how it functions, how Veterans will be paid.   
March 2018 Amendment- We are changing the name [CONTACT_75284][INVESTIGATOR_75193]. We plan to change it to "Assisting Veterans in the Safe Use of Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]."  
Further, we plan to change the inclusion criteria to include Veterans on 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75194].   As part of broadening the inclusion criteria we plan to add a third group to the adaptive intervention. We will enroll and randomize the Veterans who do not 
admit to drinking and place them in a monitoring category where we continue to 
assess them and if they admit to consuming any amount of alcohol we would then transfer them to the treatment arm into which they had been randomized. This change is a significant change to the study but does not change the aims or outcomes and it does not increase the risk. It is a change supported by [CONTACT_75244] a way to increase enrollment and reach veterans that we think may be less 
truthful about their alcohol use out of fear that they will have their opi[INVESTIGATOR_75195].  Following up those who initially deny drinking will provide important data for the VA. The yearly AUDIT screening appears to be underestimating the numbers of 
vets who are drinking alcohol.  If our data indicate that a significant percentage of 
those who deny drinking at the start of the study end up reporting drinking later in the follow-up, it will be in indication that at risk patients (i.e., those on opi[INVESTIGATOR_75196]) are at risk due to underreporting of their drinking, which could be an unintended consequence of the current VA policies. 
 
We also will no longer be using the AUDIT-C.   Additionally, we have decreased the total n for the study to 150 from all sites. That is, 200 subjects from all sites being randomized (with 150 participants drinking and entering TX phase and 50 participants not drinking (25 at CMCVAMC and 25 
at Penn). 
 Moreover, there is a personnel change. Max Stern is no longer a Research Coordinator on this study.   
Lastly, SenseHealth has changed its name [CONTACT_75285] [ADDRESS_81625] been randomized at the following sites:

1.3. Not applicable; chart review or use of previously collected data - 
 
 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 22 of 39 
 2. Screening and/or Eligibility Requirements -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria are the same for 
screening before and after consent, however, some assessments used to determine 
final eligibility (such as the SCID and the MINI) are only administered once the Veteran comes to the lab (which occurs after a positive phone screen)  
2.1. Describe and provide justification for:  
2.1.1. Inclusion criteria: To be eligible for participation, Veterans must: (1) 
currently be receiving daily treatment with a prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75200], OR receive a daily prescription for opi[INVESTIGATOR_75201] a chronic pain diagnosis; (2) be between the ages of 18 and 75; (3) have a cell phone capable of receiving text messages; (4) and be willing to be in a study where they might receive text messages.   
 
If at some point during follow-up research visit, if a subject admits to drinking they will move on to the treatment arm that they were randomized to upon entry into the study. 
 
2.1.2. Exclusion criteria: Veterans will not be eligible if they: (1) meet DSM-V 
criteria for a moderate to severe alcohol or drug disorder (with the exception of nicotine abuse/dependence); (2) have a current psychotic disorder severe enough to require inpatient treatment; or (3) are participating in alcohol use treatment at the VA or elsewhere (with exception of screening and brief intervention at the VA); (4) are currently on palliative care or are being treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_75202]-related 
pain.  
 
2.2. List all screening and/or eligibility requirements. To be eligible for participation, 
Veterans must: (1) currently be receiving daily treatment with a prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_75203] a daily prescription for opi[INVESTIGATOR_75201] a chronic pain diagnosis; (2) be between the ages of 18 and 75; 
(3) have a cell phone capable of receiving text messages; (4) and be willing to be in a study where they might receive text messages. Veterans will not be eligible if they: (1) meet DSM-V criteria for a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (with the exception of nicotine abuse/dependence); (2) have a current psychotic disorder severe enough to require inpatient treatment; (3) are participating in 
AUD treatment at the VA or elsewhere (with exception of screening and brief 
intervention at the VA); or (4) are currently on palliative care or are being treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_75202]-related pain.  
 
2.3. Explain any special test or evaluations potential subjects may have to undergo before 
they are actually determined to be eligible for the study. The SCID and MINI will be 
administered to ensure that potential subjects do not meet DSM criteria for 
moderate to severe alcohol or drug disorders (except nicotine) or have a current 
psychotic disorder severe enough to require inpatient treatment.  If this is found 
during the research, we will refer the patient via a “warm hand-off” to either [CONTACT_75292], co-investigator, or Dr. DePhilippis, clinical liaison.

U. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
1. Potential Study Risk s 
1.1. Describe and assess all of the following risks that may be associated with the research: 
1.1.1. Physical There is a small chance of mild pain and swelling where the 
needle enters the skin and vein, bruising, infection and possibly fainting 
during the blood draws at baseline and 18 months. Texting (reading and 
sending) while driving may potentially lead to automobile accidents and 
bodily injury.  
1.1.2. Psychological There is a small chance that talking about their personal 
history can be embarrassing and/or lead to psychological discomfort.  
1.1.3. Social There is slight risk of embarrassment in terms of coming to the 
MIRECC suite for the research as MIRECC is geared towards research 
with mental illness and the stigma associated with mental illness.  
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81638] participants’ information through secure servers (for web-based 
data) and in locked cabinets in with the MIRECC suite (for paper-based 
data). In addition, there is the risk that a person authorized to access the 
text messages might use them for an unauthorized purpose or disclose 
them to an unauthorized party. 
1.1.8. Assess the likelihood and seriousness of such risks. Low.  
1.1.9. Other N/A 
1.2. Specify what steps will be taken to minimize these risks. Research staff is trained in 
the proper use and storage of confidential information as well as not to disclose 
information over the phone. Research staff is also trained in proper interviewing 
methods and how to handle delicate questions (such as questions regarding 
PTSD, etc). We have clinicians on hand at the VA who can speak with any Veteran 
who has experienced discomfort as a result of the research visit. We will attempt 
to schedule research visits on days that the Veteran has another appointment 
scheduled to minimize travel costs. Participants will be reminded of the risk of 
texting while driving and will affirm that they will not engage in this behavior with 
their signature [CONTACT_75288].  
1.3. If methods of research create potential risks, describe other methods, if any, that were 
considered and why they will not be used.       
1.4. If chart review, breach of confidentiality is always a concern.  Specify what steps will be 
taken to minimize these risks.        
 
2. Potential Study Benefits 
2.1. Assess the potential benefits to be gained by [CONTACT_31031], as well as benefits 
that may accrue to society in general as a result of the planned work.  The project will 
yield considerable information on whether a prevention intervention can help 
Veterans who are receiving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_75207] [ADDRESS_81639] outside the research context.  The 
alternative is VA’s usual care which includes a brief intervention aimed at 
reducing drinking.  
3.2 If none, state that the alternative is not to take part in this research  study at all.        
 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81640] (DSMB) or Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) ( All Phase III 
studies are required to have a DSMB.  However, the IRB has the right to require a DSMB with any 
study.)

W. Data Monitoring (Monitoring plans describe how a monitor, independent of the study team, regularly 
inspects study records to ensure the study is adhering to the study protocol and applicable research 
regulations and CMCVAMC requirements.  Monitoring plans do not necessarily require the use of an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  Such independent boards are usually 
reserved for high-risk phase I studies, or large, multi-center phase III trials.  Federally funded studies 
may require the use of an independent DSMB.)    
1. Describe the data monitoring plan.  (All protocols must have a data monitoring plan 
appropriate for the potential risks and the complexity of the study.)  Data will be collected using 
standardized forms and will only be identified with the study’s ID of the participant. The 
codes that link the name [CONTACT_75289] [CONTACT_10768] a secured cabinet at CMCVAMC. Most of the study data will be 
entered directly into databases as it is collected, via an intranet-based data entry system 
at the CMCVAMC.    Data forms that are not amenable to web-based data entry will be 
entered by [CONTACT_16133], and discrepancies will be corrected by a supervisor, based on source documents. The quality of the data will be monitored once per month. The study’s statistician will analyze the data, using SAS and SPSS software.    The primary outcome measure will be rates of risky drinking (i.e., more than 4 drinks at 
any one sitting or more than 14 drinks/week for men; more than 2 drinks at any one sitting or more than 7 drinks/week for women) within each follow-up period (e.g., months 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-18), as determine by [CONTACT_75236]. Secondary outcomes in the study will be self-reported frequency of heavy drinking days (TLFB), biological measures of alcohol use ((%dCDT and GGT), urine toxicology tests to assess other drug use, VA 
medical records of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], depression, and pain.  Outcome data will be 
analyzed using mixed effect regressions for continuous and categorical data (i.e., SAS) and various packages to examine mediation effects (i.e., MPlus).  The alpha level for the primary outcome will be set at 5%.   Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_75262].  The 
Research prevention counselors will receive standardized training on the interventions, which are all manualized.  Adherence to the manuals will be monitored using audiotapes and individual supervision provided by [CONTACT_75263].  If drift is observed the counselors will be re-trained.  
 
Blind interim analyses of the data will be conducted at two points when 50 and 75% of the sample has been accrued. If the results show statistically overwhelming significant differences between groups, the study will be stopped (or one of the conditions stopped). 
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81641] (UADE), and unanticipated or 
unexpected problems will be reported to the CMCVAMC IRB and sponsor .  (Refer to the 
CMCVAMC IRB Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Manual for reporting guidelines.)   In this 
study we will use the FDA definition of serious adverse events (SAEs).  SAEs will be 
systematically assessed at each clinic visit. Any SAE, whether or not related to study 
intervention, will be reported to the IRB and DoD. The initial SAE report will be followed 
by [CONTACT_63664] a completed SAE report to both institutions.  In the event that a participant either withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to discontinue a participant due to SAE, the participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_75264] a resolution is reached (i.e., the problem requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75209]), the SAE is 
determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or the SAE results in death.  Unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers or others, serious adverse events related to participation in the study and all volunteer deaths related to participation in the study should be promptly reported by [CONTACT_648] ([PHONE_164]), by e-mail 
([EMAIL_1515]), or by [CONTACT_6972] ([PHONE_165]) to the U.S. Army Medical 
Research and Materiel Command’s Office of Research Protections, Human Research Protections Office. A complete written report should follow the initial notification. In addition to the methods above, the complete report can be sent to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, ATTN: MCMR-RPH, [ADDRESS_81642], Fort Detrick, Maryland [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
Additionally, SAE’s, protocol deviations, breaches of confidentiality and unanticipated or unexpected problems will be reported to the VA IRB within five days of discovery. 
2.1. Describe the management of information obtain that might be relevant to participant 
protections such as:

or drug abuse. [CONTACT_75293] will be consulted in the event there is significant change 
to the Veterans’ use status. If the Veteran is in danger in terms of physical abuse 
or someone else is in danger due to the Veteran abusing them, [CONTACT_75293] will be 
consulted and the appropriate actions will be taken.  
 
4. Statistical Analysis  
4.1. Include statistical power calculations and the assumptions made in making these 
calculations. We consider the primary hypothesis of risky alcohol use, which 
compares PI [INVESTIGATOR_75210]. We use the 
sample size formulae of Diggle et al. We expect to have a 20% dropout rate by 
[CONTACT_24473] 18, and to see a risky drinking rate of 30%. On the assumption of a within subject correlation of 0.3 (resp. 0.4, 0.5), our sample size of 150 per group provides 80% power for a main effect difference of 30% versus 20% (resp. 30% versus 19%, 30% versus 18%) for the BIO versus PI [CONTACT_10609].  
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 31 of 39 
  
March 2018 Amendment:  Our original power analysis in the grant was very 
conservative, as it took into account multiple outcome measures and moderation and mediation analyses.  We had our statistician re-run the analyses, focusing on the main effect treatment group comparison with the primary outcome measure.  If we calculate sample size needed to have 80% power to find a 15- percentage point difference in rates of risky drinking between the two conditions (e.g., 35% 
control condition vs. 20% experimental condition on risky drinking rate), we need 
a total of 136 to 162 veterans (depending on different estimates of the correlation between the outcome measure at different follow-up points).  If the effect is slightly larger (e.g., 20 percentage point difference), we only need [ADDRESS_81643] 
examine our primary outcome measure. 
 
4.2. Define plans for data and statistical analysis, including key elements of the statistical 
plan, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_75211].  a. Primary objective: The responses for the primary hypothesis comprise 
five repeated binary measurements per participant indicating risky alcohol use over the follow-up points. Our main analyses will use mixed effects logistic regression models to compare the two groups on the rates of risky alcohol use. We expect that linear and quadratic trends will account for the patterns of use across time. If residual analyses suggest 
significant lack of fit, we will examine more general time trends using 
spline specifications. The main explanatory variable will be a binary factor indicating intervention group, together with terms for time trends, and for group by [CONTACT_25218], if appropriate. Based on analyses of similar data, we expect that a random intercept model, possibly with an 
autoregressive repeated measures structure, should provide a good fit to 
the covariance structure of the repeated measures, although we will examine more general specifications, if necessary. The estimated regression coefficients for the group variable, and possibly for group by [CONTACT_25218], will address our primary hypothesis. We will test whether estimated coefficients are different from zero, and will report 
estimates and approximate 95% confidence intervals.  
b. Secondary outcomes. For Hypothesis 1, we will use the same type of 
mixed effects logistic regression models as described above to compare the groups on urine toxicology tests for use of drugs other than alcohol. The frequency of heavy drinking is a count response, so we will use 
mixed effects Poisson regression models to compare two groups on the 
number of heavy drinking days in a week. The models will allow for over dispersion by [CONTACT_75265] a variance inflation factor or, if this is insufficient, by [CONTACT_75266]. Some subjects have more days without heavy drinking than would be expected under a Poisson model. To account for this, we will fit 
mixed effects zero inflation models. If levels of heavy drinking are too low 
even for zero-inflation models, we will compare the intervention groups on the absence or presence of any heavy drinking days in a week, using mixed effects logistic regression models. Measures of depression and pain, and biological measures of alcohol use, will be continuously 
distributed, and will be compared across the groups using mixed effects 
linear regression models, after transformation of these responses to approximate normality. The explanatory variables, time trends, and covariance structure for these secondary analyses will be chosen as described for the primary hypothesis.  
 
HRPP Accepted:  03-[ADDRESS_81644]. 
d. Mediation analyses. We will address Hypothesis 4 through mediation 
analyses, with changes in readiness for change, self-efficacy, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_75212]. Here, we will follow the methods described in (105) First, to address the time course of these mediators separately from outcome, we will use the same mixed effects model approach described above. 
Second, to address whether these mediators predict later risky alcohol 
use, we will conduct a further series of mixed effects model analyses, using lagged versions of the mediator variables as time-varying covariates, together with the intervention and the other explanatory variables described above. We expect that the intervention effects on the 
mediators and on the outcomes will occur gradually over time, so we will 
use a latent growth curve mediation model to address the joint behavior across time. As suggested by [CONTACT_38722], we will also examine the fit of other types of models, to obtain a more complete assessment of the intervention’s direct and indirect effects on outcomes. 
e. Missing values. The mixed effects models will provide valid estimates of 
treatment efficacy if the missing data meet the ignorable missingness 
assumption. We will conduct further analyses to assess the sensitivity of our inferences to possible violations of this assumption. First, we will use pattern mixture models (104), defining a categorical variable describing the main patterns of missing data, and including it as a main 
effect and interaction effect with intervention group in the modes for 
primary outcomes. Significant differences in the estimated intervention effects across levels of the pattern variable suggest one type of non-ignorable missingness. Second, shared parameter models (104) assume that the repeated responses and repeated binary indicators of missingness have possibly correlated random effects, and significant 
correlation indicates possible non-ignorability. Finally, semiparametric 
regression models (106) use inverse probability weighting to extend the validity of GEE models, and provide a different type of sensitivity analysis for the mixed effects models. All three approaches require certain model assumptions, so we will compare the results of the 
analyses over a range of such assumptions.

information as listed under section R.8 identification and recruitment of subjects).  We 
will use VA VISTA pharmacy records to identify Veterans who are currently being 
prescribed daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_75182]. Veterans already in addiction treatment will then be excluded from the study. For the remaining patients, the prescribing physicians will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and notified of

 Most often, the BHL refers Veterans to the study team who are engaging in risky 
drinking, but without the symptomology or levels of consumption that would 
warrant a referral to a higher level of care, such as the ARU. If during the triage assessment the BHL software flags a Veteran for risky drinking, but not a referral to a higher level of care, then the technician will refer them to the study team.

HRPP Accepted:  03-2015       Page 35 of 39 
 as listed under “Data Collection” section of this form.  Data will be collected in a private 
location by [CONTACT_3647]. Data collected via paper will be entered into the computer by 
[CONTACT_3021]. Data collected directly onto the computer will be reviewed by [CONTACT_75275]. The data will be identified using a four digit subject id number. Phone 
calls between study participants and research counselors will be recorded using a 
digital recorder. The audio files created from  these recordings will be stored on the VA 
server ( https://vhaphimulhl2.v04.med.va.gov/dmumain/ ). 
 
January 2016 amendment to change data storage location: Due to a system failure of the 
MIRECC DMU at the VA, an amendment to this ongoing protocol was made to change 
where data was stored (as detailed above and in below sections that describe data 
storage).  This is being done with the input from the ISO and PO, and under the current 
PENN-VA MOU on data storage (even though there is a separate PENN component to 
our study). The need to use the DMU at Penn is critical because  the DMU provides more 
oversight and protection over the safety and integrity of the data, being able to capture 
every entry and any changes made. It also keeps the data on a highly secured server to 
protect not only against hacking, but against catastrophic loss of data. 
 
We will re-consent current subjects. 
 
We also note that there was no data loss to due to the VA DMU failure.  July 2016 Amendment – An amendment to the protocol has been made to change the 
server back to the secure server at the VA. The reason for this is an issue with software and being able to get through the VA firewall for data entry.

drawer in a locked office separate from the consents. All data will be entered into a web-based data entry system on a VA server.  In addition, if a Veteran is in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_75215], we will be using 
digital recorders to capture the call, and then we will save the audio files of the call to 
the server ( https://vhaphimulhl2.v04.med.va.gov/dmumain/ ).

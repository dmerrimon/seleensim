amendment 1.0, dated February 27, 2017. 
Watson  Laboratories, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new generic f ormulation of budesonide 80 
mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.[ADDRESS_1270410] (i.e., Symbicort®) is required.   This study is designed to evaluate the bioequivalence between the administered test and reference products in 
accordance with the recommendations outlined in the  US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) Draft  Guidance on Budesonide; Formoterol fumarate dihydrate (June 2015). 
2. OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_904995] a new generic 
fixed -dose combination product containing budesonide 80 mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
4.5 mcg (BDS 80/FFD 4.5) (per actuation) inhalation aerosol pressurized metered dose inhaler 
(pMDI) manufactured by  [CONTACT_905005]. and r eference listed drug 
(RLD ) Symbicort®  (budesonide 80 mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg inhalation 
aerosol)  manufactured by [CONTACT_38227], in adolescent patients and adult patients with chronic 
but sta ble asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert 
Panel Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. 
To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference products should both be 
statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard to the study primary  endpoints. 
3. STUDY OVERVIEW  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, multicenter, multinational study to compare the therapeutic equivalence of  BDS 80/FFD 4.5 (per actuation) 

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015- 075-0AA 
Versi on Final  
Date Apr 11, 2018 
7 inhalat ion aerosol pMDI manufactured by  [CONTACT_905005]. and RLD 
Symbicort® manufactured by [CONTACT_38227], in  adolescent patients and adult patients with 
chronic but stable asthma as defined in NAEPP [ADDRESS_1270411] a documented diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. 
Male patients and non-pregnant, non- lactating female patients 12 years to  75 years of age who 
meet the entry criteria may be enrolled.  
The study consists of a 2-week open placebo Run-in Period fol lowed by a 6 -week  randomized 
Treatment Period (test, reference, or placebo).  
Written informed consent/assent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedure, which 
includes medication washout and restrictions. Informed consent/assent may be signed up to 14 
days prior to Visit 1.  
Screening Visit  
Patient demographic information, medical and asthma history, lung function, and clinical 
laboratory assessments will be collected after patients provide informed consent/assent  (the 
latter for adolescent patien ts) and before taking study drug. Laboratory values at screening 
must be normal (or abnormal and not clinically significant) as evaluated by [CONTACT_737]. 
At Visit 1, patients will perform spi[INVESTIGATOR_904996] a pre -bronchodilator f orced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) of ≥45% and ≤85% of the predicted normal value using 
the equations derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
III dataset for adults.  All lung function tests will be conducted in accordance with current 
American Thoracic Society/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ATS/ERS) recommendations. 
Patients must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV 1 within 30 minutes following  360 mcg 
(4 puffs) of albuterol (free base) or 400 mcg (4 puffs) of salbutamol inhalation (pMDI) at 
screening (Visit 1). Up to 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_904997] (30 minutes ± 10 minutes) are permitted at Visit 1. If the  patient achieves 
<15%, but ≥10% reversibility at Visit 1, the site may instr uct the patient  to hold long- acting 
β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA ) and/or i nhaled corticosteroids  (ICS) and return up to [ADDRESS_1270412]. Only 1 repeat of  the Visit 1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (to retest for reversibility) is 
allowed per screening.  
Patients will receive instruction on how to measure PEF rate (PEFR) and answer electronic 
diary (eDiary) questions asking the patient about his/her asthma symptoms. Patients will also 
be instructed to measure PEFR and answer the questions before self -administering the 
provided study drug. Patients will also be given an albuterol/salbutamol pMDI as rescue medication and instructed to use 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol as needed to relieve 
asthma symptoms.  
Open Label Placebo Run- in Period  
Eligible patients will enter an open label, placebo Run- in Period of at least 2 weeks in  duration 
(but not longer than 21 days, unless approved by [CONTACT_738813] ) to wash 
out any pre- study corticosteroids or  long-acting bronchodilators and to establish FEV
[ADDRESS_1270413] 70% (rounded to whole number) of 
study drug doses in the Run-in Period to proceed into the randomized Treatment Period. 
Compliance will be  based on patient eDiary documentation of doses taken from the eCOA 
Visit 1 date (which may differ from the eCRF Visit 1 date due to rescreening or other delays 
in the start of placebo administration) until the Visit 2 date .  
Randomized Treatment Period  
Those continuing to meet entry criteria will enter a 6 -week Treatment Period (Day 1) and be 
randomly assigned in a 4:4:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  
• Test product: BDS 80/FFD 4.5 inhalation aerosol (manufactured by  [CONTACT_905008].) ( Test Drug ) 
• Reference product (RLD): Symbicort® (manufactured by [CONTACT_38227]) ( Reference 
Drug )

On the first day of treatment at Visit 2, FEV [ADDRESS_1270414]  treatment 
week (treatment day 21 ± 7 days) and for Visit 4, at the end of the sixth treatment week 
(treatment day 42 + 7 days). Patients will be  instructed to withhold the study drug and not 
perform morning PEFR measurements until they arrive at the clinic on the morning of Visit 3 (Day 21 ± 7 days) and Visit 4 (Day 42 + 7 days). On both visits, FEV
1 will be determined at 
60, 30, and 5 minutes pre-dose, the average of which constitutes the pre-dose (0) value. If only one acceptable session is available, it  will be used as the pre-dose (0) value.  
At the beginning of each visit, the Investigator will thoroughly review the patient’s eDiary entries and discuss the results with the patient. The patients will be asked about their 
medication washouts and whether they have experienced any unusual symptoms or medical 
problems since the last visit. Patients will be reminded that they must inhale the  study drug as 
instructed. 
Overall, the planned duration of patient participation is [ADDRESS_1270415]:reference:placebo. Approximately  [ADDRESS_1270416] -2015- 075-0AA

3.3 Randomization and Unblinding Procedures  
3.3.1 Patient  Identification  
Upon enrollment into the study (i.e., Visit 1, Screening ), each patient  will be sequentially 
assigned a 6-digit patient  identification ( PID) number that uniquely identifies the patient with 
the first three digits identifying the site and the last three digits identifying the  patient number 
at the site. The PID number for each patient will be assigned via Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS) .  
Once assigned, the PID number cannot be reused or reassigned even if a subject does not enter the ran domized Treatment Period or withdraws from the study at any time. Patients  who 
remain in the study will retain their PID numbers throughout the study.  3.3.2 Randomization Scheme  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment on a  basis to generic BDS 80 /FFD  
4.5 inhalation aerosol manufactured by  [CONTACT_905005]. (T est Drug ), 
Symbicort® (R eference drug), or P lacebo, respectively.  
3.3.3 Allocation/Randomization of Subjects to Treatment  
Randomization of patient to treatment will occur at Visit 2 (Day 1) after all screening  
procedures have been performed and eligibility for the study confirmed. Each randomized 
patient will receive a unique randomization number assigned via IWRS. Randomized patients 
who terminate their study participation for any reason, regardless of whether study drug was 
taken or not, will retain their randomization number. 
For the randomization of patients, the Investigator will use an IWRS. Appropriate 
documentation will be filed in the Trial Master File (TMF). IWRS will assign patients to  a 
treatment group based on the pre- defined randomization list.  
4. STUDY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOMES  
This study’s co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015 -075-0AA 
Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
13 • Baseline -adjusted area under the serial FEV 1-time curve calculated from time 0 (zero) 
to [ADDRESS_1270417] day of the Treatment Period ( Visit 2 , Day 1).  
• Baseline -adjusted , pre-dose FEV [ADDRESS_1270418] 
day of treatment ( Visit 4, Da y 42). The FEV 1 Baseline is defined as the average of the 
pre-dose FEV 1 values obtained on Day 1. The Visit 4 FEV1 value will be measured as 
the mean of acceptable values collected at the visit or a single measurement if only one 
acceptable (per ATS criteria) spi[INVESTIGATOR_904998]. 
5. HYPOTHESES TESTING  
Hypothesis of Equivalence  
A two -sided, 90% confidence interval on the test/reference ratio for each of the study’s co-
primary endpoints  will be constructed using a n Analysis of Co variance  (ANCOVA)  model of 
the Test and Reference results with  treatment and study site as fixed effect s and b aseline FEV 1 
as covariate, further applying  Fieller's method .  
Clinical endpoint bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals for the 
ratio of test/reference means, for both endpoints , are contained within the interval [80.00% , 
125.00% ] for the Per -protocol Set . 
Hypot hesis of Superiority  
In order to demonstrate adequate sensitivity, both test and reference treatments will be compared with placebo with respect to the primary endpoints using an AN COVA model with 
treatment a nd study site as fixed  effect s and baseline FEV
[ADDRESS_1270419] /reference ratios for the co -primary 
endpoints.  
6. ANALYSIS SUBSETS  
6.1 Enrolled Set (ENS)  
The Enrolled Set (ENS) will consist of all subjects who provided informed consent/assent.

7. STATISTICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS  
7.1 General Principles  
The statistical analyses will be performed by  [CONTACT_905009] , 
using SAS Version 9.3 (or higher). All tables, figures and listings will be produced in 
landscape format.  
In gen eral, all data will be listed by [CONTACT_588269]/time point where appropriate. The 
summary tables will be stratified by , or have columns corresponding to, treatment groups. 
The total number of subject s in the treatment  group (N) under the stated analysis  set will be 
displayed in the header of summary tables. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables. Unless 
otherwise specified , descriptive statistics will include number of subject s, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, me dian and maximum. Number of subjects with missing values will also 
be displayed, but only if non-zero. The minimum and maximum statistics will be presented to 
the same number of decimal places as the original data. The mean and median will be presented to one more decimal place than the original data. The standard deviation will be 
presented to two more decimal places than the original data.  
In summary tables of categorical variables, counts and percentages will be displayed. The 
count [n] indicates the actual number of subject s in a particular category , which should always 
be less than or equal to the total number of subject s in the respective study group with known 
(non- missing) category [M ]. Percentage will be obtained by: % = n/ M*100. Unless otherwise 
specified, all percentages will be expressed to one decimal place.  
All statistical tests will be two -sided at a significance level of α = 0.05, unless otherwise 
indicated.  No adjustment will be made for multiplicity.  
Baseline will be defined as the last assessment , scheduled or not, prior to the first dose of the 
randomized study drug, unless otherwise specified.

Relative days will be calculated as follows only when the full assessment date is known (i.e., 
partial dates will have missing relative days).  
For assessment on or after the day of first dose of the randomized study drug: 
Relative Day = Date of Assessment – Date of First Dose of Randomized Study Drug+1. 
For assessment before the day of first dose of the randomized study drug: 
Relative Day = Date of Assessment – Dat e of First Dose of Randomized S tudy Drug. 
All dates will be displayed in DD/ MMM/ YYYY format.  
7.[ADDRESS_1270421] s enrolled in the study, 
randomized to treatment, included in the SAF, mITT ,  PPS , prematurely 
discontinued from the study  after randomization  (along with the reasons for discontinuation)  
will be presented . The same analysis will be repeated by [CONTACT_3885].  
An overall summary of the number of subjects in each population by [CONTACT_905010].  
All disposition information will be listed.  Additionally, a listing of subjects who discontinued 
from the study prematurely will be created, including date of discontinuation and primary 
reason.  Also a listing of enrollment details will provide the date of informed consent/assent 
and inclusion/exclusion criteria not met, if any . 
7.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will include:

1 baseline.  The FEV 1 baseline will be defined as the average of the pre-dose FEV 1 values 
obtained at Visit 2  Day 1.  If some of these measurements are missing, the average will be 
calculated using the available measurements , however, a minimum of two pre-dose FEV 1 
values  is required; subjects who have only one or no pre- dose FEV [ADDRESS_1270423] will be excluded from analysis. 
Calculation of FEV 1 AUC 0-12. The endpoint of Baseline -adjusted FEV 1 AUC 0-12 on Day 1  
will be calculated as follows:

alculation of Baseline -adjusted pre -dose FEV 1 at end of treatment .  
The endpoint of Baseline -adjusted pre- dose FEV 1 at end of treatment  will be calculated as  
[FEV 1 at end of treatment] – [Basel ine FEV 1] 
where FEV 1 at end of treatment will be defined as  the single or average (if multiple available)  
pre-dose assessment (s) at Visit [ADDRESS_1270427] has no pre- dose assessment at Visit 4, Day 42, in the mITT  analysis Average FEV 1 
at end of treatment will be imputed  (following LO CF rule)  as the average of available pre-
dose assessments on the last post- baseline day when at least two pre -dose FEV 1 assessment 
are available (e.g. the Early Termination visit) .  
. In the PPS 
analysis, however, the endpoint will not be imputed and the subject will be thus excluded from analysis, unless the subject missed Visit 4 Day 42  because he/she discontinued from the study 
due to lac k of efficacy. In the latter case the endpoint will be imputed in the same way as for 
mITT  analysis even in the PPS analysis.

22 FEV 1 AUC 0-12 on Day 1 and FEV1 at end of treatment (both absolute and baseline -adjusted) 
will be summarized  descriptively by [CONTACT_223259] , for the mITT set and the PPS 
appropriate for each endpoint . 
7.8 Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the SAF.  
7.8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulat ory Activities 
(MedDRA version 20.0) AE coding system for purposes of summarization. 
Only Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) starting will be used for the summary 
analysis. An AE will be considered as treatment -emergent if the time of onset is on or after the 
time of the first placebo  administration in the study Run- in period. AEs with unknown start 
dates will be counted as treatment- emergent unless the AE resolution date is prior to the 
placebo  start date. If the start date is partially missing , the AE will be considered treatment -
emergent, unless the month and year (when available) rule out the possibility that  the event 
occurred post dosing.  
All AEs will be assigned to study periods for the purposes of the tabulations:  
Run-in Period:  All TEAEs with onset at the time o n or after the first dose of placebo study 
drug during the Run- in Period until the time of the first dose of randomized study drug.  
Treatment Period : All TEAEs with onset at the time of or after the first dose of randomized 
study drug during the Treatment Period . 
For the purposes of assigning TEAEs to study  periods partial onset dates will be imputed as 
the latest possible date compatible with the known partial information; thus in case of 
ambiguity TEAEs will be assigned to Treatment per iod.  
A TEAE is defined  as treatment -related if it is recorded  as related, probably related or 
possibly related to the study medication on the e CRF . In case the relatedness was not assessed , 
the most conservative result ( related ) will be chosen for the ana lysis.  
In summaries of TEAEs a  subject  experiencing the same AE multiple times will only be 
counted once for that preferred term. Similarly, if a subject  experiences multiple AEs within 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -[ADDRESS_1270428] 1 TEAE in the following  categories:  
• Any TEAE  
• Treatment -related TEAE  
• Serious TEAE  
• TEAE leading to discontinuation of the study medication  
• TEAE leading to death . 
The following TEAE frequency tables will be prepared summarizing the overall number of TEAEs, the number and percentage  of subject s reporting at least one TEAE by [CONTACT_113997] ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT), by [CONTACT_273602]:  
• All TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• AEs leading to discontinuation of the study medication 
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_905013] 
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_905014] . 
All information pertaining to adverse events noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130] , 
detailing verbatim, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date , intensity, outcome, 
action taken and causal relationship to the study drug. The adverse event onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the date of first administration of the study medication.

below and presented (in number of days).  
                          AE Duration = AE Stop Date – AE Start Date + 1  
7.8.2 Laboratory tests  
Laboratory safety assessment (i.e., clinical chemistry and hematology) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_905015] p resence of any findings that meet the description of an AE. Laboratory 
test results will not be listed or summarized.  
Pregnancy test results and results of the drug and alcohol screen will be listed.

  
 
 
Note that in the calculation of the planned number of doses for the run- in period the date o f 
Visit 1 is taken from the  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_258230]) data. It may differ from the CRF data if 
subjects return for repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757]. In such cases the  data will record the 
repeat visit as Visit 1.  The intent is to take the date of the repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_291386], if one 
occurred, and the date of the original screening visit, if no repeat occurred. 
All doses in the diary recorded on or after the date of Visit [ADDRESS_1270432] 75% and not more

27 than 125% of doses. The compliance will be analyzed using the descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_905016]. The proportion of compliant vs. non- compliant subjects will be 
tabulated for each study period and treatment group .  
Duration of exposure will be calculated by [CONTACT_905017] [Date of last use of study 
medication in the period] – [Date of first use of study medication  in the period]  + 1. Duration 
of exposure will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_530795].  
Compliance and duration of exposure  will also be listed.  
These analys es will be performed for the SAF . 
Diary compliance will be determined only for the purposes of identification of protocol 
deviations. Diary compliance will be determined based on the compliance report from BMS 
similar to study drug compliance. In the Run -in period: “ Run- In: Actual Number of 
Questionnaire Completions ” / “Run- In: Expected Number of Questionnaire Completions ”. In 
the Treatment period: (“ Treatmen t V2-V3: Actual Number of Questionnaire Completions ” + 
“Treatment V3 -V4: Actual Number of Questionnaire Completions ”) / (“ Treatment V2 -V3: 
Expected Number of Questionnaire Completions ” + “Treatment V3 -V4: Expected Number of 
Questionnaire Completions ”) * 100%.  
7.8.9 Rescue medication use 
Number of rescue medication uses in Run- in and Treatment periods will be counted in the 
diary, using the answers from “AM Questionnaire” (“If you had difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_905002], did you need to take albuterol/salbutamol (your rescue 
medication)?”) “PM Questionnaire” (“Did you need to take albuterol/salbutamol (your rescue 
medication)?”) and “Missed Recoding Questionnaire” (“Did you take your rescue medication 
yesterday morning (12:00am -11:59am)? ” and “Did you take your rescue medication yesterday 
afternoon or evening (12:00pm -11:59pm)?”) . This number will be summarized descriptively 
by [CONTACT_530795]. It will also be listed.  
7.8.10 Prior and  Concomitant Medication  
Prior and concomitant  medication will be coded according to the World Health Organization – 
Drug Reference List and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Prior 
medications are defined as those taken before the first dose of randomized study drug on Day

medications are defined as those taken at the time of or after the first dose of randomized 
study drug. Any medications that were started before the first dose of randomized study drug 
on Day [ADDRESS_1270433]. Concomitant medications 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], ATC class (highest level avai lable) and preferred

4. If a patient discontinues the study prematurely, he/she will be invited to undergo an early termination visit with the same 
procedures as on Visit 4, except for  inhalation of the study drug. More specifically, a series of at least 3 spi[INVESTIGATOR_905004] 20 minutes in between. A medical follow -up examination 
including physical examination, blood pressure, pulse, ECG and clinical laboratory investigation will be done. 
5. Informed consent/assent may be signed up to 14 days prior to Visit 1. Written informed consent/assent must be obtained prior to 
any study- related procedure which includes medication washout and restrictions. 
6. Blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. Blood pressure and puls e will be measured at each clinical visit 
after at least [ADDRESS_1270436] in  supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. On Visits 2, 3, and 4, measurements will be done in the morning prior to inhalation, 
and a patient would not be administered study drug if  his/her blood pressure or pulse is deemed as clinically significant abnormal 
by [CONTACT_737].  
7. 12- lead ECG to be measured after at least [ADDRESS_1270437] demonstrate a pre -bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of the predicted value and at least 80% of 
the Visit [ADDRESS_1270438] day of treatment (Visit 2) the FEV1 must also be in the range of ≥45% and ≤85% of the 
predicted value.  
9. Patients must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 360 mcg of albuterol/400 mcg salbutamol inhalation pMDI. If the patient achieves <15%, but ≥10% reversibility at Visit 1, the site may instruct the pat ient to hold LABA 
and/or ICS and return up to [ADDRESS_1270439]. Only 1 repeat of the Visit 1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (to retest reversibility) is allowed 
per screening.

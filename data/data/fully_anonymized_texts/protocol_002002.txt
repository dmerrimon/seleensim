Original Protocol  30-APR -2020  2020N436091_00  
 
Amendment 3: 25-JAN-2021 
This amendment is considered substantial , based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union . 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment to add an additional cohort in the study .  
Before the last of 806 participants co mpleted the study (Last Subject Last Visit, Day 60), 
an interim analysis of the primary endpoint and all -cause mortality data at Day 28 
showed that substantial clinical benefit was evident in one of the pre -defined stratification 
subgroups “Age 70 to <80 y ears”, with no safety concerns in any subgroup.   Given the 
ongoing pandemic and particularly high mortality of COVID -[ADDRESS_911090] part of the study (Part 1) and decided that a second part will be 
added to the study (Part 2) which has less frequent assessments to decrease the burden on 
sites.   The following changes have been made in Amendment 3 for Part 2.  
Section # and Name  [CONTACT_674301]. Study 
Phase  Added that Part 2 is Phase 3 . Part 2 of the study is confirmatory 
and therefore, considered Phase 3.  
1.1. Synopsis , Brief 
Summary , Number of 
Participants  Added Part 2 . Additional cohort required to  confirm 
efficacy  and safety  in Part 1.  
1.1. and 3. 2. 
Objectives and 
Endpoints - Part 2  Added objectives and endpoints for 
Part 2 based on objectives and 
endpoints in Part 1 , added a 
secondary endpoint “All -cause 
mortality” at Day 28 , and deleted 
explorat ory endpoint s “Improvement 
of at least 2 points relative to baseline 
of Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score” and  
“Improvement relative to baseline in 
SpO 2, FiO 2, and SpO 2/FiO 2 ratio”. A pre -specified endpoint is a key 
value driver in the cost-effectiveness 
model , and th e exploratory endpoint s 
will not be reported.

23 2. INTRODUCTION  
Granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor  (GM-CSF) is a hemopoietic growth 
factor and a key mediator of tissue inflammation, that signals through the GM -CSFα/β 
receptor comp lex.  GM -CSF has multiple cellular sources, including monocytes, 
macrophages, T cells, B cells, neutrophils and tissue resident cells [Wicks , 2016].  GM -
CSF e xerts multiple pro -inflammatory effects on myeloid cells including macrophages, 
monocytes and neutrophils.  Pre -clinical models and human clinical trials have 
demonstrated that neutralizing GM -CSF or blocking the GM -CSFRα subunit can be 
efficacious in infl ammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Otilimab is a fully 
human anti -GM-CSF monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been well tolerated by 
[CONTACT_674259] -inflammatory activity in RA patients (phase 3 clinical 
trials ongoing).  
Emerging  data from COVID -19 patients indicate that GM -CSF may play an important 
role in the acute hyper -inflammatory state associated with severe stages of illness .  
Treatment with an anti -GM-CSF receptor (anti -GM-CSFR) mAb  (mavrilimumab ) was 
well tolerated, reduc ed fever and improved oxygenation in 6 patients experiencing a steep 
decline of pulmonary status due to COVID -19 pneumonia.  All patients were reported to 
respond to treatment, and 3 out of the 6 patients were discharged within 5 days  [Kiniksa , 
2020] , further supporting the  scientific rationale to evaluate the efficacy of otilimab in 
these patients.  
Update for Part 2  
New literature data has associated raised levels of GM -CSF in the circulation of COVID -
19 patients with age, disease severity and mortality [Hue, 2020;  Thwaites , 2020] .  
Furthermore , dysregulation of the circulating myeloid cell compartmen t involving 
inflammatory  / dysfunctional  / maladapted monocytes and neutrophils is being 
increasing ly recognised as a key driver of severe COVID -19 disease.  GM-CSF targets 
monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils and GM -CSF as a key driver of severe COVID -
19 disease has been widely proposed [Bonaventura , 2020; Lang , 2020; Mehta , 2020a].  
The scientific rationale supporting targeting GM -CSF in severe COVID -19 disease is 
also supported by [CONTACT_674260] -GM-CSF receptor (anti -GM-CSFR) mAb 
(mavrilimumab) in the clinic.  Mavrilimumab was shown to be well tolerated and clinical 
outcomes compared with standard care in 17 non -mechanically ventilated patients with 
severe COVID -19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation (17 patients, single -centre 
prospective cohort study [De Luca , 2020].  
2.1. Study Rationale  
A subset of patients with SARS -CoV-2 infection develop pulmonary complications and 
may transition to a form of  acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  (ARDS) and the most 
severe stage of illness, which manifests as an extra -pulmonary, systemic hyper -
inflammation syndrome [Siddiqi , 2020].  Markers of systemic inflammation appear to be 
elevated at this disease stage and have shown that inflammatory cytokines such as IL -2, 
IL-7, G-CSF, MCP -1, MIP -1α and TNFα were significa ntly elevated, particularly in 
COVID -19 patients requiring ICU treatment compared with those not requiring ICU

  214094  
24 treatment [Huang , 2020].   Elevated levels of IL -[ADDRESS_911124] been correlated with adverse patient outcomes [Coomes , 2020].  
In health y subjects , GM -CSF is not detectable in the circulation, however, GM -CSF was 
detectable in plasma of some COVID -19 patients whether they received ICU care or not 
[Huang , 2020].  In a s eparate study, numbers of GM -CSF-expressing monocytes, T  -
cells, B cells and NK cells were found in the blood of COVID -19 ICU and non -ICU 
patients compared with healthy controls.  The COVID -19 ICU patient group also had 
increased numbers of CD4+ T cells co -expressing GM -CSF and IFNγ, as well as 
increased numbers of GM -CSF+ CD8+ T cells compared with non -ICU patients [Zhou , 
2020].  
GM-CSF is well known to drive mono cytes/macrophages into proinflammatory 
phenotypes that are primed to produce inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL -1β 
and IL -6 [Hamilton , 2019; Wicks , 2016].  The observation that GM -CSF neutralization 
prevented IL -6, IL -8 and MCP -1 cytokine release by [CONTACT_674261] a co -culture CAR T -
cell assay [Sachdeva , 2019], and cytokine release in a humanized CAR T -cell xenograft 
mouse model [Sterner , 2019], suggests a role for GM -CSF as a driver of hyper -
inflammation and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  
Therefore, by [CONTACT_68461] -CSF signaling, an anti -GM-CSF mAb such as otilimab is 
hypothesized to work “upstream” of IL -6 in the hyper -inflammatory processes triggered 
by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 infection and will directly inhibit proinflammatory activities of 
monocytes/macrophages ( e.g. by [CONTACT_674262]α, IL -1β and IL -6 production) that 
perpetuate inflammation and cause tissue damage.  
Otilimab, a n anti-GM-CSF mAb , is currently in phase 3 development (ContRAst 
program) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) following phase 2 results, which showed a 
positive efficacy and s afety profile based on a large clinically -driven response for joint 
improvement and pain.  
In addition, lenzilumab (KB003), a nother anti-GM-CSF mAb dosed IV over 20 weeks 
was generally well tolerated in a placebo -controlled study in  inadequately controlled  
asthma patients, with no safety signals of concern and no increase in infection rate  
[Molfino , 2016].  Moreover, there were no dose limiting toxicities ide ntified and no 
treatment emergent, study drug -related, grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported in a phase 1 study 
of lenzilumab dosed in 15 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [Patnaik , 
2020].  
Otilimab has not previously been tested in patients with severe pulmonary COVID -[ADDRESS_911125] of 
care.   In order to understand risk and benefit in a stepwise fashion, the study has a leading 
cohort with detailed safety assessments to provide early evidence of safety prior to the 
larger cohort of patients to pr ovide further confirmatory efficacy and safety data that may 
facilitate early access to patients.

25 Update for Part 2  
Recent l iterature data ha ve shown GM -CSF to be particularly elevated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674219] -19 patients 70 years not requiring oxygen, and i n all patient ages with severe 
disease [Thwaites , 2020] and was associated  with mortality [Hue, 2020;  Thwaites , 2020].  
Age is widely recognised as the most significant risk factor for seve re COVID -19 disease 
and immune cell changes in severe COVID -19 disease bear resemblance to those 
observed in the  aging immune system [Hazeldine , 2020; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20206] , 2020;  Salimi , 2020].  
The age ing immune s ystem is characterized by [CONTACT_674263]  / 
dysfunctional monocytes, reduced lymphocyte function, reduced naïve T cell numbers 
and dysregulated myeloid cell responses [Aiello , 2019; Hazeldine , 2020; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20206] , 
2020; Salimi , 2020].  These changes result in a reduced ability of older individuals to 
respond to novel antigens and increase d levels of circulating inflammatory mediators.  
This may predispose older patients to the developm ent of severe COVID -19 disease with 
resultant  increased  viral load, increasing immune cell accumulation and further 
dysregulating monocytes, macrophage and neutrophil activities (in the circulation and the 
lung) [Pence , 2020; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20206] , 2020].  Post-mortem findings in fatal COVID -[ADDRESS_911126] shown the in flammatory infiltrate in lungs and other organs consists of high levels 
of macrophages and neutrophils  [Carsana  2020; Nienhold , 2020; Schurink , 2020].  
Therefore , targeting GM -CSF may prove more beneficia l in severe COVID -19 patients 
aged 70 years . 
Otilimab has been tested in patients with severe pulmonary COVID -19 related disease  in 
Part 1 of this study , with evidence of efficacy in the pre -defined stratification group of 
participants 70 to <80 years old , with no safety concern s.  The second part of this study 
aims to confirm that otilimab improves  the recovery of patients 70 years old with severe 
pulmonary  COVID -19 related diseas e. 
2.2. Background  
2.2.1.  Role of GM -CSF in inflammation  
Originally identified as a  hematopoietic growth factor, GM -CSF is now recognized as a 
key driver of tissue inflammation that exerts multiple pro -inflammatory effects on 
myeloid cells.  The cellular sources of GM -CSF include T cells, B cells, monocytes, 
macrophages, neutrophils and tissue resident cells [Wicks , 2016] and GM -CSF signals 
via the GM -CSFα/β receptor complex which is expressed on myeloid cells.  GM -CSF 
promotes survival and p olarize s monocytes/macrophages into pro -inflammatory 
phenotypes  that are primed  to produce pro -inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, 
IL-1β and IL -6 [Hamilton , 2019].  GM -CSF also extends neutrophil survival, primes the 
neutrophil oxidative burst, enhances phagocytosis and promotes neutrophil adhesion to 
endothelial cells and promotes neutrophil trafficking to sites of inflammation [Wicks , 
2016].  
Therapeutic inhibition of GM -CSF signaling by [CONTACT_674264] g serum IL -6 levels and indirectly suppress T -cell activation

26 patients in dicate that inhibition of GM -CSF or its receptor is anti -inflammatory and well 
tolerated with long -term dosing [Burmester , 2018; Taylor , 2019].  
2.2.2.  Scientific rationale to inhibit GM -CSF in COVID -19 patients  
Some patie nts with severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] –coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV-2) 
infection develop pulmonary complications and may transition to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS) and the most severe stage of illness, which manifests as an 
extra -pulmonary, sy stemic hyper -inflammation syndrome.  It is widely proposed that 
intervention with immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_674220] -inflammatory state 
could be beneficial, particularly in the later and more severe stages of COVID -19 disease 
[Mehta , 2020b; Siddiqi , 2020].  
COVID -[ADDRESS_911127] -mortem data available shows 
prominent alveolar edema, h yalinosis (intra -alveolar proteinosis) and fibrin deposition 
with pneumocytes viral cytopathic change and immune cell infiltration [McGonagle , 
2020].  Pulmonary post -mortem findings from [ADDRESS_911128] 
shown  that inflammatory infiltrate was composed by [CONTACT_674265] [Carsana , 2020].  Therefore, in later stages of severe 
disease suppressing hyper -inflammatory processes (“cytokine storm syndrome” [Mehta , 
2020b]) with an immunomodulator would be important to limit further lung damage, 
prevent respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, and multi -organ failure.  
In health, GM -CSF is not detectable in the circulati on, however, GM -CSF was detectable 
in plasma of some COVID -19 patients whether they received ICU care or not [Huang , 
2020].  In a separate study, increased num bers of GM -CSF-expressing monocytes, T -
cells, B cells and NK cells were found in the blood of COVID -19 ICU and non -ICU 
patients compared with healthy controls.  The COVID -19 ICU patient group also had 
increased numbers of CD4+ T cells co -expressing GM -CSF and IFNγ, as well as 
increased numbers of GM -CSF+ CD8+ T cells compared with non -ICU patients [Zhou , 
2020].  
COVID -[ADDRESS_911129] increased numbers of circulat ing GM -CSF+ monocytes 
compared to healthy controls.   ICU treated patients also have increased numbers of IL -6+ 
monocytes and CD14+CD16+ monocytes compared with non -ICU patients [Zhou , 2020] . 
A small study has also shown that pro -inflammatory monocyte -derived macrophages 
dominate over resident alveolar macrophages in the lungs of patients with severe 
COVID -19, whereas resident alveolar macrophages predominated in the lungs of 
mild/recovering COVID -19 patients [Liao, 2020].  The existence of these monocyte -
derived macrophages  suggests that activated monocytes infiltrate the injured lung from 
the blood, release inflammatory cytokines and may differentiate into activated 
macrophages .  It has been proposed that in severe or critical COVID -19 cases, since the 
lung barrier integrit y is interrupted, monocytes and neutrophils are chemotactic to the 
infection site to clear exudates with virus particles and infected cells, resulting in 
uncontrolled inflammation.   In this process, because of the substantial reduction and 
dysfunction of l ymphocytes, the adaptive immune response cannot be effectively 
initiated, and t he uncontrolled virus infection leads to more macrophage infiltration and a 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
27 further worsening of lung injury  [Li, 2020] .  GM-CSF is well known to drive 
monocytes/macrophages into proinflammatory phenotypes that are primed to produce 
inflammatory cytokines including IL -6, TNF and IL -1β [Hamilton , 2019; Wicks , 2016].  
The observation that GM -CSF neutralization prevented IL -6, IL -8 and MCP -1 cytokine 
release by [CONTACT_674261] a co -culture CAR T -cell assay [Sachdeva , 2019], and that GM -
CSF neutralization prevented human VEGF, IP10 and IL -1R cytokine release and 
murine IP10 and MCP -1 chemokine release in a humanized CAR T -cell xenograft mouse 
model  [Sterner , 2019], suggests a role for GM -CSF as  a driver of hyper -inflammation 
and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  
As well as GM -CSF, other markers of systemic inflammation are elevated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_520162] -19 patients [Huang , 2020].   Plasma levels of IL -1β, IL -1Rα, IL -6, IL -8, IL -9, IL -
10, IFNγ, IP -10, MIP -1β, PDGF, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU 
patients and non -ICU COVID -19 patients than in healthy controls.  Plasma levels of IL -2, 
IL-7, G-CSF, MCP -1, MIP -1α and TNFα were significantly elevated in COVID -19 
patients requiring ICU treatment compared with those not requiring ICU treatment 
[Huang , 2020].  Elevated levels of IL -[ADDRESS_911130] been 
correlated with adverse patient outcomes [Coomes , 2020] . 
These observations support the hypothesis that hyper -inflammation leads to poor 
outcome in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51379], transition to ICU/ventilator and death due to cytokine 
storm and organ damage.  In these patients there is a strong rationale that inhibiting 
hyper -inflammatory processes with targeted immunomodulatory approaches would be 
beneficial [Mehta , 2020b; McGonagle , 2020].  
Update for Part [ADDRESS_911131] reported that levels of some inflammatory mediators, including 
IL-6, are elevated in COVID -19 [Kox, 2020; Sinha , 2020], but are typi[INVESTIGATOR_674221] (ARDS) and sepsis 
[Damas , 1992] suggesting that other factors may play a major role in COVID -[ADDRESS_911132] data from the CDC show the increases in risk of death for COVID -19 patients 
were 10x, 30x, 90x, 220x, and 630x higher for patients in the 40 -49, 50 -64, 65 -74, 75 -84, 
and 85+ year age groups, respectively, than those in the 18 -29 age group [ CDC , 2020].   
In addition, it is clear that mortality increases significantly with age for COVID -19 
patients in US intensive care units (ICUs) with 17.1%, 25.5%, 36.3%, 45.1%, and 48.9% 
in the 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69, 70 -79, and 80+ year old groups dying ([COMPANY_004] analysis, data on 
file).  Similar trends have been reported in the [LOCATION_006], with 17%, 24%, 42%, 55%, and 65% 
of COVID -19 patients in the 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69, 70 -79, and 80+ year old groups dying 
within 28 days; and patients aged 70 accounted for 27% of all patients recently  admitted 
to ICUs [ICNARC , 2021].  
Emerging analyses of circulating immune cells have revealed that severe COVID -19 is 
marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment involving emergency  myelopoiesis 
with both dysfunctional/maladapted and immature monocytes and neutrophils [Mann , 
2020; Schulte -Schreppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , 2020].  Changes in COVID -[ADDRESS_911133] been 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
28 hypothesised to be a potentia l mechanism predisposing older patients to increased 
morbidity and mortality due to SARS -CoV-2 infection [Pence , 2020; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20206] , 2020].  
In addition, single -cell studies of bronchoalveolar lavage samples suggest dysregulated 
pulmonary immune responses, resulting in pro -inflammatory monocyte -derived 
macrophag es dominating over resident alveolar macrophages in the lungs of severe 
COVID -19 patients [Liao, 2020].  Moreover, post -mortem findings in fatal COVID -[ADDRESS_911134] shown the inflammatory infiltrate in lungs and other organs consists of high 
levels of neutrophils and macrophages as well as neutrophilic plugs [Carsana  2020; 
Nienhold , 2020; Schurink , 2020].  
SARS -CoV-2 infection has been shown to cause increased expression of pulmonary 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_302183] -CSF [Blanco -Melo , 2020; Chandrashekar , 2020], and persistent activation 
of GM -CSF has been proposed to contribute to injurious lung inflammatio n preclinically 
[Halstead , 2015].  Intranasal administration of an anti -GM-CSFRα or anti -GM-CSF 
monoclonal antibody inhibited cell influx and inflammation in the lungs of mice 
challenged with LPS [Alessandris , 2019; Bozinovski , 2002].  Neutralization of GM -CSF 
was shown to dose -dependently suppress neutrophilic inflammation, inhibit TNF mRNA 
expression, reduce macrophage replication and suppress matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP -
9) level s and activity [Bozinovski , 2002; Bozinovski , 2004].  MMP -9 is a protease that 
degrades extracellular matrix proteins and an early increase in circulating MMP -9 has 
been observed in COVID -19 patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] [Ueland , 2020].  
Therefore, by [CONTACT_68461] -CSF signalling, an anti -GM-CSF mAb is hypothesized to 
have beneficial effects on the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe COVID -19 
disease and poor patient outcomes in patients aged [ADDRESS_911135] been associated with disease severity and 
mortality in COVID -19 patients [Hue, 2020; Thwaites , 2020] and raised GM -CSF levels 
are already evident in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15583] 70 year old COVID -19 patients not requiring oxygen 
[Thwaites , 2020].   Secondly, changes in COVID -[ADDRESS_911136] been hypothesised to 
be a potential mechanism predisposing older patients to severe COVID -19 disease 
[Pence , 2020].   Thirdly, as the main target for GM -CSF is myeloid cells and 
dysfunctional/inflammatory/maladapted monocytes and macrophages are associated with 
severe COVID -[ADDRESS_911137] monocyte/macrophage production of multiple pro -
inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators that lead to hyperinflammation, 
tissue damage, end organ failure and drive severe CO VID-19 pathogenesis [Bonaventura , 
2020; Lang , 2020;  Mehta , 2020a].  
2.2.3.  Timing of GM -CSF inhibition in COVID patients  
GM-CSF is not produced in most healthy tissues, but local alveolar production of GM -
CSF is nece ssary for mature alveolar macrophage differentiation and lung homeostasis 
function over the long term.  Complete genetic or auto -antibody ablation of GM -CSF (or 
its receptor) eventually results in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), however this is 
likely not to be a concern in severe pulmonary COVID -19 related disease  since PAP 
takes many months/years to develop [Sakagami , 2010;  Trapnell , 2019], and has not been 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
29 observed following long -term inhibition of GM -CSF signaling with an anti -GM-CSF 
mAb  (mavrilimumab ) treatment in RA patients [Burmester , 2018].  
Increased levels of GM -CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage (B AL) fluids on Day 1  and 3  of 
diagnosis with ARDS was associated with improved survival [Matute -Bello , 2000], and a 
second study of 29 critically -ill patients within 24 hours of diagnosis with ventilator -
associated pneumonia (VAP) demonstrated that higher GM -CSF/TGFβ1 BAL ratios 
correlated with increased patient survival [Overgaard , 2015].  However, administration of 
recombinant GM -CSF by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion daily for 14 days evaluated in a 
random ized phase II trial in 130 patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS had no 
effect on ventilator -free days, mortality or organ failure [Paine , 2012].  
Intrana sal administration of an anti -GM-CSFR or anti -GM-CSF monoclonal antibody  
inhibited cell influx and inflammation in the lungs of mice challenged with LPS 
[Alessandris , 2019; Bozinovski , 2002].   Neutralization of GM -CSF was shown to dose -
dependently suppress neutrophilic inflammation, inhibit TNF mRNA expression, 
suppress matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) levels and activity, and reduce macrophage 
replication [Bozinovski , 2002; Bozinovski , 2004].  
Conversely, preclinical studies assessing influenza A infection in mice deficient in GM -
CSF or its  receptor have demonstrated a more severe viral infection in the absence of 
pulmonary GM -CSF signaling; whereas intranasal administration of GM -CSF to 
wildtype mice or GM -CSF overexpression in the airways of GM -CSF knockout mice 
reduced mortality following  influenza A infection [Halstead , 2015; Halstead , 2018; 
Huang , 2011].  However, it has been speculated that at high influenza viral titer, 
persistent activation of GM -CSF as induced by [CONTACT_674266], GM -
CSF may contribute to injurious inflammation  [Halstead , 2015].  
Thus, lo cal lung expression of GM -CSF in the early stages of COVID -19 related 
pulmonary disease in patients may help control viral titer and to maintain the epi[INVESTIGATOR_674222].  As the disease progresses to hypoxia, controlling the viral load is thought to 
be less important, whereas suppressing the systemic hyper -inflammatory process 
(“cytokine storm syndrome” [Mehta , 2020 b]) is much more important to limit further 
lung damage, prevent respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, and multi -organ failure.  Therefore, once 
hypoxia occurs in COVID -[ADDRESS_911138] 
beneficial [Mehta , 2020b]. 
To support this,  there have been several reports of anti -IL-6 mAbs having some benefit in 
small studies of patients with severe pulmonary COVID -19 related disease where 
beneficial clinical response has been inferred by [CONTACT_674267], 
oxygen requireme nts, C -reactive protein (CRP), radiological pulmonary abnormalities 
[[COMPANY_002] , 2020; Xu, 2020], or need for ventilation [Hermine , 2020].  Moreo ver, review of 
interim data from an ongoi ng large phase 3 study of sarilumab led to a recommendation  
by [CONTACT_674268] “critical” group  whose outcomes had 
improved  and discontinuing the less advanced “severe” group, without any  new safety 
findings [[COMPANY_011] , 2020].    
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL

30 By [CONTACT_68461] -CSF signaling, an anti -GM-CSF mAb such as otilimab is hypothesized 
to work “upstream” of IL -6 in the hyper -inflammatory processes triggered by [CONTACT_7544] -
CoV-2 infection and will directly inhibit proinflammatory activities of 
monocytes/macrophages  (e.g. by [CONTACT_365801] -6, TNF and IL -1 production) that 
perpetuate inflammation and cause tissue damage.   In addition,  as described previously, 
early experience in treating COVID -19 patients with severe pulmonary disease with an 
anti-GM-CSF receptor mAb (ma vrilimumab) has been well tolerated and demonstrated 
clinical benefit through fever reduction and improved oxygenation.  
Update for Part [ADDRESS_911139] outcomes .  
Therefore , targeting GM -CSF may prove more beneficial in severe COVID -19 patients 
aged 70 years .  This hypothesis is support ed by [CONTACT_674269] 1.  The second part of this study aims to confirm that 
otilimab facilitate s the recovery  of patients 70 years old with severe pulmonary COVID -
19 related disease .   
As of the dat e of approval of this protocol amendment, no targeted immunomodulatory 
therapy has been demonstrated to improve oxygen requirements, recovery from 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or reduce mortality in a patient population with severe COVID -19-

The potential risk assessment and mitigation strategy for the administration of otilimab in this protocol is outlined below.  
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of otilimab may be 
found in the  Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  The assessment of potential risk s and mitigation strategy for the adm inistration of otilimab in 
this protocol is outlined below.  
Potential Risk of Clinical Significance  Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Study Intervention(s) Otilimab  
Cytokine release syndrome  (CRS)  CRS is a syst emic inflammatory response caused by 
[CONTACT_674270], such as IL -6, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), by [CONTACT_24495] 
(B cells, T cells, and/or natural killer cells) and/or 
myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and 
monocytes).   This can lead to a constellation of 
clinical symptoms including fever, flu -like symptoms, 
hypotension, to severe inflammatory syndrome 
leading to widespread organ dysfunction, even 
death .  It is not expected that  the inhibition of GM -
CSF signaling , by [CONTACT_674271] , would 
carry the risk of directly inducing CRS . 
Pre-Clinical Data  
GM-CSF neutralization in CAR T -cell assays or in 
vivo models  inhibited  cytokine release  [Sachdeva , 
2019;  Sterner , 2019 ].  In vitro  otilimab showed 
variable results, with evidence of cytokine elevation 
at elevated levels  of otilimab (50 and 100 µg/mL) . 
Primate toxicology  studies demonstrated no 
evidence of CRS with concentrations at C max of 
2,690 µg/mL ( 54x higher  than anticipated  human 
levels ) and substantial safety margin for AUCs . Mitigation:  
Part 1:  
 To mitigate the uncertainty around safety and 
tolerability of otilimab IV, dosing will occur in an 
initial safety cohort of 20 non-mechanically  
ventilated participant s, and these participants will 
be closely mo nitored and dosed in a staggered 
manner  (see Section 4.1). 
 Unless a safety signal is identified during the 
ongoing safety review by [CONTACT_674272], enrolment of the 
main cohort of participants will be initiated.

33 Potential Risk of Clinical Significance  Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Clinical Data:  
No serious allergic or acute systemic reactions have 
been observed in comple ted clinical trials with 
otilimab . 
In Part 1 of Study 214094, a participant  developed 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] 32 days after a single 
dose of otilimab 90 mg administered intravenously 
with a fatal outcome. The participant received 
confounding concomitant  medications, including 
sertraline, lansoprazole, pi[INVESTIGATOR_674224]/tazobactam, 
cefotaxime and rovamycine . Monitoring:  
 Serio us hypersensitivity reactions are 
categorized  as AESIs.  
 Hypersensitivity to be managed appropriately per 
local guidelines/medical judgement  
 All participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674225] 
(e.g. swelling, induration, pain).  
Non-clinical Data:  
No macroscopic or microscopic changes indicative 
of local injection site reactions were observed 
following SC administration in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Clinical Data:  
Injection/infusion site reactions have been reported 
in completed Phase II studies with otilimab  and were 
non-serious and of mild to moderate intensity.  Monitoring:  
 Infusion site reactions are categorized  as AESIs  
 Monitor for infusion site reactions throughout 
study.  
Neutropenia  Grade 3 (<1.0 x 109/L) Although there is a perceived theoretical risk that 
GM-CSF blockade may affect maturation of 
leukocytes and their precursors, mice lacking GM -
CSF do not develop neutropenia or show any major 
perturbation of hematopoiesis [Stanley , 1994].  
Clinical Data:  
Neutropenia has been observed in completed 
studies of otilimab ; however, no clinically significant 
cases have been observed.  Mitigation:  
Part 1   
Exclusion of participants with ANC <1.5 x 109/L 
(neutropenia  Grade 2) (Section  5.3 Exclusion 
Criteria)  
Part 2  
Exclusion of participants with ANC <1.0 x 109/L 
(neutropenia  Grade 3) (Section  5.4 Exclusion 
Criteria)  
Monitoring:  
 Neutropenia Grade 3 (<1.0 x 109/L) is 
categorized  as an AESI.  
 Full blood count (with differential) performed  
throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .

34 Potential Risk of Clinical Significance  Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Infections  Immune -modulating biologic drugs are associated 
with an increased risk of serious and opportunistic 
infections.  Because of the role of GM -CSF in anti -
infective immunity, otilimab  also has the potential to 
increase the risk of infection .  GM-CSF has been 
noted to play a role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_674226].  Therefore, it is possible 
that otilimab, by [CONTACT_68461] -CSF, may affect the 
ability of the lu ngs to fight lung infection or properly 
recover from infection  
Non-clinical Data:  
Studies in knock -out mice showed that GM -CSF 
deficiency affe cts the ability of mice to control 
infection when infected with M. tuberculosis  or 
pulmonary group B streptococcus  [Paine , 2001; 
LeVine , 1999 ]. 
No changes in peripheral blood  populations 
(lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils 
or basophils), phagocytic activity of peripheral blood 
polymorphonuclear cells (investigational endpoint in 
the 26 week study), T -cell dependent B -cell primary 
or secondary response, or circula ting cytokine levels 
(26 week study) were observed.  
Clinical Data:  
Based on the mechanism of action of otilimab  an 
increased risk of infection including TB, fungal and 
opportunistic infections could be expected for anti -
GM-CSF treatment, because of the rol e of GM -CSF 
in anti -infective immunity.  
One healthy subject  in study MSC -1000 experienced 
septic shock secondary to pneumonia 29 days after 
receiving a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg but recovered 
after treatment with antibiotics.  
In Phase II completed studies, no significant 
infections or opportunistic infections were reported.  Eligibility Criteria  
Exclusion of participants with:  
 Untreated  systemic bacterial, fungal, viral, or 
other infection (other than SARS -CoV-2). 
 Known active tuberculosis (TB), history of 
untreated or incompletely treated active or latent 
TB, suspected or known  extrapulmonary TB  
 Known HIV regardless of immunological status  
 Known HBsAg and/or anti -HCV positive  
 Part 1: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.5 x 
109/L (neutropenia  Grade 2)  
 Part 2: ANC <1.0 x 109/L (neutropenia  Grade 
3) 
 Received monoclonal antibody therapy  (e.g. 
tocilizumab, sarilumab) within the past 3 months 
prior to randomization, including intravenous 
immunoglobulin, or planned to be received 
during the study  
 Part 1: Received immunosuppressant therapy 
including but not limited to cyclosporin, 
azathioprine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, janus 
kinase (JAK) inhibitors ( e.g. baricitinib, tofacitinib, 
upadacitinib) within the last 3 months prior to 
randomization or planned to be received during 
the study.  
 Part 2:  Received immunosuppressant therapy 
including but not limited to cyclosporin, 
azathioprine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, JAK 
inhibitors ( e.g. baricitinib, tofacitinib, 
upadacitinib) , nintedanib , disease -modifying 
antirheumatic drug s (DMARDs , e.g. 
methotrexate)  within the last 3 months prior to

 2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
Otilimab is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of RA, at weekly 
doses of 90 and 150 mg SC for up to 12 months in pi[INVESTIGATOR_674229] a long -term extension study.  
In completed studies (IV and SC), cumulatively 447 patient s and healthy volunteers (HV) 
have received otilimab (326 RA patient s, 25 multiple sclerosis (MS) patient s, 22 hand 
osteoarthritis patient s, and 74 HVs).  
Although otilimab has not been studie d before  in this  acutely ill  population, there is 
biologic rationale which supports the use of otilimab in the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_911142] as a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes myeloid cell survival and 
polarizes monocytes /macrophages into pro -inflammatory phenotypes that are primed to 
produce pro -inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL -1β and IL -6.  GM -CSF also 
extends neutrophil survival, primes the oxidative burst, enhances phagocytosis and 
promotes neutrophil adhesion  to endothelial cells and neutrophil trafficking to sites of 
inflammation.  
COVID -[ADDRESS_911143] increased circulating numbers of IL -6+ monocytes , 
CD14+CD16+ monocytes and GM -CSF+IFNγ+ helper  T cells compared with non-ICU 
COVID -[ADDRESS_911144] that elevated  levels of GM -CSF in the 
lung could be more beneficial  in the early stages of disease and may play a role in disease 
resolution by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_674230], restore  or maintain  the lung barrier  function , and 
return to tissue homeostasis .  As the disease progresses, suppressing the systemic hyper -
inflammatory processes would be a priority and where otilimab could be beneficial.  
Therefore, a single dose of otilimab in patients with pneumonia and oxygenation 
impairment, would be expected to inhibit inflammation and still allow sufficient GM-
CSF leve ls in the lung during the recovery phase.  
Update for Part 2  
Otilimab has been tested in patients with severe pulmonary COVID -19 related disease in 
Part 1 of this study, with substantial clinical benefit  in the pre -defined stratification group 
of participan ts 70 to <80 years old, with no safety concerns  identified (including all 
AESIs ) in either the overall study population or the pre-defined stratification group of 
participants 70 to <80 years old . 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit:  Risk Conclusion  
The overall benefit -risk assessment takes into account the potential benefit of otilimab 
treatment through GM -CSF blockade and mitigation of the hyper -inflammatory response . 
This hyper -inflammatory response  associated with severe SARS -CoV-2 infection can 
result  in severe or fatal pulmonary disease  and multi -organ failure.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL

 With the planned safety monitoring measures  around the expected low risk of CRS and 
overall favorable  safety profile to date , the overall benefit -risk assessment for the patient 
population proposed for this study is considered positive.  
Part 2  
With the planned safety monitoring measures around the expected very low risk of CRS 
and overall favorable safety profile to date, the overall benefit -risk assessment for the 
patient population included in Part 1 and proposed  for Part 2 of this study is considered 
positive.

  The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and 
record maint enance ( i.e. receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
 Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study 
intervention are provided in the SRM.  
 Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study interventio n is not 
expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff.  Take adequate precautions 
to avoid direct eye or skin contact [CONTACT_23968].  In the 
case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monito r 
and/or [COMPANY_004] study contact.  
 A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing 
occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be 
provided to the investigator, where this is required by [CONTACT_1207], or is available 
upon request from [COMPANY_004].  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
All participants will be centrally randomized  using IRT.  Before the study is initiated, the 
log in information and directions for the IRT will be provided to each site.  Study 
intervention will be administered  at the time-point detailed  in the SoA (Section 1.[ADDRESS_911162] not be re -dispensed.  
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, 
the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 
intervention assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination.  If a participant’s intervention assignment 
is unblinded [COMPANY_004] mu st be notified within [ADDRESS_911163] be recorded in the source documentation and case 
report form, as applicable.  
Participants will be randomized  in a ratio of 1:1 to receive study int ervention (Section 
1.2, Section 4.1 and Se ction 6.1).  Investigators will remain blinded to each participant’s 
assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study.  To maintain this blind, all 
participants will receive a single  IV infusion .  An unblinded pharmacist (or unblinded 
designee) will be r esponsible for the dispensation of the study intervention and will 
endeavor  to ensure that there are no differences in time taken to dispense between the 
different intervention arms.  The IV bag should be prepared away from view of the 
blinded site staff a nd the participant.  Every IV  infusion  must be labelled to maintain the 
blind (refer to SRM).  
Unblinded monitors and in the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be 
allowed access to unblinded study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that 
randomization /dispensing has been done accurately.  
A participant may continue in the study if that participant’s intervention assignment is 
unblinded.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 53 
 [COMPANY_004]’s Pharma Safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant 
with an  SAE.  If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or 
more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention 
assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or  [COMPANY_004] 
policy.  
6.4. Study Intervention  Compliance  
Participants  will receive study intervention  directly from the investigator or designee, 
under medical supervision.  The date and time of the dose administered will be recorded 
in the source documents.  The dose of study intervention  and study participant  
identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff 
other than the person administering the study intervention . 
6.5. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any dose of otilimab greater than the 90 mg dose indicated  in this study or 
used more frequently than permitted (otilimab 90 mg single IV infusion) will be 
considered an overdose.  
No specific treatment is reco mmended for an overdose of otilimab , and the investigator 
should treat as clinically indicated.  
In the event of a potential overdose, the investigator should:  
 Contact [CONTACT_27465].  
 Closely monitor the participant for adverse event  (AE)/serious adverse event 
(SAE) and laboratory abnormalities.  
 Contact [CONTACT_674275].  
6.6. Concomitant Therapy  
At Screening , information will be collected on any medications the participant has taken 
in the 14 days before screening .  In Part 2, current COVID -19 vaccination status will also 
be recorded.  
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is rece iving at the time of 
enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded along with:  
 reason for use  
 dates of administration including start and end dates  
 dosage information including dose and frequency  
The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_61519].  
TMF-[ADDRESS_911164] of cytokines on the CYP450 enzymes (Section 2.3) 
initiation or discontinuation of study intervention may have a clinically relevant effect for 
CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index e.g. warfarin and theophylline  should be 
monitored . 
Part 1  only - Investigators should exercise caution when study intervention is co -
administered with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is 
undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. 
Aside from  those medications specified in Exclusion Criteria (Section  5.3 and Section 
5.4) or Section 6.6.1 , all regular medications that are required by [CONTACT_674276].  All concomitant medications (and treatments , such as  convalescent plasma)  
should be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.6.1.  Medica tion NOT Permitted During the Study  
The following medications cannot be planned  to be administered during the study (see 
the note in Section 6.6.2 , which provides guidance on the use of treatments for COVID -
19 that might benefit the patient  or be considered lifesaving ): 
 Any monoclonal antibody therapy ( e.g. tocilizumab, sarilumab) , including 
intravenous immunoglobulin  
 Immunosuppressant therapy including but not limited to cyclosporin, 
azathioprine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors ( e.g. baricitinib, 
tofacitinib, upadacitinib) , ninted anib, DMARDs ( e.g. methotrexate ). 
 Chronic oral corticosteroids (for a non -COVID -19 related condition ) in a dose 
higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day , are not permitted . 
6.6.2.  Medication /Treatment  PERMITTED During the Study  
The following medications are permitted during the study:  
 The pa rticipan t’s regular medication.  
 Treatment  required for standard of care  (e.g. analgesia, antipyretic, sedation) . 
 Medications/t reatments required  for ICU care. 
 Additional  medications/ treatment s of COVID -19 related disease  (e.g. remdesivir , 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] , convalescent plasma , tocil izumab, sarilumab ) are permitted only if 
according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institutional policies , and not part of a clinical trial  if it 
is felt that the participant might benefit or it might be considered life -saving .  Any 
concerns  regarding  the acceptability of  potential treatments should be discussed 
with the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor(s).  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL

 6.7. Participant Discontinuation /Withdrawal  from the Study  
 A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request , at 
the request of their legally authorized representative ( LAR ) or may be withdrawn 
at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, or 
compliance reasons.   This is expected to be uncommon.  
 At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, a Withdrawal  visit (same 
as Discharge  visit) should be conducted  (for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674238]) or a  
Withdrawal phone call  (same as Follow -up phone call)  should be conducted  (for 
non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674238]) , as shown in the SoA.  
 If the participant withdraws consent  or the LAR requests that the participant is 
withdrawn  for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
 If a participant withdraws from the study  or the LAR requests that the participant 
is withdrawn , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, 
and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
6.8. Lost to Follow Up  
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she is unable to be contact[CONTACT_674277][INVESTIGATOR_307] .  Every effort must be made to reduce missing 
data.   
 The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_674278]/or should continue in the 
study.  
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 
telephone calls  and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods ).  These contact [CONTACT_674279] d in the participant’s medical record.  
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is described in Section  9.1.[ADDRESS_911165] care, 
data will be collected for the Ordinal Scale and the Clinical Features of COVID -19, and 
blood samples will be collected for PK and PD analysis (collected as detailed in the  SoA, 
Section 1.3 and Section  1.4).

  Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  (Section  1.3 and 
Section 1.4). 
 As detailed in the SoA (Section  1.3 and Section 1.4), follow -up phone calls must 
be made within ±[ADDRESS_911166]  be 
made to complete the phone call on the scheduled day .  This is particularly 
important if the Day 28 time -point  is a phone call, because this is the study 
primary endpoint . 
 Every effort must be ma de to reduce missing data throughout the study.  
 Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed . 
 Urgent  study -related safety concerns should be discussed with the [COMPANY_004]  medical 
monitor  immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant 
should continue or in exceptional circumstances withdraw from the study.  
 Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(Section 1.3 and Section  1.4), is essential and required for study conduct.  
 All screening evaluat ions must be completed and reviewed to confirm that 
potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm 
eligibility or record reasons for screen ing failure, as applicable.  
 Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management 
(e.g., blood count) and taken  before obtaining consent  may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified 
criteria and was performed  within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
 The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration 
of the study for the purpose of meeting the objectives will not exceed [ADDRESS_911167] of care assessments.  
 Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical 
issues with the samples.  
7.1. Entry /Screening Assessments  
7.1.1.  Demography & Medical History  
The following demographic parameters will be captured: year o f birth , gender  and 
ethnicity /race .  If it is not possible to collect at Screening , demography  can be collected at 
any point during the study.  
We are collecting details of race and ethnicity in this study since there have been reports 
from several counties  that ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected 
by [CONTACT_674280] -19 related disease.   In line with ICH E5 
principles, this information is therefore paramount to the assessment of the ethnic 
sensitivity of otil imab in this patient population.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094

 To the extent practical given the participant’s condition, a full medical history , including 
cardiovascular risk,  will be taken during Screening or as information becomes available  
at any point during the study .  This shoul d record concurrent medical conditions and 
concomitant medications.  
Medical history will include a detailed list of signs and symptoms of COVID -19 recorded 
at admission (see Section 7.2.1 ) 
Part [ADDRESS_911168] X-ray or computerized tomography ( CT) scan must be available  at Screening to 
confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia and eligibility.   If another chest X-ray or CT scan is 
done after Screening  and before Discharge, this status should be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.2. Efficacy Assessments  
General Note : Research staff are asked to liaise with clinical staff managing the 
participant  to ensure that all study relevant data is collected efficiently and accurately and 
that study related assessments are not performed soon after or before those required for 
participant  clinical management.  Hence, all study mandated physical examination 
assessments, measurements of vital signs and obtaining blood for laboratory tests / point 
of care tests should be performed in coordination with the clinical staff looking after  the 
participant . 
7.2.1.  Clinical features of COVID -[ADDRESS_911169] of signs and symptoms of COVID -19 will 
be recorded at the timepo ints defined in the S oA (Section 1.3 and Section 1.4; list of 
signs and symptoms  outlined in the eCRF).  
7.2.2.  SpO 2 (for participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation ) 
SpO 2 should be measured at the timepoints defined in the SoA  (Section  1.3 and Section 
1.4).  Where possible , SpO 2 should be measured “at rest” i.e. not having  undergone a 
procedure for at least 5 minutes .  When a participant is mechanically ventilated, no SpO 2 
value is expected  in the eCRF . 
Part 2:   SpO 2 should be measured once daily in the morning (up to discharge) at 
approximately the same time as the Ordinal Scale categorisation.

TMF-[ADDRESS_911170] be recorded in the 
eCRF.  There are 2 categories of location (each with sub -categories):  
1. Non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674239] / facility  
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674239] / facility  
A detailed description is provided in the  SRM for the sub-categories for 1 and 2 above . 
In order to relate the above discharge information to the participant’s residence status 
before  contracting COVID -19, information must be collected at Screening about the 
participant’s residence before  initial  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674240] -19 (refer to the SRM 
for more information).  
7.2.8.  Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores  
The SOFA score is a tool for grading organ dysfunction in critically ill participant s - 
usually those who are in ICU and intubated and mechanically ventilated .  Scores range 
from 0 to 4 for each component and represent the extent of dysfunction or failure 
[Vincent , 1996]. 
The SOFA scor e is made up of the following components:  
 The Respi[INVESTIGATOR_674241] 2/FiO 2 (mmHg) and will require an arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement.   If 
an ABG  is not available , it is acceptable to estimate PaO 2/FiO 2 (mmHg) from 
SpO2/FiO 2. 
 The Nervous System component of the SOFA score will be determined using the 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).  If possible, GCS is assessed  during a sedation 
holiday.  If a participant is intubated and ventilated (and there is no seda tion 
holiday in the previous 24 hours), the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) assessment 
can be omitted, and a score of +4 used . 
 The Cardiovascular System component of the SOFA score can be determined by  
[CONTACT_674281] (MAP) measurement  or administration of  vasopressors . 
 The Liver, Renal, and Coagulation components of the SOFA score will be  
determined by [CONTACT_674282], serum creatinine, and platelet count  
respectively.  The highest score of the last 24 -hour period for each measurement  
should  be used.  
Part 1 :  SOFA scores will be determined at the time points stipulated in SoA  (Section 
1.3). 
Part 2 :  SOFA score will be used only for eli gibility assessment in patients who are 
intubated and mechanically ventilated  (Section  1.4).

 7.3. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA  (Section  1.3 and 
Section 1.4) – where possible, these should be aligned with standard of care . 
7.3.1.  Physical Examinations  
 A full physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
Cardiovascular, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems .  Results 
will not be recorded in the eCRF . 
7.3.2.  Vital Signs  
 Temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure  will be assessed.   Single 
measurements will be used at all timepoints  as detailed in the S oA. 
 The location  used to measure temperature will be as per standard of care but must 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
 At Screening only, body weight should either be measured, established from the 
medical records e.g. last 3 months , or reported/estimated at the bedside.    
 Part 2 only: at Screening only, height should be measured , established from the 
medical records , or reported by [CONTACT_674283].  
7.3.3.  Electrocardiograms  
 Single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section  1.3 and 
Section 1.4). 
 Each ECG report must be reviewed by [CONTACT_419583] ( PI) or his 
qualified designee .  Each ECG must be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her 
qualified designee reviewing the report.  
7.3.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
 See Appendix [ADDRESS_911171] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency.  
 The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and 
record any cli nically significant changes occurring during the study as an  AE.  
The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
 Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease  are not 
considered clinically significant , unless judged b y the investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the participant's condition.  
 All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal 
(during participation in the study until the follow up visit ) should be repeated until 
the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly 
abnormal by [CONTACT_10982].  If clinically significant  values 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 61 
 do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged r easonable by [CONTACT_1275], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified.  
 If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory tests are performed 
and require a change in participant management or are considered clinically 
significa nt by [CONTACT_093] ( e.g. SAE), then the results must be recorded.  
7.3.5.  Pregnancy Testing  (Part 1 only)  
 Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by [CONTACT_427]) should be 
conducted at Screening to confirm eligibility as per  Section  5.1. 
 Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by [CONTACT_427]) should be 
conducted at Discharge .  If the participant has been discharged before  Day 60, the 
Day 60 phone call will include  a verbal confirmation about pregnancy status.  
 Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined 
necessary by [CONTACT_31837], to establish the 
absence of pregnancy at any time during the participant ’s time in the study.  
7.4. Adverse Events  (AEs),  Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) and 
Other Safety Reporting  
The definitions of AE s or SAE s can be found in Section  9.3. 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, 
and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up all AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention  or the 
study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study . 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section  9.3. 
7.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE 
Information  
 All AEs and  SAEs will be collected from the start of intervention  until the follow -up 
visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section  1.3 and Section  1.4).  However, 
any SAEs assessed as related to study participation ( e.g., study intervention , protocol -
mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a 
[COMPANY_004] product will be recorded  from the time a participant  consents to participate in 
the study . 
 Medical occurrences that begin before  the sta rt of study intervention  but after 
obtaining informed consent will be recorded as Medical History/Current Medical 
Conditions not as AEs. 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 62 
  All SAE s will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exc eed 24 hours , as indicated in Appendix 3 .  The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours  of it 
being available.  
 Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs  after the 
conclusion of the study particip ation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention  or 
study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  
7.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE.   Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  
7.4.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of special 
interest (as defined in Section 7.4.7 ), will be followed until the event is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise  explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in 
Section 6.8).  Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 
7.4.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
 Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a n SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention  under clinical investigatio n are met.  
 The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention  under clinical 
investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory r equirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators.  
 An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific s afety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure  and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
7.4.5.  Pregnancy  (Part 1 only)  
 Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study intervention  and until follow -up visit  (Day  60). 
 If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it  to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy  
in a female  participant.   While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 63 
 any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical 
reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
 Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAE s and will be reported 
as such . 
 The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  and the neonate , and 
the information will be forwarded to the sponsor.  
 Any post -study pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by [CONTACT_674284]  
7.4.4 .  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.  
7.4.6.  Cardiovascular and Death Events  
For any cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 3  and all deaths, whether or not they 
are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sec tions of the eCRF will 
be required to be completed.   These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular 
(including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death.  
The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA 
terms.   The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of 
the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion.  
The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is 
reported.  Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within  one 
week of when the death is reported.  
7.4.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The potential risks of otilimab are discussed in Section 2.3. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) include:  
 Cytokine release s yndrome (CRS)  (not related to COVID -19 [see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ]) 
 Serious hypersensitivity reactions  
 Infusion site reactions  
 Neutropenia  Grade 3  (<1.0 x 10 9/L) 
 Serious infections  
 
AESIs should be reported as AEs or SAEs , as appropriat e.  Please refer to Section 9.3 
(Appendix 3 ) and the SRM.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Cytokine R elease Syndrome  
Cytokine -associated toxicity, also known as cytokine rele ase syndrome ( CRS), is a non –
antigen -specific toxicity that occurs as a result of strong immune activation.  The 
magnitude of immune activation typi[INVESTIGATOR_674242].  As immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_674243], CRS is becoming 
increasingly recognized.  
Symptomatology associated with CRS and the severity of symptoms varies greatly  but 
may be quite mild , and management can be c omplicated by [CONTACT_161047] -current conditions in 
these participants.   This may be particularly the case in patients with severe pulmonary 
COVID -19 related disease . 
Potentially life -threatening severe complications of CRS include cardiac dysfunction, 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Of particular concern is cardiac dysfunction, 
which can be rapid onset and severe, but is typi[INVESTIGATOR_369271].  
In the event of C RS, investigators should follow institutional guidelines for symptom 
management.  Additional guidance can be found in the published literature [Lee, 2014].  
 
For this study , CRS (possibly related to study drug, rather than progression of  
hyperinflammation in COVID -19 disease ) is defined as a worsening of the CRS Grading 
System ( below ) within 6 hours  after start of study drug infusion.  
 
In the event that CRS  is suspected  (defined as a worsening of the  CRS Grading System 
within 6 hours of drug administration) and is thought to be caused by [CONTACT_674285] , additional blood  samples should be taken  (see Section  1.3 and Section 1.4, 
and Section 9.2).  These blood samples should be taken as soon as possible after 
suspected CRS onset and then again 24 hours later .  The following blood samples should 
be taken:  
 PD (cytokine) sample  
 Hematology  
 CRP  
 D-dimer  
 Ferritin  
In the event that new onset of CRS is suspected, the medical monitor must be notified 
immediately and under no circumstance can this exceed [ADDRESS_911172] 
also be reported within 24 hours as an AE or an SAE.  The investigator will submit any 
updated  data related to the  CRS event  (including completion of any AE or SAE CRF 
forms)  to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  Additional CRF forms related 
to the CRS event should then be completed as soon as pos sible.

 7.7. Pharmacodynamics  
 Blood samples will be collected to help understand the disease , otilimab target 
levels  and response to otilimab in COVID -19 related  disease , as specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3 and Section 1.4). 
 Biomarkers may include , but are not limited to : inflammatory cytokines, such as 
IL-6; growth factors, such as GM -CSF; and other molecules  that are indicative of 
hyper -inflammation.  
 The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each blood sample collection 
will be recorded.  
 Collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_674244].  
 Part 2  - If central laboratory kits are not available at a site (for operational 
reasons), participants can be randomised and dosed, and the P D samples not 
collected.  In this situation, the missing samples would not be a protocol 
deviation.  This is justifiable, because P D sampling is an exploratory endpoint.  
[COMPANY_004] may store samples for up to 15 years after the end of the study to achieve study 
objectives.  Additionally, with participants ’ consent, samples may be used for further 
research by [CONTACT_674286] -CoV-2 infection, associated COVID -19 disease or other 
diseases , the development of related or new treatments or research methods.  
7.8. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Antibodies to otilimab will not be assessed as part of this study , since this is a single dose 
study .

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of otilimab [ADDRESS_911173] the null hypothesis that the difference between 
otilimab 90 mg and placebo on the proportion of participants alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_674245] 28  is less than or equal to zero versus the alternative hypothesis that 
otilimab 90 mg increases the proportion of participants  alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_674246] 28 .

 8.2. Sample Size Determination  
Otilimab and placebo will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio.  
Part 1  
The study will utilize a group sequential design, using a Lan -DeMets alpha-spending 
function to control the type I error  with four interim analyses for futility , two early in the 
study  where futility alone will be assessed,  using Pocock analogue rules ; and two for 
efficacy , at later times in the study and at the same time as futility,  using the O’Brien -
Fleming analogue rules  [Lan, 1983].  A sample size of 800 participants will provide 
approximately 90% power to detect a  difference of 12% in the proportion of participants 
alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_347483] a one -sided 2.5% significance level and an assumed 
placebo response rate of 45%.  The minimal detectable effect for this design is 7%.  
Full details of the decision criteria and interim analysis plan will be given in the IDMC 
charter and analysis plan.  
The assumed p lacebo  response  is based on data from recent publications of studies of  
patients with  severe pulmonary COVID -19 related disease [[COMPANY_011] , 2020]. 
Part 2  
A sample size of 346 participants will provide approximately 80% power to detect a 
difference of 15% in the proportion of participants alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_347483] 
a one -sided 2.5% significance level and an assumed placebo response rate of 45%.  The 
minimal detectable effect for this design is 10.6%. 
8.3. Analysis Sets  
Part 1  and Part 2  
The primary population will be the modified intent  to treat ( MITT) population, defined as 
all participant s who were randomized and received study drug.  This population will be 
used for all data summaries and analyses .  Any participant who receives study 
intervention will be considered evaluable.  
Further details of analy sis sets wi ll be provided in the Analysis Plan . 
8.4. Statistical Analyses  
Full details of all analyses will be described in the Analysis Plan.   Each part of the study 
will be analysed separately , and separate analysis plans will be produced.    
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses for the  primary endpoint .

 8.4.1.  General Considerations  
Part 1  
In the case of a difference between the stratification assigned at the time of randomization 
and the data collected in the eCRF, the analy ses will be performed based on the 
calculated stratum at randomization .  All analyses will be adjusted for ordinal scale 
category at baseline (category 5 or 6) and age group (treated as categorical variable  
defined by [CONTACT_674287] <60 years, 60 to <70 years, 70 to <80 years) .  Confidence intervals 
will use the 95% levels unless otherwise specified.  
Part 2  
In the case of a difference between the stratification assigned at the time of randomization 
and the data collected in the eCRF, the analyses will be performed based on the 
calculated stratum at randomization.  All analyses will be adjusted for ordinal scale 
category at baseline (category 5 or 6) and gender ( male or female ).  Confidence intervals 
will use the 95% levels unless otherwise specified.  
8.4.2.  Primary  Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint is whether or not a participant is alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_674245] [ADDRESS_911174] 
participant has completed the study.  Participants are considered alive and free of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_674247] 1, 2, 3  or 4 from the GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) 
modified version ordinal scale adapted from World Health Organization (WHO ) scale 
2020 (Section 7.2.6 . Table 2 - Ordinal Scale).  
Part [ADDRESS_911175] to follow up data after 
discharge  and this along with intermittent data  will be imputed using multiple imputation 
under the missing at random assumption .  Every effort will be made to reduce missing 
data.   Supplemental estimand strategies and missing data sensitivities may be performed 
and further details will be provided in the analysis plan.  
The primary endpoint will be summari zed using counts and proporti ons of the number of 
participants alive and  free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_674248] a logistic 
regression model , adjusting for ordinal scale category at baseline and age group.  The 
outcome of the model is an odds ratio , and a confidence interval for the odds of 
improvement in proportion of participants alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_226284] 28.   
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 69 
 In addition , the corresponding difference in proportion and confidence interval will be 
calculated  from the model  [Ge, 2011]. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint at the in -stream interim analyses in Part 1 will be 
the same as that described for the primary endpoint above.  
8.4.3.  Secondary E ndpoint(s ) 
Full details of all analysis methods for the secondary endpoints will be provided in the 
analysis plan.

  214094  
 72 financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year a fter completion of the study.  
9.1.3.  Informed Consent Process  
Given that this trial is being conducted in participants with COVID -19, and given that 
some of the participants will be mechanically ventilated upon enrolment, alternative 
procedures to obtain informed  consent will be used.  Participants may be consented in 
three ways, as described below.  The EMA Guidance on the Management of Clinical 
Trials during the COVID -19 (Coronavirus) pandemic  (Version 2, 27 -Mar-20) [EMA , 
2020] and the FDA  Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
the COVID -19 Pandemic  (updated 16 -Apr-20) [FDA , 2020] have been considered.  
 
1.  Participant is enrolled by [CONTACT_79844].  
If the participant is capable of understanding and signing the informed consent (paper or 
eConsent), the below points will apply:  
 The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to 
the participant and answer all questions regarding the study.  
 The medical record must include a statement that written (or electronic) informed 
consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date 
the written consent was obtained .  The authorized person obtaining informed 
consent must also sign the informed consent form ( ICF).  If paper consent is used, 
and there is an in fection risk to the person obtaining consent, the trial participant 
and the person obtaining consent may sign and date separate ICFs.  All relevant 
records should be archived in the Investigator Site File.  A correctly signed and 
dated ICF should be obtain ed from the trial participant as soon as possible.  
 Consent may be collected before the 48h screening window if the investigator 
considers that the participant is likely to become eligible, and wants to ensure that 
consent is given by [CONTACT_674288] a  legally authorized representative 
(LAR).  
 
2. Participant is enrolled by [CONTACT_674289].  
If the participant is capable of understanding, but not able to provide written consent 
(paper or eConsent), informed consent can be obtained orally, the bel ow points will 
apply:  
 The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to 
the participant and answer all questions regarding the study.  
 Oral consent must be given in the presence of an impartial witness.  In such cases, 
the w itness is required to sign and date the ICF (paper or electronic)  and the 
investigator is expected to record how the impartial witness was selected.   All 
relevant records should be archived in the Investigator Site File.  A correctly 
signed and dated ICF should be obtained from the trial participant as soon as 
possible.  
 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 73 3. Participant is enrolled by [CONTACT_5657]/her legally authorized representative ( LAR)  (written 
or oral).  
If the participant is unable to provide informed consent, the investigator or delegate can  
obtain consent from a n LAR.  If consent is obtained from a n LAR, the following points 
will apply:  
 The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to 
the LAR and answer all questions regarding the study.  
 Best efforts will be  undertaken to obtain written consent (paper, email or 
eConsent) from a n LAR.  However, if the LAR is not able to provide written or 
electronic consent for logistical reasons, informed consent can be obtained orally  
from the LAR .  As above for oral partici pant consent, oral LAR consent must be 
given to the investigator in the presence of an impartial witness.  In such cases, 
the witness is required to sign and date the ICF and the investigator is expected to 
record how the impartial witness was selected.  A  correctly signed and dated ICF 
should be obtained from the LAR as soon as possible.  
 The investigator has responsibility for applying local laws in the matter of who 
has the capacity to consent and who qualifies as a n LAR of a potential participant.  
 An LAR is defined as an individual or juridical or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective participant , to the 
participant’s participation in the clinical trial.  
 An LAR can be a member of the participant’s family, ne xt-of-kin or trusted 
person previously designated by [CONTACT_2299].  
 As soon as is practically possible following a participant regaining capacity, 
participants will be asked to provide informed consent to remain in the study.  If 
they decline, then they will be withdrawn from the study.  The participant  will 
decide if they want to allow samples already collected to be used or request for 
them to be discarded if not yet analyzed . 
 All relevant records should be archived in the Investigator Site File.  
Docume ntation of Informed consent process  
 
The management of the informed consent process will be documented in the medical 
source notes.  This will include which process was used to obtain consent.  The following 
should be noted in regard to the informed consen t process:  
 
 If consent is provided orally by [CONTACT_674290], the witness name, time and date of witnessing must be recorded 
in medical source notes.  The investigator must also document how the impartial 
witness was selected.  
 If consent is provided by [CONTACT_182977], name, time and date of LAR and name [CONTACT_674304].  
 Participants/LAR must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  
Participants and/or LAR will be required to sign electronically or on paper (or 
agree orally) to a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 
CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094

and other information to carry out this study; understand the results of this study; learn 
more about otilimab  or about the study disease; publish the results of these re search 
efforts; work with government agencies or insurers to have otilimab  approved for medical 
use or approved for payment coverage.  
The ICF contains a separate section that addresses the use of participant data and 
remaining samples for optional further research.  The investigator or authorized  designee 
will inform each partic ipant or their LAR of the possibility of further research not related 
to the study/disease.  Participants or their LAR  will be told that they are free to refuse to 
participate and ma y withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the 
storage period.  A separate signature  (participant or LAR) will be required to document 
agreement to allow any participant data and/or remaining leftover samples to be used for 
further rese arch not related to the study/disease.  Participants or their LAR who decline 
further research will tick the corresponding “No” box . 
9.1.4.  Data Protection

 81 9.3. Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs : Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
9.3.1.  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.  
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated 
with the use of a study intervention.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including 
those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or interm ittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention - intervention 
interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported a s an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  
Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
 "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, 
the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported 
as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_674291] t’s condition.  
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 82  Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or cond ition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
9.3.2.  Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any serious adverse event  that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment 
that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244].  If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674249], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, v omiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental 
trauma ( e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but 
do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Other situations:  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_458665].  These events should usually be considered 
serious.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 83 o Examples of such events include inva sive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , convulsions, acute deterioration of liver 
function, or development of intervention dependency or intervention abuse.  
 
9.3.3.  Definition of Cardiovascular Events  
Cardiovas cular Events (CV) Definition:  
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following 
AEs and SAEs:  
 Myocardial infarction/unstable angina  
 Congestive heart failure  
 Arrhythmias  
 Valvulopathy  
 Pulmonary hypertension  
 Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack  
 Peripheral arterial thromboembolism  
 Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism  
 Revascularization  
 
9.3.4.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.  
 It is not acceptable for the investi gator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004]  required form . 
 There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_333204].  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will 
be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_333205].  
 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 84  Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
 Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
 Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with an SAE.  Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of 
an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
 An event is  defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
 A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
 The investigator will u se clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered an d investigated.  
 The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, 
for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred,  and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004].  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make  an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] . 
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality asses sment.  
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_674292]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may incl ude additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
 If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a copy of any post -mortem findings including 
histopathology.  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 85  New or updated information will be recorded in the originally submitted documents . 
 The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of receipt of 
the info rmation.  
 
9.3.5.  Reporting of SAE to [COMPANY_004]  
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004]  via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data collection tool.  
 If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
 The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
 The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF 
(e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each 
SAE to investigational product /study participation (causality) within 72 hours of SAE entry into 
the eCRF.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on 
a previously reported SAE aft er the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, 
then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the SAE 
coordinator by [CONTACT_756].  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Study Reference Manual . 
 
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Paper Data Collection Tool  
 Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the SAE coordinator.  
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by [CONTACT_20021] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_13187].  
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE data collection tool within the designated reporting time frames.  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Study Reference Manual .

 86 9.4. Appendix  4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance  (Part 1 
only)  
9.4.1.  Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of menarche until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile (see below)  
Notes : 
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical  cause.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they 
wish to continue their HRT during the study.  
 Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, ( e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), 
investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
 
 Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 If fertility is unclear ( e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual 
cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation 
should be considered.  
9.4.2.  Contraception Guidance:  
 CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE:  
 Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per 
year when used consistently and correctly.  
 Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationc 
 Intrauterine  device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c 
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Azoo spermic partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)  
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 87  Azoospermia is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole 
sexual partner  of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed.  If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.  
  
Note: documentation of azoospermia for a male participant can come from the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview  
 Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent  Failure rate of <1% per year when 
used consistently and co rrectly.  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationc 
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
o injectable  
 Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
o oral 
o injectable  
 Sexual abstinence  
 Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention  
and  is the participant’s  normal pra ctice .  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
participant.  
a. Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_31860].  
b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_31786].  
c.  Male condoms must be used in addition to hormonal contraception.  If locally required, in 
accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mod e of 
action.  
 
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  Male condom and female cond om should not be used 
together (due to risk of failure from friction) .

If minor changes are made to the Country Specific Requirements for Japan ( e.g. the 
Study Period dates are amended), the global protocol will not be updated , and the 
changes will be reco rded in the local document only.  Therefore, all investigators in Japan 
should refer to the locally provided Country Specific Requirements Document for Japan.  
The following country specific requirements apply for Japan:  
1. Study Conduct Considerations  
1.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with “the Ministerial Ordinance on the 
Standards for the Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medicinal Products (MHW Notification 
No.28 dated 27th March, 1997)” and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act.  
The statement “I acknowledge that I am responsible for overall the study conduct.” on th e 
Investigator Protocol Agreement Page means the investigator’s responsibility defined by 
[CONTACT_330549].  
[COMPANY_004] will submit the CTN  to the regulatory authorities in accordance with 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act before conclusion of any contract for t he 
conduct of the study with study sites.  
1.2 Informed Consent  
Prior to participation in the study, the investigator should fully inform the potential 
participant and/or the participant's legally acceptable representative of the study including 
the written  information. The investigator should provide the participant and/or the 
participant's legally acceptable representative ample time and opportunity to inquire 
about details of the study. The participant and/or the participant’s legally acceptable 
represent ative should sign and personally date the consent form. If the participant is 
capable of understanding but not able to provide written consent, or if the legally 
authorized representative is not able to provide written consent , informed consent can be 
obtained orally in the presence of an impartial witness  (Protocol Section 9.1.3). The 
person, who conducted the informed consent discussion and the study collaborator giving 
supplementary explanation, where applicable, should sign and personally date the conse nt 
form. If an impartial witness is required, the witness should sign and personally date the 
consent form. The investigator should retain this signed and dated form (and other written 
information) together with the source medical records, such as clinical  charts (in 
accordance with the rules for records retention, if any, at each medical institution) and 
give a copy to the participant and/or the participant’s legally acceptable representative. If 
the participant is a minor, document informed consent will b e obtained from both the 
participant and his/her legally acceptable representative. In addition, if a minor 
participant reaches an adult during the treatment period, the participant's consent to 
participate in the clinical trial will be obtained again.  
Regarding  informed consent process of this study, the following is added according to 
GCP  7.3. 
TMF-11795607  CONFIDENTIAL   
  214094  
 97  The study population consists of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674254] (48 hours before dosing). The consent by [CONTACT_674297], but the study population includes participants who may 
have difficulty in giving their own consent under Article 50, Paragraphs [ADDRESS_911189] lives of patients in a life -
threatening condition.  
 There is no approved drug specifically targeting severe pulmonary COVID -19 
relate d disease in Japan as of 3 June 2020, although remdesivir has been approved in 
Japan for SARS -CoV-2 infection. Currently it is unknown if available treatments are 
likely to achieve sufficient therapeutic effects on severe pulmonary COVID -19 
related disease  in the prospective participants.  
 Otilimab  is expected to inhibit inflammation due to SARS -CoV-2 infection. There is 
a sufficient possibility of preventing further aggravation and saving the life of the 
prospective participants by [CONTACT_674298] -19 relat ed 
pulmonary disease (protocol S ection 2).  
 An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has been established for this 
study, and interim analyses will be used to assess safety, f utility and efficacy 
(protocol S ection 9.1.5).   
 If the participant is unable to provide informed consent and consent is obtained from 
his/her legally authorized representative (LAR), participants will be asked to provide 
informed consent to remain in the study as soon as practically possible following  the 
participant regaining capacity.  If they decline, then they will be withdrawn from the 
study.  Unidentified persons are excluded from the study because of the consent 
process in that consent is obtained from a his/her LAR before the study start if the 
participant is unable to provide informed consent (protocol S ection 9.2.3).

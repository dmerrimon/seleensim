The purpose of this study  is to determine  the feasibility and acceptability of: (1) a tailored  music-assisted  
relaxation and imagery  intervention; (2) biological sample collection; and (3) mobile device patient-
reported outcome (MDPRO)  collection  among adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588017].  
Background
Patients undergoing pancreatic surgery often experience high  pain,  stress, and anxiety that can 
contribute to poorer recovery and increased risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. Interventions that reduce 
postsurgical anxiety, stress,  and pain  that are also accessible to a diverse population and individualized  
to each patient  are needed to address  this complex problem.
Music therapy  has not been investigated specifically in patients undergoing pancreatic  surgery. 
However, several music medicine and music  therapy studies in similar populations  support  the efficacy  
of music  interventions for addressing  pain  and symptom management  in this population.  A 2015  
systematic review and meta-analysis  of 72 music  medicine  randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) initiated 
before, during, or after  surgery found  that music interventions reduced postoperative pain  (45 RCTs, 
SMD –0.77 [95% CI –0.99  to –0.56]), anxiety (43 RCTs, –0.68 [–0.95  to –0.41]),  and analgesia  use (34 
RCTs, –0.37  [–0.54 to –0.20]), and increased patient satisfaction (16 RCTs, 1.09  [0.51 to 1.68]) scores. 
Visual analog  scale pain  scores  were reduced by [CONTACT_199153] 23 mm (95% CI 16.9–29.9),  and anxiety 
scores measured by [CONTACT_588037] 6.4 units (95% CI 
3.86–8.94). Compared to investigator-selected music, patient-chosen music demonstrated a slightly 
increased but non-significant  reduction  in pain as well as a non-significant reduction in analgesia use 
(Hole et al., 2015). A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis found that perioperative  music 
interventions significantly reduced postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]  (pooled SMD -0.31  [95% CI -0.45 
to -0.16], p < 0.001, I2 = 44.3, n = 1398) (Fu et al., 2020).
Within the music therapy literature, investigators have examined the effects of patient-preferred  live 
music (PPLM) and active music engagement among patients undergoing other pancreatic  surgeries.  
Among patients recovering from organ transplant surgery, various small  RCTs have  demonstrated the 
efficacy of PPLM delivered by a music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_588018], stress, anxiety, nausea, and improving 
mood and relaxation (Bergh & Silverman, 2018; Crawford et al., 2013; Haack & Silverman, 2017; Hogan 
& Silverman,  2015; Madson & Silverman, 2010). In a study of 29 adults  who received liver  and kidney 
transplants, those who engaged  in active  music  engagement (i.e., singing and/or  instrument  playing) 
with a music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_588019] 
(Ghetti, 2011). In a RCT of [ADDRESS_774350]-surgical oncology unit, patients who received  20-
30 minutes  of PPLM (n = 24) reported significant  improvements in affect (Global Mood Scale)  compared 
to waitlist control (Merry & Silverman,  2021). Similar studies of PPLM  on postsurgical oncology units 
support its efficacy for improving anxiety,  relaxation, and pain  (Chaput-McGovern  & Silverman,  2012;  
Yates & Silverman, 2015).
Based on available  literature, no prior music  therapy  studies have  investigated the effects of music-
assisted relaxation  and imagery  (MARI) in patients  undergoing pancreatic surgery.  However, our prior 
work with  this intervention  supports its use with this population. In a RCT conducted at our institution,  
patients receiving  palliative care (n = 99) reported clinically and statistically significant mean reductions

among a larger sample of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588020]-to-severe levels  (≥ 4/10) of pain, a 
single session of MARI was clinically effective  for reducing mean  scores of pain  (-2.0 points, n = 416). 
Patients receiving  MARI in this sample reported  pain changes of ≤ -2 points in 50% of sessions.  More 
specifically, a single music therapy session was clinically effective for reducing mean pain scores  (-1.7  
points, n = 70) on a surgical  oncology unit with  pain changes of ≤ -2 points in 40% of sessions.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_588021], biological  mechanisms  of action remain poorly understood. The most frequently used  
biomarkers in medical music  intervention research  have  been stress biomarkers including  plasma 
cortisol, salivary cortisol, and salivary α-amylase.  While a handful  of studies have found significant p-
values for the reduction of salivary cortisol  and salivary α-amylase in response to music interventions, 
research using these biomarkers  have  been limited by [CONTACT_105]-standardized interventions, small samples,  
and variation in sample  collection (Wong et al., 2021) . Recent advances  in functional genomic science 
provide an opportunity to understand  gene expression mechanisms. Thus far, these approaches have  
been applied  to mind-body  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Bhasin  et al., 2013, 2018;  Dusek et al., 2008),  recreational music 
making (Bittman et al., 2005, 2013), and music listening  (Kanduri, Kuusi, et al., 2015;  Kanduri, Raijas, et 
al., 2015). In a study  of 32 healthy volunteers (mean  age = 40.8)  exposed to a 1-hour stress  induction 
protocol, group keyboard recreational music  making  (RMM) led to reversal of [ADDRESS_774352] to 6 out of 45 markers in the resting control group 
and 0 out of 45 in the ongoing stressor group (Bittman et al., 2005) . In a similar study  of 34 Caucasian 
adults (mean age = 67.7) with a history of ischemic  cardiovascular disease, group keyboard RMM 
produced changes in expression of 12 pathways governing immune function and genetic information 
processing compared to 2 pathways in a quiet reading control (Bittman  et al., 2013). However, gene  
expression approaches have not been  utilized in the investigation of music therapy or in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588022].
To support  future  research of biological mechanisms and scalability in MT, new study  protocols  must be 
tested for feasibility and acceptability. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility 
and acceptability of: (1) a tailored music-assisted relaxation  and imagery  intervention; (2) biological 
sample collection; and (3) mobile  device patient-reported outcome (MDPRO) collection in adults 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588023].

Number of Research Participants
We will enroll 30 subjects  at UH Cleveland  Medical Center (UHCMC).
Recruitment Methods 
Patients will be referred  by [CONTACT_588038]. A member  of the 
surgical team will tell patients that there is a study  they  might be eligible for, share the patient flyer with  
them, and ask if a member  of the study team  can call them to tell them more about the study. If the 
patient agrees, the provider will email the study team with the patient’s name, medical record number  
(MRN), date  of birth, and upcoming dates for pre-admission testing (PAT) and surgery  (if date set). 
Following the outpatient referral, the research  assistant (RA) will review the patient’s medical record to 
pre-screen for eligibility  using the eligibility checklist.  If the patient meets initial eligibility  criteria, the 
RA will approach  the patient over the phone prior to the patient’s surgery  to explain  the study. If the 
patient is interested in participating, the RA will either (1) meet with  the patient at the patient’s PAT 
appointment at UHCMC to obtain  full written  informed consent or (2) obtain written informed consent 
over Zoom for Healthcare, depending on the patient’s preference.
Setting
Initial consent  will take place either in person at the PAT or via a HIPAA-compliant commercial  tele-
health platform (i.e.,  Zoom for Healthcare)  prior  to the patient’s  surgery.  Most subsequent  activities will 
occur at UH Cleveland Medical  Center (UHCMC). Confirmation of eligibility (i.e., pain rated ≥4/10 and 
not admitted to intensive  care unit [ICU]) and affirmation of consent to participate, data collection, 
sample collection,  and the in-person  MARI  intervention will occur  within participants’ private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111496]. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with participants via a HIPAA-compliant commercial 
tele-health platform (i.e., Zoom Healthcare)  or over the phone 1 to 2 weeks after discharge  from 
UHCMC. Following sample collection, blood samples will be temporarily stored within the Connor Whole 
Health research  office  in the Wearn  building or in the -70 freezer in the Dahms Clinical Research  Unit  
(DCRU) laboratory space in the Wearn building. Later, samples will be shipped to Manoj  Bhasin’s lab at 
Emory University for long-term storage and subsequent analysis (Bhasin Systems Biomedicine lab, S335, 
[ADDRESS_774356],  Atlanta, [ZIP_CODE]).
Consent Process
Consent will be obtained in writing  by [CONTACT_588039]. Initial informed consent will 
occur before the surgery date either  during a PAT appointment  in a private clinical or consult room out 
of the earshot of others to maintain privacy, or via a HIPAA-compliant commercial  tele-health  platform. 
Patients will be provided with a copy of the consent  form to read  prior to the discussion of the study. 
The RA will call the patient over the phone prior to their  surgery to explain the study. If the patient is 
interested in participating, the RA will either  (1) meet with  the patient at the patient’s pre-admission 
testing (PAT) appointment  at UHCMC to obtain  full written informed consent or (2) obtain written 
informed consent  over Zoom  for Healthcare, depending on the patient’s preference. The RA will send a 
copy of the informed consent document to the patient for them to review ahead of the scheduled 
HRP-
503BIOTEMPLATE: UH Biomedical  Protocol
Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 08/[ADDRESS_774357] about the 
study. The RA will answer  these questions.  The participant’s understanding  of the study will be 
documented in the Informed Consent Documentation form in REDCap.  
When all questions have been answered, the participant will sign the consent by “making their mark” on 
the signature [CONTACT_588048]. Patients  may participate in 
the study  one time. The study team will send a PDF copy  of the signed  consent form to the participant 
via email. A copy of the consent form will be uploaded into the Electronic  Health  Record.
On day [ADDRESS_774358] check in with  the treating physician and/or the clinical nurse prior 
to approaching  the participant to ensure that there is no clinical reason  why they think the participant 
should not participate  at that time. Participants admitted in the ICU on day [ADDRESS_774359] T0 data and provide MARI, will 
not be approached for further study participation and will be withdrawn from the study.
If the participant is not admitted in the ICU and the treating physician  and/or the clinical  nurse affirm 
that it is appropriate to approach the participant, then  the RA will check in with  the participant in their 
private room  to confirm eligibility,  specifically that (1) their pain  level  is at least a 4 on the 0-10 numeric  
rating scale, and (2) they  affirm that they want  to continue participation in the study. The RA will also 
confirm that the participant is not in too much pain to spend some  time  answering some questions and 
to meet with  the music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].   
If the participant’s pain  is too low or too high  to participate, or if the provider or nurse give a clinical 
reason that the participant should not participate at that time,  the RA will return again in 15 minutes to 
see if anything  has changed. At that time, if 
the provider or nurse continue to give a clinical  reason that the subject should not participate, 
the participant  rates  their pain < 4/10,
the participant  indicates that they  are in too much  pain to participate at that time, or
the participant  is not able  to rate their pain  due to cognitive or physical  limitations,
then the RA will ask the participant if it is ok for the research  team  to return  at another time  to see if 
they meet study criteria and are willing and able to participate in study procedures.  If the participant 
says yes, the RA will return at least 24 hours  later and repeat the above steps.  If applicable, the RA will 
return each  day that the patient is admitted and study staff are available to repeat the above steps until  
either (1) the participant’s eligibility is confirmed and study procedures begin, (2) the participant says 
that they are no longer interested in participating in the study  at all, (3) the participant becomes 
ineligible for any other reason (e.g. they are admitted to the ICU, or (4) the participant is discharged. 
Participants who change  their mind  about participating (reason 2), become ineligible for another reason  
(3), or are discharged will be withdrawn from the study.  They may  still receive  music therapy services 
during their  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588024], but these will occur within routine clinical music  
therapy practice and no data  on those  sessions will be collected for this study.
The result of both the check in(s) with the provider and with the participant  will be documented in 
REDCap. Participants that continue to meet eligibility criteria on day [ADDRESS_774360] “Initiated study procedures” following enrollment.

Study Design
We will conduct a single arm non-randomized trial to determine  the feasibility  and acceptability  of: (1) a 
tailored music-assisted relaxation and imagery intervention; (2) biological sample collection; and (3) 
mobile device  patient-reported outcome (MDPRO) collection among adults  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588025]. See Attachment “MUSICPUPS_Schematic” for a graphic  representation 
of the study  design.
 
Study Procedures
Following consent, the RA will ask the participant if they prefer to use their  own device or a study  iOS 
device to listen to the MARI recording and respond  to the MDPRO  surveys. Then, the participant will 
receive education on how to access the MARI recording  and to respond to the surveys based on the 
choice that they make. The RA will provide a link to education  videos  on Box.com and a written step-by-
step guide, as well as verbal education (see attached videos and step-by-step  guides).  For participants 
who choose to use their  own device, the RA will create  a Box folder for them prior to surgery  and have  
them save a link to this folder on their device home  screen before surgery. The RA will also ask 
participants who choose to use their  own device if they would prefer  to receive MDPRO invitations via 
text message or email. This will be recorded in REDCap.
Regardless of which  device the participant chooses to use during admission,  the RA will encourage  them 
to bring their  own  headphones to use if that is most comfortable for them (e.g., their own Airpods). 
However, if they  don't have  headphones or want  to use study headphones instead, study headphones 
will be provided. If the participant chooses to use their  own device and study headphones, the RA will 
ask the participant if their  device has a headphone jack. If it does, they will be provided a set of Apple 
earbuds during  admission. If it does not, they will also be provided a dongle for lightning or USB-C 
adaptor.
During the consent  visit, in addition to the patient education, the RA will ask the participant a series of 
questions to determine  their preferences  for music (e.g.,  genre,  artists) and imagery  (e.g.,  a place or 
time in which the participant feels comfortable). These responses will be recorded in REDCap. After  the 
consent visit, the RA will share the participant’s music and imagery preferences with the board-certified 
music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (MT-BC) who is an IRB-approved member of the study team. 
Following the participant’s surgery, about an hour after eligibility and continued willingness to 
participate are established as described above, the RA will return to the participants room. This amount 
of time is necessary  to coordinate  with the MT-BC, who  will not know if the participant is eligible and if 
they will be providing the MARI intervention until  the RA checks in. Before collecting any data, the RA 
will ask the participant if their pain will permit  them to continue and if they would like to proceed. If the 
participant responds  affirmatively, the RA will document this in REDCap and then will proceed to collect 
baseline (Time  0) patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (i.e., 0-10  ratings of pain,  stress,  and anxiety)  using 
a REDCap  instrument administered on an iPad. The RA will not view  the participant’s PRO  responses.  If 
HRP-
503BIOTEMPLATE: UH Biomedical  Protocol
Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 08/2019
V4 03.22.2024 Page  7 of 16the participant  is currently utilizing a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the RA will collect 
measures of medication usage from the PCA pump. The RA will also collect a peripheral blood sample 
using a Spot On Sciences  HemaSpot-HF. The research  team chose the HemaSpot HF because it is an 
efficient and less invasive  means  of collecting  capi[INVESTIGATOR_17276]. Using the HemaSpot  HF also poses less risk 
and discomfort to these  patients who recently  underwent major surgery. Following baseline measure 
collection, the RA will leave the participant’s  room.
Following Time 0, the MT-BC will deliver a standardized 30-minute MARI intervention, personalized to 
the participant’s music and imagery preferences. Prior to the intervention, the MT-BC will verify the 
participant’s music and imagery preferences discussed  with the RA during the consent visit. During the 
MARI intervention, the MT-BC will provide live guitar  accompaniment personalized  to the participant’s 
music preferences and read from a standardized  script directing  the participant to relax muscles of the 
body, practice deep breaths, and explore a relaxing place.  This intervention will be recorded live. 
Following the MARI intervention, the MT-BC will briefly process the participant’s experience  by [CONTACT_588040] (please see the attachment “MUSIC PUPS Post  MARI Debriefing” for more 
details). The recorded  MARI track will be exported to a Box folder  that the participant can access  via an 
app on a study iOS device  (e.g., iPod touch, iPhone), or via a web link that is saved as a shortcut on the 
home screen of the participant’s own  device. In either case, the participant’s MARI  use will be tracked in 
Box. 
Immediately following the MARI intervention and post-intervention processing, the MT-BC  will leave the 
participant’s room.  The RA will then enter the participant’s room again.  The RA will confirm that the 
participant is not in too much pain to continue and would like to continue with study procedures, 
documenting this in REDCap, before  collecting post-intervention PROs and peripheral blood smear 
measures (Time 1). After  collecting these measures,  the RA will wait in the participant’s room for [ADDRESS_774361]-intervention (Time  2), the RA will again collect PROs and a final peripheral 
blood smear measure. 
After the final  PRO and peripheral blood smear  collection,  the RA will ensure that the participant  knows  
how to access  the MARI recording and enter MDPRO  measurements using  the study  iOS device or their  
own device, and that they have headphones and, if applicable, a dongle, in order to listen to the 
recording. The RA will instruct the participant to listen  to the MARI intervention 3x/day and complete 3 
MDPRO measurements each day until discharge. If the participant elects to use a study  iOS device,  it will 
be locked  to the participant’s tray table to prevent  it from being lost or stolen during the participant’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
Following the collection of blood samples and PROs, the RA will conduct a review of the participant’s 
medical record to collect data on the participant’s  demographics, clinical characteristics,  and pain  
medications administered pre-intervention.  The RA will enter this data  into REDCap. Following sample  
collection, blood samples will be temporarily  stored within the Connor  Whole  Health  research office in 
the Wearn building or in the -70 freezer in the DCRU laboratory space in the Wearn building. Later, 
samples will be shipped to Manoj  Bhasin’s lab at Emory  University for long-term  storage and subsequent 
analysis (Bhasin Systems Biomedicine lab, S335,  [ADDRESS_774362],  Atlanta, [ZIP_CODE]).
The RA will meet with  each participant every day, Monday through Friday, until discharge to 
troubleshoot any barriers  to MARI  use or MDPRO  collection. Each day, before any troubleshooting or 
HRP-
503BIOTEMPLATE: UH Biomedical  Protocol
Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 08/2019
V4 03.22.2024 Page  8 of 16collecting any data, the RA , like on day one, will (1) check in with  the treating physician and/or the 
clinical nurse; (2) ask the participant if their pain  level will permit them to participate; and (3) ask the 
participant if they  still want to participate in study procedures. If the participant responds affirmatively 
to continuing study procedures, the RA will document this in REDCap and then proceed with  
troubleshooting and data collection.  The RA will record any barriers to MARI use and/or MDPRO  
collection (i.e.,  forgot, technical difficulties, off the floor  for a procedure) as well as the participant’s self-
reported use of MARI in the last 24 hours.  From  Day 2 (i.e., the day after the live MARI intervention) 
until the participant is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], participants using  a study  iOS device will receive  
three notifications per day (i.e., morning, afternoon, and evening) on the iOS device to complete  
MDPRO measures,  and participants using  their own device will receive  three email or text invitations 
(per their preference)  to complete the MDPRO  measures. The participant’s use of the MARI recording 
will be tracked using  file utilization measures  available within Box.com. No PHI will be entered  into the 
Box.com folder. The RA will also track the participant’s use of pain  medications (recorded in the EHR or 
on the PCA). All data will be stored in REDCap.
On the day of the participant’s discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the RA will collect the study  iOS device,  if 
applicable. For those that don’t already have the link on their own device, the RA will provide the 
participant with  the MARI recording via email and a Box.com link to allow the participant to access the 
recording post-discharge.  If desired, the RA will also provide the recording  via a compact disk. Following 
discharge, the study coordinator will arrange a time  for the participant to complete  a semi-structured 
interview over  Zoom.  One to two weeks after the participant’s discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], researchers 
will meet with the participant  over  a HIPAA-compliant commercial tele-health  platform to complete  a 
semi-structured interview (see Appendix for interview guide).  If the participant  is expected to be 
discharged over  the weekend,  the RA will provide the MARI recording resources on the Friday before  
the weekend in which the participant  is to be discharged.
Blood sample procedures
All HemaSpot-HF will be prelabeled with  a Study ID (e.g.,  1,2,3,4, 5), the appropriate study  time series 
(i.e., Time 0, Time  1, or Time  2), and a line for the research  assistant to write  the date and time the 
sample was collected.
When collecting the blood sample, the research  assistant will follow Spot On Sciences’ procedure  which  
can be viewed here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8_jfOwlus). These procedures are as 
follows: 
1)Put on a pair of protective  gloves; 
2)Clean and sanitize a tray table on which to place  the HemaSpot materials; 
3)Lay out the materials from the HemaSpot kit on a tray table in the participant’s room;  
4)Clean the participant’s finger using  an alcohol  wipe; 
5)Remove  the cap from the lancet and position the end against  the inside tip of the middle  or 
ring finger; 
6)Press the lancet firmly  on the participant’s  finger until it activates with  a click; 
7)Wipe away the first drop of blood with a sterile gauze; 
8)Position the lanced finger over the center  of the HemaSpot; 
9)Provide gentle  pressure on the end of the finger, and let three drops of blood  drip from the 
finger onto the center  of the HemaSpot;  
10)Wait one minute for the wicking process  to complete; 
11)Bandage the participant’s finger;

These steps will occur  at Time 0, Time 1, and Time  2, with the RA sampling a different finger  from the 
participant at each time. The RA will note  any challenges to blood sample  collection (e.g., participant 
discomfort, device malfunction,  participant refusal) and record  these in REDCap following the 
procedure.
Following blood sample collection, the RA will ensure that the samples are properly labeled and their 
collection are noted in REDCap. The three  samples will be placed in a secure padded envelope and 
locked in the Connor Whole Health Research Office  in Wearn [ADDRESS_774363]  the clinical care team and make a note in the patient’s EHR. If the patient reports 
an anxiety score greater than  or equal  to 7/10 on the numeric  rating  scale during the study, study staff 
will make  a note in the patient’s EHR documenting the patient’s anxiety score.  The clinical care team  will 
follow their intervention protocol to address  the patient’s  situation. 
 
Interview procedures
Interviews will take place over a HIPAA-compliant commercial tele-health platform  (i.e.,  Zoom for 
Healthcare) or over  the phone one-to-two weeks after the participant is discharged  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
During that interview, a researcher will ask the participant  about their experience in the study  and what 
they thought about the MARI intervention. The researcher conducting the interviews  remotely will be in 
a private room when  interviewing the participants  and will be certified in human subject protection and 
GCP, researched credentialed if applicable, and on the study personnel table. The interview will take 
about 30 minutes and will be recorded and then transcribed by [CONTACT_35681].

1.Peripheral blood sample
Data Analysis  Plan
In anticipation of a dropout rate of 33% following admission  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e.,  participants either not 
ever meeting  pain criteria or choosing not to participate), we decided on a sample size of [ADDRESS_774364] 20 participants  meeting  full eligibility criteria.  
We based our sample size of 20 and definition  of feasibility on prior research examining the feasibility of 
biological sample collection with music  therapy  (Holochwost et al, 2020). We have  no prior experience 
using the HemaSpot  HF for sample collection  nor with  delivery of the MARI intervention to this 
population and plan to start with a small  sample size in order to refine procedures for a larger study. We 
hypothesize a 75% feasibility threshold for complete live MARI intervention delivery, PRO collection, and 
biological sample collection. We would consider  failure to be completing  less than 15/20 MARI  
interventions, 15/20  complete sets of PROs at Time  0, Time 1, and Time 2, 80% of MDPRO  measures  
over the duration of the participant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 45/60 blood sample  collections. 
We will use descriptive statistics (e.g., counts, percentages, mean, standard deviation, and median)  to 
summarize participants’ demographics and clinical  characteristics  (obtained from EHR), as well as 
feasibility measures including rates of enrollment, attrition, intervention participation, MARI  recording  
use, biological sample collection/viability,  and PRO  collection. We will determine the feasibility  of 
biological sample viability by [CONTACT_588041]. No formal hypothesis  tests  (e.g., linear mixed  effects models)  will be 
conducted on changes in PRO data as this is a feasibility study.
Blood sample analysis plan
We are not collecting genetic data. We are not performing  any genetic profiling. We are performing 
gene expression  analysis, and this is different from  genetic profiling. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_588027]. To establish procedural elements, it is 
necessary to test procedures including  the MARI  intervention, peripheral blood sampling, and mobile  
device patient-reported outcome collection as these  have not been utilized in prior studies  with  this 
population. We have already consulted with  statisticians and based on our previous findings in music 
intervention, we need [ADDRESS_774365]-measures  on subjects for the fully powered study. After  this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we intend to launch a multi-center feasibility study in collaboration with other  institutions.
We will plan  on conducting the following gene expression analyses as specified for all three-time points 
(Time 0, Time 1, and Time  2). The gene expression analysis will be performed at Bhasin Systems 
biomedicine lab at Emory University.  
A large part of the human  genome is transcribed  into various forms of RNA, and the global  gene 
expression profile (GEP) changes  measure  expression changes in genes over time due to an intervention. 
Accordingly, our long-term goal of this line of research will be to examine whether pain intensity  
changes after the MARI intervention are associated with  specific changes in gene expression profiles 
(GEP) and pathophysiologic pathways that correspond with the elicitation of the relaxation  response 
(Bhasin et al., 2013, 2018; Dusek et al., 2008).

V4 03.22.2024 Page  12 of 16Our prior work  was conducted among healthy adults (Bhasin et al., 2013;  Dusek et al., 2008)  or 
hypertensive patients (Bhasin et al., 2018) living in the community using PaxGene tubes to collect whole 
blood.  In the intervening  years,  the technology of dried blood spot (DBS) collection of samples has 
improved and has been  used for GEP analysis.  
Thus, for the current  feasibility  study with [ADDRESS_774366]. Bhasin’s lab at Emory University  for RNA  
sequencing based transcriptome profiling.  The transcriptome profiling will be performed using paired-
end RNA  sequencing  that allows for the measurement  of the expression profile of ~30,000 human  genes 
with high sensitivity and specificity. Briefly, sequencing libraries  of Poly A selected mRNA will be generated 
from the double-stranded cDNA using  the Illumina TruSeq kit according  to the manufacturer's protocol. 
High-quality libraries will be sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 to achieve  comprehensive coverage  
of measuring the expression of all genes. The assay can only measure the expression of genes but cannot 
reveal the identity/race/gender of the subjects. 
The Raw  sequencing data  will be processed to remove any adaptor, PCR primers, and low-quality 
transcripts. After alignment, the gene expression levels  will be normalized  and compared among the 
baseline and post-intervention samples to identify genes that are significantly modulated by [CONTACT_283800]. The comparison will be performed by [CONTACT_588042]. We will perform a focused  analysis on immune and 
inflammatory response-related genes  as our previous analyses depi[INVESTIGATOR_588028]-body interventions 
deliver beneficial effects  by [CONTACT_588043].  Additionally, to understand the detailed mechanism 
of intervention, we will perform pathways  enrichment and interactive network analysis.  
Although the size of the feasibility proposal is small, we contend that it is worth  conducting the GEP for 
each of the [ADDRESS_774367] RNA from the dried  blood spots (DBS) and prepare RNA sequencing (RNAseq) 
libraries. This process will occur  in three steps: (1) RNA extraction and isolation,  (2) RNAseq  library 
preparation, and (3) Sequencing.
1.RNA extraction and isolation. The RNA will be quantified using  Qubit  (Thermo Fisher  Scientific) 
and quality  assessed  by [CONTACT_588044] (Agilent).  See attachment  “NEB Protocol” for 
more details on RNA  extraction and isolation.
2.RNAseq library preparation. The lab technicians will use the New England biolabs kits. First, they  
will remove ribosomal RNAs  using  ribosomal depletion kit (NEB#E6310) and then prepare the 
RNAseq library using the NEBNext®  Ultra™ II Directional RNA  Library Prep with  Sample 
Purification Beads (NEB#E7765). The technicians  will quantify the library using qubit and 
checking the quality HS DNA bioanalyzer  chips  (Agilent). See attachment  “RNA  Extraction  and 
Isolation from HemaSpot” for more details on the RNAseq library preparation protocol.

NextSeq 500/550  mid output kits – 150 cycles (Illumina).
Qualitative analysis plan
Interviews will take place via a HIPAA-compliant commercial tele-health platform  (i.e.,  Zoom  for 
Healthcare) and be recorded  then transcribed  by [CONTACT_35681]. The RA, who will not conduct any interviews, will 
proof transcripts against the original  recordings  for accuracy.  The transcribed interviews will be 
imported into the qualitative software  program NVivo  for analysis. At least two individuals experienced 
in qualitative data analysis  will perform a line-by-line review and coding of each transcript 
independently using a constant comparative method of qualitative data  analysis (Hseih & Shannon, 
2005). The initial coding will consist of reading the narrative  text and highlighting  words or phrases  that 
capture the experience with music therapy. Text will be coded as themes as identified from the 
narratives and will be organized into meaningful categories and subcategories.  In the final step, a table 
with categories and subcategories of data, along with definitions for each category,  will be constructed 
consistent with study objectives.  All data from  the interviews that appear to be directly related to the 
study aims  will be extracted. 
Strategies to optimize validity  will include reviewing  the coding  among  all coders, refining the coding 
until there  is agreement. Members  of the research  team  will review  findings for accuracy  of generated 
themes, interpretations of the data, and conclusions. 
Risks to  Research Participants
The participant may  not like the MARI  intervention included in the study. In that event, participants may 
ask the MT-BC  to stop the intervention and choose not to participate in the rest of the intervention. The 
probability of this event is low, however,  as it has not occurred in any prior music therapy studies and its 
occurrence is rare in music therapy practice.  It is possible that the participant may experience  
discomfort providing peripheral blood samples via finger prick. A breach in participants’  privacy  and 
confidentiality may  occur  as a result of participating  in this research study. 
Provisions to Protect  the Privacy  Interests of Research Participants
All attempts will be made to ensure  participants’ privacy. The referrals will come from the participant’s 
medical team. The participant’s name [CONTACT_588049]. The 
linking log that identifies  the participant’s study ID to identifiable data will be stored on a password-
protected, encrypted  computer  or secure server. All data that is stored in REDCap  will identify the 
participant by [CONTACT_588045]. Informed consent  will occur 
in a private clinical room or consult room out of the earshot of others to maintain  privacy.
Only aggregate data will be presented or published and will be presented such that individuals cannot  
be identified. Only IRB-approved  study personnel will have access to participant data. All study  
personnel will be required  to be certified in the protection of human subjects throughout  the study.
Identifiable information  will not be reused or disclosed  to any person or entity outside  of University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588029], except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized  oversight 
of the research study, or as specifically approved  for use in another study by [CONTACT_1201].

V4 03.22.2024 Page  14 of 16Although not guaranteed,  there is the possibility  that the MARI  intervention may reduce pain, anxiety 
and stress after their surgery. Furthermore,  future surgical patients may benefit from the knowledge 
gained from  this study.
Withdrawal of Research Participants
The study doctor or the sponsor can withdraw participation of research participants  at any time without 
their consent for the following reasons:
If the patient is admitted to the ICU following surgery and remain admitted to the ICU on the 
day when study procedures would  typi[INVESTIGATOR_176711].
If, after the first day participation, the participant’s  clinical condition  deteriorates enough that 
they are transferred to the ICU.
If it appears  to be medically harmful  to the subject;
If the subject fails to follow directions for participating in the study;
If it is discovered  that the subject does  not meet the study requirements;
If the study is canceled; or 
For administrative reasons, including competitive enrollment - the target number of subjects has 
entered the study.
Alternatives to Participation

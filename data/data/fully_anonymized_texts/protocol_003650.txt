Title of Study:  Phase 1b, Randomized , Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Dose Escalation 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of QR -010 
in Subjects With Homozygous ΔF508 Cystic Fibrosis  
Investigators:  To be determined  
Study Centers:  Approximately 27 centers in North America  and European Union ( EU) 
Phase of Development:  1b 
Study Period:   [ADDRESS_908357] Participation:  9 days (single ascending dose cohorts)  
8 weeks (multiple ascending dose cohorts)  
Objectives:  Primary : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -010 administered  via 
inhalation  and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
Secondary : To evaluate  the change from baseline  analysis for laboratory 
parameters and vital signs  as well as the  pharmacokinetic s (PK) of QR -010 
administered  via inhalation.  
Exploratory : To explore  the efficacy of QR -010 administered  via inhalation . 
Study Design:  Randomi zed, double -blind  (investig ator and subject) , placebo -controlled, 
single ascending and multiple ascending dose-escalation study . This study  
includes  two portions : four single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts  (1-4) and 
four multiple ascending dose (MAD)  cohorts  (5-8). 
An independent  Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will be  
designated  to review all  safety data at the end of  each cohort. Safety data 
will in clude [ADDRESS_908358] two SAD cohorts. Similarly, subsequent MAD 
dosing cohorts will be initiated based on the determination of the DSMC  
that an adequate  safety profile is demonstrated in the corresponding 
supportive SAD  and MAD  cohorts. Lastly, the DSMC  will review safety 
data on an ad hoc bas is. The type of adverse event ( AE) that would trigger 
such an ad hoc DSMC  review would be documented in the data safety 
monitoring plan.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  2.0 INTRODUCTION  
ProQR Therapeutics (ProQR, the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_576452] ( AON ) 
product, QR -010, for the chronic treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) that is associated 
with either a compound hetero - or homozygous genotype for the absence of phenylalanine at 
position 508 (ΔF508 /p.Phe508del) on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) -encoded ribonucleic acid (RNA). QR -010 is a single -stranded RNA oligonucleotide that 
is complementary to the ∆F508 region on the RNA transcription product of the CFTR gene. 
Translation of the repaired CFTR encoded RNA should result in a wild-type (WT) or normal 
CFTR protein. The intended route of clinical administration is oral inhalation (inhalation) of 
nebulized QR -010 solution.  
Cystic Fibrosis Associated with ΔF508 CFTR Genotype  
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that i s caused by a mutation in a gene that 
encodes CFTR, a membrane protein with pleiotropic functions. CFTR regulates the surface 
liquid layer and is found in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_672127], gastrointestinal, and biliary 
systems; male reproductive tra ct; and exocrine sweat glands. This protein consists of 1480 amino 
acids that are divided into five domains, two of which cross the membrane to form a 
bidirectional, trans -membrane chloride channel ( Riordan et al., 1989 ). Although CFTR functions 
primarily as a chloride channel, it has many other regulatory roles that affect the CF phenotype. 
These include inhibition of sodium transport through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_85062] (ENaC), 
regulation of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel, regulation of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP ) channels, regulation of intracellular vesicle transport, acidification of intracellular 
organ elles, and inhibition of endogenous calcium -activated chloride channels. The CFTR protein 
is also involved in bicarbonate –chloride exchange. A deficiency in bicarbonate secretion leads to 
poor solubility and aggregation of luminal mucins. Lack of CFTR func tion results in the multi -
organ system clinical syndromes described in patients with CF (Collawn et al. , 2012; Mehta , 
2005; O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Quinton , 1999; Reisin et al. , 1994; Vankeerberghen et al. , 
2002 ).  
The CFTR gene is encoded on chromosome  7 (Chr 7 117,120,017 through to 117,308,715). The 
transcription product of the CFTR gene (189 kb) is a messenger RNA (mRNA) ( 6.1 kb) that is 
translated into the CFTR protein. A patient with  a CF phenotype has a CFTR gene mutation on 
both alleles and may b e homozygous for a single mutation or compound heterozygous with a 
different mutation on each allele. There are nearly [ADDRESS_908390] an allele frequency ≥ 0.01% and 127 of those 159 variants meet both the clinical  
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_672128]) and functional (affects RNA quality/quantity or 
CFTR protein) criteria to cause CF. Together, these 159 variants account for 96.4% of identified 
cystic fibrosis alleles. The ΔF508 mutation is the most common  allelic mutation and accounts for 
about 66 -70% of identified mutated alleles in northern European and North American 
populations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data 
Report (2012), a total of 23,053  CF patients (86.7 % of the CF population in the US) in the US

2013 ). 
The various CFTR mutations are often classified into 5 specific functional classes, as shown in 
Figure  1. The ΔF508 mutation (hetero - or homozygous ) is a Class II CFTR functional mutation 
that is characterized by [CONTACT_672166]; the gene is transcribed but the translated 
protein product is not trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum and is degraded  before 
reaching the cell surface. The ΔF508 mutation results in a CFTR protein that is mis -folded, 
which results in ubiquination and degradation. As a result, little, if any, CFTR reaches the 
plasma membrane. QR -[ADDRESS_908391] one allele ( O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Pasyk & Foskett, 1995 ; Zamecnik et al. ,

Source: Gelfond & Borowitz, [ADDRESS_908392] common cause of death in patients with CF is respir atory failure due to progressive 
loss of lung function and/or pulmonary disease ( Davies et al., 2007 ). There are sever al 
hypotheses regarding the mechanism by [CONTACT_642081] ΔF508 mutation leads to the multi -organ 
system CF phenotype and progressive loss of function, however the causal relationship between 
CFTR dysfunction and the CF phenotype is well established (Sosnay , 2013 ). In the simplest 
pathophysiological scenario, functional CFTR is either absent or substantially reduced at the 
api[INVESTIGATOR_307202]; the absence of functional CFTR at the api[INVESTIGATOR_672129] c iliated airway 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_672130] a reduced capacity to secrete chloride ions to the 
airway surface and, indirectly, in an increased absorption of sodium ions from airway surfaces  
(Collawn et al. , 2012; O’Sullivan  & Freed man, 20 09). This imbalance of active ion transport 
favors the net removal of salt and concomitant water from  airway surfaces. Loss of water in the 
gel-like periciliary layer results in a loss of lubrication of the airway surface and increased 
concentration s of mu cin in the mucus layer. Dehydrated periciliary layer ( PCL) leads to thicker 
mucus and cilia collapse, which results in a reduced mucociliary clearance. The ‘stuck’ mucus

obstruct the airway lumen, produce airflow obstruction, and serve as a nidus for persistent 
bacterial infections. It is the same loss of CFTR -mediated ion regulat ion that leads to dysfunction 
in other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal ( eg, malabsorption), biliary, pancreatic and 
sweat exocrine, reproductive (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in males)  systems .

in the European Union ( EU). The Investigational eFlow ® Nebulizer System  (PARI Respi[INVESTIGATOR_672131]) will be used for study drug administration in North America . These devices are 
identical and will be referred to as eFlow in this protocol.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Placebo  
Placebo, QR -010 Placebo Solution for Nebulization, is a solution of 0.9% sodiu m chloride. It is 
similar to QR -010 Solution for Nebulization except the active ingredient, QR -010, is excluded. 
The placebo is labeled with the appropriate information as specified in the clinical protocol and 
as necessitated by l ocal regulatory requireme nts. 
2.1.3 Nonclinical  
The nonclinical pharmacology program investigated QR -010 using both in vitro (human cell line 
and primary cells) and in vivo (mice, Cynomolgus monkeys) systems. The nonclinical 
pharmacodynamics data demonstrat ed the inhalation of QR -010 in  mice and supported the 
proposed mechanism of action of treatment with QR -010 in facilitating the phenotypic reversion 
of ∆F508 CFTR activity to WT CFTR activity. These studies are summarized in QR-010 
Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5. 2 - Nonclinical Pha rmacology .  
Three preliminary studies contributed bio -distribution data for QR -010. These analyses were 
conducted in mouse variant C57BL/6J  (considered wild -type [WT] for the purposes of these 
studies).  One additional 28 -day, repeat -dose GLP -compliant toxicity study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys provided toxicokinetic (TK) data . These studies are summarized in QR-010 
Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5.[ADDRESS_908398] Metabolism in Animals .  
The nonclinical toxicology program for QR -010 was cond ucted in accordance with the following 
guidelines:  
 ICH M3 (R2): Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human 
Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  
 ICH S4 Guidance: Duration of Chronic Toxicity Testing in Animals  (Rodent and Non 
Rodent Toxicity Testing)  
 ICH S3A Guidance : The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies   
A total of seven toxicity studies in mice and Cynomolgus monkeys contributed relevant data for 
the determination of safety and maximum reco mmended starting dose. These studies are 
summarized in QR-010 Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5. 4 – Toxicology .

frequency ≥ 0.01%  and 127 of those 159 variants meet both the clinical (sweat chloride test) and 
functional (affects RNA quality/quantity or CFTR protein) criteria to cause CF. Together, these 
159 variants account for 96.4% of identified cystic fibrosis alleles. The ΔF508 mutation is the 
most common allelic mutation and accounts for about 66 -70% of identified mutated alleles in 
northern European and North American populations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data Report (2012), a  total of 23,053  CF patients 
(86.7% of the CF population in the US) in the US had one or two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] ΔF508 mutation  
(O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Sosnay , et al., 2013 ). 
The ΔF508 mutation (hetero - or homozygous) is a Class II CFTR functional mutation that is  
characterized by [CONTACT_672166]; the gene is transcribed but the translated protein

airway inflammation, obstruction, and persistant bacterial infections ( Collawn et al. , 2012;

dysfunction in other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal ( eg, malabsorption), biliary, 
pancreat ic and sweat exocrine, reproductive (congenital bilateral absence of the vas de ferens in 
males) systems.  
Although many organ systems are affected in CF, the most common cause of death is respi[INVESTIGATOR_672133]/or pulmonary disease ( Davies et al., 2007 ). 
Hence, patients with CF would greatly benefit from a therapy targeted to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_672134] ∆F508 CFTR activity to WT or normal CFTR

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  The initial clinical study, PQ -010-001, will be a single - and multiple -ascending dose (SAD and 
MAD, respectively) study that will evaluate safety, tolerability, and the ma ximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of QR -[ADDRESS_908403] baselin e lung function defined as FEV 1 ≥ 70% 
predicted for safety re asons. The Phase 1b study will be conducted in  North America  and select 
European countries.  
2.2.1 Dose Selection Rationale  
Dose selection was based on the human equivalence dose (HED) and maximum recom mended 
starting  dose (MRSD) that were derived from 28 -day toxicology studies in mouse and 
Cyanomolgus monkey studies , and further details can be found in the Investigator Brochure .  
The doses in the intended dose escalation scheme ( 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 m g) in Study 
PQ-010-001 correspond to the fill dose (mg loaded into the nebulizer)  for the nebulizer. The 
maximum fill volume of the eFlow, the device that will be used to deliver study medication, is 
4 mL. In Study PQ-010-001, the fill volume will be 4 mL for all doses in the dose escalation 
scheme. The doses will be adjusted by [CONTACT_672168] 50 mg/mL solution. The actual  delivered dose 
of QR -010 Solution for Nebulization using the eFlow with a 4 mL fill is < 80% of the fill  dose. 
Hence, the maximum amount of drug delivered to patients will be approximately 5, 10, 20, and 
40 mg under the dose escalation scheme.  
The maximum loaded (50  mg) and estimated maximum delivered dose s (40 mg) roughly 
correspond to one -half of the  MRSD  of 104 mg. In addition, the MRSD incorporated a safety 
factor of greater than 5 times the pulmonary deposited dose (PDD) (based on data from  the 
28-day toxicity study that was conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys ), and it is expected that there 
will be a lower  bioavailability of QR -010 in the lungs of CF patients. In  consideration of all the 
points above , the proposed dose escalation scheme for PQ-010-001 is considered highly 
conservative.

4.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
A Dose -limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as follows:  
 Allergic reaction requiring medical intervention  
 Acute bronchospasm requiring medical intervention  
 Other acute AEs of interest  requiring immediate medical intervention  
Allergic reactions and acute bronchospasm not requiring intervention  (Grade 1)  are usually 
considered subject -specific and are not included in the definition of DLT. In this protocol ,

4.5 Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MTD  is defined as one dose level below the dose level at which 2 subjects  receiving 
QR-010 experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  for dose cohorts [ADDRESS_908424] exposure will be approximately <  40 
mg (< 80% efficiency of the eFlow including residual volume) . For the MTD determination, the 
fill dose will be used .

Allergic reactions  may include local dermatitis, angioedema, throat constriction, or anaphylaxis.  
Appropriate treatment may include administration of antihistamines, hydrocortisone, or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_672141].  Subjects diagnosed with a systemic 
allergic reaction requiring therapy will be withdrawn from the study.  
Given the proposed mechanism of action of QR -010, it could be anticipated that subjects  could 
experience a change in baseline  cough, change in sputum quality, or change in sputum volume. 
A pulmonary exacerbation should be considered if these symptoms are accompanied by [CONTACT_411], 
body weight loss, generalized malaise. If a pulmonary exacerbation is diagnosed, appropriate 
interventions including  appropriate  additional antibiotics should be prescribed by [CONTACT_672174]. Subjects diagnosed with a pulmonary exacerbation requiring the addition 
of antibiotics will be withdrawn from the study.

6.3 Concomitant Medications and Ancillary Therapy  
6.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
All concurrent CF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_672144]. Prior to study drug 
dosing on a give n day, the following order of concurrent treatment should be adhered to: Long - 
and/or Short acting bronchodilator, mucolytic  therapy ( eg, Pulmozyme),  chest physiotherapy 
(airway clearance technique), inhaled cortic osteroid, inhaled antibiotics.  
Subjects w ho are prescribed chronic, intermittent inhaled antibiotics should participate in the 
study when they are most stable and continue the inhaled antibiotic throughout the study. For 
most patients, this would mean that the subject initiates the inhaled antibi otic during the 
screening period and continues taking it as prescribed through the end of study, including some 
additional days or weeks. As the regimens of chronic inhaled antibiotics varies significantly from 
patients to patient, the Investigator is enco uraged to discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
the appropriate regi men for the course of the study . 
Ancillary therapy regimens and airway clearance techniques should remain consistent throughout 
the study period. Other ancillary therapy may be admini stered at the d iscretion of the 
Investigator. Subjects  should receive full supportive care, including antibiotics, antiemetics, 
bronchodilators , etc., as ap propriate. The reason(s) for ancillary therapy, including dosage and 
date(s) of treatment, will be r ecorded in the source documents.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_908441] 30 days prior to enroll ment 
are permitted. The reason(s) for ancillary therapy, including dosage and date(s) of treatment, will 
be rec orded in the source documents. Use of ivacafto r (Kalydeco ™) or lumacaftor  are prohibited 
within 45 days of Day 1,  through the End of Study visit.  Use of any investigational drug (other 
than QR -010) or device are  prohibited within [ADDRESS_908442] below (defined as those, alone or in combination, tha t result in a low  failure rate, ie, 
less than 1% per year  when used consistently and correctly ). Double barrier methods (a

hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559] . 
Highly effective methods of birth control include:  
 Combined  (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
 Progesterone -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, implantable)  
 Intrau terine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner and has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence. Sexual abstinen ce must be true abstinence which is the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial, and 
withdrawal are not acce ptable methods of contraception.  
Birth control measures must be employed  during the time of participation  (beginning at the 
Screening Visit)  in this trial. Protections against pregnancy must be continued for  at least  [ADDRESS_908444] dose of study  drug. 
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently ster ile by [CONTACT_31657]. 
Male subjects with CF with medical confirmation of azospermia and/or infertility will be 
considered permanently sterile. A man who is fertile should use a condom during treatment and 
until [ADDRESS_908445] dose of study drug . 
6.4 Adverse Reaction Management  
AEs in the study will be treat ed with appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Acute b ronchospasm (defined as a ≥ 
15 % decrease in FEV 1 % predicted) should be treated with treatment cessation and with β2 
agonists, IV hydrocortisone (100 mg), o r other agents as appropriate. Additional supportive care 
should be provided as necessary by [CONTACT_672182].  
A Grade 4 (as defined by [CONTACT_672183] [NCI CTCAE  
Version 4.0 3] Modified for CF ) adverse  reaction requires permanent discontinuation of study 
drug.  
If Grade [ADDRESS_908446]: QR -010

7.0 EVALUATIONS BY [CONTACT_672184]  1, Schedule  of Assessments. All laborator y 
tests are detailed in  Appendix 2 , Sched ule of Laboratory Assessments. Refer to these appendices 
for the required assessments for each study day.  Throughout the protocol, the term “ baseline ” is 
used to refer to tests or procedures performed at screening, Day -1, or on Day 1 prior to dosing.  
7.1 Visit and Assessment Windows  
The flexibility regarding scheduling of study days and correspond ing procedures differ 
depending on the cohort and phase of the study. The timing of assessments, procedures and 
sample collections outlined in t he protocol are nominal times. It is understood that in the phase 1 
setting, actual times will approximate rathe r than match the nominal times exac tly. Actual times 
are to be recorded in the source documentation  and in the case report forms (CRFs) , and, if any 
time point s are missed, the reasons are also recorded.  
For the SAD cohorts, there is no flexibility regardi ng the timing of the scheduled study days in 
relation to dose Day 1.  
For the MAD cohorts, there is some flexibility regarding the timing of the scheduled study d ays 
in relation to dose Day 1. The description of procedures assumes a Monday -Wed nesday -Friday  
dosing schedule. An alternative dosing schedule can be used, provided that there is at a minimum 
2 days  between doses, and a maximum of 4 days between doses.  Missed doses  are to be recorded 
as such, and the overall treatment period should remain at 4 week s, and  not be extended to  
accommodate the missed doses. Missed doses  are to be recorded in the CRF.  
Details regarding acceptable windows for timing of study procedures for both the SAD and 
MAD cohorts can be found in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.2 Screening  Visit  (All Cohorts)  
A screening log of all consented subjects  will be kept at each site. Subject  screening should be 
conducted ≤  14 days prior to study drug dosing ( Day 1). Screening evaluations may be 
completed over several days, if necessary.   
If the first ad ministration of study drug does not occur within the initial 14 days of screening, the 
screening period may be extended up to an additional 14 days and subjects may be reassessed for 
eligibility with an interim medical history, focused physical examination , and repeat of 
laboratory studies (standard laboratory assessments).  
At the discretion of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, the screening period for an individual 
subject may be exte nded for an additional [ADDRESS_908447]: QR -010

11.0 STUDY TERMINATION  
If the Sponsor, DSMC , Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee, study monitor, or appropriate 
regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study 
should be halted or that a study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after 
appropriate consultation.  Termination may occur in accordance with the clauses contained in the 
site’s exe cuted clinical trial agreement.  ProQR Therapeutics reserves the right to discontinue the 
trial prior to enrollment  of the intended number of subjects , but intends only to exercise this right 
for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  
If the clinical development of QR -010 is discontin ued, the Sponsor  shall immediately inform all 
trial Investigators/institutions and regulatory authorities. Study termination and follow -up will be 
performed in compliance with the conditions set forth in the ICH E6 on Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and local regulatory requirements.

AEs include:  
 Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to have worsened in severity 
or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period  
 AEs not previously observed in the subject  that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period  (as specified in Section  12.4.1)  
 Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions ( eg, invasive 
procedures such as blood draw s) 
 AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are re lated to a 
protocol-mandated intervention ( eg, invasive procedures such as blood draw s, medication 
washout, or no treatment run -in) 
12.3 Assessment of Adverse Events   
The I nvestigator is responsible for assessing the severity and causality of AEs. 
12.3.1  Assessment of  the Severity (Intensity) of Adverse Events  
Maximum intensity is to be graded using the NCI CTCAE (V 4.0) Modified for CF ( National 
Cancer Institute , 2011 ). If grading table  does not have grading criteria for the event,  the criteria 
in Table  4 will be used.  
Table  4: Adverse Event Intensity (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Severity  Alternative Description of the Adverse Eventa 
1 Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; discomfort sufficient to 
reduce or in terfere with daily activities.  
3 Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672152]; disabling; limits self -care with 
significant interference with daily activities; incapacitating with inability to perform 
self care activities of daily living.  
4 Life-threatening  Urgent intervention indicate d; immediate risk of death.  
5 Death   
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to definitions of an SAE.  
a. Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_908505]: QR -010 
Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 62 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Any AE that meets the seriousness criteria (see Section  12.5, Serious  Adverse Event Definitio n) 
will be considered a n SAE , including all life -threatening AEs . In addition, AEs with Grade  [ADDRESS_908506] be distinguished from disease -related conditions. To 
ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, I nvestigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
Not Related:  The AE has an etiology  other than the study drug ( eg, preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness , or concomitant medication); a nd/or the AE has 
no plausible temporal relationship to admini stration of the study drug ( eg, cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_908507] dose of study drug).  
Related:  There is a plausible (possible, probable, or definite) temporal relationship between the 
onset o f the AE and administration of the investigational product, and the AE cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational pro duct; and/or the AE abates or 
resolves upon discontinuation of the investigational product or dose reduction and, if applicable, 
reappears upon rechallenge.  
Note:  The I nvestigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process and will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record, AE CRF , and SAE  
form if applicable. AEs recorded without the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship to 
study drug will be followed up until causality is assigned.  
12.3.3  Assessment of the Outcome of Adverse Events  
Recovered/resolved:  The subject  has fully recovered from the event , with no residual effects 
observable.  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered from the event, but with residual 
sequelae effects observable.  
Not recovered/resolved:  Effects of the event are still present.  
Recovering/resolving:  The subject  has improved, but has not fully recovered from the event . 
Fatal:  The death is re lated to the event . 
Unknown:  The outcome of the event is unknown to the reporter ( eg, subject  was lost to 
follow -up).

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  12.4 Reporting of Adverse Events  
The I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the source 
document, AE CRF , and/or SAE form, and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol 
instructions.  
12.4.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All significant medical conditions including signs/symptoms of the underlying diagnosis found 
during the screening  period and up to randomization will be captured as medical history.  Any 
event/condition related to participation in the trial but not related to underlying or concomitant 
disease  that is  noted after screening  up to the randomization date will be captured as a 
non-treatment emergent AE. 
Any event/condition noted once the subject  is randomized will be captured as an AE. All AEs 
and SAEs regardless of attri bution will be collected until at least [ADDRESS_908508] ’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study 
treatment.  Any related non -serious AE occurring after the reporting period may be reported at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  
AEs and SAEs  related to study drug that persist >[ADDRESS_908509] to follow -up, 
or it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the 
AE/SAE . Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE CRF and 
SAE  form (if applicable) and in the subject ’s medical record to facilitat e source data verification. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], facsimile, electronic 
mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE report ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or 
autopsy report).   
12.4.[ADDRESS_908510]  evaluation 
time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
12.4.[ADDRESS_908511] medical terminology/concepts whe n recording AEs or SAEs on 
the CRF and/or SAE form . Colloquialisms and abbreviations  should be avoided . SAEs must also 
Investigational Product: QR -010 
Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 64 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  be recorded on the AE CRF . Only one medical concept should be recorded i n the event field on 
the AE CRF and SAE form (if applicable).  
a. Signs and Symptoms  versus Diagnosis  
Signs and symptoms  should be recorded on the AE CRF rather than the unifying diagnosis . The 
unifying event term or diagnosis should  be recorded as the “etiology” in the CRF  (if known), and 
the SAE form, if applicable.  For example, jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases  should 
be record ed on the CRF , and “liver failure” shoul d be recorded as the etiology. As another 
example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing  should be recorded as AEs on the CRF , and  record “upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_19625]” as the etiology.  Vague, nonspecific AE terms such as “erythema,” 
“rash,” or “lump on head” should be avoided and more specific information sho uld be provided, 
such as “erythematous macule on right leg,” “allergic dermatitis,” and “scalp cyst.”  
b. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should also be entered as separate AEs. For example, if  severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, both diarrhea and dehydration should be entered as AEs on the CRF , and if also 
serious , on the SAE form.  
c. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A pe rsistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject  evaluation 
time poi nts. Such events shoul d only be recorded once in the CRF un less their severity increases. 
If a persistent AE becomes more severe  or occurs more frequently , it should be recor ded again 
on the AE CRF  with the increased severity grading .  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject  evaluation time p oints and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded individually on the AE C RF. 
d. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs on the  CRF  and SAE form (if applicable). For example, abnormalities that 
require study drug dose modification, discontinu ation of study treatment, more frequent follow -
up assessments, further  diagnostic investigation, etc.  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should  be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an  elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 
mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs on the CRF and SAE form (if applicable) , unle ss their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  e.  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section  12.4.1), 
regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the AE CRF and SAE form and reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of event knowledge .  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as a single medical concept. For example,  if death resulted from respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518], the AE recorded should be “Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064]”, and the Outcome of the AE would be 
“Death”.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
record “ unexplained death” on the  AE CRF and SAE form . 
f. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History CRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of  the condition worsen s during the study. When recording such events on 
an AE CRF  and SAE form (if applicable) , it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has  changed by [CONTACT_672193] g applicable descriptors ( eg, “more frequent 
headaches”).  
g. Pulmonary Exacerbation   
Given the proposed mechanism of action of QR -010, it could be anticipated that subjects  will 
experience a change in baseline  cough, change in sputum qu ality, or change in sputum volume. 
A diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation should be considered if these symptoms are accompanied 
by [CONTACT_411], body weight loss, generalized malaise. If a pulmonary exacerbation is diagnosed, 
appropriate interventions including additional antibiotics should be prescribed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_415829]. Subjects diagnosed with a pulmonary exacerbation requiring the addition of 
antibiotics will be withdrawn from the study.  
h. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576470].  
i. Pregnancy  
If a f emale partner of a male subject  in the study becomes pregnant while her partner is receiving 
investigational therapy or within  [ADDRESS_908512] dose of study, a Pregnancy form  should 
be completed  and faxed to the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Department or its designee within [ADDRESS_908513]: QR -010

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Abortion, whether therapeutic , or spontaneous, will be reported on a Pregnancy Report form and 
faxed to the Sponsor according to the instructions in the Study Manual. If the abortion meets 
seriousness criteria (see Section  12.5, Serious  Adverse Event Definition), this information will 
be captured on the AE CRF  and SAE form.  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or to a female  partner of 
a male subject  exposed to the investigational product should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
j. Overdose Reporting  
Overdoses must be reported to the Sponsor on an AE CRF  and an SAE form for tracking 
purposes and will be considered a protoco l violation. Overdose is defined as any study drug  dose 
administered above the intended dose for the cohort assignment . Additional instructions 
for reporting overdose information will be provided by [CONTACT_672194].  
12.[ADDRESS_908514] , or precaution 
regardless of t he relationship to study drug. An SAE is any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening AE. This definition implies that the subject , in the view of the 
Investigator, is at immediate risk of death  from the event as it occurred.  It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 In-subje ct hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010], except for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672153]-dose sample collections  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial disruption 
of the subject ’s ability to conduct n ormal life functions)  
 Cong enital anomaly or birth defect.  This serious criterion applies if a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect is diagnosed in a child born to a  female subject, or a  female partner 
of a male subject  exposed to the investigational product.  
 Other important medical events . Medical and scientific judgment should determine 
whether an AE should be classified as serious in other situations, such as important 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], but may jeopardize the subject  or require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes l isted in the definition above. Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not result in in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependence or abuse.  
All A Es that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious A Es.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  The terms “severe” and  “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significa nce (such as severe headache). “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based o n 
subject  or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject ’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.

and reported on the SAE form . 
 All SAEs must be reported to the IRB/Independent Et hics Committee, if applicable. See 
ICH GCP E6, Section  4.11.1 . 
12.8 Expedited Reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
 The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all 
expedited SAEs ( ie, 7/15 Day S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during any clinical studies that are using 
the investigative compound. The Sponsor or its designee  shall also notify Central Ethics 
Committees and Central IRB of S[LOCATION_003]Rs or significant risks to subjects, per country

13.7 Safety Analys es 
13.7.1  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an event that was not present prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug and present after the first dose or if it represents the 
exacerbation of an event that was present prior to the first dose.  
AEs noted during the study will be coded to system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms 
(PTs)  using the MedDRA dictionary. The overall incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_672199]. Deaths, AE severity, seriousness, rel ationship to study 
drug and study discontinuation due to AE will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_7169] . An AE will be 
considered drug -related if the Investigator indicated the event is at least “possibly” related or if 
the relationship is missing. AEs with missi ng start dates, but with stop dates overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_576471]. All AEs will be listed in subject  listing , 
and summarized by [CONTACT_672200] . If a subject  reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most

will be summarized by [CONTACT_7169] , whenever possible,  in the following ways:  
 Descriptive statistics of actual results (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation,  
median, minimum, and maximum) for the continuous data and frequencies and 
percentages for the categorical data, for each time point  
 Descriptive statistics (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum) of change from baseline  to each time point  
 Shift tables summarizing the frequencies of subjects  below, within and above the normal 
ranges at baseline  and to maximum and to minimum value during treatment and after 
treatment will be presented .  
 Site local laboratories  were used; s ummar ies will be provided as units/ranges permit . 
13.7.5  Other Safety Assessments  
Other safety assessments, such as urinalysis, ECG s, and physical examination s will be 
summarized and listed as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
13.8 Pharmacokinetics Ana lyses  
To determine the PK profile of inhaled  administration s at the different dose levels  of QR-010, 
the following PK parameters will be calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
 Cmax: The maximum serum concentration will be taken directly  from the data.  
 Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.  
 T½: The terminal elimination half -life will be estimated by [CONTACT_105] -linear regression analysis 
of the terminal elimination slope , if feasible . 
 AUC 0-t: Area under the curve to the final sa mple with a concentration greater than lower 
limit of quantification (LLQ) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method.  
 AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration C last(obs) using formula : AUC 0-∞=AUC last+Clast(obs)/λz , if feasible . 
 CL: Serum  clearance will be estimate d using the formula: CL = Dose/ AUC 0-∞. 
Achievement of s teady state of the drug will be determined from trough levels.  
Exact procedure for imputation of data will be described in the SAP.  
All samples obtained from all cohorts will be analyzed to avoid bias in data presentation.

authorized to use the system in compliance with  the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  21CFR 
Part 11 , ICH GCP  and local regulations,  before recording data on eCRFs. All corrections to 
eCRFs will be made by [CONTACT_55795], and the changes will be automatically logged in the 
audit trail o f the system  (time and date stamps and the user entering or updating data) . 
eCRFs should be completed for every subject  screened or enrolled in the study . Each subject will 
be identified by a unique subject identifier (site number and subject number). At the study’s 
conclusion, a PDF file will be created for each site containing their subjects ’ data submitted on 
eCRFs. In the event of an audit or regulatory authority inspection, copi[INVESTIGATOR_672156].  
The Investigator will ensure that the eCRF s are accurate, complete, and completed in a timely 
fashion. The Investigator will ensure that source documents that are required to verify the 
validity and completeness of data transcribed on the eCRFs are never obliterated or destroyed. 
Separate source r ecords are require d to support all eCRF entries. The eCRF is not to be used to 
document data without prior written or electronic records.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects  and sites, a clinical data management 
review will be perfor med on subject  data. During this review, subject  data will be checked for 
consistency, omissions, a nd any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be reviewed for

management review process, data que ries will be sent to the site. Corrections or updates to the 
data resulting from queries should be ma de on the eCRF. All changes will be automatically 
documented in the software’s audit trail, including the reason  for change.  
The Investigator will  electronically  sign and date the  indicated places on the eCRF. These 
signatures will indicate that the Investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF and 
agrees with the content.  
A Sponsor  representative will con tact the Investigator(s) at periodic intervals by [CONTACT_672201] o f the study. CRFs, 
eCRFs, and subject  records will be reviewed at on -site visits at regular intervals throughout t he 
study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data ; 
and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have 
access to subject  medical records and other study -related rec ords needed to verify the entries on 
the CRFs and eCRF.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs/eCRF, are resolved.

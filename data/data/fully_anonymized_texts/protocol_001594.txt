Study Design This is a single-masked, two-arm, parallel-group, 
randomized-controlled, dispensing clinical trial. Up to 70 
subjects will be enrolled into the study with the aim of 
completing approximately 60 subjects .  The subjects will be randomized and fit (Visit 1) in  a study lens (Aurora  or 
DT1MF
) and wear the lens for 3±1 day then undergo 
optimization (Visit 2) and wea r the optimized pair for 
approximately 1 week (7±1 day) . At the follow-up visit (Visit 
3), study endpoints will be collected and subjects will be 
dispensed a fresh lens with th e same power as dispensed at 
Visit 2. Lenses will be worn for an additional week (7±1 d ay).  
At the follow- up visit (Visit 4) the study endpoints will be 
collected and the subject will be exited from the study. 
See the flow chart at the end of the synopsis table for the 
schematic of the study visits  and procedures of main 
observations (Figure 1).

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vi sual performance and subj ective responses of the 
JJVC Investigational Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_822311] a different manufacturing line.  
The last set of prototypes evaluated were manufactured on a different manufacturing line, 
however used a similar process that is being used on the new line.  The performance of these new lenses will be compared to a marketed product, Dailies Total 1

Control: Dailies Total 1®Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_19542] A material 
1.2. Intended Use of Inve stigational Products
All lenses are intended to correct spherical refractive error and presby[CONTACT_19555].  For this study both 
of the lenses will be worn as a daily disposable lens, with the lenses being discarded after a day of wear.  The Lenses will be fit in a randomized fashion. After fitting, each subject will 
return for an optimization visit and then a follow-up.   
1.3. Summary of Findings fr om Nonclinical Studies
All previous pre-clinical findi ngs were deemed satisfactory pr ior to proceeding with clinical
trials on humans. For the most comprehensiv e nonclinical information regarding the Test 
lenses refer to the latest version of the CR-[ADDRESS_1140167] presby[CONTACT_19555].  A listing of exam ples of adverse reactions is 
found in the section 13 of this protocol.  The investigator should follow normal clinical guidelines regarding examination and care of subjects who participate in this trial.  Refer to study lens package insert for additional details for the control lens and the Investigational Brochure (IB) for the Investigational lens.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES
2.1. Objectives 
Primary Objective:
The primary objective of this study is to eval uate the binocular visual performance (logMAR
acuity) and subjective vision respons es (CLUE Vision) with respect to the Aurora lens after 1-
week of optimized lens wear.
Secondary Objective:
The secondary objective of this study is to comp are the clinical performan ce of Aurora relative 
to DT1MF after 1-week of optimized lens wear with respect to binocular visual performance and subjective vision responses.  
2.2. Endpoints 
Primary  and Secondary Endpoints: Visual Performance (logMAR)
Visual Performance will be assessed binocularly at each 1-week follow-up evaluation under high luminance high contrast conditions. At distan ce (4 meters), VA is assessed using ETDRS 
Charts; while near (40 cm) and intermediate ( 64 cm) assessments will be made using reduced 
Guillon-Poling charts. See  in Appendix I for details 
regarding the collection of visual acuity (logMAR) visual ability.
Subjective Vision  
Subjective vision will be assessed using the Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE™) 
questionnaire at both the 1- and 2-week follow-up  evaluations. However, data collected at the 
1-week follow-up will be used to test primary hypot heses with respect to CLUE vision.  
CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcome s questionnaire to assess patient-experience 
attributes of soft, disposable contact [CONTACT_13276]  (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a 
contact-lens wearing population in  the US, ages 18-65.  Derived CLUE™ scores using Item 
Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distri bution with a population average score of 60 
(SD 20), where higher scores i ndicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-
120.  A 5-point increase in an average CLUE™ score translates into 10% shift in the 
distribution of scores for population of soft contact [CONTACT_13293].

2.3. Hypotheses
All primary and secondary hypothese s must be met in order to satisfy the objective of this 
study. 
Primary Hypotheses 
1. After approximately 1-week of wear in th e optimized lenses, the distance, binocular, 
high luminance, high contrast visual performance of the Test lens will be superior to 
0.[ADDRESS_1140172] lens will be non-inferior co mpared to that of the Control lens within 
the hyperopes .  A non-inferiority margin of -5 CLUE points will be used.

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
This is a single-masked, multi-site, two- arm, parallel-group, ra ndomized-controlled, 
dispensing clinical trial. Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled in this study with the aim of 
completing approximately 60. 
At Visit 1 (Day 0), eligible subjects will be randomized and fit into one of the study lenses
(test or control) in a bilatera l fashion. Subjects will be dispense d to wear the lenses for 3±1 day 
and return for Visit 2 to undergo optimization. S ubjects will be dispensed the study lenses and 
wear the optimized pair for approximately 1 week (7±1 days). At the follow-up visit (Visit 3) 
study endpoints will be measured, and a new study lens will be dispensed for the same lens 
type and power and will be worn for an approximately 1 week (7±1 days).  At the final follow-up visit (Visit 4) the study endpoints will be m easured, and the subject will be exited from the 
study. 
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
The study objectives are to assess and compare th e clinical performance of Aurora compared 
to DT1MF, therefore, 
atwo-arm parallel study wa s chosen as the design most optimal to 
evaluate the primary a nd secondary hypotheses.  
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration
A total of [ADDRESS_1140177] 2-3 months.

5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCATION AND MASKING
5.1. Test Article Allocation 
The study lenses will be worn in a bilateral an d random fashion using a 2- arm parallel design. 
A computer-generated randomization scheme wi ll be used to randomly assign subjects, in 
blocks of 2, to one of the two possible study lenses: Aurora or DT1MF . The randomization 
scheme will be st ratified by [CONTACT_3725]. The random scheme w ill be generated using the PROC PLAN 
procedure from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Software Versi on 9.4 or higher (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC).[ADDRESS_1140178] occurred prior to
randomization: 
ͻInformed consent must have been obtained.  
ͻThe subject must have met all eligibility criteria.
ͻThe subject’s screening and baseline info rmation must have been collected.
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
lens fitting schedule .
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appr opriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability Log in the “Dispensed” section. 
5.2. Masking
This is a single-masked study. Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask 
should be broken only if specific emergency treat ment/course of action would be dictated by 
[CONTACT_169762]. In  such cases, the Investigator may, in an 
emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  In th e event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must 
be informed as soon as possible. The date , time, and reason for the unmasking must be 
documented in the subject record. The Investigat or is also advised not to reveal the study 
treatment assignment to the clini cal site or Sponsor personnel.  
Subjects who have had their tr eatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced.

5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
The test articles mask shall not be broken unl ess information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject. The Sponsor must be notified before
the mask is broken. 
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule/randomization sc heme to obtain the test article assignment for that 
subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme if applicable
Investigator or designee will pull the appropria te test articles from th e study supply. All test 
articles that are opened, whether dispensed (place d/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical 
site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability Log in the “Dispensed”
section.

6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJVC will provide the Investigator with suffici ent quantities of study ar ticles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The I nvestigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test article accountability records. 
Test articles must be ke pt in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Dele gation Log. All test articles mu st be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.  
2. What was returned to the Investigator  unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785]. 
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements. 
The Investigator will collect all unused test artic les from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be se parated from the clinical study 
inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monitor will return all unused  test articles to JJVC.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment  documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

11. STUDY TERMINATION
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agen t cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the even t of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled. 
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_822304]’s results are compromised. 
JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_35511], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
CR-6468, v 2.0  
Page 53 of 201JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC ) refers to any written, electr onic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical  operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquirie s reported via “Subjective Qu estionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site.
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs. 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
Within [ADDRESS_1140245] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorde d in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
xWho received the complaint. 
xStudy number. 
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
xLot number(s). 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s). 
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject). 
xOD/OS indication, along with whet her the lens was inserted. 
xAny related AE number if applicable. 
CR-6468, v 2.0  
Page 54 of 201JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
xConfirmation of product availa bility for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follo w section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications

suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of  test article, study tr eatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additiona l therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional ther apy or alteratio n of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of st udy treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the c ondition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse ev ents at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. All adverse events occurring while the subject  is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
CR-6468, v 2.0  
Page 58 of 201JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xDrawings or photographs (where appropri ate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.). 
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, se verity, and relationship to te st articles, as applicable. 
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropriate), including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. 
xAny referral to another hea lth care provider if needed. 
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any). 
xLikely etiology. 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the ev ent and upon conclusion of the 
event, if the AE is related to the visual system.
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visu al system or not), an AE review form 
must be completed. Additiona l dated and initialed entries should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have retu rned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatme nt beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be  the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Inves tigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedur es, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolu tion of the adverse event or un til referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are not related to the test artic le, study treatment, or study pro cedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up.

The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for an y serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report w ill comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adve rse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail or telephone, but no  later than [ADDRESS_1140248] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/s ignificant adverse event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomizati on code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unm asking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and medical judgment for colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article. 
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_1140249] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1140250]. 
Non-Serious Adverse EventsAll non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.

13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Resp onsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events  to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.5. Event of Special Interest
None 
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pre gnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual  acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be  implemented in this c linical trial is outlined 
below.  
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
[ADDRESS_1140251]/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis. Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be excluded from the statistical analysis.
Summary tables (Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety  variables as appropriate. Continuous variables 
will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subj ects or eyes within each 
category will be provided for categorical data.
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_618420] (Aurora and DT1MF) and time 
point (Baseline, fitting, 3-Day follow-up, 1-week  follow-up and 2-week follow-up) and will 
be performed separately by [CONTACT_19587] (Safety Population and Pe r-Protocol Population, 
when appropriate).

14.2. Sample Size Justification
This study was designed and powered to  test for superiority of the Aurora lens after 1-week of 
optimized lens wear with respect to binocular HLHC visual performance at distance, 
intermediate and near. Additiona lly, this study was powered to te st non-inferiority of Aurora 
relative to DT1MF with respect to visual performance at distance (4m) after 1-week of lens wear. 
Historical data from one study was utilized in  the sample size calc ulation. Clinical study, 
was a 2x3 crossover designs with 1-week follow-up evaluation for the optimized lens 
wear.
11,13However, for the sample size estimate fo r this study, only data from period 1 was 
utilized. Table 6 below summaries the historical data by [CONTACT_77433].

Based on the table above a total of at least [ADDRESS_1140252] will be targeted to 
be enrolled in this study to th e aim of 60 to complete.   
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: 
All subjects who were administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded. 
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfu lly completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_89632] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justif ication of excluding subjects with  protocol deviations in the
per-protocol population set will be documented in a memo to file. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:All randomized subjects regardless of actual trea tment and subsequent withdrawal from study 
or deviation from protocol. At leas t one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statis tical Significance
Primary and secondary hypothese s will be tested using a ga te keepi[INVESTIGATOR_63966]. Primary 
endpoints will be tested using a familywise error rate of 5%. Al l primary hypotheses must be 
met in order to test the sec ondary hypothesis. A Bonferroni co rrection will be utilized for the 
adjustment of multiple endpoints within each  the primary hypothese s. All primary and 
secondary hypotheses must be met in order to test any exploratory hypotheses.  
14.5. Primary Analysis  
While a simple t-test was utilized for the sample size calculations to test all primary and secondary hypotheses, the primary and secondary  analyses will perform the hypotheses tests 
by a t-test using a model-base d approach with the Kenward and Roger degrees of freedom. 
Given the size of our historical data (N=67 Hype ropes) the historical sample was large enough 
for a simple t-test to provide an accurate approximation of the sample size estimates. Therefore, since the sample size estimates are valid, and th is study aims to complete [ADDRESS_1140253] approach.   
All primary analysis w ill be conducted on the intent-to-treat population.  
Visual Performance (logMAR)
Binocular HLHC visual performance will be analyzed using a linear mixed model for repeated 
measures. Lens type, distance (distance, intermediate and near), timepoint and all possible interactions between lens type, distance and timepoint will be included in the model as fixed effects. Other subject characteristics such as age or ADD power may be included as covariates 
when appropriate. Site and subject nested within site will be included as random effects (G-side). The covariance between repeated measurements within a subject across distance will be

There will not be an interim analysis performed on this study.  
14.9. Procedure for Handling Mi ssing Data and Drop-Outs
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of mi ssing values will be included 
in the summary tables and listings. 
Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of missing data in this clinical trial. 
Past clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not-at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data , sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than the 10%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with a parametric regression method used to ma ke at least 50 imputations.
14.10.Procedure for Reporting Devi ations from Statistical Plan
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in above sections. There are no known reasons for which it is planned to deviate fr om these analysis methods. If for any reason 
a change is made, the change will be documented in the study re port along with a justification 
for the change.

WARNINGS
Advise patients of the following warnings pertaining to 
contact [CONTACT_13279]:
• Problems with contact [CONTACT_288813]. It is essential that patients follow their eye care professional’s directions and all labeling instructions for proper use of lenses and lens care products. 
Serious eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can 
develop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_145908].
• Daily wear lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and 
patients should be instructed not to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Clinical study results have shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when contact [CONTACT_288814]
2.
• Studies2 have shown that contact [CONTACT_288815] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than 
nonsmokers.
• If a patient experiences eye discomfort, foreign body 
sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the 
eye, the patient should be instructed to immediately remove 
lenses and promptly contact [CONTACT_288816]. It is recommended that contact [CONTACT_288817].
PRECAUTIONS
To prevent damage to the eyes or to the contact [CONTACT_13276], the 
following precautions should be taken:
Special Precautions for the Eye Care Professional
Due to the small number of patients enrolled in the clinical investigation of lenses, all refractive powers, design 
configurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material 
are not evaluated in significant numbers. Consequently when 
selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the eye care professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, central and peripheral thickness and optic 
zone diameter.
The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular 
health should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for 
refractive correction; therefore the continuing ocular health of the patient and lens performance on the eye should be carefully evaluated on initial dispensing and monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_288818].
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses 
are on the patient’s eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and 
become discolored. Whenever fluorescein is used, the eyes should be flushed thoroughly with sterile saline solution that is recommended for in eye use prior to inserting lenses. Avoid dispensing saline from an aerosol can directly into the eye.
• Patients who wear contact [CONTACT_288819]. Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each patient.
• Before leaving the eye care professional’s office, the patient 
should be able to promptly remove their lenses or should have someone else available who can remove their lenses for them.
• Eye care professionals should instruct the patient to remove 
the lenses immediately if the eye becomes red or irritated.
• Routine eye examinations are necessary to help assure the 
continued health of the patient’s eyes. Eye care professionals 
should make arrangements with the patient for appropriate 
follow-up visits. Alcon recommends that patients see their eye 
care professional once each year, or more often, as recommended by [CONTACT_288820].• Diabetics may have reduced corneal sensitivity and thus are 
more prone to corneal injury and do not heal as quickly or completely as non-diabetics.
• Visual changes or changes in lens tolerance may occur during 
pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives. Caution patients accordingly.
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients 
about the following safety precautions:
Handling Precautions
• Be sure that before leaving the eye care professional’s office 
the patient is able to promptly remove lenses or have someone else available to remove them.
• Good hygiene habits help promote safe and comfortable lens 
wear. Always wash, rinse and thoroughly dry hands with a lint-free towel before handling lenses.
• REMOVE A LENS IMMEDIATELY if an eye becomes red or 
irritated.
• Always handle lenses carefully. Never use tweezers or other 
sharp objects such as fingernails to remove lenses from the lens container unless specifically indicated for that use.
• Do not use if blister package is damaged or not sealed 
completely. This may result in product contamination which 
can lead to a serious eye infection.
• Ensure that the correct lens for each eye is available. Shake 
the blister pack gently prior to opening. Remove the lens from 
the blister pack by [CONTACT_288821]. Ensure the lens is right side out. Inspect 
lenses prior to insertion. Do not insert damaged lenses.
• To insert lenses:
- Wash and rinse hands thoroughly and dry completely with a 
clean, lint free towel before handling lenses.
- Place a lens on the tip of your clean and dry right or left 
index finger, place the middle finger of the same hand close 
to lower eyelashes and pull down the lower eyelid.
- Use the fingers of the other hand to lift the upper eyelid.
- Place the lens directly on the eye (cornea) and gently roll 
finger away from the lens.
- Look down and slowly remove the hand, releasing the 
lower lid.
- Look straight ahead and slowly remove the other hand, 
releasing the upper lid.
- Blink gently.
• To remove lenses:
- Wash and rinse hands thoroughly and dry completely with a 
clean, lint free towel before handling lenses. Make sure 
hands are clean and completely dry.
- Blink fully several times.
- While looking up, slide the lens down onto the white part of 
the eye.
- Remove the lens by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_288766]. Do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_288767].
- If the lens is difficult to grasp, dry fingers once more and try 
again. Do not use rewetting drops in this instance.
• 
If a lens decenters on the eye, it may be possible to recenter it by:
- Closing the eye and massaging the lens into place, or- Looking in the direction of the lens and blinking gently, or- Gently pushing the off-centered lens onto the cornea with 
light finger pressure on the edge of the upper or lower 
eyelid.
• If a lens tears in the eye it will feel uncomfortable. Advise 
wearers it is impossible to lose a contact [CONTACT_288822] a 
contact [CONTACT_288823]. Lens pi[INVESTIGATOR_288768], 
carefully avoiding pi[INVESTIGATOR_288769]. If the lens pi[INVESTIGATOR_288770], rinsing with saline is 
recommended. If this does not help, the wearer should contact [CONTACT_288824].
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• Patients should never exceed the prescribed wearing schedule 
regardless of how comfortable the lenses feel. Doing so may 
increase the risk of adverse effects.
• The lens should move freely on the eye at all times. If the lens 
sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions in the Care for a Sticking Lens section. If 
non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should be 
instructed to consult their eye care professional immediately.
• The eye care professional should be consulted about wearing 
lenses during water sports and water related activities. 
Exposure to water or other non-sterile liquids while wearing

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
contact [CONTACT_145940], water skiing, and 
hot tubs may increase the risk of ocular infection, including 
but not limited to Acanthamoeba keratitis. 
• Never allow contact [CONTACT_288825]-sterile liquids (including tap water and saliva) as microbial contamination can occur, which may lead to permanent eye damage.
• Eye irritation, infection, or lens damage may result if 
cosmetics, lotion, soap, cream, hair spray, deodorant, aerosol products or foreign particles come in contact [CONTACT_288826]. 
• Environmental fumes, smoke, and vapors should be avoided in 
order to reduce the chance of lens contamination or physical trauma to the cornea.
• Lenses should be disposed of each day upon removal from the 
eye.
• Discard any lens which has become dehydrated or damaged. 
Replace with a sterile, fresh, new lens.
• Note the correct lens power for each eye to prevent getting 
them mixed up.
• Always carry spare lenses with you or have back-up 
spectacles available.
• Do not share lenses with anyone as this may spread 
micro-organisms which could result in serious eye health problems.
• Do not use lenses beyond their expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].
Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Periodic eye examinations are extremely important for contact 
[CONTACT_19554]. Schedule and conduct appropriate follow-up examinations to determine ocular response. Alcon 
recommends that patients see their eye care professional 
once each year or as recommended by [CONTACT_288820].
• Certain medications may cause dryness of the eye, increased 
lens awareness, lens intolerance, and blurred vision or visual 
changes. These include, but are not limited to, antihistamines, 
decongestants, diuretics, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion sickness. Caution patients using such medications accordingly and prescribe proper remedial measures.
• Visual changes or changes in lens tolerance may occur during 
pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives. Caution patients accordingly.
Who Should Know that the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]:• Patients should inform their health care practitioners that they 
are wearing contact [CONTACT_13276].
• Patients should inform their employers that they are wearing 
contact [CONTACT_13276]. Some jobs may require the use of eye protection equipment or may require that contact [CONTACT_288827].
It is strongly recommended that patients be provided with a copy 
of the DAILIES TOTAL1
® and DAILIES TOTAL1® Multifocal 
(delefilcon A) Contact [CONTACT_288828].
WATER ACTIVITIES
Do not expose contact [CONTACT_35551].
Warning:Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe 
infection, vision loss or blindness. If lenses have been submersed 
in water when showering or swimming, discard them and replace with a new pair. Ask the Eye Care Professional for 
recommendations about wearing lenses during any activity 
involving water.
ADVERSE EFFECTS
Patients should be instructed to check eyes regularly to make sure they look well, feel comfortable and vision is 
clear. Potentially serious complications are usually 
accompanied by [CONTACT_288829]:
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830]• Foreign body sensation• Excessive watering or other eye secretions including 
mucopurulent discharge
• Redness of the eyes• Photophobia (light sensitivity)• Burning, stinging or itching or other pain associated with the 
eyes
• Comfort is less compared to when the lens was first placed on 
eye
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision)• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects• Feeling of dryness
WHAT TO DO IF A PROBLEM OCCURS
Patients should be instructed that if any of the above signs or symptoms are noticed, he or she should:  
• IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENSES.
• If the discomfort or problem stops, discard the lens and 
replace it with a new one.
• If the discomfort or problem continues after removing 
lens(es) or upon insertion of a new lens, IMMEDIATELY 
remove the lens(es) and contact [CONTACT_288831].
• The patient should be informed that a serious condition 
such as corneal ulcer, infection, corneal vascularization, or iritis may be present, and may progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Less serious reactions such as abrasions, infiltrates, and 
bacterial conjunctivitis must be managed and treated 
carefully to avoid more serious complications.
• Additionally, contact [CONTACT_288832]. These include but are not limited to local or 
generalized corneal edema, epi[INVESTIGATOR_86159], epi[INVESTIGATOR_288771], infiltrates, neovascularization, endothelial polymegathism, tarsal papi[INVESTIGATOR_288772], conjunctival injection or iritis.

LENS WEAR & REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES
DAILY WEAR (less than 24 hours, while awake):
• To avoid tendency of the daily wear patient to over-wear the 
lenses initially, stress the importance of adhering to a proper, 
initial wearing schedule. Normal daily wear of lenses assumes a minimum of 6 hours of non lens wear per 24 hour period. 
• It may be advisable for patients who have never worn contact 
[CONTACT_288835] a wearing schedule that 
gradually increases wearing time over a few days. This allows 
more gradual adaptation of the ocular tissues to contact [CONTACT_94638].
• The maximum daily wearing time should be determined by [CONTACT_288836]’s physiological 
eye condition because individual responses to contact [CONTACT_288837]. There may be a tendency for patients to over-wear the 
lenses initially. The eye care professional should stress the 
importance of adhering to the initial maximum wearing 
schedule. Studies have not been conducted to show that delefilcon A contact [CONTACT_288838], therefore patients should be advised to remove their lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Normal daily wear of lenses assumes a 
minimum of 6 hours of non-lens wear per 24 hour period. 
Optimum individual wearing schedule will vary.
• Delefilcon A contact [CONTACT_288839] (daily 
disposable wear) and then discarded at the end of each 
wearing period. The patient should be instructed to start the next wearing period with a fresh new lens.
EMERGENCY LENS CARECleaning and disinfection of daily disposable lenses is not recommended. The patient should be reminded to have replacement lenses or back-up spectacles available at all times.
CARE FOR A STICKING LENS
If the lens sticks (stops moving) or begins to dry on the eye, 
instruct the patient to apply several drops of a recommended lubricating solution (used in accordance with package labeling). The patient should wait until the lens begins to move freely on 
the eye before attempting to remove it. It is important that the 
patient wash and dry their hands thoroughly before removing the 
lens. If the lens continues to stick, the patient should 
IMMEDIATELY consult the eye care professional.
IN OFFICE USE OF TRIAL LENSES
Eye care professionals should educate contact [CONTACT_288840].
Each contact [CONTACT_288841] a blister pack containing 
phosphate buffered saline solution.  Hands should be thoroughly washed and rinsed and dried with a lint-free towel prior to 
handling a lens. In order to ensure sterility, the blister pack should not be opened until immediately prior to use. For fitting 
and diagnostic purposes lenses should be disposed of after a single use and not be re-used from patient to patient.
EMERGENCIES
The patient should be informed that if chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) are splashed into the eyes, the patient should: 
flush eyes immediately with tap water or fresh saline solution and immediately contact [CONTACT_288842] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288773].

and well-being of participants and site staff. If, at any time, a participant’s safety is considered to be at risk, 
study intervention will be di scontinued, and study follow-up will be c onducted as outlined in the protocol.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional risks liste d below need to be considered for study participants 
and study personnel:
Additional Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:
xThe possible transmission of the Coronavirus i nfection and consequent complications, beyond the 
risk of adverse events due to the investigational device and/or procedures. 
xThe risk may be higher in an optometric clinical study because of the close contact [CONTACT_822316] (since the investigatormust make the measurements close to the subject’s face) and, in addition the need for multiple follow-up visits/exams which may expose the subject to other patients and/or healthcare professionals who might be transmitting the virus, even if they do not have symptoms.
xPotential disruptions to the study may be necessary due to current or future pandemic-related 
emergency restrictions, which may lead to delays in scheduled follow-up visits.
xSubjects experiencing an adverse event related to contact [CONTACT_126134]-[ADDRESS_1140266] contracted COVID-19 during participation in a study, he/she will be 
discontinued from the study a nd followed until COVID-19 Adverse Event (AE) resolution.
To help minimize the above potential risks, JJVCI recommend reviewing/complying with local, state, 
and governmental guidance for COVID-19 risks. 
JJVCI will provide the following study specific docum ents with language pert aining to COVID-19 risks:
4.1.1 Informed Consent :  
Will include information concerning the study-associated risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic

Page 3 of 11  STUDY ASSOCIATED RISKS RELATED TO COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) PANDEMIC
It is important to note that this study will be conducted, at least in part, during the COVID-[ADDRESS_1140267] for you. This is pa rticularly impo rtant for this 
study due, in part, to the closeness of the doctor during the study examinations. 
The potential effects of the disease are not fully known, at this time, and may include long-term serious health 
consequences. In severe cases, this may result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death. Based on current knowledge from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include 
older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. 
During this study, all appropriate measures will be taken to minimize risks including the use of personal protective 
equipment such as masks and gloves, as well as proper sanitization.  This is in conformance to guidance from the 
CDC, local health departments, and the state and county in which the study doctor’s office is located. However, 
these measures may not complete ly eliminate the risks associat ed with contracting COVID-19. 
If you are found to have contracted COVID-19 or feel ill with flu-like symptoms during participation in the study, 
you will not be permitted to continue in-office study follow- up visits, but you will re ceive instructions and your 
condition will be monitored by [CONTACT_35586]/or study staff.   
4.1.[ADDRESS_1140268] (Attachment-B): 
Will include COVID-[ADDRESS_1140269] JJVCI clinical 
studies. The risk controls are consistent with CDC, AOA, AAO Guidance. The Principal
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5972]/sign the study specific checklist prior to the Site Initiation Meeting.
4.1.3 Protocol Compliance Investigator(s) Signature [CONTACT_3490]:  
Will include a statement in dicating that the Principal Investigator  (PI) agrees to conduct the study 
in compliance with all local, state, and governmental guidance’s for COVID-[ADDRESS_1140270] read the suggested guida nce provided by [CONTACT_19610]-19 risk mitigation,
(COVID-19 Work Instruction in the Appendix of this protocol). I agree to conduct this study in 
compliance with local, state, governmental guidance for COVID-19 risks.
4.1.4 Study Site Initiation Training Slides:  
Will include suggestions to help  mitigate potential transmission of COVID-19. Suggestions may 
include maintaining social distancing in the clinical site by [CONTACT_35587],
wearing proper PPEs, frequent disinfection, and installing shields on the slit lamp and other applicable equipment. 
5.[ADDRESS_1140271] VISITS
Potential disruptions to the study may be necessary due  to current or future pandemic-related emergency 
restrictions. Possible disruption of the study as a result of COVID-19 control measures may lead to delays 
in scheduled follow-up visits.
Subjects may be delayed in being seen for study follow up visit(s), for example due to COVID-[ADDRESS_1140272]’s concerns or fears about COVID-[ADDRESS_1140273] during remote assessments may include:

time of the day the subject typi[INVESTIGATOR_822305], the number of days per week 
lenses were worn, and the number of consecutive days the subject 
didn’t wear the study lenses, etc.
The discussion with the subject will be documented in  EDC under Tele-Visit and a minor protocol  deviation 
will be noted. If during the telephone consultation, a s ubject states he/she wishes to discontinue participating 
in the study, instruct the subject to stop wearing the study lenses and schedule the subject to return to the 
clinic for a Final Evaluation at the at earliest possible time. Subjects should return all unused lenses to the 
clinic at the last visit.
Changes in study visit schedules, missed visits, or participant discontinuations may lead to missing data, 
including data related to protocol-specified procedures. Case report forms should capture specific information regarding the basis of missing data, i ncluding the relationship to the COVID-[ADDRESS_1140275] DURING PANDEMIC
It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on the conduct of this clinical study due to, for example, self-isolation/quarantine by [CONTACT_19611]-site personnel; travel restrictions/limited access to public places, in cluding Optometry Clinics; and changes in clinic 
procedures required to address the COVID-19 challenge.
Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments for study participants, including 
follow-up. However, if scheduled visits cannot be conducted in person at the study site it is suggested that 
assessments be performed to the extent possible remotely/virtually or delayed until such time that on-site 
visits can be resumed in order to continue partic ipant monitoring in accordance with the protocol where 
possible. At each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint 
assessments should be performed if required and as feasible.
Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation 
with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical 
trial management system for protocol deviations. Inte rruptions of test article wear or discontinuations of 
study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19-
related” in the case report form (CRF).

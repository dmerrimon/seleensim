Study Number  W-4873 -201 
Title of Study  A Phase II, Randomized, Double -Blind, Multicenter, Comparative Study to Determine  the 
Safety , Tolerability, pharmacokinetics  and Efficacy of Oral Nafithromycin Versus Oral 
Moxifloxacin in the Treatment of Community -Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP)  in 
Adults  
Study Centers 
(Planned)  Approximately [ADDRESS_256390] worldwide; its associated age -standardized death rate was 41.7 per 
100,000 population in 2013. The global incidence of pneumonia is estimate d to be between 1.5 
and 14.0 cases per 1000 person -years, varying by [CONTACT_11338], season, and patient characteristics. 
Short -term mortality (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30 -day mortality) for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213561] 4.0% to 18.0%. Costs related to CABP are high, and few approaches (such as 
reducing the length -of-stay, adequate use of antibiotics, and the introduction of vaccines) have 
reduced these costs to date. Streptococcus pneumoniae  remains the most common pathogen of 
CABP worldwide, independent of age. Other frequent causes of CABP include Haemophilus 
influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , Staphylococcus aureus , and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213562] (including 
Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila and Legionella  spp.). 
A major therapeutic challenge impacting the treatment of CABP is the widespread resistance of 
S. pneumoniae  to ß-lactam (especially penicillins and cephalosporins) and macrolide 
antibiotics. For example, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae  macrolide resi stance on a global 
scale is estimated to be 25 % to 40%, varying by [CONTACT_11338]. The prevalence of multidrug -resistant 
(MDR) S. pneumoniae  is also worrisome. For example, in the US, a recent analysis of 1498 
clinical pneumococci strains collected between 2012 an d 2013 found that 21.0% were MDR. 
Community -acquired MDR S. pneumoniae  poses treatment challenges for outpatient 
CABP―most notably the lack of effective oral antibacterial options―because of resistance to 
the most commonly -used oral penicillins, cephalospo rins, and/or macrolides. Failure of therapy 
due to resistance will continue to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of CABP, and 
treatment failures of mild disease will result in increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213563].  
Nafithromycin (previously known as WCK 4873) is an intravenous (IV) and oral antibacterial 
agent of the ketolide class that is structurally related to the macrolide class. Diverse in vitro, in 
vivo, preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety studies have  provided strong scientific 
evidence of the therapeutic potential of nafithromycin for difficult -to-treat respi[INVESTIGATOR_213564] -resistant (MDR) pathogens, including CABP. Preclinical 
studies have shown that nafithromycin has pote nt activity against macrolide - and ketolide -
resistant strains of S. pneumoniae  and Group A streptococci. Additionally, nafithromycin is 
active against other important CABP pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella 
catarrhalis , and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213565].  
The ketolide class of antibiotics provides a convenient orally -administered and effective 
therapeutic option for pneumococci, streptococci, and multiple Gram -negative respi[INVESTIGATOR_46264]. Innovative structural modifications among newer ketolides pr ovide them with 
several distinguishing features such as high -affinity binding to domain V and domain II of the 
23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid  (rRNA ) target, in contrast to macrolides that bind only to 
domain V. Such dual -target binding by [CONTACT_213659] (1) erm gene -encoded methylases (macrolide, lincosamide and 
streptogramin B [MLS B]-type resistance, involving methylation of the 23 rRNA target), (2) 
point mutations within rRNA domain V and (3) d iverse mutations in ribosomal proteins L -[ADDRESS_256391] pathogens―especially respi[INVESTIGATOR_213566] ―would help address this unmet need.  
In all, nafithromycin is expected to have the following advantages over older , available 
macrolides based on data from in vivo, in vitro and preclinical studies conducted to date:  
1. Mechanism -based activ ity potential against macrolide - and ketolide -resistant
pneumococci and Group A streptococci
2. Excellent target -organ -tissue concentra tion leading to:
a. Enabling potent activity vs. MDR pathogens in vivo
b. Once -a-day dosing convenience
c. Potential for s horter duration of therapy
3. Minimal CYP inhibition leading to ease of co -administration of other drugs
4. Favorable hepatic safety potential owing to favorable drug disposition resulting from
lower accumulation in liver
5. Comprehensive coverage of all key CABP pathogens, including atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213567] s:

findings related to infection (i.e., cough) requiring non -antibiotic ancillary 
treatment (e.g ., expectorant).  
o Clinical Failure: Requires alternative rescue antibacterial treatment for CABP
prior to the assessment (EOT or TOC) related to progression or worsening of
CABP symptoms, development of infectious complications of CABP (e.g.,

Safety  Endpoints : 
Safety evaluation is based  on TEAEs, clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs , physical 
examination findings and electrocardiograms ( ECG s) collected  during the study . 
Study Design  This is a Phase II prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1:1), double -blind, 
comp arative efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK study of oral nafithromycin versus oral 
moxifloxacin for treatment of  male and female  adults with CABP. Study drug is defined as oral 
nafithromycin or oral moxifloxacin.  
Subjects providing informed consent and  meeting all study eligibility criteria will be enrolled 
in the study and randomized into the study in a 1:1:1 ratio to either of the following 3 treatment 
arms:  
 Arm A : Nafithromycin 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) PO q24h for 3 days;
subjects will receive matching placebo (two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO
q24h) on Days 4 through Day 7 , and one moxifloxacin placebo  capsule  PO q24h 
on Days 1 through 7,  to maintain the blind
 Arm B : Nafithromycin 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) PO q24h for 5 days;
subjects will receive matching placebo (two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO
q24h) on Day 6 and Day 7 , and one moxifloxacin placebo  capsule  PO q24h on
Days 1 through 7, to maintain the blind
 Arm C : Moxifloxacin 400 mg (one 400 mg capsule ) PO q24h  for 7 days ;
subjects will also receive two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO q24h on Days [ADDRESS_256395] dose of the study drug. Block randomization using an 
Protocol W-4873-201

Version 1.0, 10 May 2016 
interactive voice/web response system (IXRS), stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US vs. ex -US) and 
Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team ( PORT ) Risk Class (II vs. III/IV) , will be used to  assign 
subjects (1:1:1) to Arm A, Arm B, or Arm C. Enrolment of PORT Risk Class II will be capped 
at 50% and enrolment of subjects with allowed prior systemic antibiotic use will be capped 
initially at 25%  (subject to change during study conduct) . Study D ay [ADDRESS_256396] administered, and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_213660].  
Subjects may be treated in the study as inpatients or outpatients based on their clinical 
condition, at the discretion of the Investigator ; however, only oral study drug will be 
administered (i.e., parental moxifloxacin will not be administered). Subjects will be assessed 
daily by [CONTACT_213661] 1 and Day 5, whether being treated for  CABP in the 
inpatient or outpatient setting. Investigators will assess for clinical outcome at Day 7 (EOT), 
and TOC (Day 15  ± 3 days). Vital signs, physical exam, assessment of CABP symptom 
severity, and other study procedures are detailed in Table 3-1. A FU visit will be conducted on 
Day 31 ±[ADDRESS_256397] or by [CONTACT_213662]; otherwise, the visit must be conducted in person . 
Rationale for moxifloxacin as a comparator : 
Moxifloxacin is a member of the fluoroqui nolone class of antibiotics. It is active against most 
CABP pathogens including macrolide - and penicillin -resistant S. pneumoniae , Gram -negative 
bacteria, and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213574]. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_213575], especially in 
subjects admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], is consistent with current US ( Infectious Diseases Society of 
America [IDSA]/American Thoracic Society [ATS] ) and European ( The Task Force of the 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_213576]  [ESCMID ]) therapeutic guidelines. The recommended 
dose (IDSA/ATS) is 400 mg once daily for 7 -14 days, and in this study , a 7-day regimen will 
be used.  
Rationale for 800 mg of nafithromycin once daily : 
Preclinical PK conducted in rodent and non -rodent species and Phase I clinical studies have 
shown optimal PK profile commensurate to the once -a-day dosing potential of nafithromycin. 
Administration of multiple -ascending oral doses (600 mg, 800 mg, and 1000  mg) of 
nafithromycin to humans was well tolerated. No serious adverse events have been reported for 
any dose in clinical studies conducted to date. On average, steady state of plasma 
concentrations was achieved at Day 3 -4 of multiple dosing.  
Rationale of therapeutic treatment duration with nafithromycin of 3 days and 5 days : 
Nafithromycin attained a geometric mean T ½ of approximately 11 h in steady state at 800 
mg/day in healthy human subjects (steady state was achieved on average within 3 -4 days over 
the 600 to 1000 mg/d dose range). In addition, significant accumulation of nafithromycin in 
polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) was observed.  
Furthermore, superior tissue penetration observed in rodents ― particularly in the target organ 
(lung) ― is expected to dri ve superior pharmacodynamic ( PD) activity, enabling a shorter 
duration of therapy of 3 to 5 days.  
A multiple dose study was conducted to compare plasma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_71444] (ELF) and 
alveolar macrophage (AM) concentrations of nafithromycin (800 mg admi nistered once daily 
for 3 days) in healthy adult subjects. Each subject underwent one standardized bronchoscopy 
with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 3, 6, 9, 12, [ADDRESS_256398] oral dose of 
nafithromycin. Concentrations of nafithromycin were si gnificantly higher in ELF and AM than 
simultaneous plasma concentrations throughout the 48 h period after 3 days of once -daily 
dosing. The ratios of ELF to plasma concentrations and of AM to plasma concentrations based 
the mean AUC 0-24 values were 13.8 and  527, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling : 
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from all subject s on Day 3 and Day 4  at sites 
Protocol W-4873-201 
Page 7 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016 
where PK sampling is possible . Time points for PK sample collection will be:  
 Pre-dose: pre -dose PK sample will be collected within 10 minutes before dosing.
 Post-dose at 2 -4 h (Day 3) and 24 -28 h (Day 4).  Subjects  who have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213577] a post -dose PK sample at 6 -10 h (Day 3).

(criteria provided  in Section 16.1.5)
This study is not powered for inferential statistical analyses. All data will be summarized 
separately by [CONTACT_5349] (nafithromycin for 3 days, nafithromycin for 5 days, and 
moxif loxacin). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be presented for continuous variables.  Frequency distributions (counts and 
percentages) will be presented for categorical variables. All summaries will be prese nted within 
each treatment group. The 95% confidence intervals, obtained using the Clopper -Pearson 
method, for the proportions of subjects with a favorable response in each treatment group will 
be presented.  
Safety : Safety data will be summarized  for the Safety population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who received any amount of study drug, analyzed according to the 
treatment received.  The subject incidence of serious adverse events ( SAEs ), including deaths 
and discontinuations due to adverse events ( AEs) will be presented by [CONTACT_213667] (MedDRA®), 
relationship to study drug, and severity.   
PK: The PK data acquisition and analysis strategy entails the use of a sparse PK sampling 
schedule. Efforts will be made to obtain PK samples from all subject s at sites where PK 
sampling is possible . Plasma concentrations of nafithromycin will be listed for each subject in 
the PK Population. Nafithromycin plasma conc entration data, along with other information 
including demographic data, will be combined with appropriate data from other clinical studies 
and analyzed using a population PK approach and reported separately.

e FU is to be conducted on Day 31 ±[ADDRESS_256404] or by [CONTACT_213668] ( Section 13 .2.2) and had no AEs or clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities noted at or after the TOC visit; otherwise, the 
visit must be conducted in person. 
f Written and signed informed consent must be obtained before any protocol assessment is performed. 
g Complete physical exam―consisting of general ap pearance, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, extremities, lymph nodes, vascular, and 
neurological exams―will be conducted at Screening and daily between Day 1 and Day 5 (whether inpatient or outpatient), EOT, and TOC. As part of the complete 
physical exam, the I nvestigator should assess the severity of the subject’s CABP symptoms of dyspnea, cough, production of purulent sputum, and pleuritic chest pain, based 
upon the CABP Symptom Severity Guidance for Investigator Assessment in Appendix III. 
h Vital signs―including body temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry―will be collected at Screening and daily 
between Day 1 and Day 5 (whether inpatient or outpatient), EOT, and TOC. Height, weight, and creatinine clearance (CrCl) will also be collected at the Screening Visit. 
i A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening, Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and EOT. A 12-lead ECG will be performed at TOC or FU if prior ECG(s) showed any clinically-
significant abnormality (Sections  11.9 and 11.10 ).   
j Subjects must have a confirmatory CXR or chest CT scan consistent with acute bacterial pneumonia within 48 h prior to randomization. 
k Subjects with a PORT score of 51 to 105 (PORT Risk Class of II, III or IV) are eligible for enrolment ( Appendix II ). 
l At Screening, local laboratory evaluations required for assessing subject eligibility include serum transaminase (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels, serum 
creatinine and BUN (or urea), peripheral WBC count, absolute neutrophil count, coagulation, and immature neutrophil percentage. Blood will be collected for central 
laboratory testing at the Screening, Day 5, EOT and TOC visits (including serum β -HCG in females; full list of central laboratory tests available in Appendix IV); blood will 
also be collected for central laboratory testing at FU in subjects with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted at or after the TOC visit. 
m Collect blood for acute (Screening) and convalescent (TOC) atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213587], including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and 
Legionella pneumophila , for central laboratory testing. 
n At Screening, a urine dipstick will be performed locally; if results are abnormal and deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], a urinalysis will be sent to the central 
laboratory. 
o At Screening, urine will be tested locally for Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Legionella pneumophila  using provided rapid antigen test kits. 
p At Screening, local laboratory urine or serum pregnancy test (females only) is required to confirm study eligibility. In addition, blood will be collected from all female 
subjects for serum β -HCG pregnancy test by [CONTACT_213669].   
q At Screening, collection of expectorated sputum or other deep respi[INVESTIGATOR_213588]. Gram stain will be performed on all sputum 
specimens and quality assessed. Culture will be performed on all adequate sputum samples or deep respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194]. Post-baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_213589] ( Section 12.6 ).  
rTwo sets of blood cultures (each set consists of 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic blood culture bottle) will also be collected at Screening. Repeat post-baseline blood cultures 
should be collected on the day that the positive blood culture is detected. If subsequent blood cultures are also positive, repeat the blood cultures as necessary until 
negative blood cultures are obtained (Section 12.6 ).   
s Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from all subjects at sites where PK sampling is possible on Day 3, including within [ADDRESS_256405]-dose PK sample at 6-10 h (Day 3). 
t Study drug should be administered q24h (±4 h) between Day [ADDRESS_256406] been administered within 1 4 days prior to the date of signing the informed consent or during the Screening phase will be recorded in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  All medications administered after the first dose of study drug must be recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol W-4873-[ADDRESS_256413] infection, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
(CABP), remains the second largest cause of death and years of life lost worldwide; its 
associated age-standardized death rate was 41.7 per 100,000 population in 2013 ( GBD, 
2015 ). The global incidence of pneumonia is estimated to be between 1.5 and 14.0 cases 
per 1000 person -years, varying by [CONTACT_11338], season, and patient characteristics ( File, 2010b ; 
Millett, 2013 ). Short-term mortality (in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30-day mortality) for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213593] 4.0% to 18.0% ( Arnold, 2013 ; File, 2010b ). Costs 
related to community-acquired pneumonia are high, and few approaches (such as 
reducing the length -of-stay, adequate use of antibiotics, and the introduction of vaccines) 
have reduced these costs to date ( Prina, 2015 ). Streptococcus pneumoniae  remains the 
most common pathogen of CABP worldwide, independent of age. Other frequent causes 
of CABP include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213562] 
(including Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, and Legionella  spp.). 
A major therapeutic challenge impacting the treatment of CABP is the widespread 
resistance of S. pneumoniae  to ß-lactams (especially penicillins and 1st and 2nd-generation
cephalosporins) and macrolide antibiotics. For example, the preval ence of S. pneumoniae  
macrolide resistance on a global scale is estimated to be 25% to 40%, varying by [CONTACT_11338] 
(Farrell, 2008 ; Reinert, 200 9). The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. 
pneumoniae, defined by [CONTACT_213670]-
β-lactam antibiotic classes, is also worrisome. For example, in the US, an analysis of 
1498 clinical pneumococci strains collected between 2012 and 2013 found that 21.0 % 
were MDR (Richter, 2014 ). Community-acquired MDR S. pneumoniae  poses treatment 
challenges for outpatient CABP―most notably the lack of effective oral antibacterial 
options― because of resistance to the most commonly-used oral penicillins, 
cephalosporins, and/or macrolides. Failure of therapy due to resistance will continue to 
contribute to the morbidity and mortality of CABP,  and treatment failures of mild disease 
will result in increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213594].   
The development of oral nafithromycin (described below in Section 6 .2), which has 
activity against MDR S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes , respi[INVESTIGATOR_213595]-negative 
pathogens, and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213574], would provide clinicians with a new treatment option 
for CABP  caused by [CONTACT_213671], including MDR S. 
pneumoniae , while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.

6.2 NAFITHROMYCIN 
Nafithromycin (previously known as WCK 4873) is an IV and oral antibacterial agent of 
the ketolide class that is structurally related to the macrolide class. Diverse in vitro, in 
vivo, preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety studies have provided strong scientific 
evidence of the therapeutic potential of nafithromycin for difficult to treat respi[INVESTIGATOR_213596].

6.4 STUDY DRUG DOSE RATIONALE 
In this study, study drug is defined as oral nafithromycin tablet or oral moxifloxacin 
capsule (i.e., over-encapsulated tablet). Relevant matching placebo formulations (tablets 
and capsules) are used to maintain the blind.

6.4.2 Moxifloxacin 
Moxifloxacin was selected as the optimal comparator for this Phase II CABP study, given 
its long history of efficacy and tolerability in this infection.  The proposed dose regimen 
and treatment scheme (400 mg once daily for 7 days ) has been selected for consistency 
purposes worldwide as this study is planned to be conducted in different regions, such as 
Europe, US and South Africa.  
 Moxifloxacin has a similar spectrum of activity to that of nafithromycin, with coverage 
against the most common typi[INVESTIGATOR_213597] (e.g., S. pneumoniae  
[including penicillin-resistant and macrolide-resistant isolates], H. influenzae, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila ). 
This broad spectrum of activity along with its once-daily dosage allows for the double-
blind monotherapy design of this trial, obviating the need for combination therapy in 
either treatment arm. The use of moxifloxacin for CABP is consistent with the current 
treatment guidelines by [CONTACT_213672]/ATS and ESCMID (Mandell, 2007 ; Woodhead, 2005 ). In 
conclusion, the 7-day oral treatment duration of moxifloxacin, allowed in this study was 
selected to be generally consistent with clinical guideline recommendations as well as the 
duration of therapy recommended in the package inserts for the oral switch agent 
(moxifloxacin package inserts) from different regions, and can thus be considered a 
globally appropriate treatment duration from both efficacy and safety standpoints.

8.0 STUDY DESIGN 
8.1 TYPE OF STUDY 
This is a Phase II prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1:1), double-
blind, comparative study to determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of oral 
nafithromycin versus oral moxifloxacin for treatment of adults with CABP. Study drug is 
defined as oral nafithromycin tablets or oral moxifloxacin capsules.  Relevant matching 
placebo formulations (tablets and capsules) are used to maintain the blind. 
Subjects providing informed consent and meeting all study eligibility criteria will be 
randomized into the study in a 1:1:1 ratio to either of the following 3 treatment arms: 
Arm A: Nafithromycin 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) PO q24h for 3 days; subjects
will receive matching placebo (two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO q24h) on
Days 4 through Day 7, and one moxifloxacin placebo capsule PO q24h on Days 1
through 7, to maintain the blind
Arm B: Nafithromycin 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) PO q24h for 5 days; subjects
will receive matching placebo (two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO q24h) on
Day 6 and Day 7, and one moxifloxacin placebo capsule PO q24h on Days 1
through 7, to maintain the blind
Arm C: Moxifloxacin 400 mg (one 400 mg over-encapsulated tablet) PO q24h  for
7 days; subjects will also receive two nafithromycin placebo tablets PO q24h on
Days 1 through Day 7 , to maintain the blind
Baseline assessments for study eligibility will occur within 24 h prior to randomization 
using IXRS, stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US vs. ex-US) and PORT Risk Class (II vs. III/IV), will 
be used to assign subjects (1:1:1) to Arm A, Arm B or Arm C. Study Day [ADDRESS_256414] administered, and subsequent study days are defined by 
[CONTACT_213673]. 
Subjects may be treated in the study as inpatients or outpatients based on their clinical 
condition, at the discretion of the Investigator; however, only oral study drug will be 
administered (i.e., parental moxifloxacin will not be administered). Subjects will be 
assessed daily by [CONTACT_213661] 1 and Day 5, whether being treated for 
CABP in the inpatient or outpatient setting. Investigators will assess for clinical outcome 
on EOT (Day 7) and TOC (Day 15 ± 3 days). Vital signs, physical exam, assessment of 
CABP symptom severity, and other study procedures are detailed in Table 3 -1. A FU 
visit will be conducted on Day 31 ±[ADDRESS_256415] or by [CONTACT_213674]; otherwise, the visit must 
be conducted in person.

8.2 RANDOMIZATION 
Block randomization using an IXRS, stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US vs. ex-US) and PORT Risk 
Class (II vs. III/IV), will be used to assign subjects (1:1:1) to Arm A, Arm B or Arm C. 
After informed consent has been obtained and study eligibility established, a study 
pharmacist or designee will obtain the study drug assignment from the IXRS. Subjects 
are considered randomized when the pharmacist or designee receives the IX RS-generated 
treatment assignment. 
8.3 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 
Approximately 225 adult subjects (75 subjects per arm) diagnosed with CABP will be 
enrolled in this study.  
Enrolment of PORT Risk Class II (PORT score 51 to 70; Appendix II ) will be capped at 
50% and enrolment of subjects with allowed prior systemic antibiotic use ( Appendix I ) 
will be capped initially at 25% (subject to change during study conduct). 
8.[ADDRESS_256416] will remain in the study for approximately one month. This will include a 
Screening visit (within 24 h of randomization), a 7-day oral treatment period, and post 
treatment assessments at TOC (Day 12 to Day 18) and FU (Day 2 8 to Day 3 4).

9.4.1 Premature Discontinua tion from Study Drug Administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Discontinuations Due to Safety  
Possible reasons for premature discontinuation from study drug administration due to 
safety include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Occurrence of an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator, warrants the 
subject’s permanent discontinuation from study drug administration.  
 Meets Hy’s law criteria, defined by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_256422], elevation of serum total bilirubin to > [ADDRESS_256423] abnormalities  
Protocol W -4873 -201  
 
Page 32 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
 Known pregnancy or breastfeeding during the study drug administration period. 
Female subjects whose pregnancy test is positive post -baseline must be followed 
through the immediate postnatal period or until termination of the pregnancy. 
Study center personnel must report every pregnancy as soon as possible (within 
24 h of learning of the pregnancy,  as described in Section 14.1.6). 
Assessments and Procedures:  Subjects who are prematurely discontinued from study 
drug administration (i .e., before the anticipated full course of study drug required for 
effective treatment of the CABP) for safety reasons  should  continue to undergo study 
assessments at every  study visit (Section  11.0). If a subject is discontinued from study 
drug on Day [ADDRESS_256424] any remaining PK blood 
samples scheduled for that day . 
Clinical Outcome Assessment: Subjects prematurely discontinued from any study drug 
for safety reasons and for whom further antibacterial therapy is not required for treatment 
of the primary infection (i .e., the CABP has resolved completely or imp roved to the point 
where no further antibacterial therapy is necessary), may be assessed as a clinical cure at 
the EOT and TOC  visits . 
Subjects prematurely discontinued from any study drug for safety reasons and who 
require further antibacterial therapy fo r the CABP should be assessed as a clinical failure 
on the day of discontinuation and automatically assigned an outcome of clinical failure at 
the next outcome evaluation time point.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Discontinuations Due to Insufficient Therapeutic Effect  
Possible reasons for discontinuation from study drug due to insufficient therapeutic effect  
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Clinical worsening:  Subjects who show systemic or local signs of clinical 
worsening may be prematurely discontinued from study drug a dministration at 
any time. If the Investigator deems the benefit -to-risk ratio of study drug 
continuance acceptable, study drug administration of at least 48 h is encouraged 
before discontinuation from study drug therapy . 
 Lack of clinical progress:  For subjects who are stable, yet do not show signs of 
improvement, the Investigator is encouraged to continue study drug therapy for at 
least 48 h before such subjects are considered clinical failures and prematurely 
discontinued from study drug therapy . 
Assessments and Procedures:  Subjects who are prematurely discontinued from study 
drug due to insufficient therapeutic effect  should have EOT assessments conducted 
(Section 11.8) on the day of discontinuation and undergo sa fety assessments at TOC 
(Section  11.9). Prematurely discontinued subjects should also be encouraged to attend the 
FU visit. If a subject  is discontinued from study drug on Day [ADDRESS_256425] and is switched to an alternative antibiotic, that therapy should be documented.  
Protocol W -4873 -201

Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
Clinical Outcome A ssessment: Subjects who are prematurely discontinued from study 
drug administration due to insufficient therapeutic effect  should be assessed as clinical 
failure on the day of discontinuation. Subjects prematurely discontinued from study drug 
administratio n due to insufficient therapeutic effect will be automatically assigned an 
outcome of clinical failure at the next outcome evaluation time point.  
9.4.2 Withdrawal from Study  
Reasons:  Possible reasons for withdrawal from study include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Significant subject noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the 
prescribed dosing and follow -up regimen  
 Investigator deter mines that it is in the best interest of the subject to withdraw 
from the study protocol, due to reasons other than an AE  
Assessments and Procedures : Subjects may withdraw from the study or be withdrawn at 
the request of the Investigator or Sponsor at any time. Subjects who wish to withdraw 
completely from this clinical study during the treatment period should be encouraged to 
undergo safety assessments at the time of withdrawal. Additionally, if a subject is 
withdrawn on Day [ADDRESS_256426] any remaining PK 
blood samples scheduled for that day.  Subjects withdrawn from the study need not 
undergo TOC or FU assessments.  
Clinical Outcome Assessment: Subjects who withdraw from the study and are not 
assessed  as clinical failures should be assessed as indeterminate for all remaining 
scheduled clinical assessments.  
9.5 REPLACEMENT OF SUBJE CTS  
Randomized subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
9.6 STUDY TERMINATION BY  [CONTACT_213677]. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies of nafithromy cin or 
moxifloxacin indicate a potential health hazard to subjects  
 Serious or persistent noncompliance by [CONTACT_737] s with the protocol, 
clinical research agreement, Form FDA 1572, or applicable regulatory guidelines 
in conducting the study  
 Relevant ethics committee(s) or regulatory agency(ies) decision to terminate or 
suspend approval for the Investigator or clinical conduct at site  
Protocol W -4873 -201  
 
Page 34 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
 Investigator request to withdraw from participation  
 Subject enrolment is unsatisfactory  
9.7 GUIDANCE TO INVESTIG ATORS ON WH EN TO END STUDY 
DRUG THERAPY  
The duration of study drug in this study is a fixed 7 -day course in all three Treatment 
Arms; therefore, subjects who are improving clinically will receive no less or no more 
than 7 days of the study treatment re gimen. At Day 7  (EOT), an assessment of clinical 
outcome will be performed by [CONTACT_737]. A subject will be determined as a clinical 
cure at EOT if the subject is alive and the infection is sufficiently resolved such that 
further antibacterial therapy is not needed  (Section 13.2.2).  Note that subjects with 
CABP may have some residual findings related to infection (i.e., cough) requiring non -
antibiotic ancillary treatment (e.g., expectorant) at EOT and still meet criteria for clin ical 
cure.  
If additional antibacterial therapy is required for the index CABP (e.g., progressively 
worsening CABP between Day 1 and Day 7, or gradually improving CABP that requires  
additional antibacterial therapy beyond 7 days ), study drug should be disc ontinued, the 
subject will be deemed a clinical failure  on the day of study drug discontinuation , and 
open -label antibacterial therapy will be started at the d iscretion of the Investigator. 
Administration of blinded study drug will not be allowed beyond Da y 7. In cases of 
premature discontinuation of study drug, subjects should not be discontinued from the 
study itself; subjects should remain in the study and undergo all scheduled assessments at 
EOT, TOC and FU ( Section 11.0). 
The Investigator may use culture and susceptibility results from the local microbiology 
laboratory to help guide therapy; however, decisions to continue or discontinue study 
drug should be based on clinical response rather than susceptibility results (as 
nafithromycin susceptibility testing is not available at the local site). If the index CABP is 
caused by a microorganism that is not susceptible to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or 
ketolides in vitro, the decision to continue or discontinue study treat ment should be based 
on the subject's clinical course and the Investigator’s clinical judgment. These cases 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to prematurely discontinuing study 
drug, and the rationale for this decision should be recorded i n the source documents.  
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256427] S 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either oral nafithromycin  tablets or oral 
moxifloxacin  capsules (over -encapsulated tablets ). The duration of therapy is 7 days (3 or 
5 days of active oral nafithromy cin followed by [CONTACT_213678] 7 days of therapy 
[Arms A and B, respect ively]  or 7 days of active oral moxifloxacin [Arm C]) . Relevant 
matching placebo formulations (tablets and capsules) are used to maintain the blind.  
10.1 STUDY DRUG  
10.1.1  Oral Nafithromycin  & Matching Placebo  
Each subject randomized to receive nafithromycin  (Arm A or Arm B) will receive oral 
nafithromycin administered as two 400 mg tablets ― for a total of 800 mg ― once daily.  
Nafithromycin is a novel IV and oral antibacterial agent of ketoli de class (molecular 
weight 859 Daltons), which is structurally related to macrolide class. The chemical 
nomenclature is: (11S, 21R) -3-Decladinosyl -11, 12 -dideoxy -6-O-methyl -3-oxo-12, 11 -
{oxycarbonyl -[E-N-[1-(5-pyridin -2-yl-1,3,4 -thiadiazol -2-yl)-(S)-ethoxy ]-
carboxamidino]methylene} -erythromycin -A. 
The nafithromycin and matching placebo tablets have been manufactured  under GMP 
conditions and have undergone stability studies in compliance with regulatory norms. 
Oral nafithromycin 400 mg tablets and corresponding clinical placebo tablets are of white 
color, oval shaped, biconvex film coated, scored on both sides and deb ossed with W and 
755 on either side of the score on one side ( IB).  
Storage and dispensing of nafithromycin tablets can be undertaken at room temperature 
(below 25°C)  in its packaging  (while protected from moisture ). Detailed instructions 
regarding storage  are presented in the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) . 
The blinded products will be packaged in subject -specific blister wallets. Tablets are to 
be swallowed with water in an upright position.  
10.1.2  Oral Moxifloxacin  & Matching Placebo  
Each subj ect randomized to receive moxifloxacin (Arm C) will receive oral moxifloxacin 
administered as a single 400 mg capsule (i.e., over-encapsulated tablet ) once daily.   
All other subject s, randomized to receive nafithromycin (Arms A and B) , will receive 
moxiflo xacin matching placebo.   
The blinded products will be packaged in subject -specific blister wallets. Capsules are to 
be swallowed with water in an upright position.  
Consult the summary of products characteristics or prescribing information (Appendix V ) 
or other local dosing guidelines regarding preparation, storage, administration, maximum 
doses, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and AEs reported with the use of 
moxifloxacin.   
Protocol W -4873 -201  
 
Page 36 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
10.2 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Treatment compliance will be documented in the eCRF by [CONTACT_108888], time, and 
whether or not each oral dose of study drug was administered . 
10.3 PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T MEDICATIONS  
All prior systemic or inhaled antimicrobial agents ( administered  within  14 days prior to 
randomization ) and a ll systemic or inhaled concomitant antimicrobial agents  
(administered  during the study) will be documented .  
A subject who received  more than a single dose of any potentially -effective , short -acting, 
systemic antibacterial  therapy for the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_213600] 72 h before 
randomization will be excluded from the study ( Section 9.3), unless there is unequivocal 
clinical evidence of treatment failure of the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_213601] (e .g., worsening 
signs and symptoms) after administration of an antibacterial agent other than a ketolide or 
fluoroquinolone.  
Concomitant use of potentially effective systemic antibacterials or potentially effective 
inhaled antibacterials is not permitted.  
Nafithromycin is a weak inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms such as 
CYP3A4; specifically, nafithromycin is a 2 -5x and 14 -60x less potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 than telithromycin and solithromycin, respectively ( details in IB ). 
Nafithromycin  is no t an inhibitor of CYP2D6. In addition, nafithromycin does not induce 
enzyme activity or mRNA levels of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Concomitant 
medications that induce P450 enzymes are  contraindicated  in this study. Specifically, 
prior (within 14 days prior to randomization) or concomitant use of cytochrome P450 
liver enzyme inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], griseofulvin, sulfonylureas, 
phenytoin, or rifampin ) are excluded . 
All other concomitant medications and nutrients necessary for the health a nd well -being 
of the subject are permitted.   
10.[ADDRESS_256428] be readily 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_13679]’s Representative and are open to 
inspection at any time by [CONTACT_112103].  
Upon receipt of study therapy drugs, the Investigator or designee must acknowledge 
receipt, visually inspect the shipment, ve rify the number of tablets  or capsules shipped 
are received, and document the condition of the drugs received.  
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256429] to study drug treatment. After written 
informed consent has been obtained and eligibility established, the study center’s 
pharmacist/designee will obtain the randomization code using IXRS. The IXRS system 
will also confirm the study drug assignment including the unique identification number(s) 
of the kits to be prepared for the subject ’s oral therapy. The  pharmacist/designee will be 
responsible for maintaining accountability and  dispensing the oral study drug according 
to the handling instructions. Study center personnel will remain blinded to the identity of 
study drug until the database has been locked and the study has been unblinded. In the 
case of a medical emergency requiring the Investiga tor to know the identity of the oral 
study drug, the Investigator will follow the procedures outlined below.  
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment for each randomized subjec t, will be 
available to the Investigators or pharmacists from IXRS. Interactive voice/web response 
system procedures will be described in the IXRS user manual that will be provided to 
each center. To maintain investigator blinding, the treatment code should not be broken 
except in medical emergencies when the appropriate m anagement of the subject requires 
knowledge of the treatment randomization. In such a case, the subject should receive all 
appropriate medical care. Prior to any unblinding, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_213679]. Th e unblinding procedure will be done 
through the IXRS system. As soon as possible and without revealing the subject’s study 
drug assignment (unless important to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the 
Investigator was unable to contact [CONTACT_27464]. The Investigator will 
record in the source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded 
treatment assignment for that subjec t; the tre atment assignment itself should not be 
entered into source documentation. The Sponsor  may break the code for SAEs that are 
unexpected and are believed to be causally related to study drug and that potentially 
require expedited reporting to regulatory autho rities. In such cases, the minimum number 
of Sponsor  personnel will be unblinded. Treatment codes will not be broken for the 
planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each 
individual subject  have been made and docume nted and databases have been locked.

11.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is located in Table 3–1.  
11.[ADDRESS_256430]’s regular medical care or site’s standards of care 
within  24 h (laboratory) and 48 h (radiology) before randomization do not have to be 
repeated to determine subject eligibility. In addition , laboratory assessments ( Table 3-1) 
must be sent to the central laboratory as part of baseline safety assessments . If local or 
regional laboratory results are not confirmed by [CONTACT_213680], the subject 
should not be automatically withdrawn from the study  or study drug . The subject should 
be assessed for safety and the Medical Monitor must be contact[CONTACT_213681].  
Written and signed informed consent must be obtained before any protocol assessment is 
performed . 
Clinical Assessments:  
 Verify inclusion and e xclusion criteria  
 Obtain a complete medical and surgical history, including all active conditions 
and all conditions diagnosed within the previous 5  years  
 Record all prior medications that have been administered within 14 days prior to 
the date of signing the informed consent  
 Record height and weight, and estimate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) using the 
following Cockcroft -Gault formula (use actual body weight):  
 For serum creatinine in mg/dL:  
Males:  CrCl =  (140 - age in yea rs) × weight (kg)  
 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
Females:  CrCl =  (140 - age in years) × weight (kg)   × 0.85  72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
Protocol W -4873 -201

Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
If the serum creatinine value reported is in Système International d'Unités (SI) 
units ( i.e., μmol/L), convert to conventional units (mg/dL) using the following 
formula:  
Conventional units (mg/dL) =  SI units ( μmol/L)  
88.4 
 
 Record vital signs of body temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), blood pressure, 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry; the highest daily temperature 
should be recorded , and attempts should be made to measure temperature s using  
the same m ethodology throughout the study  
 Perform a complete physical examination, including  general appearance, skin, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, extremities, lymph nodes, 
vascular, and neurological exams  
 Assess CABP symptom severity ( Appendix III ) 
 Obtain a 12 -lead ECG  
 Identify, assess and record any AEs (since the time of informed consent)  
Radiographic Evaluation  
 Obtain a CXR or chest CT scan for all subjects at Screening. If a CXR is 
performed, anteroposterior and lateral views are preferred, and confirmation of 
new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates consistent with CABP may occur with 
either (or both) CXR view; however, posteroanter ior (i.e., portable) views are also 
acceptable. Chest radiography may be obtained as part of routine, non -study 
evaluation of a subject presenting with signs and symptoms of CABP and 
therefore may be performed in some circumstances before informed consent is 
obtained for participation in this study ; radiological evaluations already 
performed as part of the subject’s regular medical care or site’s standards of care 
within [ADDRESS_256431] 
eligibility. Radiologic evaluation(s) will be performed locally and interpreted by 
[CONTACT_213682], and the evaluations 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_213683]; the conclusions of th e Investigator’s  review will be the basis for subject 
inclusion. The written radiography report (i.e., formal interpretation of the 
radiographic image or film) should be i ncluded in the source documents ; 
however, the radiography images or films are not needed in the source documents .

Local or Regional Laboratory Assessments for Study Eligibility:  
○ Obtain serum transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels, coagulation 
profile, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (or urea), peripheral WBC 
count, absolute neutrophil count, and immature neutrophil percentage  to 
determine eligibility . ABG  is recommended, but not required, to measure blood 
pH and partial pressure of oxyg en (PaO 2) for the PORT score calculation.   
○ Obtain serum or urine sample for pregnancy test (β -HCG) in all females and 
ensure that the test i s negative before randomization . 
○ Obtain a urine dipstick test; a standard urine dipstick includes detection of 
specific gravity, pH, leukocytes, blood (hemoglobin), nitrite, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, protein, and glucose. If any results is abnormal (e.g., not negative) 
and deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], a urinalysis will be sent to 
the central lab.

as reported by [CONTACT_12082]:  
1. < 10 sq uamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]/  LPF ( magnification, x100 ) 
2. > 25 PMNs/LPF  
In the event that a sputum specimen is determined to be inadequate, or cannot be obtained 
prior to the first dose of study drug, repeated collection of a specimen should be 
attempted as early  as possible, not later than  [ADDRESS_256439] the pleural fluid sample in 1  aerobic blood 
culture bottle and 1  anaerobic blood culture bottle for a total of 2  bottles  (if limited 
pleural fluid is available, collect the fluid in the aerobic bottle at a minimum) . Pleural 
fluid can be collected in sterile caps for Gram stain  and culture . Pleural fluid cultures 
must be obtained during thoracentesis or initial chest tube placement; cult ures are not 
acceptable if obtained from an indwelling chest tube.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_213616] (i.e., Gram's stain and initiation of overnight 
cultures) within 2 hours  of sampling  at ambient temperature. Refrigerated samples should 
be processed within 12 hours.  Refer to the Microbiology Laboratory Manual for details.  
Culture results are to include identification of  organisms to the level of genus and 
species. Susceptibility testing for nafithromycin will not be available to the local 
laboratory. Nafithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) will be assessed at 
the central laboratory; however, these MIC results will no t be available to the Investigator 
during real -time management of the subjects, and MICs will not be associated with 
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256440] 
care (e.g., study drug discontinuation) will be based on the evolution of the clinical signs 
and symptoms of CABP, rather than specific nafithromycin MIC data  (see Section 9.7 for 
additional guidance) . Susceptibility testing for moxifloxacin  (or other fluoroquinolones ) 
may be performed locally using local laboratory methods usually employed by [CONTACT_43100] . Results of this testing can be used by [CONTACT_213689].  
With the exception of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] “contaminants” listed b elow, a ll isolates identified by 
[CONTACT_213690]/or that are 
isolated from respi[INVESTIGATOR_213617]/ regional Microbiology Labo ratory Manual, will be submitted to 
the central laboratory for verification of genus and species and for standardized MIC 
testing performed for nafithromycin , moxifloxacin , and a panel of currently approved 
antibiotics.   In the event that local laboratory genus and species identification are not 
consistent with central laboratory results, a back -up isolate should be sent to the central 
laboratory . All isolates submitted to the central laboratory must also be retained by [CONTACT_213691]/regional laboratory.  
For the purposes of this study, t he following respi[INVESTIGATOR_213618] 
“contaminants ” and  should not to be sent to the central laboratory:  
 Normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_213619], mixed respi[INVESTIGATOR_213619], or eq uivalent 
(including, but not limited to viridans group streptococci, coagulase -negative 
staphylococci, Corynebacterium  spp.)  
 Fungal spp. ( e.g., Candida  spp., molds)  
Refer to the study -specific Microbiology Laboratory Manual for further detail, including 
specific procedures pertaining to the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of 
microbiological samples.  
12.[ADDRESS_256441] be collected for culture (i.e., 1 
aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle from 2 separate venipuncture sites, for a total of 4 bottles).  
Either an automated or a manual system can be used for blood and pleural fluid culture 
methods according to the preference of the local microbiological laboratory performing 
the testing. Refer to the Microbiology Laboratory Manual for details.  
Culture results are to include identification of pathogens to the level of genus and species. 
Susceptibility testing for nafithromycin will not be available to the local laboratory ; MICs  
will be assessed at the central laboratory . Therefore, decisions related to subject care 
(e.g., study drug discontinuation) will be based  on the evolution of the clinical signs and 
symptoms of CABP . 
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256442] -BASELINE MICROBIOLOGICAL ASSE SSMENTS  
At any time a fter the Screening Visit, respi[INVESTIGATOR_213620]. As CABP responds to therapy, obtaining repeated 
specimens for culture or examination may not be clinically appropriate and/or there may 
be no material for culture.  
If study drug is prematurely discontinued due to insufficient effect of stud y drug (e.g., 
failure at EOT or TOC , or clinical relapse at any time ), an appropriate respi[INVESTIGATOR_213621]; if new 
antibacterial therapy is administered to treat the current CABP after premature 
discontinuation of study drug, it is preferred that respi[INVESTIGATOR_213622].  
Blood cultures  should be repeated  upon knowledge of a positive result from any previous 
collection until sterilization is confirmed ( Table 3-1).  
Repeat, post -baseline urinary antigen tests for L. pneumophila  or S. pneumoniae  should 
not be performed.  
12.6 CENTRAL LABORATORY P ROCEDURES  
With the exception of “contaminants” defined above  (Section 12.1), all cultured bacterial 
isolates collected at each visit will be forwarded to the designated central laboratory  for 
each study site. Central laboratory services will perform the following procedures:  
1. Re-identify all bacterial isolates to the genus and species level  
2. Test all bacterial isolates for nafithromycin and moxifloxacin MICs using 
standardized testing methodologies  
3. Test Screening and TOC blood samples for atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213623], respectively, for Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae  (Section 12.4) 
Any questions regarding microbi ological procedures, interpretation of results, or storage 
of isolates should be discussed with the Sponsor or designee. Additional detail is 
available in the Microbiology Laboratory Manual.

Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256452] a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sig n (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A guideline).  
Adverse events may also include post -treatment complications that occur as a result of 
protocol -mandated procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture and 
biopsy). Pre -existing events that increase in severity or change in nature during, or as a 
consequence of, use of a medicinal p roduct in a human clinical study will also be 
considered AEs.  
Any preexisting medical condition or diagnosis associated with a clinically significant 
laboratory abnormality should be documented in the CRF.  
 
An AE does not include the following:  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that necessitates the procedure is an AE. Any pre -
existing medical condition that necessitates a procedure during the study should 
not be captured as an AE, and the  condition should be listed in the medical 
history.  
 Any pre -existing disease or condition or laboratory abnormality present or 
detected prior to the start of the study treatment regimen that does not worsen  
 Laboratory abnormalities without clinical manife stations, which do not require 
medical intervention, or that do not result in termination or delay of study drug 
administration   
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions)  
 Overdose of any study treatment or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms, unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]  
 Progression of the index CABP or insufficient therapeutic effect of study drug, 
which is cap tured as an efficacy outcome (i.e., clinical failure at EOT or TOC)  
Protocol W -4873 -201  
 
Page 57 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
 Progression of disease or insufficient therapeutic effect which causes new 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (in subjects not previously hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213640]), 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (in subjects that were previously hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213641] ); however,  if this leads to  death, it should be recorded as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) ( Section 14.1.3). 
A TEAE is defined as an AE  or SAE  that occurs during or after the first administration of 
study drug and up through the FU visit . 
A life -threatening AE is an AE that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , 
places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not available, is not 
consist ent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan. For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarl y, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as 
used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occur ring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Progressive worsening of the index CABP or insufficient therapeutic effect of study drug 
that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] (i.e., SAE criteria, Section 14.1.4) is considered 
expected―as part of potential disease progression―and not unexpected.  
Some AEs are listed in the IB as occurr ing with the same class of drugs, or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have not been 
observed with the drug under investigation. Such events would be considered unexpected 
until they have been observed with th e drug under investigation.  
The list of AEs included in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure will be used 
as reference safety information.  
14.1.[ADDRESS_256453] make an assessment of the relatio nship of the 
event to the study drug using the following scale:  
 Unrelated : The event is definitely not associated with administration of the study 
treatment, and is judged clearly due to causes other than the study treatment.  
Clinical failure of CABP due t o insufficient therapeutic effect of study drug is 
also considered “unrelated” to study drug.  
 Related : The event is possibly or probably associated with administration of study 
treatment. Possibly -related  events follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study treatment, but may be due to another cause and could also 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256454]’s clinical state or 
other treatment, and are confirmed by [CONTACT_149882] a fter stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213642].   
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment.  If the event is believed to be unrelated to the study 
treatment, then an alternative explanation sh ould be provided.  
14.1.3  Severity Assessment  
The Investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using 
the following categories: mild, moderate, or severe  (Table 1 4.1.3-1).  This assessment  is 
subjective and the Investigator should use medical judgment to compare the reported AE 
to similar types of events observed in clinical practice.  Severity,  which is a description of 
the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness , for which specific 
SAE criteria are met ( Section 14.1.4).   
 
Table 1 4.1.3-1:  Severity Assessments of Adverse Events.  
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject or does not make the subject 
uncomfortable .  The AE does not influence performance or functioning.  
Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s).  
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make the subject uncomfortable.  
Performance of daily activities is influenced . Treatment of symptom(s) may be 
needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort.  
Severity may cause cessation of treatment with the drug.  Treatment for 
symptom(s) needed.  
 Abbreviation: AE = Adverse event.  
14.1.4  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any adverse experience that occurs from the signing of the informed consent 
to the FU visit and that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death)  
 Inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
treatment  
 Events that jeopardize the subject sufficiently that  medical or surgical intervention 
may be required to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples may include, 
but are not limited, to:  
Protocol W-4873-[ADDRESS_256455] which causes new 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (in subjects not previously hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213643]), rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (in subjects that were previously hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213644]) is not a SAE; however, if this leads to 
death, it should be recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) ( Section 
14.1.3 ) 
The Sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAEs that meet 
specific criteria. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding any SAE 
that occurs after informed consent is obtained. All SAEs and follow-up information must 
be reported within 1 business day, or 24 h as required by [CONTACT_427], by [CONTACT_29658] a 
completed SAE Report Form to the fax number below (Table 14.1.4-1) or emailing a

14.1.5  Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the  informed 
consent form  (ICF) to the time of the FU Visit. The Investigator must instruct the subject 
to report AEs and SAEs during this time period. Reports of death within [ADDRESS_256457] should be asked the following nonspecific question: "How have 
you been feeling since your last visit?"  Signs and symptoms should be reco rded using 
standard medical terminology.  
Any unanticipated risks to the subjects must be reported promptly to the relevant ethics 
committee(s) and regulatory agency(ies) . 
14.1.[ADDRESS_256458] report the event on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and fax or email it 
to the SAE/Pregnancy fax num ber or email  provided in Section  14.1.4, even if no AE has 
occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male subjects occurring during the time 
frame described above must also be reported.  
The pregnancy must be followed t o term and the outcome reported by [CONTACT_213697]. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (e .g., if the 
mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a separate SAE Form for Clinical Trials must be 
filed as described in Section 14.1.4 with the appropriate serious criterion (e .g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated, in addition to the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256459] medical practice and 
guidelines for oral administration of study drug. Vital sign assessments ( temperature , 
blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oxygen saturation ), medical history, prior and 
concomitant medications, height, weight, and physical examination findings will be 
conducted at the specified time points outlined in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures ( Table 3–1) and Section  11.0. 
14.3 LABORATOR Y ASSESSMENTS  
Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests and blood/urine samples for pregnancy tests 
will be collected at baseline and throughout the study according to the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures ( Table 3–1) and Section 11.0.  
Unscheduled c linically -indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) 
should be conducted at the local or regional laboratory  on an as -needed basis . 
14.4 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
An internal , blinded Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized in this study. 
The DMC will perform periodic reviews of blinded data from the study to evaluate 
subject safety, compliance with the study protocol, and the quality of data. Safety of 
study drug will be monitored by [CONTACT_213698], SAEs, and the safety laboratory 
assessments on a regular basis. If specific issues are identified that warrant more 
extensive review, the DMC will recommend that experts external to the company review 
the data and p rovide a formal opi[INVESTIGATOR_213646].

16.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
16.1 STUDY POPULATIONS  
16.1.1  Safety Population  
The safety population  will include all randomized subjects who receive any amount of 
study drug ( nafithromycin or moxifloxacin ). Subjects will be analyzed  according to the 
treatment actually received.   
16.1.2  Intent -to-Treat Population  (ITT)  
The ITT population will include all subjects who were randomized.  
16.1.3  Microbiological Intent -to-Treat Population (micro-ITT)  
The micro -ITT population will include all ITT subjects who have a at least one baseline 
Gram -positive or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213582], including bacterial 
pathogens identified by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_213583]  (e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_213649]; pleural fluid obtained by [CONTACT_213685]; or 
expectorated or induced sputum meeting adequacy criteria) , blood culture, urinary 
antigen test ( S. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila ), or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213584] ( M. 
pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pne umophila ). Subjects with sole baseline Gram -
negative bacterial infection will be excluded from this population.   
16.1.4  Clinically -Evaluable Population (CE)  
The CE population will include all ITT subjects who follow important components of the 
trial. Sufficient information regarding the clinical course of CABP must be available to 
determine the subject’s clinical outcome at TOC, and the subject must not have 
confounding factors that interfere with the assessment of that outcome.  
In order to be included in the CE  population, subjects must meet a ll of the following 
criteria: 
 Meet the clinical disease criteria for CABP as described in Inclusion Criterion #3 
(Inclusion Criteria 3a –3e; Section 9.2)  
 Receive at least 1 dose of study drug 
 Do not receive non -study , potentially -effective , systemic antibacterial therapy 
between Day 1 and TOC (except  in cases of treatment failure)   
 Have an Investigator -determined clinical response of clinical cure or clinical 
failure at TOC (unless determi ned to be a prior clinical failure at EOT)  
 Receive a t least 80% of the intended doses of study drug therapy  
Protocol W -4873 -201  
 
Page 64 of 85 
Version 1.0, 10 May 2016  
 
 Receive a t least [ADDRESS_256462] 72 h of study drug therapy in orde r to be considered an 
evaluable clinical success  
16.1.5  Microbiologically -Evaluable Population (ME)  
The ME population will include all subjects who meet both micro -ITT population 
(Section 16.1.3) and CE population (Section 16.1.4) criteria.

16.2 METHODS OF ANAL YSIS  
This is an exploratory study and, therefore, is not powered for inferential statistical 
analyses and no formal comparisons between the treatment groups will be conducted.  
All data will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_5349] (nafithromycin for 3 days,  
nafithromycin for 5 days, and moxifloxacin).  Descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables 
for each study drug. Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be presented  
for categorical variables.  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan will be prepared and finalized prior to 
database lock . 
16.2.[ADDRESS_256464] a 1:1:1 (Arm A: Arm B: Arm C) allocation ratio; therefore, 
approximately [ADDRESS_256465] initial efficacy data and to evaluate the 
safety and PK of oral nafithromycin in subjects with CABP. The sample size chosen for 
this study is considered to be adequate to achieve the study objectives and  provide 
sufficient data to inform the design of future definitive studies, including Phase 3 studies, 
of nafithromycin . Assuming a 78% clinical response rate at Day 4 in the oral 
nafithromycin treatment arms, the sample size of 75 subjects per treatment a rm will yield 
a 95% confidence interval around the response rate of 66.9% to 86.7% . 
16.2.[ADDRESS_256466] disposition (enrolment, discontinuations from the study), study drug 
administered, premature discontinuations fr om study medication, withdrawals from the 
study, and major protocol deviations will be summarized by [CONTACT_213700] .  
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256467] 
deviations, medians, minima and maxima for continuous variables, and counts and 
percentages for categorical variables.  
16.2.3  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy evaluation will be t he by -subject clinical response at Day [ADDRESS_256468] will be classified programmatically as a responder, non -
responder, or indeterminate based on CABP symptom data entered in the e -CRF ( Section 
13.2.1).   
The number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group classified 
programmatically as a responder, non -responder and indeterminate will be reported.  
Exact 95% confidence intervals around the percentage of subject s classified as 
responders will be calculated for each treatment group using the Clopper -Pearson 
Method.  The treatment difference will also be determined and a 95% confidence for the 
difference will be calculated using the method of Miettinen -Nurminen. Individual subject 
data will also be displayed as a listing .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary analysis variables are listed in Section 13.1. 
For analyses of the variables above that measure clinical success on a per -subject basis 
(i.e., clinical cure, improvement in CABP symptoms and normalization in vital signs at 
Day 4, lack of readmission or new admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , the number and percentage 
of subjects in each treatment group in the specified population (s) classified as clinica l 
success, clinical failure, and indeterminate (as applicable to each secondary analysis;  
Section  13.2) at the specified time point(s) will be tabulated. The difference between 
treatment groups in clinical success and 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference also will be 
included in the tabulation.  
The per -pathogen and per -subject microbiological efficacy analyses will be conducted in 
the micro -ITT and ME Populations at TOC. Per -subject responses will be based on per -
pathogen outc omes ( Section 13.3). These responses include eradication, presumed 
eradication, persistence, and presumed persistence. Of these responses, eradication and 
presumed eradication will be regarded as a favorable outcome. Persi stence and presumed 
persistence will be regarded as an unfavorable outcome. To have an overall favorable 
microbiologic response, the outcome for each basel ine pathogen must be favorable. 
Microbiological outcomes in the ME Population, by [CONTACT_108], will no t include subjects 
with indeterminate response s.  
Protocol W -[ADDRESS_256469] data will also be d isplayed as a listing.  
Emergent infections ( i.e., superinfection, new infection) will not be considered in the by-
subject or by -pathogen microbiological response and will be provided in separate listings 
(Section 13.3.1; Table 13.3.1-2). 
16.2.4  Safety Analyses  
Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of oral nafithromycin for 3 or 5 days in the 
treatment of CABP is an important primary objective for this Phase II study. Safety will 
be analyzed in the Safety Population  (Section  16.1.1). Subjects in the Safety Population  
will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
Safety will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_116004], physical examinations, vital 
signs, laboratory evaluations (hematology evaluation, chemistry panel, UA, and ECG 
parameters). For each safety parameter, the last assessment made prior to the first 
administration of study dru g will be used as the baseline value for all analyses.  
The incidence of TEAEs (defined in Section 14.1.1 ) will be presented by [CONTACT_213701]®, by [CONTACT_213702], and by [CONTACT_926]. In addition, the incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug will be presented by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
and relationship to study drug.  If the incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug is low, only a listing will be provided.  
Descriptive statistics of vital signs at each time point measured, as well as the change 
from baseline and PCS changes, will be presented. Descriptive statistics for ECGs and 
physical e xaminations will also be presented for each time point measured . The number 
and percentage of subjec ts with a normal physical exam result at baseline and an 
abnormal physical examination result at a follow -up assessment will be provided for each 
time point . Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs and for the 
change from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_15449]. Potentially clinically significant 
clinical laboratory results will be determined based on normal limits and percent c hange 
from baseline . 
16.2.[ADDRESS_256470] approve any change to the protocol before 
seeking approval from the relevant ethics committee(s) and regulatory agency(ies) . Each 
Investigator will be respo nsible for enrolling only those subjects who have met the 
protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
17.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS AND DATA CA PTURE 
SYSTEM  
Data collection will involve the use of an Electronic Data Capture ( EDC) system, to 
which only authori zed personnel will have access. Electronic case report forms will be 
used to capture study data in an EDC system . Entering of eCRFs should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor or Sponsor representative. All eCRFs 
must be completed by  [CONTACT_213703]. Each Investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that accurate data are entered into the EDC system in a timely manner.  
Before the first subject is dosed at the investigational site, the Sponsor or Sponsor 
representative  will meet with the Investigator and the study center’s personnel to train 
them on recording the data on the eCRFs using the EDC system. The Investigator or 
designee will be responsible for reviewing eCRFs, resolving data queries generated by 
[CONTACT_124730] t he system, providing missing or corrected data, approving all changes 
performed on the subject data, and endorsing these data within the EDC system. This 
approval method will include applying an electronic signature, a uniquely assigned user 
name, and a pa ssword that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature.  
Queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study center and answered 
electronically by [CONTACT_116010]’s personnel. The identifying information (assigned 
user name, date, and time) for both the originator of the query and the originator of the 
data change (if applicable) will be collected.  
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for ele ctronic records.  
17.[ADDRESS_256471] study data, 
subjects’ medical records, and eCRFs in accordance with current ICH E6 Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) guideline, and the respective US , EU and local  regulations and 
guidelines, as applicable. The Sponsor  or Sponsor representative will also be able to 
review query status remotely, which may warrant additional communication with the 
Investigator and the study center’s personnel. The Investigator will make available to t he 
Sponsor, or Sponsor representative, source documents, signed ICFs, and all other study -
related documents.  
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or Sponsor representative and applicable 
regulatory authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
17.5 STUDY COMPLETION  
The Sponsor requires the following data and materials before the study can be considered 
complete or terminated:  
 Clinical and laboratory results from Screening through TOC

their identity and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In 
eCRFs and other documents or image material submitted to the Sponsor, subjects will be 
identif ied not by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209] (e.g., initials and identification 
number).  
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of subject safety and/or 
verifying data in the source and transcribed onto the eCRF. This review may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_11200], properly authorized persons on behalf of the Sponsor, 
the quality assurance unit, and/or regulatory authorities. Personal medical information 
will always be treated as confidential.  
18.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
This study will be  conducted in compliance with the current ICH E6 GCP guideline 
pertaining to informed consent, the current US CFR (Title  21, Parts 50 Subparts B and D, 
56 and 312)  as well as relevant European and local guidelines . Subjects will give written 
consent to par ticipate in the study at the first visit, before initiation of any study -related 
procedures, after having been informed about the nature and purpose of the study, 
participation and termination conditions, risks, and benefits. If a subject is unable to 
provide written informed consent, the subject’s legally acceptable representative(s) may 
provide written consent, as approved according to institution specific guidelines. The ICF 
must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative(s), before study participation. A n original  copy of the signed ICF must be

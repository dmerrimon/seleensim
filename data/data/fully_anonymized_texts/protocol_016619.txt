NORMAL AGING  
 
 
  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Date: December 21, 2022  
 
  
 Background  
 
While amyloid plaques are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether 
β-amyloid is the causal agent of neurodegeneration in AD remains unclear. Evidence supporting 
the hypothesis that amyloid is a primary contributor to AD pathogenesis (the amyloid -first 
hypothesis) include the finding that genetic mutations responsible for inherited forms of AD 
cause increased amyloid production. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) to 
measure amyloid plaque burden in vivo have demonstrated amyloid positivity before obvious 
atrophy or cognitive decline in healthy older controls. While tau positive neurofibrillary tangles 
represent the second hallmark of AD, tau mutations are seen in patients with variants of 
frontotemporal dementia, not AD. The propagation of tau pathology is thought to follow 
amyloidosis, suggesting amyloid in some way induces tau mediated degeneration. However, the 
link between amyloid and tau not clear as there are spatial and temporal distinctions. For 
example, bulk of amyloid burden in medial parietal cortex and frontal cortex early on, while tau 
burden begins in medial temporal cortex.  
While β -amyloid has been shown to have direct neurotoxic effects in vitro, these effects 
are seen at concentrations of β -amyloid much higher than found in human brain[1].Therefore, 
amyloid may not confer significant direct toxicity. In addition, autopsy findings of pre -tangle 
pathology occurring in midlife prior to amyloidosis[2] suggest that tauopathy may begin prior 
and independent to significant amyloid plaque deposition. Since amyloid burden correlates 
poorly with cognition[3], tau may be a more important mediator of neurodegeneration in AD.  
Investigational  Agent  
18F-MK-6240 is a PET radioligand that binds to paired helical filament tau aggregates.  
This radioligand has only been used for research purposes. 18F-MK-6240 will be administered in 
tracer doses (≤20 µg) at activity of 4 to 5 mCi (148 - 185 MBq) ±10% per injection.  
Study  Objectives  
 The primary objective is to determine the extent and spatial distribution of tau at different 
stages along the cognitive spectrum of aging (cognitively normal older adults, adults with mild 
cognitive impairment, and adults with Alzheimer’s disease  dementia).  
 Secondary objectives are to determine how 18F-MK-6240 binding in brain relates to 
cognitive performance, amyloid binding, atrophy on MRI, and CSF concentrations of markers  of 
inflammation and  neurodegeneration.  
 
Study  Design  
 
150 subjects will undergo screening including history, physical examination, routine  
laboratory studies, neuropsychological testing, and brain MRI.  
Target sample size is 100 elders with impairment (50 amnestic MCI and 50 Alzheimer’s 
disease) and 50 elders without impairment (150 subjects total).  
One brain MRI will be performed on each subject using a 3 T Philips scanner. Sequences 
performed will include 3D T1 (MPRAGE, 180 slice 1 mm resolution, 256 x 256 voxel count) for 
volumetric analysis and clinical sequences to exclude subjects with significant intracranial 
pathology unrelated to AD, such as malignant brain tumor of subdural hematoma. PET scans  will 
take place on a Biograph mCT PET scanner (Siemens Healthcare) at the CUMC Kreitchman 
PET Center. Subjects will have one PET scan with 18F-MK-6240 (injected activity 4 to 5 mCi = 
148 - 185 MBq ±10%). PET imaging will be performed without arterial sampling. Vital signs 
  
 (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) will be checked prior to injection of 
18F-MK-6240, then at the completion of the PET scan. 18F-MK-[ADDRESS_214584] not yet been 
validated for clinical use. Subjects will be informed if a clinically important abnormality is 
detected on MRI or PET imaging (e.g., brain  tumor).  
FreeSurfer ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/),  the MRI software package comprising a 
suite of automated tools for segmentation, reconstruction, and derivation of regional volumes and 
surface -based rendering, will be used for derivation of regions -of-interest (ROIs). Eleven ROIs 
will be extracted from the structural T1 image: entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, inferior temporal 
cortex, combined superior and middle temporal cortex, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal 
lobule, precuneus, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067], prefrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus.  
18F-MK-6240 PET images will be analyzed as follows: Freesurfer based ROIs will be 
applied to coregistered PET images. Correction for partial volume effects using a region -based 
voxel -wise method[23] will be applied. Regional time -activity curves using [ADDRESS_214585] uptake value ratio (SUVR) values will be calculated by [CONTACT_181817].  
Subjects will have the option of having one lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF collection.  
Subjects may refuse the LP and still participate in the other study procedures. CSF analysis will 
be performed to determine CSF concentrations of total tau, phospho -tau, β -amyloid, and markers 
of inflammation such as IL -1β, TNF -α, glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100B, and YLK -40. 
 
Primary Study  Endpoints  
 
Because the drugs used in this study are radioligands given at tracer doses, there are no clinical 
endpoints of the study.  
 
The primary outcome measures are:  
1. Amount of 18F-MK-6240 binding.  
 
Secondary outcome measures are:  
1. Correlation Between Tau, Neurodegeneration and Inflammation  
 
Statistical  Plan  
Sample Size  Determination  
Because 18F-THK -[ADDRESS_214586] adequate 
preliminary data for a formal power calculation. This protocol is designed to generate  
information about 18F -MK-6240 binding in a large number of subjects over the spectrum from 
normal aging to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
Statistical  Methods  
The primary outcome measure will be regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) 
values for 18F-MK-[ADDRESS_214587] ANOVA with cognitive 
status (AD vs. MCI vs. normal) as independent variable. Effect of age and education will be 
determined in post -hoc analysis.

 1. Aims 1.1. The goal of this single arm Phase II study is to evaluate the prophylactic use of 
Trental and vitamin E for its efficacy in reducing radiation necrosis after 
radiosurgery. 
 2. Background and Significance 2.1. Hypothesis: 
2.1.1. Vitamin E and Trental are commonly used  in combination to treat cerebral 
radiation necrosis after ra diosurgery.  Use of these drugs after radiosurgery 
may serve as prophylaxis for and reduce the incidence of radiation necrosis. 
2.2. Background: 
2.2.1. Radiation Necrosis Review:   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Radiosurgery is widely used in th e treatment of various intracranial 
disorders such as metastatic brain tumors, meningiomas and 
arteriovenous malformations (1-3).  However, the use of radiosurgery is limited by [CONTACT_629719] n.  Although technological 
advances have considerably enha nced the safety and efficacy of 
radiosurgery, radiation necrosis con tinues to be a serious complication 
of treatment.  A recent study at our institution showed that 14% of metastatic lesions treated with radiosurgery exhibited imaging characteristics consistent with radi ation necrosis (4).  Several other 
studies have confirmed this obs ervation and have shown that 
radiographic changes can be present in up to 46% (5-7).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
radiation injury is categorized into  acute, subacute and chronic stages 
based upon the time between radiation treatment and onset of symptoms (8).  Imaging characterist ics are variable and can range from 
T2 FLAIR abnormalities to areas of contrast enhancement and frank necrosis.  Clinical symptoms can be  associated with these radiographic 
changes and can range from mild h eadaches to progressive neurologic 
deterioration.  Steroids are a comm only used form of treatment for 
radiation induced injury.  However, patients who progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_629715] E.  This combination has been widely used to treat radiation induced injury and will often reve rse both clinical and radiographic 
effects (9-16).  A recent randomized controlled trial showed that this combination is effective in the treatment of superficial radiation induced fibrosis over the chest, in patients receiving radiotherapy for 
breast cancer (13).  Also, a recent st udy suggested that the combination 
may be effective in the treatment of radiation induced brain injury (14). 
The goal of this study is to dete rmine whether this commonly used 
treatment for radiation necrosis can be  used prophylactica lly to prevent, 
delay and/or reduce the severity of cerebral radiation necrosis after 
radiosurgery.             
Amendment 2 04/25/[ADDRESS_839859].  He has published 
extensively in the field of radiation oncology and currently has an academic 
radiation oncology practice.  He has also had extensive experience in the 
diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system radiation necrosis.    
4. Experimental Design and Methods 4.1. Patient Registration: 
4.1.1. Only patients who meet eligibility  requirements may be registered. 
4.1.2. Once an eligible patient is identified by [CONTACT_1963], informed 
consent for participation in  the study is obtained.  
4.1.3. A baseline evaluation form and enrollment form (See Appendix B) is 
completed. 
4.2. Pretreatment Evaluation: 
4.2.1. Prior to initiation of treatment, a co mplete history and physical with a 
detailed neurologic exam ination is required.   
4.2.2. Evaluation of further metastatic dise ase may be performed as clinically 
indicated.  
4.3. Treatment Phase: 
4.3.1. Patients will receive a combination of  Trental [ADDRESS_839860] radiosurgery treatment. 
4.3.2. Patients will be monitored with regula r clinic visits and MRIs performed 
at 3 month intervals.  A follow up form (Appendix B) will be filled out by [CONTACT_555568]. 
4.3.3. All patients will be followed for an appropriate duration as clinically 
indicated.  
4.3.4. Enrolled patients that require additi onal radiosurgery will discontinue 
Trental and Vitamin E for the two weeks prior to the additional radiosurgery 
and resume treatment the day after.  These patients will remain on study, but 
the new site disease will not be fo llowed in the necrosis analysis. 
4.4. Data Analysis and Monitoring

4.4.3. As per the design, at the first stag e we would evaluate the results by 
[CONTACT_629721] [ADDRESS_839861] 
52 or more lesions in the study then th at would confirm we  should continue 
to complete the study with all 134 lesions. At that stage, if we find 14 or less 
lesions with radiation necrosis, we w ould then claim that the study has met 
its objective of a 50% reduc tion in incidence of radi ation necrosis (from 15% 
to 7.5%).  (see Appendix A)

requirement of steroid therapy, (2) 2 consecutive scans with 
persistent MRI changes consiste nt with radiation necrosis, 
(3) findings suggestive of radiation necrosis on MR 
Spectroscopy, or (4) histological evidence of radiation necrosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Once radiation necrosis is iden tified by [CONTACT_1963], 
parameters will be quantified us ing standard radiation oncology 
software tools by [CONTACT_2413] : LI.  The volume of contrast 
enhancement, T2 edema and necrosis will be quantified. 
4.5. Data storage and confidentiality 
4.5.1. Data will be maintained in a password protected database  and will only be

project.  
Amendment 2 04/25/12 
5. Estimated period of time to complete the study. 
5.1. It is estimated that the patient recruitment period will be 2 years and the follow up period will be one year.  Total estimated time to complete the study is 3 years.   
 
6. Human Subjects:  Describe the charac teristics of the re search population: 
6.1. Subjects will include patients receiving or planning to undergo single fraction or 
five fraction radiosurgery for a metastatic brain tumor.   
6.2. The demographics of the study population are expected to reflect the general 
population with intracranial meta static tumors.  Only adults >
 18 years of age 
will be included in the study. 
6.3. Recruitment: 
6.3.1. Patients seen at the University of Cincinnati Brain Tumor Center will be 
directly recruited by [CONTACT_3433] e treating physician.   
6.4. This study is estimated to require 49 patients.  In a recently published study performed at the University of Cincinnati (4), patients recruited to the study had 
an average of 2.75 metastatic lesions.  Each lesion was treated independently when analyzing the incidence of radiati on necrosis.  Using this same method, a 
total of 134 lesions are nece ssary to show a 50% effec tive reduction in radiation 
necrosis with our supplement.   This woul d be estimated to require 49 patients.   
6.5. Inclusion Criteria: 
6.5.1. Patients about to undergo or currently  receiving single or five fraction 
radiosurgery for a metastatic brain tumor. 
6.5.2. Diagnosis of a metastatic brain tumo r may be accomplished by [CONTACT_629725] a known history of cancer. 
6.5.3. Availability for follow up  
6.5.4. Ability to give informed consent.  
6.5.5. Age >
 [ADDRESS_839863] had partial or total resection of a metastatic tumor are 
eligible.

6.6.10. Patient who is on Warfarin, Lovenox, NSAIDS, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  Low dose (81 
mg) of daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_89325]. 
Amendment 2 04/25/12 
6.6.11. History of liver disorder 
6.6.12.  Intolerance to methylxanthines such as caffeine , theophylline, and 
theobromine. 
 
 
7. Risk/Benefit Assessment. 
7.1. The combination of vitamin E and Tren tal is a commonly used treatment for 
radiation induced injury to the brain as well as other body organs (9-14).  
7.2. Vitamin E ( α-tocopherol):   
7.2.1. It is thought that the therapeutic bene fits in combating radiation induced 
injury are due to its antioxidant properties and its inhibition of TGF-β  and 
collagen production (15,16).  As a co mmon component in over the counter 
multivitamins, the toxicity profile of vitamin E is low and the dosage of 400 IU BID used for the study presents minimal risk to the patient.   
7.3. Trental (Pent oxyfilline):  
7.3.1. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed for the potential 
benefits of Trental in radiation induced injury.  However, the exact 
mechanism is unclear.  Trental may d ecrease the inflammatory response and 
formation of oxygen radicals (2,9).  The dosage of Trental used in this study 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_629717].  Common 
side effects of Trental include gastro intestinal effects such as nausea, 
vomiting, dyspepsia; nervous system e ffects such as headache, dizziness, 
insomnia and cardiovascular effects such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], flushing and angina.  While typi[INVESTIGATOR_39326], side effects have necessitated 
discontinuation of Trental in approxima tely 3% of treated patients.   
7.4. The benefits of this stud y include the possibility of providing a prophylactic 
regimen for the prevention of radiation necrosis.     
8. Payment 8.1. None  
9. Subject Costs: 9.1. All tests and procedures involved in this  study are considered standard of care 
and would be the responsibility of the pati ent and/or  insurance.    Vitamin E is 
available over the counter and tr ental is available by [CONTACT_50246].

Summary Statements  
The optimal two-stage design to test th e null hypothesis that P<=0.850 versus the 
alternative that P>=0.950 has an expected sample size of  33.71 and a probability of early termination 
of 0.602. If the drug is actually no t effective, there is a 0.049 pr obability of concluding that 
it is (the target for this valu e was 0.050). If the drug is ac tually effective, there is a 
0.200 probability of concluding th at it is not (the target fo r this value was 0.200). After 
testing the drug on [ADDRESS_839868] stage,  the trial will be terminated if 11 or fewer 
respond. If the trial goes on to the second stage,  a total of 65 lesions  will be studied. If 
the total number responding is less than or equal to 59, the drug is rejected.

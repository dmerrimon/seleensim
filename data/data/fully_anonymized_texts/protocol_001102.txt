Design Multi -site r andomized trial comparing conventional  in-person  hearing 
health care (HHC) versus in -person HHC plus telehealth audiology 
sessions among existing hearing aid users . 
Sample Size and 
Population  This study is predicated on an already established cohort of existing 
hearing aid users with a fixed sample size from the original  Aging and 
Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders  (ACHIEVE) trial (N=490 hearing 
intervention cohort).  We conservatively estimate that N=[ADDRESS_367091]:   1) have been 
eligible for and participated in the hearing intervention arm of the 
ACHIEVE trial (see main original criteria below), 2) agree to be 
randomized to receive hearing care via continued conventional in-
person visits  or conventional in-person care with the addition of 
telehealth audiology sessions.  Participants randomized to 
conventional in-person care only would also receive telehealth 
sessions after one year, and 3) agree to participate and able and 
willing to be followed for 2 years  in the fol low-up study.  
Original ACHIEVE criteria:  Community -dwelling adults aged 70-84 
years with mild to moderate audiometric hearing impairment, and free 
from substantial cognitive impairment at baseline.  
Objectives Primary:   
1. To compare the effect of the telehealth hearing health care (HHC) 
versus conventional HHC delivery model s on hours of hearing aid 
use (primary outcome) at 1-year post -randomization. 
Secondary:  
2. To compare the effect of the telehealth HHC versus the conventi onal HHC delivery model on patient-centered hearing 
and communication outcomes, social  functioning, and quality of 
life at 1-year post-randomization.  
3. To compare utilization of hearing services required by [CONTACT_300734]. 
4. To evaluate the association of the telehealth HHC intervention with changes in hearing aid use and patient-centered hearing and 
communication, social functioning, and quality of life measures 
from baseline to up to two years post -intervention.  
Outcomes  Primary:   Average  daily hours of hearing  aid use at [ADDRESS_367092] 
number of hours  logged will be selected. 
Key secondary:   
• Treatment satisfaction, as assessed  by a single  item from the 
International  Outcome Inventory  – Comprehensive Hearing 
Intervention (IOI-CHI)  
• Ability  to hear for the primary communication goal, as assessed 
by a single  item from the Client-Oriented Scale of Improvement 
(COSI) goals  achievement questionnaire 
• Hearing-specific  quality  of life, as assessed  by [CONTACT_300735] (HHIE -S) 
questionnaire  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  7 Randomization and 
stratification  1:1 random  block randomization , stratified by [CONTACT_300736] 
(mild  vs. moderate or greater), cohort (originally recruited t o the 
ACHIEVE study from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study  
[ARIC] or de novo from the community), and field center to achieve 
balance among these factors between treatment arms.  Similar to 
ACHIEVE, spouse pairs will be randomized to the same treatment 
group.  
Study Interventions  Conventional HHC:  Participants randomized to continued 
conventional HHC group will, for the first year of this study, continue to 
receive the same c onventional, clinic -based hearing intervention 
received in the original ACHIEVE study , with clinic -based visits every 6 
months to reinforce self-management strategies and perform hearing 
aid checks .  In year two, participants randomized to continued 
conventional HHC will crossover  to receive telehealth HHC.  
Telehealth HHC:  The t elehealth HHC  intervention allows for remote 
access to hearing health care services and continuous support of 
participants’ hearing loss needs via telehealth in addition to 
conventional  clinic -based hearing booster sessions that occur every 6 
months.  Participants randomized to the telehealth HHC group will 
receive telehealth HHC for both years of the study.  
Participant  Duration  2 years , with data collection follow -up visits  occurring every 6 months  
Study Duration  5 years  
Statistical 
Methodology  Primary:  The primary analy sis compares hearing aid  utilization 
between groups randomized to telehealth HHC versus conventional 
HHC delivery model under the intention-to-treat paradigm, analyzing 
individuals according to their random allocation, irrespective of the 
treatment received.  Consistent with best practices in clinical trials, we 
will assess the comparability of the randomized groups with respect to known confounders (e.g., recruitment source, site, level of hearing 
impairment, Quick Speech in Noise score, self-reported acceptance of 
telehealth at baseline, self-reported and objectively measured baseline hours of hearing aid use, self-reported baseline hours of hearing 
assistive technologies  use, the number of days hearing log data was 
measured prior  to randomization, and the number of visits prior to 
randomization at which a participant provided hearing logging data).  
These variables will be considered as covariates in all models.  
We will use a weighted regression model with an identity link to compare average daily hours  of hearing aid use at 1-year post-
randomization between participants assigned to the telehealth HHC and conventional HHC.  To account for the non-normal distribution of 
the outcome, confidence intervals  and p-values  will be obtained using 
a bias corrected and accelerated bootstrap resampling procedure with 
10,000 replicates .

3 Study objectives and endpoints  
The aims of the Randomized Trial of Telehealth vs. Conventional Hearing Care Delivery in the 
ACHIEVE Study  (ACHIEVE Hearing Intervention Follow -Up, or ACHIEVE -HIFU) are: 
 Primary aims 
1. To compare the effect of the telehealth HHC versus the conventional HHC delivery model 
on hours of hearing aid use (primary outcome) at [ADDRESS_367093] number of hours logged will be selected.  
 
Secondary outcomes 
1. Treatment satisfaction, as assessed by a single item from the International Outcome 
Inventory – Comprehensive Hearing Intervention (IOI-CHI) .  The IOI-CHI is an 
interviewer -administered scale that consists of 6 items where participants self-report 
satisfaction with the hearing intervention using a 5-point Likert scale.  A  higher score 
indicates a more favorable outcome. 
2. Ability to hear for the primary communication goal, as assessed by a single item from the 
Client-O riented Scale of Improvement (COSI) goals achievement questionnaire.   COSI 
goals are rated using a 5-point Likert scale.  A higher score indicates the participant is 
able to hear more of the time. 
3. Hearing-specific quality of life, as assessed by [CONTACT_300737] (HHIE -S) questionnai re.  The HHIE -S is an interviewer -
administered questionnaire that consists of 10 items .  Participants rate whether hearing 
loss affects them in different situations (yes, sometimes, or no).  T he total score is the 
sum of all responses and ranges from  0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater 
hearing issues . 
 
Exploratory outcomes 
Exploratory analyses may include, but are not limited to: 
1. The 5 remaining items from the IOI- CHI, as well as a composite score created by 
[CONTACT_300738] 6 items. 
2. Ability to hear for the other two communication goals from the COSI goals achievement 
questionnaire, as well as a composite score created by [CONTACT_300738] 3 
goals . 
3. Telehealth acceptance, as assessed by [CONTACT_2702] -administered scale that consists 
of 5 items in which  participants rate the ease of use or utility of telehealth equipment 
using a 5-point Likert scale.  A higher score indicates  a more favorable rating.  Each item 
will be examined separately before being analyzed collectively as part of a composite 
score created by [CONTACT_300738] 5 items. 
4. Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes including, but not limited to, 
sex, race, and education.  Interactions between treatment assignment and subgroups 
will be tested relative to p < 0.10. 
5. The effect of treatment assignment on the total number of contacts between the provider 
and participant.   The total number of provider -participant contacts is  quantified by [CONTACT_300739].  In a supplemental 
analysis, the number of contacts will be examined across specific modalities, including 
face-to-face contact [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a clinic, face-to -face contact [CONTACT_300740] a clinic (e.g., home visits), 
and remote contact (e.g., video calls, phone calls, etc.).  
6. The effect of treatment assignment on the total time spent between the provider and 
participant.   The total number of minutes  during which the provider and participant

Background and rationale  
4.1 Hearing health care 
Age-related hearing loss in older adults fits the World Health Organization’s definition of a 
chronic health condition, with leading professional organizations recommending a 
comprehensive and multi -dimensional care process.1–3  In practice, however, hearing health 
care is predominately delivered via an acute care model that is biomedically focused, clinician-led, and device-centered .
4  Beginning with the initial clinical encounter, the case histories 
obtained by [CONTACT_300741], with little dialogue focused on the person’s psychological or functional difficulties or psychosocial 
concerns .
5  The application of a biomedical framework to the clinical decision-making process is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_300716], rather than the application of a comprehensive, multi -dimensional model of HHC advocated by [CONTACT_300742], education, and coaching aimed at improving self-efficacy and locus of control, within a self-management framework .
5,6  Although such non-technological activities are 
associated with positive outcomes, they are not routinely offered by [CONTACT_300743] .7 
 
Perhaps not surprisingly, current rates of hearing aid use among older adults with hearing loss 
in the U.S. are <20%, and rates of discontinuation of hearing aid use among older adults are high and estimated to be >30% .
8–[ADDRESS_367095] from a clinic, commonly from home.  Telehealth can be used to deliver 
services to adults with hearing loss including ongoing self-management support.12  While much 
research has focused on the influence of individual patient characteristics, attitudes, and beliefs 
on lack of hearing aid uptake and continued hearing aid use,13–17 there is increasing recognition 
that the current acute-care, clinic -based HHC model may itself be a leading contributor to low 
hearing aid uptake and utilization rates .4,18–[ADDRESS_367096] practice models of HHC through facilitating 
ongoing delivery of self- management support services outside the clinical setting.

4.2 ACHIEVE background 
ACHIEVE (ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; NIA R01AG055426, R01AG060502; 
MPIs:  Lin/Coresh) is a first-in-kind randomized trial to investigate if hearing loss treatment can 
reduce cognitive decline in older adults with hearing loss.  Recruitment actively began in 
January 2018 and ran through October 2019, with ACHIEVE enrolling 977 (~10/week) 
cognitively normal older adults with hearing loss, aged 70-84 year s.  Participants were 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_367097]-practices hearing intervention (hearing needs 
assessment, fitting of hearing devices, education/counseling; N=490) or a successful aging 
education intervention (individual sessions with a health educator covering healthy aging topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] ; 
N=487).  Semi -annual follow -up visits  for three years assess ed cognitive functioning and 
secondary outcomes . 
 
The ACHIEVE trial is nested within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive 
Study (ARIC -NCS).  ARIC is a large, biracial prospective cohort study that enrolled 15,792 
participants aged 45-64 years from four US communities in 1987-1989:  Jackson, MS, Forsyth 
County, NC, Washington County, MD, and Minneapolis, MN.  The Jackson cohort was entirely 
African-American , and the Forsyth County site was about 15% African-American, with other 
participants being primarily white.  ARIC participants have received multiple assessments of 
cardiovascular risk factors, measurement of microvascular and macrovascular markers, cognitive testing, PET amyloid, and brain MRI over the last 30 years.  The ARIC study is well 
described with over 1700 papers published in peer -reviewed journals .
23  The ACHIEVE -HIFU  
study brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of established investigators and leverages 
the existing research infrastructure, scientific expertise, and well -characterized participant 
cohort of ARIC -NCS.  The 977 participants in ACHIEVE were recruited from the existing ARIC -
NCS cohort (N=238) and de novo from the surrounding communities (N=739). 
 
4.3 Preliminar y studies of telehealth HHC  
Our preliminary studies to assess the feasibility of telehealth HHC delivery were guided by 
[CONTACT_300744] .24  We began with an online 
survey of the ACHIEVE study audiologists to determine whether or not components of the 
conventional hearing intervention could or should be provided via telehealth.  Audiologists’ 
responses guided decisions regarding the inclusion of procedures at specific points in time over 
the course of intervention.  The results revealed that after the initial clinic -based sessions, many 
follow -up procedures and counseling could be delivered remotely.  We used the audiologists’ 
responses to help develop our multi-site fidelity monitoring plan for implementation of a 
manualized telehealth-supported HHC model for  ACHIEVE -HIFU.  Our team then adapted the 
parent ACHIEVE manualized hearing intervention to incorporate telehealth to support long-term HHC.  
 We conducted an initial feasibility study of the adapted telehealth hearing intervention among a 
convenience sample of [ADDRESS_367098]-time hearing aid users, 6 male and 4 female, aged 70 -91 years 
old, who were sampled from a clinical population at the University of South [LOCATION_012] in 2019.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria matched that in the parent ACHIEVE trial, with the additional 
requirement of access to a smartphone.  During our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we identified two major barriers 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  12 to successful remote HHC delivery:  1) a vailability of a compatible smartphone/tablet with 
adequate internet connection speed, and 2) p articipant unfamiliarity with telehealth HHC and 
challenges with how to use a telehealth platform.  In order to address these barriers, we 
incorporated the GrandPad device into our  ACHIEVE-HIFU telehealth protocol.  The GrandPad 
is an internet-enabled tablet that was specifically designed for use by [CONTACT_21140], has been 
effectively implemented at scale for telemedicine, and comes with manufacturer support 
servi ces to ensure that older adults can effectively use the device.  
 
5 Study population and eligibility  
This study is predicated on an already established cohort with a fixed sample size from the 
original ACHIEVE trial (N=490 for the clinic -based hearing intervention cohort).  All participants 
currently in the ACHIEVE hearing intervention group will be invited to join this follow -up study, 
and accounting for los s to follow up and refusal to continue participating, we conservatively 
estimate that N=[ADDRESS_367099] meet the following criteria:  
1. Eligible for and participated in the hearing intervention arm of the ACHIEVE trial (see 
original  criteria below)  
2. Agree to be randomized to receive hearing care via either a telehealth or  conventional 
delivery model  for the first year before being offered telehealth options, and 
3. Agree to participate and able and willing to be followed for two years in the follow -up 
study.  
ACHIEVE participants who have developed cognitive impairment are eligible for ACHIEVE -
HIFU if they are willing to participate and are consented with a proxy (see section 6.1 below ). 
Original ACHIEVE inclusion criteria:  
• Age 70-84 years  
• Community dwelling, fluent English speaker  
• Availability of participant in area for study duration  
• Adult-onset hearing impairment, defined as four -frequency pure tone average (PTA, 0.5-
4kHz,  better ear) ≥  30 dB & < 70 dB  
• Speech recognition scores in quiet ≥ 60% in better ear  
• MMSE ≥ 23 for high school degree or less; ≥ 25 for some college or more 
Original ACHIEVE exclusion criteria: 
• Reported disability in ≥  2 activities of daily living (ADLs) 
• Vision impairment (worse than 20/[ADDRESS_367100]) 
• Self-reported use of a hearing aid in the past 1 year  
• Medical contraindication to use of hearing aids (e.g., draining ear)  
• Unwilling to wear hearing aids on daily basis 
• Conductive hearing impairment with air -bone gap > 15 dB in two or more contiguous 
frequencies in both ears  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  13  
5.2 Recruitment  and retention 
The parent ACHIEVE cohort has already been recruited, and all participants assigned to the 
hearing intervention (N=490) in the parent study presenting for their final 3-year visit and who 
are willing and able to be followed for an additional two years will be eligible for inclusion in this 
proposed study.  We expect that nearly all participants will choose to enroll in this follow -up 
study for the following reasons :  1) Continued enrollment in the study ensures that participants 
will have continued long -term access to free care and management of their hearing aids with 
their study audiologist, with whom they have an established relationship (in contrast, 
participants would otherwise be responsible for covering on their own future costs related to 
replacement/repair of their hearing technologies and follow -up visits with another audiologist); 2)  
All participants will be provided with a free GrandPad for use for the duration of their participation in this follow -up study; and 3) Participants have been strongly engaged with this 
study , as evidenced by [CONTACT_300745], which is likely driven by [CONTACT_300746].  We will also continue to use retention 
strategies for ACHIEVE participants that been highly effective to date.  In brief, some of these 
strategies include:  provision of transportation to sessions and home visits as needed, mailed 
newsletters, birthday and holiday cards, reminder cards and phone calls, small study incentives (e.g., tote bags, mugs, calendars, etc.), and meals/snacks provided at study visits.  
 The following procedures are also implemented in order to enhance retention:   
• When scheduling sessions , participants will be asked about their preferred time and date 
• When scheduling in-person clinic visits, participants will be asked about: 
o How participants prefer to get to the clinic visit  
o Need for assistance getting to or moving around the clinic  
o Existence of any medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, dietary restrictions) which might affect the examination and/or type of snack provided  
• Reminder calls will be placed and/or reminder packets will be mailed to the participant 
prior to the scheduled appointment as needed, confirming the study session date and 
time 
• Free parking is provided to all participants for in-person sessions  
• Participants will be reimbursed for travel costs, or transportation will be covered for a 
participant if he/she is not able to drive and/or obtain a ride to attend a study visit  
• Participant study incentives will include study -related items (GrandPad device, pens, 
bags, mailed holiday cards, etc.) and/or modest payments (~$20 to ~$40) for 
participating in each study visit [individual field sites will determine the participant 
incentives to provide based on their previous experience and knowledge of their 
participants and community]  
• Participants will be contact[CONTACT_300747]/or mail to reschedule the appointment if participants fail to arrive for a scheduled appointment or cancel their appointment to 
encourage continued participation and to identify and overcome barriers to participation 
• Home or telephone-based visits by [CONTACT_300748] (e.g., from illness or injury)  
[these visits will be informed by [CONTACT_300749] ] 
 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  14 Each no-show case will be individually reviewed by [CONTACT_300750].  Efforts to engage the 
participant will include a combination of telephone contacts, letters, and the possibility of offering 
an abbreviated visit.  Field site staff, in consultation with the study coordinator and/or field site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or hearing intervention unit/analysis and study governance unit, will determine how long to continue contact [CONTACT_300751].  A participant will only be considered “withdrawn” if he/she explicitly 
requests to withdraw from the study.  Participants are free to refuse, or re-enter the study 
protocol after refusal , at any time. 
 
6 
Participant rights and confidentiality 
6.1 Informed consent  
A signed consent form is obtained from each participant by [CONTACT_7355]. The 
consent form describes the purpose of the study, how randomization works, the procedures to 
be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation.  The consent process inform s a 
volunteer about the study, indicates that participation is voluntary, and that the participant has the right to stop at any time.  Risks are enumerated in the informed consent form and described 
orally during the consent process.  
 The purpose of the informed consent form is: 
• To inform the prospective participant as much and as accurately as possible about:  
o The procedures involved in the study  
o What is expected of participants who consent to enroll  
o What the study can and cannot provide to the participant  
o What are the reasonable risks and benefits  
o What are the alternatives to participation 
• To document the participant’s consent to participate in all of the respective study 
procedures  
• To provide a prospective participant with a legal document summarizing the study and 
his or her rights as a study participant 
• To provide the participant with ongoing explanations and continuing information that help 
the participant decide whether to begin or continue in the research study  
 Re-obtaining consent in the event of consent changes 
• If substantive changes to the consent form occur after the participant has signed the consent form at the randomization visit, the participant will be informed of the changes 
prior to their next study visit or interaction.  
• Whenever possible and permitted by [CONTACT_1201], verbal  re-consent will be obtained from the 
participant and documented by [CONTACT_154323]’s chart. 
• If written re-consent is required for changes to the consent form, re-consent can occur in 
person or remotely.  Remote consent would be obtained by [CONTACT_300752][INVESTIGATOR_300717], having trained study personnel review the 
updated consent form, noting the changes, ensuring the participant understands the 
changes, and asking the participant to sign one copy of the form and mail it back.  Upon 
receipt, the study personnel who obtained consent would sign the form and document 
the consent process in a note in the participant’s chart.  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  15  
Re-obtaining consent in the event of cognitive impairment 
• Although those with dementia were not enrolled at baseline of the parent ACHIEVE trial , 
given the age of the cohort, some participants may have developed or may in the future 
develop cognitive impairment over the course of the study.  Participants  determined to 
have significantly reduced cognitive capacity and who wish to take part or remain in this 
follow -up study will be re-consented with consent from a designated proxy. 
• If re-consent with a proxy is required during the course of the follow -up study, the re-
consent may occur in person or remotely.  Remote consent would be obtained by [CONTACT_300753][INVESTIGATOR_300718], having trained study personnel review the 
consent form with the proxy and participant over the telephone (answering questions and 
ensuring understanding) , and having the proxy and participant sign one copy of the form 
and mail it back.  Upon receipt, the study personnel who obtained consent would sign the 
form and document the consent process in a note in the participant’s chart. 
• We will use procedures established by [CONTACT_300754]-making capacity .  Given the minimal risk associated with the study procedures, 
relatively conservative criteria will be used to trigger re-consent with a proxy.  These 
criteria include:  (1) a diagnosis of dementia based on cognitive testing at any of the 
study sessions, or (2) judgment of our trained staff at the time of a study session.  These 
criteria adhere to the published recommendations of the Alzheimer’s Association.25 
 
6.2 Participant confidentiality  
Data from the ACHIEVE -HIFU  study  are used only in aggregate, and no identifying 
characteristics of individuals will be published or presented.  Per the existing parent study 
(ACHIEVE and ARIC) protocols, results of select testing (weight, body mass index, and blood 
pressure) are given to participants, and they can choose to share those data with their health 
care provider.  Study results of depressive symptoms, blood pressure, or cognition, which may 
indicate the need for referral for medical care, will be provided to participants, who are 
encouraged to share the results with their private physician.  If participants have given 
permission, the results  may also be  sent to participants ’ private physicians.  Information, 
including results of testing to be shared with a participant’s primary care physician, is not released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by 
[CONTACT_1744]. 
 Confidentiality of data is maintained by [CONTACT_300755].  This study utilizes safeguards established as part of the parent studies  
(ARIC and ACHIEVE) to ensure the security and privacy of participants’ study records.  
Research records are kept in locked file cabinets within locked rooms at the study site.  Only 
selected study personnel will have access to participants’ study records on a need-to-know  
basis.  Data are stored on password-protected computers with regularly updated virus software.  
Identifying information is only kept in the files where it is necessary for the conduct of the study 
and linkage to other files.  In analysis files, study IDs only are used to identify participants.  
 In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 
Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information of the Department of Health 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  16 and Human Services, study staff access protected health information (PHI ) and medical records 
only after receiving signed informed consent or a HIPAA waiver of authorization.  Participants’ 
medical records that are obtained for review and abstraction are kept in a locked cabinet that is 
separate from other file cabinets.  Only selected study personnel have access to these files.  
 
7 Study assessments and procedures 
As part of this study, participants will complete interviews, questionnaires, audiometric 
evaluations, neurocognitive assessments, and measures of physical functioning that mirror 
those completed as part of the parent ACHIEVE trial.  To reduce participant burden, data from 
the final visit in the parent ACHIEVE trial (year 3 follow -up) will serve as baseline data for this 
follow -up study.  The schedule is shown in 7.1 and descriptions  of each of the activities, 
evaluations, or assessments are provided in the sections that follow the table.  Full details on 
data collection and measurements can be found in the Manual of Procedures. 
 
7.1 Schedule of activities  
Table 1 details which data will be gathered and when.  Data collection visits may be split across 
multiple days or multiple settings (clinic visits, home visits, telephone contacts, or video calls) to 
meet the needs of our participants.  Some items related to exploratory  outcomes might be 
dropped based upon participant burden, scientific considerations, or available resources.

ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  19 7.2 Hearing intervention assessment  
7.2.1 Intervention Check-Up  
The ACHIEVE -HIFU Intervention Check -Up includes assessments of the following components 
related to the hearing intervention at the in-person semi -annual and annual visits, and some of 
the components, as noted below, during both scheduled and unscheduled remote encounters.  
• Hearing a ids:  usage of all hearing aids is documented [all contacts]  
• Real-ear aided response:   real-ear measure to verify the gain and output of hearing 
aids [in-person visits only; as needed] 
• Speech intelligibility index:   a calculated estimate from the real -ear measurements 
that indicates the amount of the speech signal available to the participants when wearing 
their hearing aids  [in-person visits only; as needed]  
• Hearing aid data logging:  hearing aid use is obtained from the device data log within 
the hearing aid manufacturer software, including the total hours of use and average 
hours of use per day [in- person visits only]  
• Hearing assistive technologies (HAT):   usage of HATs is documented [all contacts]  
• Quick speech in noise (QuickSIN; aided):  assesses speech recognition in noise 
utilizing the hearing aids, where sentences are presented in the presence of background 
noise, and the participant repeats back what they heard [in- person annual visits  only] 
7.2.[ADDRESS_367101] and its duration, along with type/mode of contact, will be 
documented by [CONTACT_300756].  Both scheduled contacts (documented as part of the 
Intervention Check -Up) and unscheduled contacts  will be documented. 
7.2.3 International Outcome Inventory for Comprehensive Hearing I ntervention 
The International Outcome Inventory for Comprehensive Hearing Intervention (IOI-CHI) is a 
brief, 6-item measure adapted from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-
HA)26 .  The IOI-CHI is used to determine benefit from the hearing intervention following a 
sustained period of regular use.  
7.2.4 Client -Oriented Scale of Improvement 
The Client-Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI)27 is a cl inical tool developed by [CONTACT_300757] (NAL) for outcomes measurement.  It is an assessment questionnaire 
used to document a participant’s goals/needs  and progress towards achieving those goals . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_367102]’s professional discretion, some 
components of the assessment can be omitted.  Cerumen management by [CONTACT_300758].  Participants with more severe cerumen impactions that cannot be 
easily cleared by [CONTACT_300759] -the-counter cerumenolytic ear 
drops (e.g., Debrox, Murine) and advised to follow -up with their primary care provider or an 
otolaryngologist.  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.[ADDRESS_367103]’s professional discretion, this measurement can be omitted if hearing is stable since last evaluation.  
7.3.3 Tympanometry 
Objective measurement that determines integrity of the tympanic membrane/ossicles and 
assists in determination of a sensorineural hearing loss free of middle ear problems. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_367104] Recognition in Quiet  
Confirms that the speech percepti on abilities are consistent with a hearing loss that can be 
helped through traditional hearing aid intervention .
29 
7.3.5 Quick Speech in Noise (unaided) 
The QuickSIN30,[ADDRESS_367105] that meas ures the signal -to-noise (SNR) necessary 
for a listener to correctly identify 50% of key words on sentences presented in a babble 
background noise.  A listener’s abilities to understand speech in noisy backgrounds cannot be 
predicted by [CONTACT_300760], and this measure provides a tool to counsel the participant on 
realistic expectations for success with hearing aids and guides intervention decisions regarding 
hearing assistive technology (e.g., remote FM microphone).  
 
7.4 Social  functioning and quality of life  
7.4.1 Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D)  
The CES -D Short Form is a 12-item form to assess depressive symptoms, derived from the 
original 20-item CES -D.37  In addition to a reduced administration time and clearer response 
options (relative to the 20-item version), the Short Form is highly correlated with the original (r > 
.94), has a high internal consistency, retains the same factor structure as the original, and has a 
similar positive predictive value as a screening tool for identifying clinical depression.  The 
questionnaire is administered by [CONTACT_30230] , and is scored 0-24. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_367106] of hearing loss .
39  This questionnaire  assesses the social and emotional components of 
perceived hearing impairment such as embarrassment, and limits on personal and social life.  
7.4.3 RAND-36 Health Survey 
The 36-item RAND Health Survey , assesses health-related quality of life.40  It is a generic 
measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  21 7.4.4 Social Network Index  
The Cohen Social Network Index (SNI) is an interviewer -administered questionnaire to gather 
social network data.41  The Social Network Index evaluates two outcome variables:  1) Social 
Netwo rk Diversity – n umber of social roles in which the participant had regular contact [CONTACT_300761] 2 weeks, and 2) People in Social Network – t otal number of people 
with whom the participant had regular contact (at least once every 2 weeks) . 
7.4.5 UCLA Loneliness Scale 
This interviewer-administered questionnaire42 measures subjective ratings of social isolation 
and loneliness (e.g., lacking companionship, feeling left out, and isolated from others, among 
others). 
7.4.[ADDRESS_367107]. 
 
7.5 Covariates  
7.5.1 Health history questionnaire 
This is an interviewer-administered questionnaire that documents a number of chronic diseases 
or conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, among 
others). 
7.5.[ADDRESS_367108] neurologic diagnoses and treatments.  This 
information will be used as possible covariates and by [CONTACT_300762]/dementia adjudicators.  
7.5.3 Anthropometry 
Participant height and weight will be measured using standardized study  protocols from the 
parent studies (ARIC/ACHIEVE).  Anthropometric measures include height, weight, waist and 
hip circumference, and body fat.  
7.5.4 Seated blood pressure 
Seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured using standardized study 
protocols from the parent studies (ARIC/ACHIEVE).  
7.5.[ADDRESS_367109] questionnaire 
This brief questionnaire asks questions about how the coronavirus pandemic, or COVID -19, has 
affected the participant.  
7.5.6 Telehealth acceptance questionnaires 
Ques tions assess the participant’s comfort with and acceptance of telehealth HHC both prior to 
start of the telehealth intervention and after starting the telehealth intervention.  
 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.[ADDRESS_367110] differences in physical activity and s edentary 
behaviors.  
7.6.3 Falls and mobility 
This interviewer-administered questionnaire records living circumstances, self-reported physical 
ability, fatigue, and falls.  
7.6.4 Grip strength 
Grip strength will be measured using standardized study protocols from the parent studies 
(ARIC/ACHIEVE).  Grip strength is objectively assessed with a handheld dynamometer.  After a 
practice trial, participants are asked to complete two trials, squeezing as hard as possible, with a 15-[ADDRESS_367111] or hand, for example arthritis or tendonitis.  This information is recorded on 
the data collection form. 
7.6.5 Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  
The Short Physical Performance Battery
44 will be conducted using standardized study protocols 
from the parent studies (ARIC/ACHIEVE).  The SPPB is a series of physical performance tests 
designed to assess lower extremity function in older adults.  The SPPB ranges in score from 0-
12; higher scores indicate better function.  The total score is the sum of 3 component scores:  
chair stands, balance, and 4-meter walk  gait speed; each component score ranges from 0-4. 
Exclusion from any performance test is based on examiner assessment or participant concerns 
that the test would be unsafe.  Walking aids are allowed during the 4-meter  walk only, if 
participants feel they are necessary.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_367112] been published 
and are enumerated in the Manual of Procedures .  Briefly, MCI and dementia syndromic 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  23 diagnoses are determined by a panel of clinicians , taking into account performance on the 
neuropsychological  battery (test scores are compared to age, education, and race-specific 
norms), cognitive decline across study visits, and subject and informant interviews regarding 
cognitive functional status.  Based on these elements, all examined participants have a 
computer-algorithmic classification followed by [CONTACT_300763]-adjudicated review.  The computer 
algorithm, also developed by [CONTACT_300764] -NCS, has been used successfully to 
enhance uniformity in applying the diagnostic criteria.  In ARIC -NCS, the computer algorithm -
reviewer agreement was high:  99% for normal, 94% for MCI, and 95% for dementia, suggesting 
that the algorithm accords well with clinical judgment.  The informant interviews noted above are 
conducted with a knowledgeable informant at every exam where the participants meet a priori 
criteria for poor cognitive performance and who have significant cognitive decline from prior 
exams.  
7.7.1 Neurological interviews 
The neurologic interviews include the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).  In addition, the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) is 
used in determining a participant’s level of daily functioning, but does not have a dedicated interview or form; rather, all FAQ items are embedded within the CDR interview.  Each of the 
measures are well -validated, standardized instruments that have been widely used in both 
clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_300719]. 
7.7.2 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)  
The CDR gives important information about daily functioning, and is a required element in the 
determination as to whether an individual is demented or has MCI, or is normal.  The CDR 
includes the CDR Participant (CDP), and the CDR Informant (CDI), and the CDR Summary (CDS).   
The CDP (the portion of the CDR administered to the participant) is administered by a certified 
staff member.  The CDI is administered by a certified staff member with a knowledgeable 
informant.  After completion of these two components (and not in the presence of the subject or informant), a trained staff member will score the CDR (on the CDS form) based on the 
responses to the questions on both the CDP and CDI.  The CDR scores range from 0 (normal) 
to 3 (severe impairment) for each of the following 6 areas:  memory, orientation, judgment and 
problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.  
7.7.3 Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ)  
The FAQ score is embedded within the CDR.  Scores range from 0 (normal function), 1 (has 
difficulty, but does by [CONTACT_6270]), 2 (requires assistance), to 3 (dependent).  There are [ADDRESS_367113] which are also FAQ questions (there are 10 FAQ questions; one CDR question 
encompasses two FAQ questions).  
7.7.4 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)  
The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_300720].  This scale is completed with a knowledgeable informant after the CDI.  
 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  24 7.8 Neurocognitive battery 
This study  will utilize the neurocognitive battery  (described below) that was previously  
administered in ARIC-NCS32 and the parent ACHIEVE trial.  Four cognitive domains  are derived 
from factor  scores .33  These domains  include:  
• Global function 
• Memory  
• Executive function  
• Language 
7.8.[ADDRESS_367114], and the participant is asked to repeat back the sentence.  Participants are scored on the number of target words repeated back correctly (3 
target words/sentence).  Steps on how to proceed with neurocognitive testing if audibility is not 
established are outlined in the Manual of Procedures .  The parent ACHIEVE Steering 
Committee developed this protocol to guard against poor speech understanding from hearing loss directly confounding administration of neurocognitive tests with auditory stimul i.  
7.8.2 Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 
The MMSE was developed as a brief, standardized instrument for screening a limited number of 
cognitive functions .
[ADDRESS_367115] (DWRT)  
The DWRT is a measure of verbal memory that requires the participant to recall a list of [ADDRESS_367116] and use it in a sentence.  This procedure is repeated, providing two exposures to the 
words.  Following an approximate 5-minute delay, during which the (non- verbal) digit symbol 
substitution test (DSST) is given, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible.  
Scores range from [ADDRESS_367117] (DSST)  
The DSST is a measure of psychomotor speed and sustained attention.  Besides its own value, 
the DSST also serves as a nonverbal distracter task, interposed between learning and recall for 
the DWRT above.  The participant is asked to translate numbers (1-9) to symbols using a key 
provided at the top of the test form.  The participant is provided with a pencil (without an eraser).  
Instructions are provided in a deliberate and slow pace.  One point is given for each correctly 
drawn symbol completed within the 90-second time limit.  Scores range from 0-93.  
7.8.[ADDRESS_367118] symbols as 
he/she can remember, in any order.  Next, the participant is asked to write down the number 
that was paired with each of the symbols from the DSST.  Two scores are yielded:  1) Free 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  25 Recall:  total number of symbols recalled, regardless of pairing, and 2) Pairing:  number of 
correct symbols correctly  paired with corresponding numbers.  Scores for each range from 0-9. 
7.8.[ADDRESS_367119] Part A (TMT A)  
The TMT A is a timed task in which participants connect numbers in sequence as quickly as 
possible.  TMT measures attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual search and motor 
function.  In TMT A, the participant is asked to draw a line and connect a series of numbers 
(from 1 -25) as quickly as possible.  Prior to the test part, the participant is given a sample test to 
demonstrate the task.  The score for TMT A is the number of seconds required to complete the 
task.  A maximum of 240 seconds (4 minutes) and [ADDRESS_367120] Part B (TMT B)  
The TMT Part B is a timed task in which participants connect letters and numbers in sequence 
as quickly as possible.  TMT measures attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual 
search and motor function.  In TMT B, the participant is asked to draw a line and connect a 
series of numbers and letters, alternating between a given number and letter (e.g., 1 to A, A to 
2, 2 to B, B to 3, etc.) as quickly as possible.  Prior to the test part, the participant is given a 
sample test to demonstrate the task.  The score for TMT B is the number of seconds required to 
complete the task.  A maximum of 240 seconds (4 minutes) and [ADDRESS_367121], part of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised version, provides a measure of 
immediate and delayed verbal recall for the number of ideas presented in two stories , which are 
read to the participant.  Two stories are read to the participant, each at a slow and deliberate 
pace.  After each story is presented, the participant is asked to recall as much of the story as 
possible.  The Logical Memory I score provides a measure of immediate recall and is calculated 
as the average number of ideas recalled from Story A and B.  Each story  contains 25 scoring 
units, the maximum score is 25 (25+25/2).  
An approximate 20-minute delay follows, during which the remaining (non-memory) tests are 
administered.  Following the delay period, the participant is again asked to recall the stories.  
The Logical Memory II score provides a measure of delayed recall and is calculated as the average number of story elements recalled from Story A and B.  As each story contains 25 
scoring units, the maximum score is 25 (25+25/2). 
7.8.9 Digit Span B ackwards 
Digit Span Backwards is part of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and provides a measure 
of attention and working memory.  The participant is read a series of numbers progressively 
increasing in length from two to eight digits.  After the numbers are read, the participant is asked 
to repeat the numbers in the reverse order.  Two tr ials at each digit length are performed (i.e., 2 
trials with 2 digits, 2 trials with 3 digits, etc.).  The test is discontinued after two consecutive 
errors of the same length item.  Scores range from 0-12. 
7.8.[ADDRESS_367122] assesses  visual naming ability using black -and- white drawings of 
common objects.  For this study, the 30-item version used by [CONTACT_300765]'s 
Coordinating Centers Uniform Data Set will be used.  The participant is presented with a series 
of line drawings of objects and asked to name [CONTACT_300784].  The items become progressive ly 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.[ADDRESS_367123] is a measure of verbal functioning.  In this task, the participant is ask ed 
to produce as many words as possible that begin with the letters ‘F’ , ‘A’, and ‘S’ within a time 
limit of 60 seconds for each letter, avoiding proper nouns, variations, plurals, and repetitions.  
The score is the total number of admissible words produced across letters. 
7.8.12  Animal Naming 
Animal Naming is a measure of category fluency (semantic association).  Category fluency, and 
specific ally animal naming, is part of the [LOCATION_011] Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, the Stanford-
Binet test, and the CERAD.  The participant is asked to name [CONTACT_300785] a 60-second time limit.  The score is given as the sum of all admissible names. 
7.8.13 Telephone neurocognitive assessment  
In the event that a participant is unable to be scheduled for an in -person visit (at the field site or 
at home) to complete the neurocognitive battery, a version of the neurocognitive battery modifi ed for telephone administration may instead be administered.  The content of the 
Ensuring Speech Understanding test, the Digit Span Backwards test, and Animal Naming test 
remains the same as described above but with some modifications to instructions for telephone 
administration.  The content of the CDP (see section 7.7.2) remains the same, but the order of 
administration has been modified for use over the telephone.  The W ord Fluency test has been 
shortened to collect on 'F' and 'A' words  only, with 'S' words dropped. 
In lieu of the visual DWRT, an oral 10-item word list memory measure (CERAD, The 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease)
[ADDRESS_367124] the study early 
A final interview will be attempted with all participants who are either unable (e.g., due to illness) 
or unwilling to complete the study.  Trained interviewers will collect information by [CONTACT_300766]-comp liant video call regarding the reason for withdrawal and offer to schedule a home 
visit/telephone/video call for an abbreviated final study session.  In the absence such a session, 
because dropouts may be more likely to have dementia, we will attempt to as certain dementia 
status using a telephone -based/video call -based  assessment with the participant or informant 
interview conducted with a knowledgeable informant.  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  27 In the case where the participant is alive and able to communicate by [CONTACT_648]/video call, we wi ll 
administer the Six Item Screener (SIS).  The SIS is a short instrument developed to identify 
cognitive impairment in older adults.  In the case where the participant has died or is otherwise 
unable to communicate by [CONTACT_648]/video call, dementia status will be characterized by [CONTACT_300767]/video call using the AD8--a brief instrument, derived from the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale, developed to discriminate between normal aging and dementia.  
Notably, these procedures parallel ARIC’s ongoing dementia surveillance methods.  For ARIC 
participants, additional sources of information may also be used to complete ascertainment of dementia cases (e.g., discharge codes from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], CMS, and ICD codes on death 
certificates).

Randomization 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the telehealth HHC vs. conventional HHC 
delivery groups.  Randomization will be carried out using random blocks of sizes 2, 4, and 8, 
and will be stratified by [CONTACT_300768] (mild vs. moderate or greater), cohort (originally 
recruited from the ARIC Study or de novo from the community), and field center  to achieve 
balance among these factors between HHC arms . 
 
ACHIEVE enrolled some spouses/cohabitating partners who were randomized together.  
Spouses or cohabitating partners in this follow -up study will also be randomized together.  T hey 
will be randomized as a unit with, arbitrarily, the first spouse/partner  of the pair to be selected 
according to the random assignment procedure and the second spouse/partner  of the pair 
receiving the same assignment.  Spouse/partner pairs will be randomized in spouse/partner -pair 
specific permuted order blocks of varying sizes within strata defined by [CONTACT_300769] (at 
least one spouse/partner  pair in ARIC or both non-ARIC participants) and by [CONTACT_300770].  
 Randomization will be performed after the baseline data for this follow -up study have been 
collected.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_367125] staff (except one unblinded statistician) will remain blinded to accumulating 
data.   Additionally, study participants will be blinded to study hypotheses.  
 This study design that incorporates the GrandPad for all participants minimizes  potential bias 
(i.e., all participants receive a GrandPad, reducing the possibility that better outcomes with the telehealth HHC intervention are only due to those participants having access to a GrandPad) 
and allows for a direct efficacy study of whether telehealth HHC can improve outcomes when 
barriers to telehealth technology are effectively reduced. 
 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  28 9 Interventions  
9.1 All participants 
At the ACHIEVE trial year 3 visit, which will serve as the ACHIEVE -HIFU baseline visit, all 
participants will complete the hearing intervention check -up (see 7.2.1 above), and the 
audiologist will address any hearing aid maintenance or repairs, as needed. 
 
At the ACHIEVE-HIFU randomization visit, after providing informed consent, participants will be 
randomized to receive either continued conventional clinic -based HHC or telehealth HHC 
delivery  in addition to clinic -based care.  All participants will complete the Telehealth 
Acceptance Pre-Intervention questionnaire before they will be given a GrandPad tablet wi th 
general instructions on how to set it up, an overview of its basic functionality, and how to access manufacturer support services.  Prior to being informed of their randomized group, all 
participants will meet with the audiologist to complete COSI goal setting and complete the 
hearing intervention check -up (HICF).   Participants will then be informed of their randomization 
assignments.  
Participants randomized to the telehealth HHC delivery group will receive their first telehealth 
session at the end of the randomization visit, and they will continue to receive telehealth HHC 
for both years of the study, with clinic -based care occurring every [ADDRESS_367126] telehealth session at the end of the 
Year 1 visit, and receive telehealth HHC for the second year of the study.   The telehealth and 
conventional HHC delivery models are described next. 
9.2 
Telehealth hearing health c are 
We designed a hearing health care (HHC)  service delivery model that leverages telehealth in 
order to provide more accessible long-term support of older adults using hearing aids.  The 
telehealth HHC service delivery model allows for remote access to HHC services and 
continuous support of participants’ hearing loss needs via telehealth to complement clinic -based 
hearing booster sessions that occur every [ADDRESS_367127] of:  
1. Participant instruction in use of the GrandPad for telehealth sessions  
2. Re-introduction of the Hearing Loss Toolkit for Self-Management and C2Hear reusable 
learning objectives ( RLOs ) within the context of the telehealth platform  
3. Individual h earing and communication needs  assessment, including review of technical 
intervention, optimizing the hearing intervention for telehealth sessions, and discussion of how telehealth can be used to achieve COSI goals  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  29 9.2.2 Telehealth Sessions B and C 
Two follow -up intervention sessions (at approximately [ADDRESS_367128]-
randomization) will occur via GrandPad video call (or telephone if the participant does not 
choose to use the GrandPad) .  These sessions will primarily be individualized counseling 
sessions and will consist of: 
1. HIFU Intervention Check -Up components that can be collected remotely (i.e., hearing 
aid use, HAT use) 
2. Assessment of COSI goals achievement  
3. Discuss participants’ comfort with the telehealth platform  
9.2.3 Asynchronous provider-to-participant telehealth communications 
Clinician -initiated self-management suggestions related to the participant’s communication 
goals will be sent asynchronously via the email/text function on the GrandPad approximately 1-2 
times per month or communicated via telephone or other modalities if the participant does not 
use the GrandPad.  These asynchronized contacts could include reminders about:  
1. Reviewing the Hearing Loss Toolkit for Self-Management exercises related to their set 
COSI goals  
2. C2Hear RLOs  
3. Support of any device cleaning and hearing aid troubleshooting 
4. Hearing assistive technology (HAT) use 
 
These asynchronous contacts can lead to synchronous telehealth encounter s or even an in-
clinic visit if determined to be necessary by [CONTACT_300771].  As in 
the parent ACHIEVE study, participants will be able to reach out to the audiologist to initiate an 
interim visit/encounter to address any unanticipated needs if they arise, with a shift to telehealth 
visits as the first option for participants receiving the telehealth HHC delivery model . 
9.[ADDRESS_367129]-practices hearing intervention 
approach46 that is currently being implemented in the parent ACHIEVE trial based on the World 
Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO ICF)
47 biopsychosocial framework.   In line with the WHO ICF framework , the main goal of 
intervention is improving a person’s quality of life by [CONTACT_300772].  The parent ACHIEVE h earing intervention begins with a 
comprehensive audiological assessment, followed by [CONTACT_300773]  (HATs).  C ounseling and education aimed at 
supporting hearing loss self-management skills are an integral component of the ACHIEVE 
hearing intervention, and are provided based on individual participant-prioritized goals.  
 
Participants randomized to the conventional, clinic -based hearing health care (HHC) arm will 
continue to be seen in-clinic semi-annually to reinforce hearing loss self- management strategies 
and perform hearing aid checks.  Following the COSI goal setting and HIFU hearing intervention 
check -up that all participants will complete during the randomization visit, participants 
randomized to the conventional, clinic -based HHC arm will  be informed of their randomization 
assignment and reminded about how to continue access ing the conventional HHC supports  that 
they received in the parent ACHIEVE study  during the first year of the ACHIEVE- HIFU study  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  30 (i.e., participants will be able to reach out to the audiologist to initiate an interim visit/encounter 
to address any unanticipated needs if they arise) . 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_367130]-randomization visit, participants will receive telehealth session A (see section 9.2.1), 
followed by [CONTACT_300774] B and C at approximately 3 and 6 weeks later, respectively, as 
described above. 
 
Full details of the interventions can be found in the Manual of Procedures . 
 
10 Safety monitoring 
ACHIEVE -HIFU  will follow safety procedures established as part of the parent studies 
(ACHIEVE and ARIC).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_367131] (DSMB)  has been constituted in 
collaboration with the NIA for the parent ACHIEVE study  and provides oversight at convened 
biannual meetings where interim unblinded and blinded data reports are reviewed.  An 
approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) and DSMB charter guides data and safety 
monitoring for the ACHIEVE study.  The DSM B members comprise clinicians/investigators with 
expertise in clinical trials, neuropsychology, dementia, biostatistics, audiology, and 
otolaryngology.  This follow -up study to ACHIEVE will fall under the purview of the existing 
DSMB, and we will continue to follow all prevailing procedures as detailed in our approved DSMB charter and DSMP during the period of temporal overlap between ACHIEVE -HIFU  and 
the parent ACHIEVE trial .  After the completion of the parent trial, we will determine, in 
consultation with the DSMB, NIA, and NIDCD , whether continued DSMB oversight of this 
telehealth trial is needed given the minimal risk nature of this study and based on the experience to date with the parent trial.  Because the primary outcome of this proposed study is 
hearing aid use at [ADDRESS_367132] of the trial.  
 
An adverse event (AE ) is an untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered study -
related, which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial . 
 
A serious AE  (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A majo r congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
For this study, only the following adverse events and serious adverse events will be 
recorded and reported: 
Adverse Events  Serious Adverse Events  
• Otitis externa  • Death from any cause  
• Cerumen impaction or ear foreign body 
requiring removal by a physician   
 
An adverse event of otitis externa is defined as inflammation or infection of the ear canal 
resulting in pain, swelling, irritation, itching, or other related symptoms as diagnosed by [CONTACT_300775] a physician.  Adverse event severi ty is defined as:  
• Mild if the symptoms are self-limited and resolve with interventions such as transiently limiting hearing aid use and/or the use of over -the-counter pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_300721]’s ear drops.  
• Moderate if the symptoms require evaluation and management by a physician and  the 
use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_300722].  
• Severe if the symptoms require evaluation and management by a physician and the use 
of oral or parenteral antibiotics.  
 
An adverse event of a cerumen impaction or ear foreign body requiring removal by a physician 
is defined as a cerumen impaction and/or ear foreign body that cannot be routinely managed by 
[CONTACT_300776] a physician (typi[INVESTIGATOR_300723]).  Adverse event severity is defined as:  
• Mild if the cerumen impaction or foreign body is resolved without further need for therapy besides over -the-counter pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_300724]. 
• Moderate if there is an associated otitis externa requiring the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_300725].  
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  32 • Severe if the cerumen impaction or ear foreign body results in a perforation of the 
tympanic membrane or an associated otitis externa requiring the use of oral or 
parenteral antibiotics.  
 AEs or SAEs will be defined as unexpected or expected based on the judgement of the field 
site PI [INVESTIGATOR_300726]/or study PIs Lin (who is a board-certified 
otolaryngologist)  and Sanchez (who is a licensed audiologist)  based on the following definitions:  
• Unexpected:  nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
information about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol and consent form 
• Expected:  event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition under 
study.   
 
Study -relatedness of AEs or SAEs will be based on the judgement of the field site PI [INVESTIGATOR_300727]/or study PIs Lin/Sanchez  based on the following 
guidelines:  
• Definitely Related:  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
intervention – i.e., an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to 
the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_300728]’s clinical state.  
• Possibly Related:  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to 
the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e., another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically 
plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study 
intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
 
Unanticipated Problems 
An unanticipated problem is defined as an incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
• Unexpected – in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the procedures and 
interventions used in the study as described in the protocol and informed consent given the characteristics of the study population 
• Possibly or definitely related to participation in the study 
• Suggests that the research placed the participant or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized 
 Some but not all adverse events may qualify as unanticipated problems.  
 
The Coordinating Center  will review all recorded treatment-emergent adverse events and all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) from this pre-specified list and will provide a report to the 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.[ADDRESS_367133] results and dates.  
 All completed AE forms will be forwarded promptly to the Coordinating Center where they will be 
reviewed for completeness by [CONTACT_300777] [CONTACT_78363] (who is a board-
certified otolaryngologist) and/or MPI [INVESTIGATOR_300729] (who is a licensed audiologist) .  In particular, the 
Principal Investigator s will assure that documentation of each event is adequate to permit 
accurate inferences regarding causation (e.g., temporal associations, onset, course, response to patient or physician intervention, alternative etiologies) and severity.  Full details of 
procedures for reporting adverse events can be found in the Manual of Procedures . 
 
11 
Statistical considerations 
11.1 Sample size 
This study is predicated on an already established cohort with a fixed sample size from the 
original ACHIEVE trial (N=490 for the clinic -based hearing intervention cohort).  In order to 
estimate the minimal difference in hours of continued hearing aid use that could be detected between the telehealth and conventional HHC groups after 12 months, we’ve made 
conservative assumptions based on expected loss to follow -up over time that would diminish the 
sample size and any observable outcomes.  The initial cohort receiving the hearing intervention 
was N=490.  Assuming conservatively that 5% of participants per year in this cohort are lost to 
follow -up or death, we would have a potential cohort of N=420 participants who would be 
eligible to participate after 3 years of follow -up from 2021-2022.  If we further assume that up to 
5% of these participants may then decline additional  follow -up, we conservatively estimate that 
N=400 participants currently in the hearing intervention group will be recruited into this foll ow-up 
study  (ACHIEVE-HIFU) .  Further conservatively assuming:  1) 10-20% loss to follow-up in the 
12-month follow-up data collection; 2) 80% power and a 5% Type 1 error rate; and 3) that 
patterns of hearing aid utilization will be similar to those observed in the ACHIEVE  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
we would have the ability to detect an average treatment effect of 0.[ADDRESS_367134] error variance 
will be employed, depending on whether the outcome is rare or common.  For categorical outcomes, either ordinal or multinomial  logistic regression models  will be utilized, depending on 
the nature of the measure and empi[INVESTIGATOR_300730].  
Statistical significance for the primary outcome will be defined as p < 0.05.  Secondary 
outcomes will be evaluated for statistical significance with a Hochberg modification to the Bonferroni adjustment, in which the p-values of the five outcomes will be ordered.  The largest 
p-value will be compared relative to p < 0.05, and if met, all parameters will be considered 
significant.  If not, then the second largest p-value will be assessed relative to p < 0.05/2 = 
0.025, and if met, then it and all other parameters will be considered significant, and so on for 
the third p-value at p < 0.05/3 = 0.017. 
 
12 
Data management  
Trained data management and study management staff at the UNC CSCC will be responsible 
for coordinating data management.  The Coordinating Center (CC) uses  a customized state-of-
the-art web -based data management system using Carolina Data Acquisition and Reporting 
Tool (CDART) which is also used for the parent ACHIEVE study and ARIC -NCS.  A complete 
description of all data management procedures has previously been developed for the parent 
ACHIEVE trial and has been approved by [CONTACT_300778].  CDART uses a flexible, secure 
authentication system requiring a username [CONTACT_2383].  In accordance with HIPAA, all 
individually identifi able information is encrypted and decrypted for local on-screen display at 
field sites.  The GrandPad tablet is HIPAA -compliant with respect to any telehealth sessions that 
occur using this platform. 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  35  
Data collection 
The CC has previously led the translation of the protocol data collection specifications into a 
consolidated set of clear, unambiguous electronic case report forms (eCRFs)  for the parent 
ACHIEVE trial .  Each eCRF has a corresponding paper form to be used by [CONTACT_300779].  
 Randomization and b linding  
Randomization will be implemented within CDART.  Although the ACHIEVE hearing 
interventions are by [CONTACT_300780], in order to minimize bias based on review of 
accumulating data by [CONTACT_75374], the ACHIEVE PIs, co-investigators, and key project staff 
(except one unblinded statistician) will remain blinded to accumulating data.  In all cases, hours 
of hearing aid use (primary outcome), a completely objective data point, will  be gathered directly 
from hearing aid data logging software, and source data will be verified as part of the quality 
assurance procedures.  All other non-audiological secondary outcomes will be collected by 
[CONTACT_300781], rather than the site audiologist. 
 
Data quality control and monitoring 
Quality and completeness of recorded data will be assured on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_300782], queries for missing or inconsistent data, and periodic monitoring.  
Consistent with the parent ACHIEVE trial a Quality Control Subcommittee chaired by [CONTACT_79086] [INVESTIGATOR_300731].  
 Records retention 
MPIs and field center PIs will retain study essential documents and specimens for up to 10 
years following study completion. 
 
Ethical c onsiderations 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), 
applicable government regulations and i nstitutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted single Institutional 
Review Board ( sIRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the 
study conduct.  The decision of the s IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in 
writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
 All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and provi ding 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_941] s IRB 
for the study.  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The subject will sign the consent 
form, as will the investigator-designated research professional obtaining the consents. 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  36 13 Study sites and structure of the study team  
13.1 Field centers 
The field centers where the research will be conducted are the same as the parent ACHIE VE 
study.  The field centers will be responsible for recruiting participants into the new study, 
administering the HHC intervention, and collecting follow -up outcome data. 
• Washington County, Maryland (Johns Hopkins center located in Hagerstown, MD)  
• Jackson , Mississippi (University of Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_60584])  
• Forsyth County, North Carolina (Wake Forest University Health Sciences)  
• Minneapolis, Minnesota (University of Minnesota)  
13.2 Coordinating Center (CC)  
The CC is located at the University of North Carolina (UNC).  UNC currently serves as the CC 
for the ACHIEVE trial and ACHIEVE -MRI study and has served as the CC for numerous other 
studies, including ARIC.  The CC will be responsible for programming data entry screens into 
the data management system, providing reports on study progress and data quality, creating datasets for sharing with investigators, and participating on study committees.  See section [ADDRESS_367135] information for all investigators and study team members at each participating site.  The CC is responsible for distributing memos  to 
the site PIs and/or study coordinators  when there are changes to the protocol or clarifications to 
study procedures. 
13.3 
Hearing intervention unit  
The University of South [LOCATION_012] (USF) will be responsible for training and oversight of the fidelity 
of the hearing intervention.  USF will participate on study committees and lead the hearing 
intervention subcommittee.  
13.4 Analysis and study governance site  
Johns Hopkins University  (JHU)  is the analysis and study governance site.  JHU will be 
responsible for overall trial coordination, leading several of the committees (described in the next section).  JHU will be responsible for preparing and maintaining the study protocol, 
consent, and other study documentation, and will work with the CC to have these study 
documents distributed and/or posted to the study website as needed.  JHU will also be 
responsible for preparing NIH progress reports.  
13.5 
Single IRB  
Johns Hopkins Medicine is serving as the single IRB for this study.  It is the preference of Johns 
Hopkins Medicine IRB to use the SMART IRB reliance agreement as the basis of reliance.  The 
ACHIEVE HIFU Protocol, v. 1.3 June 5, 2024  37 SMART IRB master reliance agreement was created in 2016 to harmonize and streamline the 
IRB review process for multisite studies.  It enables reliance on a study -by-study basis, clearly 
defines roles and responsibilities of relying institutions and reviewing IRBs, and eliminates the need to sign reliance agreements for each study [e.g., a non-SMART IRB agreement].  900+ 
institutions have already signed onto this agreement and are actively using it as the basis of reliance for multisite projects.  Sites that will rely on JHM IRB are still responsible for conducting 
a local context review prior to the start of research at their site and for following any local and institutionally required policies as it applies to research at their site [e.g., reporting of 
unanticipated problems]. 
13.6 
Study organization 
Study  organiz ation will be based directly on the existing organizational framework used in the 
ongoing ACHIEVE trial consisting of an overarching Steering Co mmittee that interfaces  with the 
ARIC study, NIH, and DSMB (when applicable) .  Under the Steering Committee, several 
additional committees  (Operations, Quality Control, Neurocognitive Adjudication, Intervention 
Fidelity  and Q uality, and  Publications) oversee day -to-day execution of the study.

6.1 Informed 
consent  Added sub -section on re -
obtaining consent in the 
event of consent changes.  The protocol did not previou sly 
address the process for re- consent 
due to consent changes.  Because the study involves telehealth (remote) visits, and not all contacts occur in person, flexibility has been 
added to allow re -consent to be 
provided verbally or via mail.

HHC arm’s Telehealth Session A.  This removal is a correction – goals 
achievement will be assessed at the 
Year 1 visit, which will often occur 
the same day or w ithin the week 
prior to Session A for the group randomized to conventional HHC, so goals achievement will not be 
repeated at Session A.  
12 Data 
management  Removed text indicating that 
technicians will be blinded to randomization status.  The primary outcome for ACHIEVE -
HIFU is objectively measured hours of hearing aid use, so technicians collecting other outcomes are not 
required to be blinded.  
14 History of 
protocol amendments  New section added.  The relevant summary of changes 
for the current protocol version will be outlined in the table at the 
beginning of the protocol, but the full 
history of protocol changes will be maintained within this newly added 
section in the protocol.

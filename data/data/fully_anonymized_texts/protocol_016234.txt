SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Number:  CNTX -CX-01-2015 -AML -1 
Title of Study:  A Randomized, Phase II Study of CX -[ADDRESS_170686] Induction  
Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
Indication:  Newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  
Number of 
Investigators and 
Study Centers:  The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the [LOCATION_002].  
Development Phase:  Phase II  
Objectives:  Primary objectives  
The primary objectives are:  
• To assess whether 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (CX -01), administered 
at any or all studied dose levels in conjunction with standard induction 
therapy for AML increases the morphologic complete remission (CR) 
rate based on Interna tional Working Group (IWG)  criteria  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of CX -01, administered at two 
studied dose levels in conjunction with standard induction therapy for 
AML.  
 
Secondary objectives  
The secondary efficacy objectives are:  
To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in 
conjunction with standard induction and consolidation therapy for AML 
improves:  
• Event -free survival  (EFS)  
• Leukemia -free survival  (LFS)  
• Overall  survival  (OS)  
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR + CRi, which is CR without 
recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL  and/or 
platelet count  <100,000/μL).  
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 60-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 90-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• Neutrophil  recovery  
• Platelet  recovery.  
Study Population:  Newly diagnosed, treatment -naïve patients with de novo or secondary AML  
60 years of age or older.  
Methodology/ 
Study Design:  This is an exploratory phase II, open -label, randomized, multicenter, parallel 
group trial to determine whether there is evidence that the addition of either or 
both different dose levels of CX -[ADDRESS_170687] induction chemotherapy 
alone.  
 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_170688] patient is randomized.

A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will meet periodically to review the 
safety of the study.  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from time of informed consent and 
conti nue until [ADDRESS_170689] an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery by [CONTACT_2006] 42 (i.e. until the recovery or  
until the reason for no recovery is diagnosed) after the last induction or 
consolidation cycle.

Evaluation: Efficacy  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148556] 14 -21. If LFS is 
documented, an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148557] 1 week after the ANC recovers 
to >1000/μL. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148558] [ADDRESS_170699] recovery of 
ANC. Response will be evaluated based on IWG criteria.  
 
For patients with documented CR, confirmatory bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148559].  
 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the morphologic CR rate based on IWG 
criteria.  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are:  
• EFS 
• LFS 
• OS 
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR +  CRi 
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day morta lity 
• 60-day mortality  
• 90-day mortality  
• Time to neutrophil recovery defined as days from the date of 
randomization until ANC recovered to  >1000/μL  
• Time to transfusion -independent platelet recovery defined as days from 
the date of randomization until the first day that the platelet count 
recovers to >100,000/μL (provided it is not as a consequence of 
platelet transfusion and provided platelets are the n maintained  at 
>100,000/μL for the five subsequent days without platelet transfusion).  
Evaluation: Safety  Key safety endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_148602] -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), unless otherw ise 
stated. Adverse events will be categorized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and 
Preferred Term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) dictionary (version 14.1), and will be graded according to National

Statistical Methods:  Sample Size  
A total of 25 evaluable patients per arm will provide 71.8% power for each test 
comparing a dose with control via a Fisher's exact test at 1 -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_170700] a difference between a control proportion 0.55 and an experimental dose 
proportion 0.8 0; these tests will be conducted in a fixed sequence: higher dose 
versus control first and lower dose versus control second, with the second test 
considered exploratory (failed) if the first test fails.  
 
Analysis populations  
The following populations will be considered for data summaries.  
Intent -To-Treat (ITT) : All randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they are randomized. The ITT Population 
will be the primary analysis set for the efficacy variables.  
 
Per Protocol (PP) : Supporting analyses will be conducted on the PP Population, 
comprising all patients randomized and treated without major protocol 
violations during the trial. This population will be documented before final 
database lock.  
 
Safety : All patients who receiv ed at least one dose of study treatment. Patients 
will be included in the analyses according to the treatment they received. The 
Safety Population will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  
 
Primary analysis  
The primary efficacy analyses will be  based on the ITT Population. Fisher exact 
test will be used to compare the proportion of CRs between each dose and 
control.  
 
Secondary analysis  
The primary analysis will be repeated using the PP Population as a supportive 
analysis. Complete response rates  and confidence intervals will also be reported 
for key subgroups (e.g., randomization strata). Analyses of EFS, LFS, time to 
neutrophil recovery, time to platelet recovery, and OS will be descriptive.  
Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates will be used to estimate the survival distribution 
for each arm and KM plots will be produced to accompany these analyses.  
Confidence intervals will be reported for medians and KM estimates. Duration 
of response will be analyzed  using a similar approach; the analysis will account 
for the competing risk of death and the survival distributions will be estimated 
as cumulative incidence functions.  
 
Mortality rate at Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90 will be reported using descriptive 
statis tics in a manner similar to the reporting of the morphologic CR rate. The 
time to neutrophil and platelet recoveries will be reported using the following 
descriptive statistics: N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and 1st and 3rd quartil es.

Statistical Methods:  Exploratory analysis  
Exploratory analyses will be descriptive.  
 
Safety analysis  
Safety analysis will be descriptive, based on the Safety Population and will 
involve examination of descriptive statistics and individual patient listings for 
effects of study treatment on clinical safety and tolerability. The safety 
assessment period is f rom the first dose of study treatment until [ADDRESS_170701] study treatment, deaths 
reported beyond 30 days that are considered study d rug-related, and the 
incidence of laboratory values with NCI -CTCAE Grades 3 or 4. Particular 
attention will be upon coagulation parameters and bleeding -related events. Vital 
signs and ECOG performance status, electrocardiograms, and laboratory 
parameters w ill be summarized  descriptively.  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be descriptive.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
 
This is a phase II study to evaluate 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (CX -01), a low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) derivative with inhibitory effects on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, 
a pathway that has been shown to be important in cancer  stem cell survival, proliferation, 
migration, and chemotaxis. It is proposed that the addition of CX -01 at two dose levels to 
idarubicin + cytarabine may be of benefit in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML).  
 
At present, CX -[ADDRESS_170711] 100 years ago ( 1), and through most of its life has been 
employed as an anticoagulant to treat or prevent vascular thrombosis. However, because 
of heparin binding motifs on a host of proteins, this glycosaminoglycan has multiple 
pharmacologic effects that are not dependen t upon anticoagulation ( 2). In cancer, these 
non-anticoagulant actions, and most notably its ability to disrupt the CXCL12/CXCR4 
axis, offers an intriguing set of therapeutic possibilities for using heparin as adjunctive 
treatment to conventional therapy. These therapeutic possibilities are, however, severely 
limited by [CONTACT_148608] - 
anticoagulant pharmacologic activity. This observation led to the development of  a low 
anticoagulant CX -[ADDRESS_170712] range of biologic activities of heparin, with 
only a small fraction of its anticoagulant activities.  
 
Acute myelogenous leukemia afflicted 18,860 patients in the [LOCATION_002] in 2014 and 
resulted in 10,460  deaths. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_148562] ( 3,4), the mainstay of AML 
induction therapy continues to be variations on a 7 -day infusion of cytarabine and 3 days 
of an anthracycline (“7 + 3”), an appro ach three decades old ( 5). Relapses are believed to 
be due to quiescent CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells (LSCs) nestled in the marrow 
stromal niche, where they are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.  
 
4.1.1 The CXCL12 /CXCR4 Axis in Cancer  Biology  
The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has recently been suggested as a new therapeutic target in 
lung cancer ( 6,7). CXCL12 (also known as Stromal Cell Derived Factor -1) was first 
described as a CXC chemokine produced locally within the bone marrow compartment 
that provides a homing signal for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by [CONTACT_148609]  
G-protein coupled receptor (CXCR4) to the surface of HSCs. Ligation of CXCR4 
activates a nu mber of signaling pathways, in particular the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt pathway, which promotes stem cell survival, proliferation, migration, and 
chemotaxis ( 7). 
 
More recently, it has been appreciated that spl ice variants of CXCL12 are also produced 
in high concentrations in brain, lung, colon, heart, kidney and liver, and that these 
CXCR4 receptors are prominently expressed on the cell membranes of many cancer  cells,

 particularly cancer stem cell s (7). This emerging research supports a role for the 
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in mediating the invasion/migration by [CONTACT_148610] “fertile soil” sites commonly associated with metastasis. Thus, it is 
proposed that local production of CXCL12 within metastasis -prone sites promotes the 
chemotaxis of cancer cells and cancer stem cells into these sites through interaction with 
the CXCR4 on the membranes of cancer cells.  
 
In addition, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis a ppears to be important in cancer cell  proliferation 
and neovascularization, and is intimately involved in recruiting cancer -associated 
fibroblasts (CAF) that provide the mesenchymal matrix support for growing tumors and 
further metastases ( 7). Thus, a major promoter of CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression 
within a tumor is its hypoxic core, which gives rise to hypoxia inducible factor  1α. 
CXCL12 is also produced abundantly by [CONTACT_148611]. Once sti mulated by [CONTACT_62528]12, tumor cell associated CXCR4 becomes a major 
mediator of tumor cell interaction with extracellular matrix proteins (i.e., laminin, 
fibronectin, collagen), as well as a regulator of CD44 and integrin -mediated cancer and 
cancer stem cell ad hesion (though CXCR4 itself is not directly involved in cell  adhesion).  
 
4.1.2 The CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis in Acute Myeloid  Leukemia  
Normal CD34+CD38- HSCs migrate to and are anchored in the bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_148612] ( 8,9,10,11). Forem ost of 
these signals is the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (stem cell derived factor -1), which ligates 
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on the HSC surface. This signaling activates directional 
Rho/Rac -mediated migration toward and attachment in the bone marrow environme nt 
through enrichment of pseudopodia with adhesion receptors such as very late antigen -4 
and others. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling also activates phosphatidylinositol -3-kinase and 
its downstream effector protein kinase B, providing enhanced survival ( 10). In the 
marrow, HSCs shuttle between an endosteal osteoblastic niche inducing quiescence and a 
sinusoidal endothelial vascular niche promoting proliferation and differentiation ( 8). 
Recent evidence sugg ests that quiescence in the endosteal niche is maintained by [CONTACT_148613] ( 12,13). Megakaryocytes negatively regulate HSC 
proliferation through secretion of platelet fac tor-4 (PF4), which also enhances integrin - 
mediated endothelial adhesion during bone marrow homing ( 14). 
 
There is substantial evidence that LSCs employ the same CXCL12 -, CXCR4 -, adhesion 
molecule -dependent mechanisms as norm al HSCs to home toward a marrow niche and 
maintain themselves in a quiescent, protected state ( 8,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23). 
CXCR4 is an unfavorable prognostic marker in AML ( 24,25,26,27,28), and its high 
expression on CD34+ AML is associated with the poor survival in patients with Fms -like 
tyrosine kinase -3 /internal tandem duplication mutations. Conversely, disrupting CXCR4 
signaling inhibits transmigration, survival and chemotherapy resistance in vitro 
(29,30,31,32) and tumor growth in AML xenografts ( 32,33,34,35). Clinical experience 
with the CXCR4 inhibitor Plerixafor in AML is just beginning ( 36,37). Short term daily 
subcutaneous administration of Plerixafor for up to 7 days for stem cell mobilization is 
well tolerated ( 38). However, cardiac toxicity arose when it was administered as a daily 
intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous injection for 11 -14 days ( 39). This questions

CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol No.: 
CNTX -CX-01-[ADDRESS_170713] interference with its 
ligand CXCL12. Heparin, a g lycosaminoglycan used as an anticoagulant, avidly binds to 
a cluster of cationic amino acids on the CXCL12 surface that overlaps with the CXCR4 
binding region ( 40,41). Heparin inhibition of CXCL 12 is diminished by [CONTACT_148614] 6 -O, 
but not 2 -O sulfates ( 42), but is apparent only at concentrations of 20 U or approximately 
3 µg/mL ( 42,43), which exceed therap eutic heparin plasma levels for anticoagulation by 
10-fold ( 44). Low anticoagulant 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH, also known as  
CX-01, Figure 6 —2) is a porcine intestinal heparin derivative that retains many heparin 
anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, CX -01 binds PF4 with affinity similar to 
heparin, but the CX -01/PF4 complex does not bind antibodies that produce platelet 
activation and med iate heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Furthermore, 
megakaryopoiesis is negatively regulated by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]4 and anti -PF4 blocking antibodies 
diminish chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) in mice. CX -[ADDRESS_170714] 
that CX -01 increases the complet e remission (CR) rate and enhances count recovery. In 
addition, we show that CX -[ADDRESS_170715] been tested to block CXCR4, among these are AMD3100 
(Genzyme), BKT140 (Biokine Therapeutics), MSX -122 (Med Koo Biosciences), 
unfractionated heparin (UFH) and LMWH (various).  
 
AMD3100 (known as Plerixafor and Mozobil), has gained  Food and Drug Administration 
approval for the mobilization of stem cells. AMD3100, when used with another small 
molecule CXCR4 inhibitor, BKT140, acts synergistically with chemotherapy in human 
non-small cell lung cancer under experimental conditions ( 45,46,47) as well as against 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in vitro and in animal models ( 48,49,50,51). 
 
Short term daily subcutaneous administration of AMD3100 for up to 7 days in humans 
for stem cell mobilization is well tolerated ( 52), but when administered as a d aily IV 
infusion or subcutaneous injection for 11 -14 days, as an HIV treatment in humans, it was 
associated with cardiac toxicity ( 53,54). MSX -122, also developed for stem cell 
mobilization, is a partial CXCR4 antagonist which in animal studies appears to be 
tolerated in longer term regimens, however, MSX -122 has not as yet been tested in 
humans.  
 
Heparins are effective inhibitors of CXCL12. Recently, UFH has been shown to inhibit 
CXCL12 in a man ner not dependent on its anticoagulant activity ( 42). Binding of heparin

 produces a steric hindrance of CXCR4 binding to CXCL12 ( 55) when this negatively 
charged glycosaminoglycan binds to a concentration of cationic amino acids that overlap 
with the CXCR4 binding site ( 55). However, even greater effectiveness might be 
achieved using, CX -01, a low anticoagulant heparin, that would enable effective 
CXCL 12 blocking without the risk of anticoagulation.  
 
4.2 Study Rationale for CX -01 in  AML  
 
CX-01 is a rationally engineered complex carbohydrate derived from heparin that may 
represent a safer inhibitor of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis.  
 
Differential anticoagulant effect relative to heparin : Heparin is more than [ADDRESS_170716] of CX -01 begins to 
appear at a plasma concentration that is approximately 2 -fold higher than the plasma 
concentrations achieved in normal volunteer and patient studies (25 µg/mL); at these 
concentrations it is anticipat ed that CX -[ADDRESS_170717] ( 56). 
 
Reduced antigenicity relative to heparin : HIT is a potential clinical complication of 
heparin administration that results from the format ion of an antibody to the PF4/heparin 
complex, which in turn may cause thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism ( 57). CX -01 
binds PF4 with an affinity similar to heparin, but the CX -01/PF4 complex does not 
activate platelets beca use it does not bind HIT antibodies and, unlike heparin/PF4, does 
not stimulate additional antibody production ( 56,58,59). 
 
Platelet and white blood cell (WBC) recovery following chemotherapy : In patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, and in patients with 
AML receiving induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine, CX -[ADDRESS_170718] of  
CX-01 on the inhibitory action of PF4 in marrow myeloid and megakaryocyte 
development after chem otherapy ( 60,61,62). In separate but related research, Cantex is 
collaborating with the National Institute of Health and other federal agencies to develop 
CX-01 as  a medical countermeasure to radiation poisoning, where refractory 
thrombocytopenia is a major concern.  
 
Thus, CX -01 may offer benefits to AML patients without the risks of other heparin 
derivatives, namely blocking of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis without the acc ompanying 
risks of anticoagulation or of HIT; it may also benefit AML patients receiving intensive 
chemotherapy by [CONTACT_148615].

5.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
The primary objectives are:  
 
• To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in 
conjunction with standard induction therapy for AML increases the morphologic 
CR rate based on International Working Group (IWG)  criteria  
 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of C X-01, administered at two studied dose 
levels in conjunction with standard induction therapy for  AML.  
 
5.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
The secondary efficacy objectives are:  
 
To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in conjunction 
with standard induction and consolidation therapy for AML improves:  
 
• Event -free survival  (EFS)  
• Leukemia -free survival  (LFS)  
• Overall survival  (OS)  
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR + CRi, which is CR without recovery  of 
neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL and/or platelet  count  
<100,000/μL).  
 
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 60-day mortality (in the i nduction  cycle)  
• 90-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• Neutrophil recovery  
• Platelet  recovery.

 6.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control  Groups  
 
Approximately 75 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_170728] 
induction and consolidation therapy with or without CX -01 at two different doses  (lower 
and higher  dose).  
The anthracycline/cytarabine regimen using idarubicin (9 -12 mg/m2 daily) is considered a 
standard therapy for the majority of newly diagnosed patients with AML ( 64). Complete 
remissions are achieved in approximately 5 0% to 75% of patients ( 65). Dosing studies 
with continuous infusion cytarabine demonstrated that 100 mg/m2 was as effective as  
200 mg/m2 (66,67). 
The need for p ost remission therapy, following successful induction therapy, has been 
established in a number of clinical trials. It is presumed that most patients still have 
residual disease after the completion of induction chemotherapy ( 68). The standard 
treatment option includes consolidation therapy with intensive cytarabine -based 
chemotherapy regimens or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

6.3.3 Withdrawal and Discontinuation of  Patients  
 
Patients are free to withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any 
time, without prejudice to further treatment. A patient’s participation in the study may 
also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Spons or. 
 
The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator or Sponsor to discontinue a 
patient from treatment:  
 
• The patient was erroneously included in the study (i.e. was found to be  ineligible)  
• The patient experiences an intolerable or unacceptable  AE 
• The patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the  protocol  
• The patient participates in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization of the Sponsor or its  designee  
 
• The patient’s participation in the study presents a sign ificant safety  concern.  
Patients who experience Grade [ADDRESS_170732], ALT or bilirubin (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT >[ADDRESS_170733]; increase in total bilirubin to >[ADDRESS_170734]) will be discontinued 
from the study, if the Investigator judges that the laborator y abnormalities are potentially 
related to study treatment. Patients discontinued for this reason will not be re -challenged 
and will be followed until resolution of abnormal liver function tests.  
 
Patients who are discontinued from study due to an AE will be closely monitored until 
the resolution or stabilization of the AE.  
 
Patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who are discontinued from 
treatment, but not withdrawn from the study, will be asked to complete all evaluations for 
early term ination (Early Termination/End of Study Visit).  
 
Patients who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

of CX -01 and 0.9% sodium chloride to an empty, sterile infusion bag. An IV infusion line 
will then be attached to the infusion bag, and the infusion set purged with the CX -01 
solution. A Luer lock (or similar) will then be  placed at the end of the set. As CX -01 
doses are weight based, the amount of CX -01 from the vials and saline solution will both 
vary by [CONTACT_4676]’s weight. Each 1 mL solution contains 50 mg CX -01. 
 
For each continuous infusion bag, an appropriate volume and  concentration of CX -01

Long term stability testing for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and final product 
(CX-01 vials) was conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Results from these 
stability studies indicate that CX -[ADDRESS_170750] studies are being 
conducted with current production material to confirm prior results and extend the study 
period to 72 months. A stability study of CX -01 in normal saline diluted for b olus dose 
concentration and continuous infusion concentration (in polyethylene bags) has 
confirmed stability of the drug product for at least 72 hours (the maximum period tested) 
at two concentration levels and at two temperature conditions (2ºC to 8ºC and  room 
temperature). This testing covers all the ranges for CX -01 concentration/dilution required

The Sponsor will be responsible for assuring that the quality of the study drug is adequate 
for the duration of the study. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or designee to 
ensure that the study drug is only dispensed to the patient. The study dr ug must be 
dispensed only from official study sites by [CONTACT_148624]. The Investigator or designee must maintain accurate records of the study 
drug receipt, dispensing information, and  disposition.  
 
If study drug is to  be destroyed at the site, it is the Investigator or designee’s 
responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for the disposal, drug 
accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_148623], procedures for proper disposal 
have been established acc ording to applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional 
procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been documented and provided

6.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to  CX-01 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient  Identification  
 
Each ne wly enrolled patient will be assigned a unique patient identification number using 
an Interactive Web/Voice Response System (IxRS). Patients will be randomized across 
all sites. Patients who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.  
 
6.4.4 Selection of Do ses in the  Study  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Selection of  Dose  
 
The selection of CX -[ADDRESS_170752] potential activity but without 
clinically significant anticoagulation. The study dose chosen (4 mg/kg bolus followed by  
0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour for 5 or 7 days) fulfills both of these criteria. In addition, all 
doses are expected to result in serum levels of CX -01 which are significantly higher than 
the IC90 identified in preclinical studies for inhibition of CXCL12 -CXCR4 interaction.  
 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_148573] -01 conducted on 12 patients with newly diagnosed AML, the 
addition of CX -01 to the traditional “7 + 3” regimen of cytarabine and idarubicin resulted 
in [ADDRESS_170753] cycle 
(92%). It was hypothesized that the increased rate of first cycle induction of remission 
was from blockade by [CONTACT_148598] -01 of CXCL12 (SDF -1)/CXCR4 -mediated homing of LSC in 
the marrow niche where they are protected from chemotherapy. The dose and re gimen of 
CX-01 in that trial were well tolerated without associated serious AEs (SAEs). Mean 
levels of aPTT remained largely in the mid -30 second range.  
 
In a prior study of continually infused CX -01 in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer (Study PGX -ODSH -2011 -PC), CX -01 was administered as an IV bolus loading 
dose of 4 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.375 mg/kg/hour for 5 days. This

Incorporating Amendment 2  
JAN 13, 2017  Page 41 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 dose was well tolerated and free from major AEs. However, measurement of aPTT in 
these patie nts demonstrated that aPTT was increased into the 40 to 45 second range in a 
limited number of patients. This is a range that is not overtly anticoagulant, but higher 
than the therapeutic range of aPTT (31.5 to 36 seconds).  
 
Therefore, the chosen dose (4 m g/kg bolus followed by 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour) 
represents a rational balance between effective dosing and safety in seriously ill patients 
with AML.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose  Modifications  
 
No dose modification for cytarabine or idarubicin during induction will be allowed. 
However, dose reduction of cytarabine during consolidation is permitted according to 
institutional guidelines, or if in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_148574] a 
higher dose.  
 
CX-01 Dose Modifications  
 
• CX-[ADDRESS_170754] 8 hours after  the 
bolus dose of CX -01, until the aPTT is <35 seconds. CX -01 will then be resumed 
at a 50% dose reduction. If the aPTT rises above 45 seconds at the reduced dose, 
CX-01 will be permanently discontinued. If aPTT at the 50% reduced dose is  
<35 seconds, 4 hours or more after dose reduction, the dose can be escalated by 
25%. If the aPTT after dose escalation again rises above 45 seconds at the 
reduced dose, the CX -01 will be temporarily discontinued until the aPTT is  
<35 seconds, and then resumed at the previous 50% dose reduction.  
 
• Abnormal liver  function:  
o If Grade [ADDRESS_170755], ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g.,  increase in 
AST or ALT from ULN to 3.[ADDRESS_170756]; increase in total bilirubin from 
ULN to 1.[ADDRESS_170757]), the frequency of liver function testing will be 
increased, if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities  are 
potentially related to study trea tment. No reduction of dose is  required  
 
o If Grade [ADDRESS_170758], ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT to >3.[ADDRESS_170759]; increase in total bilirubin from >1.[ADDRESS_170760]), the frequency of liver function testing will be increased  to 
≥once a week, if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities 
are potentially related to study treatment. No reduction of dose is required  
 
o If Grade [ADDRESS_170761], ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT to >5.[ADDRESS_170762];  increase in total bilirubin from >3.[ADDRESS_170763]) and if the Investigator judges that the laboratory  abnormalities 
are potentially related to study treatment, study drug must be stopped.

if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities are potentially 
related to study treatment, the patient must discontinue study treatment 
immediately and will not be re -challenge d. The patient will be followed 
until resolution of abnormal liver function  tests.  
 
• Renal  function:  
If the calculated creatinine clearance drops below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 prior to or 
during dosing with CX -01, the dose of CX -01 will be held until the creatinin e 
clearance rises above 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 
• For any other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities that appear to be related to CX -01 during 
either the induction or consolidation cycles, CX -01 will be interrupted until the 
AE resolves to Grade 1 or less, and then resumed at 0.125 mg/kg/hour provided 
administration of chemotherapy is in progress. If CX -01 is interrupted for greater 
than 72 hours, the patient will be discontinued from treatment. If the AE recurs  at 
a level of Grade 3 or higher, the CX -01 will be  discontinued.  
 
This study will utilize the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.03 for AE and SAE reporting. A copy of the

 Response will be evaluated according to IWG criteria (see Appendix A ), which has been 
published and validated and is appropriate for use in this study.  
 
6.6.2 Efficacy  Assessments  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy  Assessment  
 
The primary endpoint is the rate of patients in each treatment group achieving 
morphological CR based on IWG criteria during the induction and re -induction phases of 
the treatment. Morphologic CR is defined as ANC >1000/μL, platelet  
count >100,000/μL, <5% blasts in an bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26679], no blasts with Auer 
rods, and no evidence of extramedullary disease (see Appendix A ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy  Assessments  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Event -Free  Survival  
 
Event -free survival is measured from the date of randomization until treatment failure 
(e.g., failure to achieve composite complete morphological remission during the 
induction or re -induction phase of the study lasting up to [ADDRESS_170783]).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_170784].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Overall  Survival  
 
Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization until death from any cause.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Composite Complete Remission  Rate 
 
Complete remission rate includes CR, CR without recovery of platelets (CRp) and CRi as 
defined by [CONTACT_148628] ( Appendix A ) during the induction and re -induction phases of 
treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Duration of Morphologic Complete  Remission  
 
Duration of morphologic complete response is measured from the achievement of CR to 
detecti on of relapse.

 [IP_ADDRESS].7  Neutrophil and Platelet  Recovery  
 
Time to neutrophil recovery is measured from the date of randomization until ANC 
recovers to >1000/μL.  
 
Time to transfusion -independent platelet recovery is measured from the date of 
randomization until the first day that the platelet count recovers to >10 0,000/μL 
(provided it is not as a consequence of platelet transfusion and provided platelets are then 
maintained at >100,000/μL for the five subsequent days without platelet transfusion).  
 
6.6.3 Safety  Assessments  
 
Key safety endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_148629] -emergent AEs (TEAEs), unless otherwise stated. Adverse events will be 
categorized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictiona ry (version 14.1), and will be 
graded according to NCI -CTCAE version 4.03.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Adverse events will be collected 
from the time of informed consent and continue until [ADDRESS_170786] an ANC recovery by [CONTACT_2006] 42 (i.e., until the recovery or until a 
reason for no recovery is diagnosed) after the last induction or consolidati on cycle.  
 
For the purpose of this study, the terms toxicity and AE are used interchangeably.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_170787] medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom, or disease) in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for 
participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or casually 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_148630] (however, the condition for which 
the surgery is required may be an AE).  
 
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs the term “condition” 
may include abnormal symptoms, diseases, laboratory, or  vital sign findings.  
 
• Conditions that started before signing of ICF and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of ICF are recorded as medical history  (e.g.,  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.:

 seasonal allergy without acute complaints)  
 
• Conditions that started before signing of ICF and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of ICF, at unchanged frequency  and/or 
intensity, are recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic  pollinosis)  
 
• Conditions that started or deteriorate d after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as  AEs.  
 
 
Abnormal laboratory and other abnormal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, lead to treatm ent discontinuation or are otherwise considered clinically 
relevant by [CONTACT_737]. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the 
condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the 
procedure itself. In a case of  fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the 
death is considered as its outcome.  
 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are considered to be an AE 
only if they worsen after starting study drug and are clearly not related to cytarabine 
and/or idarubicin toxicities, or to AML that is not yet in remission. Abnormal  laboratory 
values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs and symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
 
Information about all AEs, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_102], discovered by [CONTACT_148631], or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded, as appropriate.  
 
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade based on NCI -CTCAE version 4. 03 (Grade 1 to  5) 
• The relationship to the study drug(s) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].6 ). A relationship 
between the AE and the underlying AML, the dose -intensive chemotherapy,  and 
CX-01 treatment, will be assessed  
 
• The duration (start and end dates or continuing at final  contact)  
• Action taken (no action taken, study drug dosage adjusted/tem porarily 
interrupted, study drug permanently discontinued due to this AE,  concomitant 
medication taken, non -drug therapy given, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].7 ) 
 
• Whether it constitutes an  SAE . 
All AEs will be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug

 treatment as listed in the dose modification section of the protocol (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event, completion 
of the patient’s participation, or study termination, or the Investigator or designee and 
Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, whichever occurs first.  
 
Assessments should be made at  each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the relationship to the study drug, the intervention required to treat it, 
and the outcome.  
 
Common side effects known for CX -01 are provided in the IB ( 63). All AEs will be 
immediately recorded in the patient’s source documents.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_170788] medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
 
• Results in  death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148579] 
 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity (disability is  defined 
as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life  function)  
 
• Is congenital anomaly or birth  defect  
• Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_16032].  
Note: The term ‘ life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
Hosp italization is defined as the patient being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148580], or the patient’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148581]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148582], e.g., an overnight stay to avoid a repeat journey, or patient s 
undergoing a preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829], will not be considered an SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148583] a procedure will be noted in the 
eCRF. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148584].  
 
Important medical events that may result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon

documented as AEs in the patient’s source documents and eCRF.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse  Reactions  
 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not 
listed in the IB. Suspected adverse reactions means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational 
New Drug (IND) safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Follow -up of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabili zation of the event, completion 
of the patient’s participation, or study termination, or the Investigator or designee and 
Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, whichever occurs first.  
 
Serious AEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, or the Investigator 
or designee and Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary.  
 
All AEs will be immediately recorded in the patient’s source documents.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Assessment of  Severi ty 
 
The severity grade will be based on the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. An electronic copy of

study drug on the basis of his/her clinical judgment using the following definitions. The 
causality assessment must be made based on the available information and can be 
updated as new information becomes available.  
 
Is there a “reasonable possibility” the drug caused the AE (meaning there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE)?  
 
• Yes 
• No. 
Could the AE be explained by [CONTACT_148632] o ther drugs or chemicals?  
 
• Yes 
• No. 
[IP_ADDRESS].7  Action Taken Regarding the Study  Drug  
 
• No action taken : no change in treatment  dosage  
• Dose reduction : study drug dosage adjusted/or and  reduced  
• Drug interrupted : study drug temporarily  stopped  
• Drug withdrawn : study drug permanently  stopped  
• Specific treatment instituted : other concomitant medication or non -drug therapy 
administered in response to an AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].8  Adverse Event  Outcome  
 
• Recovered/resolved : the patient fully recovered from the AE with no  residual 
effect  observed  
 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae : the residual effects (e.g., symptoms  or 
pathology) of the AE are still present and  observable  
 
• Not recovered/not resolved : the AE itself is still present and  observable  
• Fatal : the patient dies as a result of the  AE

 • Unknown : outcome of the AE is  unknown.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
 
Although not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the Investigator or their 
designee to report any pregnancy in a patient or the patient’s sex ual partner that occurs 
during the study. All patients who become pregnant must immediately discontinue the 
study drug and be withdrawn from the study. The patient will be followed to 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. This information is important f or both drug 
safety and public health concerns. If a patient is found to be pregnant after the study 
treatment was administered, the Investigator should report this to the CRO and Sponsor 
immediately and document using the Pregnancy Form.  
 
The Investigator  must make every effort to follow the patient until completion of 
pregnancy. If the outcome of pregnancy meets the criteria for classification of an SAE, 
the Investigator must follow the procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in Sec tion 6.6.4.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  12-lead Electrocardiogram  
 
A standard resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening and at the end of 
induction (Day 7). Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be obtained at the Investigator’s 
discretion or if clinically indicated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Left Ventricular Ejection  Fraction  
 
An echocardiography or MUGA scan will be performed during Screening to determine 
the patient’s cardiac ejection fraction for eligibility in the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory  Assessments  
 
The time points at which these samples will be collected are shown in the Schedu le of 
Study Procedures (Table 6 —1) and ( Table 6 —2). Assessments will be performed and 
evaluated locally.  
 
The following clinical laboratory assessments will be performed:  
 
• Hematology panel : hemoglobin , ANC, and  platelet  
• Chemistry (comprehensive metabolic panel) : ALT, AST, total  bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase , BUN, and serum  creatinine  
 
• Coagulation panel : anti -factor Xa, PT, aPTT,  INR.  
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value should be immediately re -checked 
whenever possible, for confirmation before making any decision for the concerned 
patient. It should be documented as an AE/SAE per protocol requirement.  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.: 
CNTX -CX-01-[ADDRESS_170791]. Results will be analyzed locally. Pregnancy tests may be  
performed at other visits at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Bone Marrow  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/Biopsy  
 
To evaluate disease status, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148585] 28 days before starting therapy. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148586] 14 -21 to determine the need for re -induction chemotherapy (see 
Section 6.4.1 ). Subsequent bone marrow examinations are specified in Section 6.5.1 . 
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148587] -up should include analysis by [CONTACT_148633]. Bone marrow (or peripheral blood if bone marrow is 
unavailable) should be sent to the institution’s local cytogenetic laboratory for analysis . 
 
For patients with documented CR, confirmatory bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148588].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs and ECOG Performance  Status  
 
Measurement of vital signs will include an assessment of heart rate, BP, height, and 
weight . Height will be measured once during Screening. Weight will be measured at the 
beginning of each cycle to calculate treatment doses. Vital signs may be repeated for 
clinically significant abnormal findings at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
Eastern C ooperative Oncology Group performance status will be collected at Screening 
Visit only (see Appendix B ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical  Examination  
 
All abnormal findings on physical exam will be documented in the source documentation 
and eCRF. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs, if applicable.  
 
6.6.[ADDRESS_170792] be reported by [CONTACT_148634] 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The facsimile report should 
include all available information requested on t he SAE form (refer to Key Study 
Personnel page for fax number to report SAEs).The SAE form will collect data 
surrounding the event, e.g., the nature of the symptom(s), time of onset in relation to 
initiation of therapy, duration, intensity, and whether or not therapy was interrupted or 
discontinued. The Investigator’s assessment of the probable cause of the event will also 
be included. In addition, relevant medical history, concomitant medications, laboratory 
and diagnostic reports, and procedures, as well as all pertinent medical information  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.: 
CNTX -CX-01-[ADDRESS_170793] SAE queries directly to the site requesting incomplete or missing 
information. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to be diligent in providing this 
information back to the CRO as soon as it is available. Initial reports of SAEs should not 
be left on telephone voicemails. Always fax SAE reports and follow -up with a telephone 
call if needed.  
 
All sites will follow their institutional requ irements for submission of SAEs to their IRB.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
 
Myelosuppression and its associated complications due to underlying leukemia and/or 
intensive anti -leukemia therapy are expected events during therapy for AML.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148589]/or 
intensive leukemia therapy, are also considered to be expected. These events still need to 
be recorded as AEs on the eCRF:  
 
• Fatigue, weakness and/or shortness of breath associated with  anemia  
• Febrile  neutropenia  
• Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], gastrointestinal  bleeding  
• Bacteremia, sepsis, or other  infections  
• Neutropenic colitis.  
Death due to progression of AML and/or its associated complications are expected in the 
patient population and are liste d in Appendix E . Deaths should be reported with 
Investigator’s assessment of causal ity. 
 
Appendix E also contains a list of known/expected AEs for cytarabine and idarubicin. 
The IB contains expected events known for CX -01 (63). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator’s Notification of the  Sponsor  
 
All Investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
Investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant 
contact [CONTACT_8972], is summarized in the Investigator site file. This information w ill be

6.8.1 Determination of Sample  Size 
 
A total of 25 evaluable patients per arm will provide 71.8% power for each test 
comparing a dose with control via a Fisher's exact test at 1 -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_170797] a 
difference between a control proportion 0.55  and an experimental dose proportion 0.80; 
these tests will be conducted in a fixed sequence: higher dose versus control first and 
lower dose versus control second, with the second test considered exploratory (failed) if 
the first test fails.  
 
6.8.2 Patient Popu lations  Analyzed  
 
The analysis sets that will be used for statistical analyses are as follows:  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 Intent -To-Treat (ITT) : All randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment to which they are randomized. The ITT Population will be the primary analysis 
set for the efficacy variables.  
 
Per Protocol (PP) : Supporting analyses will be conducted on the P P Population, 
comprising all patients randomized and treated without major protocol violations during 
the trial. This population will be documented before final database lock.  
 
Safety : All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patient s will be 
included in the analyses according to the treatment they received. The Safety Population 
will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  
 
6.8.3 General  Considerations  
 
The following is an overview of the statistical analysis methods to be used in  this study. 
Details on the statistical analyses will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio:  
 
• Group 1 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine, OR  
• Group 2 : Idarubicin + Cytara bine plus lower dose CX -01 (0.125  mg/kg/hour), 
OR 
 
• Group 3 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine plus higher dose CX -01 (0.25  mg/kg/hour)  
Unless stated otherwise, descriptive summary statistics will include frequency counts  and 
percentages for categorical variables and  number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum and the 1st and 3rd quartiles for 
continuous  variables.  
 
The final analysis will be done when the last patient completes the study treatment, all 
assessments for disease response, and a Safety Follow -Up Visit approximately [ADDRESS_170798] 
18 months. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS; the version used will be 
specified in the  SAP.

 6.8.7 Extent of Study Drug Exposure and  Compliance  
 
Extent of study drug exposure will be summarized for the entire study treatment period 
and by [CONTACT_5265]. Exposure variables will include d uration of study treatment, number of 
dose reductions, number of treatment delays, number of treatment cycles, and dose 
intensity relative to dose levels specified in the protocol.  
 
6.8.8 Efficacy  Analysis  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Outcome  Measure  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT Population as defined in 
Section 6.8.[ADDRESS_170800] will be used to compare the proportion of CRs between 
each dose and control.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Outcome  Measures  
 
The primary a nalysis will be repeated using the PP Population as a supportive analysis. 
Complete response rates and confidence intervals will also be reported for key subgroups 
(e.g., randomization strata). Analyses of EFS, LFS, time to neutrophil and platelet 
recovery , and OS will be descriptive. Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates will be used to 
estimate the survival distribution for each arm and KM plots will be produced to 
accompany these analyses. Confidence Intervals will be reported for medians and KM 
estimates. Duratio n of response will be analyzed using a similar approach; the analysis 
will account for the competing risk of death and the survival distributions will be 
estimated as cumulative incidence functions.  
 
Mortality rate at Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90 will be reported using descriptive statistics 
in a manner similar to the reporting of the morphologic CR rate. The time to neutrophil 
and platelet recoveries will be reported using the following descriptive stat istics: N, 
mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, and the 1st and 3rd quartiles.

7. RISKS AND  BENEFITS  
 
The potential risks associated with participation in this study are minimal based on 
available safety data. Such risks are limited to unforeseen adverse interactions between 
idarubicin + cytarabine and CX -01. Heparins, as a class are associated with abnorm al 
LFTs, which are generally reversible and of little clinical importance.  
 
Study participants may benefit from participating in the trial if, by [CONTACT_148642], 
the addition of CX -[ADDRESS_170804] 
of idarubicin + cytarabine, although such benefit is not guaranteed.

10. APPENDICES  
 
APPENDIX A – Acute Myeloid Leukemia Response Criteria  
 
The IWG consensus criteria for treatment response in AML will be used to evaluate 
response to treatment.  
 
Definitions of Remission  
 
Morphologic complete remission (CR) : ANC >1000/μL, platelet count >10 0,000/μL,  
<5% bone marrow blasts, no Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary disease.  
 
Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) : CRi, which is CR 
without recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL and/or platelet 
count <100,000/μL).  
 
Partial remission (PR) : ANC >1000/μL, platelet count >100,000/μL and at least a 50% 
decrease in the percentage of marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_108642] 5 to 25%, or marrow blasts <5% 
with persistent Auer rods.  
 
Progressive Disease  
 
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as any one of the following:  
 
• More than 50% increase in bone marrow blast % from best assessment (with a 
minimum threshold of 20% blasts in the  marrow).  
 
• >50% increase in circulating malignant blasts (with absolute blast s >1000/μL).  
• Development of biopsy -proven extramedullary leukemia (if the patient has 
extramedullary disease at baseline then PD will be defined by [CONTACT_148651]).  
 
In patients who present with i nitial marrow blast percentage sufficiently high to preclude 
the ability to base disease progression on a >50% increase in marrow blast percentage; 
disease progression should be based on peripheral blood criteria or development of 
extramedullary leukemia.  
 
Stable Disease  
 
Patients who fail to achieve CR, CRi or PR and who do not have criteria for PD will be 
defined as having stable disease. If the patient dies prior to response assessment at the 
end of Cycle 1, then they will be classified as “Indeterminate ”.

 Reappearance of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood; or >5% blasts in the bone 
marrow not attributable to another cause (e.g., recovery of normal cells following 
chemotherapy -induced aphasia); or appearance or reappearance of extramedullary disease 
and the bone marrow blast percentage is >5% but < or equal to 20%, than a repeat bone 
marrow performed at least [ADDRESS_170827] percentage is >5% is necessary to establish relapse.

Modified  Child -Turcotte -Pugh  classification  of the severity  of liver disease  according  to the degree  of ascites, 
the serum concentrations of bilirubin and albumin, the prothrombin time, and the degree of encephalopathy. 
A total Child -Turcotte -Pugh  score  of 5 to 6 is considered  class A  (well -compensated  disease);  7 to 9 is class 
B (significant functional compromise); and 10 to 15 is class C (decompensated disease). These classes 
correlate with one - and two -year patient survival: class A: 100 and 85%; class B: 80 and 60%, and class C: 
45 and  35%.

• Within 30 minutes of collection, centrifuge tube for 15 minutes at 3000 g at 16°C/ 
60.8ºF. Blood samples must be kept on ice until they are centrifuged (a delay 
in centrifuging and separating plasma should not exceed one hour because 
the platelet factor leaches out of platelets and binds CX -01 resulting in 
erroneous CX -01 values)  
 
• Using a plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], transfer 2 mL of plasma from the tube into two provided 
cryogenic vials; [ADDRESS_170828] be 
labeled:  
 
"CX-01 concentration " and will also include: The sample #, patient's 
randomization/S tudy ID #, Initials, Study site #, Protocol # (CNTX -CX- 
01-2015 -AML -2) and collection date/time.  
 
• Labeled 1 mL/cryogenic tubes must be stored immediately in a -60°C to 80°C 
freezer  
 
Once the full set of blood samples from a patient is complete, all the res ulting vials must 
be shipped under cryogenic conditions (dry ice) to the bioanalytical laboratory (see Study 
Operations Manual for name [CONTACT_148652]).  
 
Please call the bioanalytical laboratory to notify them prior to shipments. Please shi p 
specimens via FedEx only on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday to prevent thawing and 
sample loss.

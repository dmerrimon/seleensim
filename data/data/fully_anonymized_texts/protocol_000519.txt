 Growth hormone (GH) secretion is low in patients with obesity, i nsulin resistance, 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], the elderly, and those infected with HIV. (2) Hypothalamic GH releasing hormone 
(GHRH) is the primary regulator of pulsatile GH secretion from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49021]. (3) Spontaneous 
and stimulated GH secretion is negatively associated with visceral adipose tissue. (4) This is due to a 
decreased response to GHRH stimulation and enhanced GH clearance as well as excessive 
somatostatin tone. (5) Compounds which inhibit hypothalamic somatostatin release improve, but do 
not normalize, GH secretion in response to GHRH. Similarly, drugs which lower free fatty a cids 
improve GH secretion.  A functional GH deficiency characterized by [CONTACT_49036], and this is somewhat normalized after significant weight loss. (6)  
 
 Individuals with hypo pi[INVESTIGATOR_49022] -metabolic risk factors in particular 
visceral adiposity. Prospective studies in adults with hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_49023]. (7-12) GH deficiency is 
associated with impaired endothelium -dependent vasodilation.  Systemic and intra -arterial GH 
infusion increases forearm blood flow in healthy subjects, which is reversed by [CONTACT_49037], L -N-monomethylar ginine (L -NMMA). (13;14)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_49024], 
exogenous GH therapy is not under physiologic negative feedback by [CONTACT_14799] -1, does not restore 
pulsatile secretion, and is limited by [CONTACT_49038]. (15)  
 
 GH releasing hormone (GHRH) is a substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and thus 
inhibition of DPP4 may influence GH secretion. DPP4 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface serine 
protease which cleaves a dipeptide containing a penultimate proline or alanine. In vitro DPP4 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_49025](1 -44)-NH 2 to the biologically inactive GHRH (3 -44)-NH 2.(16;17)  Conversion to 
GHRH (3 -44)-NH 2 is 82% blocked in vitro by [CONTACT_34036] A, a DPP4 competitive inhibitor, or by [CONTACT_49039] 1 or 2. (18) In vivo, injection of exogenous GHRH(1 -44)-NH 2 into 
healthy subjects produces GHRH (3 -44)-NH 2 within 1 minute, demonstrating a half -life of GHRH (1 -
44) of only 6.7 minutes. (19) Others have exploited these findings to develop a DPP4 -resistant GHRH 
analogue therapy that increases endogenous pulsatile GH secretion, specifically daily subcutaneous 
Tesamorelin whic h was approved in 2010 for the reduction of visceral adiposity in HIV -associated 
lipodystrophy. (20) Twelve months of Tesamorelin therapy in 60 obese subjects selectively reduced 
visceral adiposity and improved triglycerides, C -reactive protein and carotid intima -media thickness 
without affecting glucose homeostasis. (21) Two weeks of Tesamorelin given to [ADDRESS_51467] increased homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance 
index (HOMA -IR).(22) Tesamorelin is associated with a small increase in hemoglobin A1c in patients 
with HIV. (23) This side ef fect in high risk individuals is a drawback to Tesamorelin.  
 
1/19/[ADDRESS_51468] -prandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
by [CONTACT_49040], including glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP -
1).(16;17)  DPP4 inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as sitagliptin, are popular due to their once daily oral dosing, 
tolerability, and low incidence of hypoglycemia. Consistent with the ubiquitous expression of DPP4, 
other off -target effects of DPP4 inhibition are increasingly  recognized. DPP4 is widely expressed in 
the cardiovascular system, including endothelial cells. (24) Sitagliptin therapy in patients with type [ADDRESS_51469] -prandial fr ee 
fatty acids, and decreases platelet aggregation. (25-27) DPP4 inhibitor therapy has the potential  to 
restore GH secretion by [CONTACT_49041], while simultaneously 
addressing cardio -metabolic risk through a variety of mechanisms.  
 
 We are currently evaluating the effect of acute DPP4 inhibition on stimulated GH levels and 
forearm blood flow in 14 healthy adults.  Our study biosta tistician 
(CY) has  thus far  been un -blinded to the first 6 subjects (4 females, 
2 males)  who have completed  this double -blinded, placebo -
controlled, crossover study. On each study day, subjects are 
randomized to sitagliptin (200 mg p.o.) vs. matching placebo and 
receive a thirty minute intravenous infusion of Arginine 30 grams 
which stimulates GH secretion via a GHRH -dependent mechanism . 
GH level was positively associated with forearm blood flow (FBF) 
(rs=0.442; p<0.001) and FBF significantly increased only after mean 
time of peak GH. (left) All 
subjects demonstrated 
sufficient responses to arginine 
(peak GH >3 ng/mL), with 
females demonstrating a 
higher peak GH (mean 17.5 
ng/mL ± SEM 3.5 vs. 13.3 ± 
SEM 7.9 in males; p=NS) as 
has previously been 
reported. (28-30). Our 
preliminary data demonstrates a discrete effect of Drug A vs. 
Drug B on GH secretion which is consistent among 4 females, 
where the two drugs represent blinded sitagliptin vs. 
placebo .(above)   
 
 Obese females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased visceral adiposity and 
diminished GH secretion -independent of weight or degree of insulin resistance . Females with PCOS 
exhibit an impaired GH respon se to stimuli including GHRH and a greater than 50% reducti on in 24 
hour mean GH levels secondary to diminished GH pulse amplitude. (31-34) Ten percent of 
reproductive -aged women are affected by [CONTACT_49042]; these women are often obese and typi[INVESTIGATOR_49026] a ten -times higher risk for the 
onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. (35) Similar to adults with GH deficiency, young women with PCOS 
demonstrate impaired glucose metabolism with a normal fasting blood glucose, i ncreased visceral fat 
and altered endothelial function. (36)  Management options are limited to lifestyle intervention with 
weight loss or the use of metformin. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_49027]. Furthermore, metformin therapy is associated with a modest reduction in visceral adiposity 
and an undesirable loss of protectiv e subcutaneous fat .(37)  
  

1/19/[ADDRESS_51470] GHRH -stimulated GH secretion. GH replacement therapy improves 
visceral adiposity and markers of cardiovascular risk; its administ ration, however, is limited by 
[CONTACT_49043].  The DPP4 -resistant GHRH analog, Tesamorelin, is limited by [CONTACT_49044], in addition to its lack of a 
beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis. We hypothesize that DPP4 inhibition is able to 
pharmacologically manipulate the GH axis and restore GH secretion in a more physiologic fashion 
while improving glucose homeostasis.  The translational application of currently available D PP4 
inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_49028] -metabolic risk represents a 
cost-effective, high impact strategy which may rapi[INVESTIGATOR_49029]’s 
obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  
  
 
2. Rationale and Specific Aims  
 Forty percent of women affected by [CONTACT_49045] 40 
and diabetes in this population is associated with a BMI >30 kg/m2. Women with PCOS are at 
increased risk for the development of impaired fibrinolysis and vascular func tion as well as 
cardiovascular disease. (36) Overnight and phar macologically stimulated GH secretion is reduced in 
women with PCOS syndrome. (31;33;34)  Flow -mediated vasodilation, and s pecifically nitric oxide -
mediated vasodilation, is impaired in obese women with PCOS. (38;39)  We hypothesize that chronic 
therapy with the DPP4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, will increase mean overnight GH secretion and improve 
endothelium -dependent vasodilation in obese women with PCOS.   
 
 We will secondarily evaluate the effect of chronic DPP4 inhibit ion on glucose tolerance, as well 
as glucose -suppressed GH and post -glucose rebound GH release. In healthy individuals, GH 
secretion initially declines to a nadir within 90 minutes of glucose ingestion and then increases above 
basal secretion, peaking 3 -5 hours after glucose ingestion. (40-42) This “rebound” increase in GH 
secretion following oral glucose is mediated by [CONTACT_49046]. (2) In obese subjects, the early inhibitory effect 
on GH secretion is lost and the “rebound” response is blunted. (41) DPP4 inhibition lowers post -
prandial blood glucoses and free fatty acids by [CONTACT_49047]. Both 
free fatty acids and hyperglycemia negatively regulate GH secretion; DPP4 inhibition may thus 
indirectly enhance GH secretion  by [CONTACT_49048] -prandial hyperglycemia and free fatty 
acids. (2;25 ) We also hypothesize that chronic DPP4 inhibition will improve glucose tolerance, and 
restore early GH inhi bition and “rebound” GH release after glucose ingestion.

4. Enrollment/Randomization  
 Following their initial screening visi t, subjects who qualify for the study will be randomized to 
treatment order (sitagliptin 100 mg daily or placebo) using a block randomization algorithm with a 
block size of two. The dose of sitagliptin was chosen as it is currently the FDA -recommended dose of 
sitagliptin for type [ADDRESS_51472] and dispensing of double -blinded oral study medication 
(placebo or sitagliptin).  They will take their first dose  of study medication in the CRC.  Subjects will 
take each therapy for one month; a minimum 8-week  wash -out will separate study treatments. Side 
effects and compliance  with study medication will be assessed at each visit in the CRC. Prior to 
initiation of the second drug, subjects will return to the CRC  for an interim screen ing visit to update 
their medical history and have  a blood count checked . If they still meet criteria for inclusion, they will 
then return to the CRC for a  medication -dispe nsing visit  which will again consist of a pregnancy 
test and dispensing of the double -blinded oral study medication.  
 
5. Study Procedures  
Protocol :  
 Each subject will undergo one outpatient visit  (day 15 ± 4 days of treatment) and one 
inpatient visit  (day 30 ± 4 days of treatment) during each treatment . (above  Figure)  On each study 
day, subjects will report fasting to the CRC in the morning having  had no caffeine or alcohol for [ADDRESS_51473] (OGTT) during 
the outpatient study visit , which will start one hour after their dose of study drug . During the inpatient 

1/19/[ADDRESS_51474] dose of study drug. 
Vasodilation at baseline, d uring reactive hyperemia, and following nitroglycerin  will be assessed, as 
detailed below, using high -resolution vascular ultrasound . Standardized meals will be provided at 
lunch and dinner. Body composition will be determined in the afternoon. At 8 PM ove rnight frequent 
sampling for venous GH will begin every 10 minutes for 12 hours to determine overnight GH 
secretion. Subjects will also complete a health -related quality -of-life questionnaire specific for women 
with PCOS (PCOSQ) (43;44)  at the initiation of the study and at each inpatient visit; they will complete 
a CTSA Hea lth Risk Assessment at the beginning of the study.  
 
Assessments :  
 OGTT  will be performed using  [ADDRESS_51475] ingestion: 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, [ADDRESS_51476] -glucose load, given that the late rise in GH occurs three to five hours following 
glucose ingestion. (42)  
 Flow -mediated Dilation.   Patients will be studied in a quiet, temperature -controlled room (22 -
23C).   After [ADDRESS_51477], during reactive hyperemia and after 15 
minutes reco very period. A pneumatic tourniquet will be placed on the arm and will be inflated to a 
pressure 200 mm Hg  for 5 minutes . Reactive hyperemia will be induced by [CONTACT_49049]. The 
brachial artery will be continuously imaged for about 4 minutes  after cuff release. After the recovery 
period, patients will receive 0.4 mg nitroglycerin by [CONTACT_1966]  (held if SBP<1 10 mmHg or pulse <60 bpm). 
The brachial artery will then be imaged again for an additional 4 minutes.   Brachial artery diameter will 
be analyzed using continuous edge detection and wall tracking software (Brachial analyzer 5.0, Medical 
Imaging Applications LLC, Iowa city, Iowa). We will determine peak diameter using an automated 
mathematical algorithm, prev iously published (Black MA. et al. Hypertension.2008;51:203 -210). FMD 
will be reported as absolute values at baseline, peak hyperemia, and peak following nitroglycerin. FMD 
will also be expressed as % change from baseline and will also be analyzed using al lometric modelling 
(Atkinson G and AM Batterham Vascular Medicine. 2013; 18:354 -365) . 
  
 Body composition will be assessed by [CONTACT_751] -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA)  to measure 
body composition with the inclusion of a visceral fat measurement. Abdominal vi sceral fat negatively 
predicts GH secretion following glucose load. (40) GH repl acement decreases abdominal fat in GH 
deficient adults.  (46) 
 Overnight spontaneous GH secretion will be assessed using deconvolution analysis  from 
venous samples obtained from an indwelling catheter overnight. AutoDecon, a deconvolution  
algorithm validate d for analysis of endogenous GH pulsatility, will be used to assess parameters of 
GH secretion including mean overnight GH secretion, GH half -life, GH peak and nadir, number of GH 
peaks, and GH peak area. (47-49) Intravenous catheter patency will be maintained  during sampling  by 
[CONTACT_49050] 20 mL/hour.

6. Risks  
1. Repeated blood sampling from venous catheters may cause bleeding or infection.   
2. Frequent blood draws can cause anemia.  
3. Insertion of catheters  may cause bleeding, bruising, or infection.   
4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49030], 
including acne, hirsutism, and may make menstrual cycles more irregular.   
5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49031], and cause an 
increase in blood pressure and fluid retention.  
 
6. Sitagliptin  - Drugs like sitagliptin can cause lowered blood sugar (common)  in individuals 
with high blood sugar (diabetes) . This can result in dizziness, nausea, shaking, sweating, 
fast heartbeat, vision changes, headache, anxiety, tiredness, or confusion. It can rarely 
cause fai nting, seizures, or coma. Other side effects are pancreatitis (damage to the 
pancreas), kidney damage (which can be life threatening), allergic reaction (which can be 
life threatening), rash, and liver damage (which can be life threatening).  
7. Oral Glucose ( 75 grams) Solution -The oral glucose solution is a commercially available 
liquid containing a certain amount of glucose, [ADDRESS_51478] (DSMB) bi -annually. The DSMB will receive these in written format and review the study for 
appropriate and timely subject accrual, adherence to the protocol, and da ta accuracy and 
completeness. The DSMB will provide the PI ([CONTACT_34061]) with written confirmation of receipt of this bi -
1/19/[ADDRESS_51479]. Devin, her mentor and her co -investigators will closely oversee the protocol. Any 
serious adverse events or toxicitie s will be reported to the  as per policy (currently no 
later than within 10 working days of the investigator’s knowledge) and will immediately be reviewed 
with the DSMB. Any noncompliance with the IRB -approved protocol that increases risk or affects 
participants’ rights, safety or welfare will be similarly reported to the IRB within 10 working days of the 
investigators’ knowledge and immediately reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
 Any untoward medical event will be classified as an adverse event, regardless of its causal 
relationship with the study. An adverse event will be classified as serious if it a) results in death, b) if 
life-threatening, c) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869], d) 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, e) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Non-serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review, as is 
curre ntly IRB policy.  
 
 [CONTACT_34061] will review enrollment progress, all adverse events, protocol adherence data, and 
data quality entry at a minimum of every two weeks with her mentor. [CONTACT_34061] will review with her 
Mentor each enrolled subject’s chart every tw o weeks for side effects and tolerability of the 
investigational drug. These findings will be included in the DSMB bi -annual report unless previously 
dictated otherwise.  
 
8. Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
If at any time during the study, a subject develops  any symptoms related to study participation that 
subject will be withdrawn from the study. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a subject is non -
compliant, that subject will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects who are withdrawn will be followed 
until symptoms have resolved.  
  
9. Statistical Considerations  
 
Anticipated Results  and Data Analysis Plan  

1/19/[ADDRESS_51480] -prandial GH secretion. The primary 
endpoints are mean overnight GH secretion and GH levels measured at vari ous time points during 
oral GTT. Secondary endpoint of FMD will be measured at baseline, during reactive hyperemia , and 
following nitroglycerin.   FMD will also be expressed as % change from baseline and will also be 
analyzed using allometric modelling (Atk inson G and AM Batterham Vascular Medicine. 2013; 
18:354 -365). Paired t -tests will be used to analyze the data obtained during placebo with sitagliptin.  
Mixed -effect models will be used to analyze the data , with the fixed effect being sitagliptin vs. place bo 
for endpoints such as mean overnight GH. For the post -glucose load GH secretion assessed after 
each of the two treatment periods (sitagliptin vs. placebo), time as a fixed effect and time by [CONTACT_49051] l.  This will capture the time trend and how 
sitagliptin impacts the time trend.  For each endpoint, a pre -specified set of covariates that would 
impact the endpoint will be adjusted in the model.  
 
Sample Size and Power Calculation  
 Prior data indicates that a difference in mean overnight GH of the following is statistically significant 
(p<0.005): mean baseline overnight GH 0.7 ± SEM 0.[ADDRESS_51481] -therapy overnight GH 1.2 ± 
SEM 0.3 µg/L in 13 subjects .(22) Conservatively assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.[ADDRESS_51482] difference of GH would be 0.87. 
Assuming sitagliptin will increase GH from 0.7 (placebo) to 1.2 µg/L, a sample size of 26, 30,  and [ADDRESS_51483] 80, 85, or 90% power, respectively, to detect this clinically meaningful 
difference.  Sample size was calculated with PS Software using the design for a paired t -test.(54)  
Selecting 85% power and assuming a 10% drop -out based upon previous experience with studies of 
this nature, we will enroll 34 patients.  
 
 
10.    Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Clinical data, including clinical laboratory, will be entered by a member of the Key Study Personnel in 
a protected source data base (RedCap).  A unique identification case number will be used to protect 
the confidentiality of the study participants.  The case numbers and participants' names will be 
included in the protected source database, accessible only by [CONTACT_34056], but only case 
numbers will be included in any spreadsheet used for the statistical analysis.

Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the only major risk group for whom new incident cases of HIV are increasing in the US; indeed, MSM of color living in the US represent one of the most at-risk populations in the world.1-[ADDRESS_1149107] that MSM of color do not engage in greater rates of risk behaviors (e.g., condomless anal sex with serodiscordant partners, substance abuse) compared to white MSM.3-[ADDRESS_1149108], MSM of color report greater depressive distress than white MSM,13 which in turn predicts HIV risk behavior.14 MSM of color’s exposure to racism and homophobia together drive HIV-risk behavior, lack of testing, lack of status disclosure, and among HIV-positive MSM, lack of antiretroviral adherence.[ADDRESS_1149109] barriers to psychosocial health, including a loss of physical “safe” gay spaces and community visibility as a result of increasing technology use, and exclusion from the limited remaining gay spaces because of segregation and racism.17,[ADDRESS_1149110] mental health problems (e.g., depression, substance abuse), which in turn serve as a known risk factor for HIV infection among syndemically affected populations.11,12,14,[ADDRESS_1149111] that this intervention will help buttress MSM of color’s defenses against HIV transmission in small urban areas. This intervention addresses three gaps in current approaches. First, although our team has created the first evidence-based intervention to reduce MSM’s HIV risk behavior by [CONTACT_828151][INVESTIGATOR_828135],24-[ADDRESS_1149112], and other recent qualitative research on MSM of color’s resilience, regarding the ways in which racial minority stigma impacts the mental health of MSM in small urban areas and adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_828136].   In Aim 2, we will deliver the intervention to approximately [ADDRESS_1149113] integrates expertise in culturally-sensitive evidence-based interventions for MSM’s HIV risk into a community-based HIV prevention and care context at the Fair Haven Community Health Center, where the intervention will be delivered to the existing patient population. This community-research alliance maximizes this project’s ability to receive widespread community implementation to improve stigma copi[INVESTIGATOR_828137]-transmission risk among one of the highest-risk populations in our region and the world.  2. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.   MSM of color living in the US represent one of the highest-risk groups for HIV infection in the world. While gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the only risk group for whom new incident cases of HIV are increasing in the US, MSM of color are at even greater risk.1,[ADDRESS_1149114] that MSM of color do not engage in greater rates of individual risk behaviors (e.g., condomless anal sex with serodiscordant partners, substance abuse) compared to white MSM. Explanations for these disparities, therefore, lie in the structural disadvantage surrounding MSM of color. In addition to experiencing the structural stigma affecting all MSM (e.g., sexual orientation discrimination, lack of legal protections, concealment demands), MSM of color also face structural inequities associated with race in the US. Specifically, MSM of color are more likely to be unemployed and incarcerated, and therefore to be economically disenfranchised, than white MSM.[ADDRESS_1149115] HIV prevalence among MSM are 
6  characterized as small urban areas.16 One in four MSM living in small US cities like Jackson, Mississippi; Columbia, South Carolina; and El Paso, [LOCATION_007], are infected with HIV.16 The majority of new HIV cases among MSM in Connecticut occur among MSM of color living in one of Connecticut’s four small urban areas.34 The racial disparities in HIV infection in small urban areas of Connecticut parallel national trends: While Blacks and Hispanics make up only 23% of Connecticut’s population, they comprise 66% of all HIV cases. In 2014, Black males in Connecticut were diagnosed at a rate approximately [ADDRESS_1149116] sources of HIV risk among MSM of color living in Connecticut’s small urban areas. Specifically, in qualitative interviews with 29 HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM (n = 16 MSM of color), participants noted that the advent of social and sexual networking technologies has ushered a decline of physical spaces that historically served as “safe” venues for gay and bisexual men regardless of race.35,[ADDRESS_1149117] HIV infection risk through diminished copi[INVESTIGATOR_397844]. As noted above, structural racism represents the primary driver of US racial disparities in HIV infection. Structural racism is known to be particularly intractable in that it operates through interchangeable mechanisms to perpetuate its effects over time.31 For instance, while separate-but-equal (i.e., Jim Crow) laws have been recognized as unconstitutional since 1964, Black men today have a [ADDRESS_1149118], with undeniable consequences for the health of MSM of color.4,5,41 MSM of color’s experiences of racial stigma and discrimination can erode copi[INVESTIGATOR_828138],6-[ADDRESS_1149119], MSM of color report greater depressive distress than white MSM,13 which in turn predicts HIV risk behavior.14 MSM of color’s exposure to racism and homophobia together drive HIV-risk behavior, lack of testing, lack of status disclosure, and among HIV-positive MSM, lack of antiretroviral adherence.[ADDRESS_1149120] stigma through building mental health and stigma copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   3. Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894].

For these latter three assessments, the same consent form will be used,  Screening and pre-intervention (baseline) assessment. Interested participants will complete a brief online screener, where they will be prompted to provide contact [CONTACT_828152], and instructed that, if they are eligible, a study team member will email them with a consent form and schedule an interview by [CONTACT_648]. The project coordinator will email eligible participants with a copy of the consent form and will schedule a phone assessment of HIV risk behavior. During the call, study staff will briefly review the consent form and gain verbal consent before proceeding to the phone assessment. After the phone assessment, participants will complete a baseline survey assessment containing questions regarding demographics, HIV-risk behavior, social cognitive mediators of HIV risk, mental health, substance use, and experiences of homophobic and racist stress. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline survey using a laptop at Fair Haven Community Health Center before the first group session.   Intervention. Up to [ADDRESS_1149122] at regular times once per week over the course of four months. The group will be “closed,” in that no new members will be allowed to join after the first week in order to promote open self-disclosure and trust among group members. Prior to the start of the first session of the ESTEEM conneCT intervention, study staff will again review the same study consent form and participants will sign a copy to indicate consent for study participation. All group sessions will take place in a reserved room at the Fair Haven Community Health Center, where many participants will be currently receiving care. Although group members will be told that confidentiality from the group cannot be guaranteed, all members will be asked to not share information about other group members outside of the group sessions during and after the study (see Human Subjects). Participants will be told that attendance is required and that missing more than four sessions will result in dismissal from the group. The project coordinator will contact [CONTACT_828153], problem-solve barriers to attendance, and assess motivation for future attendance.   Post-intervention assessment.

After each session, participants will receive $10 plus transportation costs (up to an additional $10). Upon completing the post-intervention assessment measures, participants will receive $40 for their time spent completing the measures. Upon completion of the qualitative interview, participants will also receive $60.   
8  4. Participant Population: Provide a detailed description of the types of participants who will be recruited into this study.    Recruitment Rationale We focus on young MSM (ages 18-35) because the ESTEEM intervention has been developed for young MSM given the developmental-specific impact of minority stress exposure, the importance of intervening at this critical age period during which behavioral risk peaks and unhealthy behavioral patterns potentially become crystallized, and because young MSM represent the highest risk group for new HIV infection. We focus on HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM given that partner pool risk, rather than individual risk behaviors, is a key driver of HIV infection among MSM of color. Because the intervention targets the psychological mechanisms (e.g., internalized homophobia, rejection hypervigilance, identity concealment, emotion regulation) through which stigma exposure drives risk behavior, its principles and exercises are broadly applicable regardless of sero-status, as empi[INVESTIGATOR_828140]. In fact, in addition to its initial test with [ADDRESS_1149124] sizes in mental, behavioral, and sexual health. Including men regardless of serostatus in the proposed group-based adaptation trial provides pi[INVESTIGATOR_828141]-prevention among HIV-negative MSM or the reduction of mental health problems and behavioral comorbidity (e.g., substance use, antiretroviral nonadherence) among HIV-positive MSM. We will form two groups, one for HIV-positive and one for HIV-negative MSM, given that young HIV-positive MSM may not be willing to disclose their status to HIV-negative or status-unknown men, especially within the tight social networks of young MSM of color in small urban areas. Including men regardless of HIV-risk behavior ensures feasible recruitment during this time-limited pi[INVESTIGATOR_828142]. Heterogeneity of HIV-risk outcomes does not pose a problem to estimating feasibility and acceptability and, instead, ensures the broadest possible use of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_828143]. Participants must speak fluent English in order to communicate with the potentially linguistically diverse group members.  Describe how access to the population will be gained in the study.   Participants will be recruited through existing community services and online. PI [INVESTIGATOR_828144] [ADDRESS_1149125], 20.7% of participants in our prior research in New Haven were not out. These online recruitment strategies include advertisements placed on social-sexual networking apps (i.e., Grindr, Scruff, GROWLr), online sex-seeking forums (e.g., the “M4M casual encounters” section of Craigslist.com), and Facebook posts targeting local LGBT-oriented groups.   5. Participant classification: Check off all classifications of participants that will be specifically recruited for enrollment in the research project. Will participants who may require additional

If so, identify the population of participants requiring special safeguards and provide a justification for their involvement.  ☐   Children                ☐X   Healthy   ☐   Fetal material, placenta, or dead                  fetus  ☐    Non-English Speaking  ☐   Prisoners  ☐ Economically disadvantaged      persons  ☐    Decisionally Impaired  ☐    Employees  ☐      Pregnant women  ☐    Yale Students    ☐    Females of childbearing potential   ☐   Fetuses    NOTE: Is this research proposal designed to enroll children who are wards of the state as potential participants? ☐Yes  ☒ No    6. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: What are the criteria used to determine participant inclusion or    exclusion?   Eligible participants will: 1) be between the ages of 18 and 35, 2) report anticipated 6-month residential stability in New Haven county, 3) self-identify as a gay or bisexual man or report being a man who has had past-12-month sex with a man; 4) self-identify as an ethnic or racial minority, including Black, African American, Caribbean American, Hispanic, and Latinx, 5) speak fluent English; and 6) provide consent.   SECTION V: RECRUITMENT/CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCEDURES   1. Recruitment Procedures:  a. Describe how potential participants will be identified and contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and by [CONTACT_20898].  Participants will be recruited through existing community health services, gay community venues, and online.   Existing community health services. PI [INVESTIGATOR_828144] [ADDRESS_1149126] involved ads placed on social-sexual networking apps (i.e., Grindr), online sex-seeking forums (e.g., the “M4M casual encounters” section of Craigslist.com), and Facebook posts targeting local LGBT-oriented groups. Upon recruitment, interested participants will be contact[CONTACT_828154]. Individuals interested in study participation will indicate this through a brief online screener described above.   Are you collecting any information about the individuals prior to their signing a consent form?  Yes ☒     No ☐  If yes, indicate what information you will be collecting and how it will be gathered (phone screen, paper questionnaire, etc.)   Prior to signing a physical copy of the consent form, study participants will undergo a phone screen, over-the-phone Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) interview, and complete an online survey composed of several baseline questionnaires.  The screener, interview, and online survey will ask participants questions regarding study eligibility, contact [CONTACT_3031], demographics, sexual risk behaviors, past substance use behaviors, and past and/or current mental health with particular focus on stigma and stress regarding sexual identity and/or behaviors and racial identity.  2.

Targeted Enrollment: Give the number of participants: a.   Targeted for enrollment at Yale for this protocol   Up to 30 participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts, one beginning in the fall of 2018 and one in the Spring of 2019.  b. If this is a multi-site study, give the total number of participants targeted across all sites   N/A  4.   How was this estimate derived?  
11   This pi[INVESTIGATOR_828145]. We believe that one group per HIV status (i.e., positive and negative) is the minimum possible number of groups to gain this information.  Using PI [INVESTIGATOR_206263]’ clinical experience delivering psychotherapy groups, we believe that approximately 10-15 participants per group is the ideal number of group members to facilitate optimal learning and information exchange.   Our primary analysis plan involves 1) qualitative interviews with the intervention recipi[INVESTIGATOR_828146] 2) quantitative analyses appropriate for estimating effect sizes necessary to power future trials. We are recruiting 30 men to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_591459]. Drawing from similar research in the field, we estimate that 30 participants will allow us to gather data until saturation is reached and no new data will be introduced through further interviews. The quantitative data gathered from the ~[ADDRESS_1149127]-intervention will provide preliminary data to guide a future trial with a larger sample population.   5.

Evaluation of Participant(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential participant’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed, if applicable.  For the online screener, participants will be asked to read details of the screener and be provided information about potential risks and benefits of completing the online screener. They will be asked to provide consent for completing the screener prior to answering the screener questions.   Participants will be emailed a version of the full study consent form to read and review prior to their phone assessment with research staff. At the start of the call, a trained Research Assistant (RA) will dedicate time to review key points of the consent form with participants and to answer any questions about the study or ICF. Verification of comprehension will be gained by [CONTACT_828158]. Participants will be asked to provide verbal consent prior to proceeding in the study and beginning the phone risk assessment.   Prior to the start of the first group session, a trained RA will gather participants' consent and assess comprehension in a reserved room at the Fair Haven Community Health Center. The RA will ensure that the participant understands the risks associated with the study. Verification of comprehension of study participation requirements will be accomplished by [CONTACT_34761]; points of confusion will be clarified. Once participants have fully understood the consent form and the steps required for participating in the study, they will be asked to sign a physical copy of the consent form. RAs will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_828147]'s capacity to consent.       9.

Please verify to whom such instances will need to be reported.   Suicidality, Homicidality   Our ESTEEM clinical protocol successfully guides reporting instances of suicidality and homicidality in our ESTEEM pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. We will employ the same protocol in this study.  The clinical protocol is attached. The protocol specifies that, in the event that a participant is at imminent risk of harming themselves or another person, as determined by a study staff member with mental health training, study staff will contact 911 to dispatch police or paramedics. Only the minimal necessary identifying information will be provided to these personnel. In less imminent instances of distress, we will refer distressed participants to local mental or behavioral health services. Clinical staff members will receive an alert if the participant answers the online questionnaires in a manner that signals distress; such participants will be contact[CONTACT_426] a clinical staff member to assess risk.   Participants will be notified of the reporting requirements under these circumstances during the consent process.  12.

Further, immediately upon providing consent, all participants will be assigned an identification number. Study staff will maintain four password protected databases tracking participant data. The first database, and only database to link participant contact [CONTACT_3031] (ie: name, age, email, address, phone number) with their ID, will be used for scheduling participant appointments and follow-ups. The second database will track participant attendance and study task completion. The third database will track participant payment, and the fourth and final database will contain data gathered about participants through assessments and therapy sessions. These databases will all be stored on a secure server to which only study staff will have access. Confidential participant information will not be stored with any other data and no other identifying information will appear on any form. All contact [CONTACT_206295], emailing, or mailing information to participants. Upon enrollment participants will also be asked to provide study staff with an alternative contact [CONTACT_3031] (email, phone numbers, and mailing address) for compensation and study retention purposes. This information will be treated in the same confidential manner as all participant information, as described here.    Secure digital (SD) memory cards for the recording equipment will be stored at the research study site. The SD card in the video camera at Fair Haven Community Health Center will be retrieved weekly and brought back to PI [INVESTIGATOR_206263]’ office at YSPH. Data will immediately be uploaded to the Secure Box server on a Yale computer and the memory cards will be cleared.  Additionally, participants will have the choice of using pseudonyms in the audio-recordings to protect their confidentiality on the audio-recordings.  What participant information will you be collecting?

How will the research data be collected and recorded? Click or tap here to enter text.  Research data will be collected via telephone, electronic databases, survey websites, paper-and-pencil, electronic documents, and video recording.  Screening data will also be collected on a secure survey website (Qualtrics.com) to determine eligibility. Participants will complete online surveys at home via yalesurvey.qualtrics.com. If a participant does not have personal computer or internet access we will invite them to complete the baseline survey at the Fair Haven Community Health Center. Participants themselves will enter most data into Qualtrics directly. Online surveys (yalesurvey.qualtrics.com) will use an encrypted web service (https) and will not ask participants’ name [CONTACT_29097], only participant ID number. Intervention sessions will be audio-recorded for quality control and will be downloaded to Yale’s HIPAA-compliant Secure Box drive upon retrieval from study cameras.   4. If identifiers will be associated with the data and/or specimens, describe whether a record or list containing a code (i.e., code number, pseudonyms) will be used, where the list will be stored, who will have access to the list and when it will be destroyed.        Participant tracking and scheduling data will be recorded on a study database.  One password-protected linking database—the study contact [INVESTIGATOR_56905]—containing participant names and ID codes will be kept on Yale’s HIPAA-compliant Secure Box drive and will only be accessible to study staff.  All study computers will be encrypted and password protected.  All filing cabinets will be locked.  Online surveys (yale.qualtrics.com) will use an encrypted web service (https) and will not ask participants’ name [CONTACT_29097], only participant ID number. The linking database used for participant scheduling and retention will be kept separate from study data, on a secure server, and will be password protected.  All study materials, including recordings, will be destroyed three years after the conclusion of the study.    5. Describe where, how and for how long the data (hardcopy (paper) and/or electronic data) and/or specimens will be stored.

After three years of study completion, the link to personal identifiers will be destroyed by [CONTACT_281877].   7. Will a Certificate of Confidentiality be needed? (See also the NIH Certificate of Confidentiality Kiosk, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/index.htm) Click or tap here to enter text.  We have received an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality.  SECTION VII: POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  1. Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to participant privacy, discomforts, or inconveniences associated with participants participating in the research. Note: All studies have the potential for risk, if not physical, there may be psychological, reputational, or financial risks or risks to breach of confidentiality.  The study participants are at minimal risk of harm as a result of participation in the proposed research study. Although unlikely, one risk of the proposed study is that participants will experience emotional discomfort as a result of completing the quantitative assessments or the intervention. Breach of participants' confidentiality presents another possible risk. Breach of confidentiality can also occur if participants in this group-based intervention disclose information about other participants to outside parties. The investigative team's strategies to protect against these risks are described below.   
19  2. Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.  Recruitment and Informed Consent: The investigative team has conducted a number of studies involving young gay and bisexual men, which have involved asking participants to complete potentially sensitive interviews and self-report measures. Thus, we have extensive protocols in place for all aspects of the study. All staff will complete IRB (re)certification as required. All new staff and research volunteers will receive local training in issues pertinent to research among young gay and bisexual men, and will sign a confidentiality pledge prior to any contact [CONTACT_34759]. No identifying information is collected prior to the moment at which a participant provides informed consent.   Participants will be actively recruited into the study through referral by a health professional at FHCC or through venue-based flyers or online advertisements. When completing the online screener, participants will be prompted to provide consent for answering screener questions. If determined eligible for the study, research staff will email them a copy of the full consent form and establish a call to discuss the study and set up a phone assessment of HIV-risk behavior. During the call, a study staff member will review key points of the study and participation requirements with the participant and clarify any participant questions. Participants will verbally consent to participation during the call prior to completing the phone assessment. Participants will again see the consent form at the beginning of the baseline survey that they will complete after the phone assessment and again, in print, before their first group therapy session.   Prior to the in-office appointments, a trained Research Assistant (RA) will assess participants' consent in a private room. The RA will ensure that the participant understands the risks associated with the disclosure of information that could indicate imminent threat to self or others. Verification of comprehension of informed consent will be accomplished by [CONTACT_34761]; points of confusion will be clarified. Once participants have fully understood the consent, they will be asked to sign the consent form. RAs will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_828147]'s capacity to consent.   Protection Against Emotional Discomfort.  It is possible that participants may experience emotional discomfort in responding to assessments. While every possible step will be taken to minimize such risk, consent documentation will make it clear that if participants have any concerns about any aspect of the study they may refuse to continue with the study at any time, without penalty. In addition, we will remind participants during the course of their assessments that they can refuse to answer any questions and may discontinue participation at any time. Research team members will receive training from a licensed clinical psychologist in appropriate response practices in instances of participant distress and will follow the clinical protocol in any situation where a participant indicates risk of self-harm or harm to others. This training will address the appropriate handling of imminent threats and provision of referrals to free counseling services in less imminent clinical situations. As noted above, our Clinical Protocol, attached to this application, will guide this training and its implementation during instances of participant distress.   Protection Against Breach of Confidentiality. The primary potential risk to participants is breach of confidentiality. Breaches of confidentiality will occur if a participant reports a clear intention to harm himself or another person. Health care professionals are required by [CONTACT_206290].  Breach of confidentiality can also occur if participants in this group-based intervention disclose information about participants to outside parties. Participants will agree in their signed consent forms that any information shared during group sessions may not be discussed outside of the intervention.  Moreover, participants will be reminded at the beginning of each session to keep all information shared during the group intervention sessions private; that is, 
[ADDRESS_1149135] will ask all group members to not disclose any other participant’s information outside of the group setting. Participants will also be told, however, that this protection cannot be guaranteed by [CONTACT_591471]. Participants will also be notified on the consent form and at the start of each session that by [CONTACT_591472]. The likelihood that any additional breaches of confidentiality would occur is minimal, as steps will be taken to guard against this risk. To protect participants’ confidentiality, NIH funded studies automatically receive a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) prior to enrolling participants. All counselors and research assistants (RAs) will undergo rigorous training in maintaining participants’ privacy and confidentiality and will be in possession of valid Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) certificates.  Further, immediately upon providing consent, all participants will be assigned an identification number. Only one database will contain participant information with a link to identification numbers and no data will be stored on this file. This database will be stored on Yale’s HIPAA-compliant Secure Box server and will be password protected. This information will not be stored with any participant data and no other identifying information will appear on any form. All contact [CONTACT_206295], emailing, or mailing information to participants.   3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HSC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.). a. What is your assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study? Minimal  b. If children are involved, what is your assessment of the overall risk level for the children participating in this study?  N/A c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Examples of DSMPs are    available here http://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/other/data-and-safety-monitoring-plan-template  for i.Minimal risk ii.Greater than minimal/moderate risk   The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews quarterly. During the review process the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22420], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74118] (IRB) have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.  This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or definitely related) or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be reported immediately (if possible), followed by a written report within 5 calendar days of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_828148] 
21  aware of the event to the IRB (using the appropriate forms from the website) and any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. The investigator will apprise fellow investigators and study personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_473429] (e.g., through regular study meetings, via email as they are reviewed by [CONTACT_458].)  The protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., the DSMBs, NIH, will be informed of serious or unanticipated adverse events within 5 days of the event becoming known to the principal investigator.  d. For multi-site studies for which the Yale PI [INVESTIGATOR_22422]:  i. How will adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others be reported, reviewed and managed? N/A ii. What provisions are in place for management of interim results? N/A iii. What will the multi-site process be for protocol modifications? N/A  4. Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to the participant(s) or to society at large. (Payment of participants is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.)   Sexual risk behavior among young gay and bisexual men is a clear public health concern. All participants in the present study will be exposed to information about HIV transmission risks in relation to social stress and co-occurring mental health disorders. We anticipate that participants will acquire knowledge and skills and will receive support needed to improve their capacity for managing HIV risk. Benefits to society in general are anticipated through the dissemination of intervention findings. Results will better inform local and national public health agencies about potentially effective outreach and prevention strategies that can be delivered to YGBM who experience lifetime stress-sensitive mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behavior. Given the unique experiences of YGBM men of color experiencing sexual orientation stigma and race-based discrimination, research to incorporate knowledge of stigma and discrimination mechanisms into a tool for HIV prevention can be a significant benefit for this community. In sum, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to subjects, which are minimal.  We propose to further test a preliminarily efficacious intervention to better help YGBM manage their HIV risk. Findings from this study can be used to help guide prevention efforts for both YGBM and other socially disadvantaged groups who experience stress-sensitive mental health disorders and are at risk of HIV infection.  Given the public health importance addressed by [CONTACT_34763], we believe that the risk to subjects is reasonable. Further, the information from this intervention can serve to benefit more widespread sexual risk-reduction efforts. Specifically, information from this study will inform public health agencies regarding the effectiveness of an intervention that addresses co-occurring behavioral risk factors for HIV infection.  This test will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the strategic implementation of this intervention alongside effective structural and biomedical approaches.             SECTION VIII: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  1. Alternatives: What other alternatives, if any, are available to the study participants outside of the research?  
[ADDRESS_1149136] of community referrals, including medical, HIV/STD testing, psychological, substance use, and housing supports.  2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe payments that will be made to participants, if any, the amount and timing of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation (if applicable). If you plan to hold a drawing, be sure to include the following on any consent or recruitment materials mentioning the lottery: 1) the value of the prize; 2) the sponsor of the prize (this cannot be a federal funding source); 3) the odds of winning; and 4) that there are no restrictions to winning.  You will receive the following compensation for completing each portion of the study:   • Ten counseling sessions: $10 per session plus transportation costs (up to an additional $10), equaling a total of $100 plus transportation costs (up to an additional $100).  • The online survey & phone interview (before the first counseling session): $40 • The follow-up online survey & phone interview (3 months after the final counseling session): $40 • The final interview (3 months after the final counseling session): $60   Payment for the pre-counseling surveys & phone interview will be provided during the first counseling session along with the payment for the first counseling session.  All other counseling session payments will be provided during those respective counseling sessions.  Payment for the post-counseling surveys & phone interview and for the final interview will be provided at a date/time agreed upon by [CONTACT_828163]-conneCT research staff.  If you withdraw from the study, you can keep the compensation that you have earned up to that point, but you will not receive compensation for those parts of the study that you have not completed.  3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the participant’s costs associated with participation in the research, if any, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost to participants.      Study participation will generate no cost for participants. All study treatment (ESTEEM-conneCT) will be provided free of charge to all study participants.   BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

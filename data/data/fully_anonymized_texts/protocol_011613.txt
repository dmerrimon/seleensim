Estimated duration of trial  2 years (accrual and follow up)  
Duration of Participation  [ADDRESS_299250] of care for men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer involves 
continual or intermittent androgen deprivation.  These regimens historically result in less than 25% of men  (12% in the most recently reported large study)  achieving an undetectable PSA 
(<0.2 ng/ml) at 1 year  (Sweeney et al ASCO 2014) .  Patients on this study will be treated with 
a single course of intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) utilizing Degerelix for 8 
months.  One month following initiation of ADT, patients will underg o whole gland 
cryoablation of the prostate.  All patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks, 
starting at the time of cryoablation  and continuing for 4 months q 3 weeks (for a total of 6  
doses).  PSA levels will be measured every [ADDRESS_299251] IHC methods available in the cancer center core.  Staining will be compared to the pre -treatment diagnostic biopsies.  The primary efficacy end point will be the 
proportion of men with PSA <0.6ng/ml at one year following initiation of treatment .

3.1 Primary Objective(s) & Hypothesis  (es) 
(1) Objective:  Assess feasibility via the proportion of men reaching a low PSA nadir 
(<0.6ng/ml) at 1 year.  
Hypothesis : Cryoablation  combined with MK -3475 and intermittent androgen deprivation 
will result in an increased percentage of metastatic patients achieving a PSA  nadir of 
<0.6ng/ml  at 1 year . 
 (2) Objective: Evaluate the safety of cryotherapy to the prostate combined with 
Pembro lizumab.   
Hypothesis :  The combination of cryoablation of the prostate with MK -3475 
(Pembrolizumab) with standard of care treatment (intermittent androgen blockade) will be 
well tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], with minimal Grade 3 or  4 toxicities.

 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.[ADDRESS_299253] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [1].  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favo rable prognosis in 
various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6].  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_299254] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immu ne responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [7; 8].  The structure 
of murine PD -1 has been resolved [9].  PD -1 and its associated  family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell s timulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [7 ; 10; 11; 12].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_299255] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [13; 14].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocyt es including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, Treg and Natural 
Killer cells [15; 16].  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells [17].  The  
ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety 
of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [18; 19; 20; 13].  
Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains 
in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_299256] 
notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on 
antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -
L2 is thought to control  immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves 
to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues [13].  Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels 
of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion 
in subjects with melanoma (MEL) [21].  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a 
critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attr active target for 
therapeutic intervention.

 MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.   
 
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_299257] treatment is systemic therapy with androgen -ablating 
drugs; a regimen associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and with only a modest benefit in terms of long -term survival.  Indeed the prognosis for men who initially present with 
metastatic disease is not especially favorable; a recent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study showed that these men have a 3 -year overall survival (OS) of only 50%, which 
may be slightly improved by [CONTACT_246050] -based chemotherapy.  Indeed, 
an effective treatment for men who present with oligo -metastatic prostate cancer 
represents an unmet  medical need . 
One alternative treatment for such men may be a combination of cryotherapy (which 
ablates the prostate in situ, and which is associated with only minimal morbidity) with immune -
modulation.  We (Levy, Drake, Fuchs et al. J Pharmacol Exp Therapeutics 2009) and others 
(Waitz and Allison et al. Cancer Research  2012) showed that cryotherapy has immune -
stimulating properties.  In carefully controlled studies in a prostate cancer model, the Allison group showed that combining immune checkpoint blockade with cryotherapy of a single lesion could prevent establishment of a second distant metastasis.  Our group has experience in this regard, having completed a small proof -of-concept study combining cryotherapy with 
immunomodulatory dosing of cyclophospha mide in men with metastatic prostate cancer  
(Sidana et al Urology  2010) .   
While the optimal immunomodulating agent to combine with cryotherapy is the subject 
of ongoing preclinical experimentation, in some respects PD -1 blockade with pembrolizumab 
represents a nearly ideal companion for cryotherapy because of its documented clinical efficacy in multiple tumor types, its acceptable toxicity profile, and the notion that prostate cancer cells can express PD -L1 upon stimulation with appropriate cytokines in vi tro (Drake et. 
al., unpublished).  We thus propose that: cryotherapy for prostate cancer can be 
administered in combination with PD -[ADDRESS_299258] notably the inability to maintain erection and in some  cases with incontinence.  
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated

 three do se levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -
limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evide nce of 
target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MT D has been identified to date. Recent data from other 
clinical studies within the MK -[ADDRESS_299259] shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and 
a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to  IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -
2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_299260] a wide therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the 
melanoma ind ication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and 
safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 
5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between 
the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings  and a fixed dose of 200mg every 3 weeks will 
be chosen  for this investigation.  
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  and Safety  Endpoints  
Efficacy endpoints include a PSA of <0.6ng/ml at 12 months.  This level of PSA has 
previously been shown to indicate cure in men with localized prostate cancer treated with 
prostate cryoablation (Levy et al J Urol 2009).   The proportion of men with PSA  <0.6ng/ml  at 
1 year after undergoing  cryoablation with MK -3475 and intermittent androgen deprivation will 
be compared to historical controls  (12% of men treated with androgen deprivation alone in the 
recently reported CHAARTED trial  achieved an undetectable PSA (<0.2ng/ml) at 1 year when 
on androgen deprivation alone ) (Sweeney et al ASCO  2014) .  Treatment failures will include 
those men with persistently rising PSAs as well as those developi[INVESTIGATOR_246043] 6 and 12 month assessments .  Men with stable low PSAs but not reaching 
<0.6ng/ml will be considered partial responders.   
A co -primary end point will be safety.  Here, more than 2 clinically significant (i.e. 
non-laboratory) grade IV or any grade V event will prompt ending of the trial and a claim of 
futility.

[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Resea rch 
We hypothesize that the combination of cryotherapy and pembrolizumab will promote an 
immune infiltrate, enriched in CTLs, into the prostate and that the extent of this infiltrate will 
correlate with clinical response.  PD -1 and PD -L1 levels in the pros tate as well as the immune 
infiltration into the prostate will be examined by [CONTACT_133374] -histochemistry (IHC).  IHC utilizing 
antibodies directed against PD -1, PD -L1, CD8, CD4, FoxP3 and Ki67 will be used for staining 
on prostate biopsy tissue obtained before treatment and at 6 months following initiation of treatment.

Subjects who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life- threatening event at the same 
grade or greater with re -challenge of MK -3475 should be discontinued from trial treatment. 
 
5.2.2 Timing of Dose Admi nistration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Trial treatment may 
be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled  Day 1 of each cycle due to 
administrative reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle intervals may be 
increased due to toxicity as described in Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS]).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability 
of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., 
infusion time is  30 minutes: - 5 min/+10 min). 
 
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
 
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or

administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescr iption, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_299281] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as d efined in Section 7.2. 
 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Anti-cancer  systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy beyond that specified in this 
protocol  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than MK -3475  
• Radiation therapy
  
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed after consultation with Sponsor.   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_299282] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limi ted to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. F lu-Mist®) 
are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed. .  
• Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.

5.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_110525]: 
• Diarrhea: Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without 
fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  In symptomatic subjects, infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms  are persistent 
and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should be considered.  
o In subjects with severe enterocolitis  (Grade 3) , MK -3475 will be permanently 
discontinued and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_299283] 1 month.  
o In subjects with moderate enterocolitis  (Grade 2) , MK -3475 should be withheld 
and anti -diarrheal treatmen t should be started.  If symptoms are persistent for 
more than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent).  When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_299284] 1 
month.  Regarding guidelines for continuing treatment with MK -3475, see 
Section 5.2. 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasib le, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  
• Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according  to standard institutional practice.  Subjects 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
• Anti-infectives: Subjects with a documented infectious complication should receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_110526] a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice.  
• Immune -related adverse events: Please see the se parate guidance document regarding 
diagnosis and management of adverse exper iences of a potential immunologic etiology.   
• Management of Infusion Reactions:  Acute infusion reactions (which can include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different from allergic/hypersensitive reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to both AEs.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug 
fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigor s/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation 
of tumor pain due to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting.

these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furth ermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_112102]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local r egulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial.  Importantly , the informed consent will specifically state that 
cryotherapy, either alone or in combination with MK -3475, is not a standard treatment 
approach for m etastatic prostate cancer.   No studies have shown that cryotherapy, either 
alone or in combination with MK -3475, is beneficial in this setting and cryotherapy may be 
associated with certain irreversible side effects such as inability to maintain an erectio n or 
inability to retain urine.

 7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in  the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -
up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 12.2 ).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  
All AEs of unknown etiology associated with MK -[ADDRESS_299300] ( ECI) of a potentially immunologic 
etiology (ir AE).  See the separate Pembrolizumab Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document .  
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Exam  
The invest igator or qualified designee will perform a physical exam during the screening 
period and prior to trial treatment administration. Clinically significant abnormal findings 
during the screening period should be recorded as medical history.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature , pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 12.4) at screening, 
prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment 
as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.  [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
Tumor imaging by [CONTACT_246053] (6 months after trial initiation).  Bone scan and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed every 6 months; roughly at the 6 month (time of discontinuation) and 12 month marks.  PSA will also be tested at this time interval.

[IP_ADDRESS] Research blood samples Evaluations  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Blood Collection for Peripheral blood lymphocytes  
Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) will be obtained by [CONTACT_54315] [ADDRESS_299302] protocols, and will be cryopreserved in a 
liquid nitrogen freezer at –140°C for further batched analyses.  
 The time points  for Peripheral blood lymphocytes are described in Section 6 – Trial Flow 
Chart.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Blood Collection for Sera for Immunoassays  
At each time point (baselin e/screening, Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, at time of Discontinuation 
and [ADDRESS_299303] MK -3475), the following research blood samples should be collected and 
processed as outlined below:  
• Draw approximately 10 mL of peripheral blood into 2 plain (red top) or SST (gold top) 
tubes, each containing ≥5 mL of blood per vacutainer.  
• Allow blood to coagulate for 20 minutes, then centrifuge at 25oC, 1500 x g (2700- 3000 
rpm), for 15 minutes.  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_194630] 10 cryotubes (about 0.5 mL/tube).  
• Store cryotubes frozen, below –20oC ( –70oC preferred), until the time of analysis.  
 
7.1.4 Other Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 -  Assessing  and Recording 
Adverse Events. After discontinuing treatment, subjects should return to the si te for a Safety 
Follow -up Visit and then proceed to the Follow -Up Period of the study.  
 
7.1.5 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 -  Trial Flow Chart.   Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 7.1 -  Trial Procedures.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Screening  
Screening will occur after patients are identified via routine clinic visits to Urology, Medical 
Oncology or Radiation Oncology.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period  
Treatment will consist of androgen deprivation, MK -[ADDRESS_299304]:   MK-3475

 26 of  39 
Confidential  
 patients will undergo cryoablation of the prostate and additionally begin treatment with MK -
3475.  MK -3475 will continue for 6 treatments. Androgen deprivation will continue until the 
6 month mark. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Treatment Visits  
Following treatment, men will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_299305] an indwelling catheter which will be removed 2 weeks later in the Urology clinic.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_299306].  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  
Subjects with an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_299307].  SAEs that occur 
within 90 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti -cancer  treatment should 
also be followed and recorded.   
 [IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up Visits  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment will move into the Follow -Up Phas e and should be 
assessed every 12  weeks (± 7 days) to follow the post -study anticancer therapy status and the 
survival status. R adiologic imaging as sessment will be every [ADDRESS_299308] information regarding disease status until the 
start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progress ion, death or end of the study.

elevations)  or starts a new anti -cancer  therapy, the subject moves into the survival follow -up 
phase and should be contact[CONTACT_80077] [ADDRESS_299310] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory fi nding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinic ally significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with the use 
of the [COMPANY_006] ’s product, is also an adverse event. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary sig nificantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Protocol Version 1.0  Date: 7/1/[ADDRESS_299311], device, diagnostic 
agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active 
comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_246055].  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006]  product in clinical trials or 
within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period 
as a result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, plac ebo treatment or a procedure.  
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe f or adverse events meeting any serious criteria is 
described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any pr otocol -
specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for MK -3475 by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific informa tion is available on 
the treatment of overdose of MK -3475. In the event of overdose, MK -[ADDRESS_299312] should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicat ed. 
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006]  product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006] ’s product  meeting the protocol de finition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse eff ect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days  hours to [COMPANY_006]  Global Safety . (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220)

 Is a new cancer; (that is not a condition of the study) or  
 Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious ad verse event. An overdose that is not associated with 
an adverse even t is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_299322] and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes listed previously 
(designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_299323] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determi nation of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] 
a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causali ty noted on the  AE form, ensures that a medically 
qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference 
guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE; the greater the corr elation with th e components and their respective 
elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors

 7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.   
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
The co-primary endpoint s will be  safety, determined as the rate of SAEs, and the 
proportion of patients with PSA (<0. 6ng/ml) at 1 year .  Exploratory endpoints include 
correlation of  biopsy PD -1 and PD -L1 expression with PSA response and tumor response via 
imaging, as well as evaluating whether expression is associated with other clinical or patient 
characteristics.  
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Co-primary endpoint s.  
Safety:  We will not separately evaluate cryotherapy alone, or ADT alone because they 
have well -established excellent safety profiles in this clinical setting.  Additionally, we will 
not include an arm with Pembrolizumab dose escalation because the approved dose has already been established.  We will monitor all patients for AEs, and calculate the proportion of patients with AEs by [CONTACT_479].  The trial will be stopped if  more than 2 clinically significant (i.e. non-
laboratory) grade IV or any grade V event occurs .  
 Efficacy:  In this 12 man study, the minimum expectation to continue will be that 30% 
of men reach the primary endpoint (PSA of 0.6ng/ml at 1 year with a detectable testosterone).  
The recently reported results from the CHAARTED study indicate that among men presenting with metastatic prostate cancer (witho ut prior local treatment (73% of the cohort)) 11.7% will 
reach a PSA of <0.2ng/ml with continuous androgen deprivation alone at the one year mark.  No evidence exists regarding the treatment of oligo -metastatic men with cryotherapy of the 
prostate alone - however it can be assumed that none of these men would achieve PSA <0.2 
ng/ml at the one year mark.  Evidence does exist in the primary prostate cancer treatment setting for localized disease and suggests that a PSA nadir of <0.6ng/ml after cryo -ablation 
indicates excellent local control (Levy et al J Urol 2009).     
The proportion of men with oligo- metastatic disease undergoing a combination of cryotherapy 
with Pembrolizumab and short term androgen blockade who reach a PSA of <0.6ng/ml at one year is unknown, and there is a paucity of PSA response data for other combination treatments in this setting. Stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) +/-  androgen deprivation has achieved good 
responses with oligo- metastatic disease.  In one study PSA data were available.  Five patients 
had PSA levels recorded at [ADDRESS_299325] -SBRT, and an additional 2 patients had 
PSA increasing within <12 months.  Among these 7 patients 2 (29%) had PSA<0.1 ng/ml at >12 months (Ahmed et al 2013).  All 7 patients also received A DT after SBRT.  This provides 
a conservative estimate of the minimum response rate we would like to observe in our trial to warrant further development of our proposed treatment regimen (“conservative” because 5 additional patients achieved PSA <0.1 at las t follow -up <12 months and are not included 
among the 7 patients on whom the 29% rate is calculated and because these patients were on continual ADT).

We will determine the proportion of patients who achieve PSA <0.6ng/ml at 12 months.  Patients who are unable to complete 12 months of follow -up due to AEs or worsening disease 
will be considered treatment failures and will be included in the intention to treat calculation of the proportion with undetectable PSA.  The table shows the lower 95% confidence bound for different target proportions of undetectable PSA, including the minimum value of 30% derived above.  Confidence interval bounds were calculated using PASS v11 (NCSS Software, Inc., Kaysville, UT).  If promising results are seen, it would warrant further investigation in a larger, randomized Phase II trial.     
 
Exploratory  endpoints   
Biopsy PD -1 and PD -L1:  Expression of each biomarker will be correlated with proportion 
undetectable PSA using logistic regression, and with change in tumor burden using ANOVA or Kruskal -Wallis.  Analyses to correlate expression with other binary or continuous clinical 
parameters will be similarly performed.

Study Number: Vedoliz umab -4001 Phase: 4
Study Design:
This is an open -label, multicenter and open enrollment model, milk -only postmarketing study to assess concentrations 
of vedolizumab in breast milk of lactating women with active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease ( CD) who are 
receiving vedolizumab therapeutically. Up to 12 (minimum of 10) lactating women with active UC or CD at least [ADDRESS_777165] -feeding their infants (or not 
providing more than 1 suppleme ntal bottle of formula/day) when enrolled in this study.
Treatment Group No. of Subjects Treatment
1 Up to 12 (minimum of 10) lactating 
women with active UC or CD 300 mg intravenous (IV) Infusion 
over 30 min 
At the approximately scheduled dosing time based on an established vedolizumab maintenance regimen, subjects will 
report to the clinic, study site ,or other healthcare provider (HCP) office at Check-in (Day 1) and receive a 30 -minute 
IV infusion. Subjects will remain at the clinic, study site, or o ther HCP office until after the Day 1 pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and safety assessments are completed. It is anticipated that visits on Days 4, 8, 15, or [ADDRESS_777166]’s home setting in the presence of a qualified nurse. To facilitate these visits, the subject should have access to 
a telepho ne. In most cases, home nurses performing a visit to a subject may complete study data forms that can be 
entered into the database by [CONTACT_590015]. In other cases, subje cts may  visit a clinic, 
study site, or other HCP office for assessments or to provide milk samples. The Study Exit/Follow -up safety  
assessment will occur on Day 57. The total duration on study for each subject will be approximately 3 months, 
including scre ening.

4.1 Background
Vedolizumab (also referred to as MLN0002 or Entyvio) i s a humanized immunoglobulin G1 
monoclonal antibody  (mAb) di rected against the hum an lymphocy te integrin α 4β7. The 
α4β7integrin mediates lymphocy te trafficking to th e gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa and 
gut-associated lympho id tissue through adhesive interact ion wit h mucosal addressin cell adhesio n 
molecule -1 (MAdCAM -1), which is expressed on the endothelium of mesenteric lymph nodes and 
GI mucosa [1-4] . Vedolizumab binds the α 4β7integrin, antagonizing its adherence to MAdCAM -[ADDRESS_777172] iveness and safet y of vedolizumab intended for intravenous (IV) use (vedolizumab IV, 
vedo lizumab for injection, for intravenous use) for ulcerative colit is (UC) and Crohn’s disease 
(CD) have been established in pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 clinical studies in subjects who had not responded 
adequately  to corti coster oids, immuno modulators, or tum or necrosis factor -alpha (TNF
-α) 
antagonists. As of 19 November 2016, a total of 8 phase 1 studies in healt hy subjects, 
8phase 1b/phase [ADDRESS_777173] been co mpleted. Fourteen clinical studies are currently  ongoing in the vedolizumab 
development program. 
As of 19 November 2016, approximately 4200 subjects ([ADDRESS_777174] antati on (allo-HSCT ), [ADDRESS_777175] wi th pouchiti s, and 2 subjects wi th melano ma) have 
received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across completed and ongoing co mpany -sponsored 
intervent ional clinical studies. Vedolizumab exposur e in interventional clinical studies has 
extended for ≥12 m onths in 1832 subjects, ≥24 months in 1379 subjects, ≥36 m onths in 1169 
subjects, ≥48 months in 862 subjects, ≥60 months in 645 subjects, ≥72 months in 308 subjects, 
≥84 months in 32 subjects, and ≥[ADDRESS_777176] 1 dose of vedo lizumab across ongoing co mpany -sponsored 
nonintervent ional clinical studies. Based on drug shipment data as of 19 November 2016, the 
cumulative postmar keting patient exposure to vedolizumab IV globally is estimated to be 
approximately  77,382 pati ent-years.
Vedolizumab exhibits target -mediated drug disposit ion as characterized by [CONTACT_590018] -dose administrati on. Following IV dosing, vedo lizumab 
concentrations fell in a biexponent ial fashio n unt il concentrations reached approximately  1to 
10g/mL with a serum terminal eliminat ion half -life (t 1/2z) of approximately 25 days. Thereafter, 
vedo lizumab concentration s fell in a nonlinear fashio n.
Similar pharmacokinet ics (PK) was observed in healthy subjects and in subjects with UC or CD. 
Results fro m popul ation PK analyses suggest that while body  weight and serum  albumin are 
predi ctors of clearance, their effects are not considered clinically relevant. The PK of vedo lizuma b 
was similar in Japanese and Western subjects with UC. Vedolizumab PK was not affected by [CONTACT_590019], including 6 -mercaptopurine,

during the reproductive years [5]. Therefore, the safety  of medications to treat UC and CD during 
pregnancy and lactation is of significant interest to women patients of childbearing potential, as 
these medications may be transferred in u tero or through breast milk from nursing inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) patients to their newborns [5]. Based on literature, mAbs, including selected 
TNF-α antagonists, are excreted in human milk; however, these antibodies in breast milk do not 
enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts [6-10] . Low levels  of 
vedolizumab were detected on postpartum  in the milk  
treated with  of vedolizumab ( ) 
dosed every  weeks; however, vedolizumab was not detected in the milk of any monkeys (n=7)

human milk. 
The purpose of this postmarketing clinical study is to assess concentrations of vedolizumab in 
breast milk of lactating women with active UC or CD who have been on established vedolizumab 
IV maintenance treatment during the study period. This  study is intended to fulfill the sponsor’s 
postmarketing commitment to conduct a milk-only lactation study as  specified in the vedolizumab

who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically. Up to 12 (minimum of 10) lactating women with 
active UC or CD who are at least [ADDRESS_777181] (IRB), the open enrollment model may be implemented in addition to the traditional 
site-based approach.
Principal investigators (PIs) may be given the option to enroll and manage only subjects treated at 
their site (ie, traditional site) and/or to serve as a central PI (ie, provide oversight of subjects 
enrolled through the open enrollment model). The PIs are appropriately trained physicians who are 
responsible for providing oversight of the study, en suring protocol a dherence, and assessing safety 
of subjects and their infants enrolled in the study. Traditional sites are responsible for identifying 
eligible subjects from their institution, consenting/enrolling subjects, performing study 
procedures, coordinating home healt hcare visits, assessing subjects’ safety, and collecting and 
entering data into the electronic case report form (eCRF).
In addition to the traditional site-based approach, having an open enrollment approach provides 
the opportunity for other eligible subjects to self -enroll if they reside outside of the geographic 
location of the traditional sites. Enrollment is facilitated by  [CONTACT_590021] 
(RCC) in the US. The RCC staff (who are formally trained in the appropriate methods for handling 
study procedures) coordinate enrollment and facilitate study management between: 
!A subject enrolled using the open enrollment service.
!The subject’s designated central site/investigator.
!The subject’s healthcare providers (HCPs). 
!The subject’s home healthcare nurses.
In the open enrollment model, eligible subjects are identified through awareness activities directed 
at the subject and her HCPs. The subject contacts  RCC for information a bout the study and, 
if interested in proceeding, answers prescreening questions. Interested eligible subjects provide 
written informed consent and medical release. The RCC assigns the subject to a central site/PI. The 
central PI, with the assistance of the RCC, will work with the subject and her HCP to assess 
eligibility. Screening activities are coordinated by [CONTACT_590022]’s local HCP, and 
the findings are shared with the central PI. The central PI [INVESTIGATOR_589997] (AEs) are properly assessed 
and reported and will provide oversight for the study. The central PI [INVESTIGATOR_589998] a

Upon confirmat ion of eligibilit y at init ial screening by  [CONTACT_590023], the RCC facilitates de livery 
of study -related materi als (ie, el ectroni c breast pump) to the subject. The RCC facilitates ho me 
visits with the designated local ho me healt hcare agency. A breast pump and supplies for collect ing 
the milk samples will be provided to the subject. Add itional data collect ion and AE reporting in 
accordance with co llection and reporting procedures described in Sect ion 10.2 are facilitated by 
[CONTACT_404432]. The RCC provides ongoing assistance to the central site/invest igator througho ut the 
study .
This is a milk- only lactati on study  with maternal milk sampling throughout the dosing interval, 
which allows detection of the presence of vedo lizumab in milk of lactating wo men. No samples 
will be co llected from the breast -fed infants in this study . Mothers m ust be exclusively  
breast -feeding their infants (or not providing more than 1 supplemental bottle of formula/day) 
when enro lled in this study.
Subjects with an established vedo lizumab maintenance regimen and have received at l east [ADDRESS_777182] ion therapy  
(300 mg o f vedo lizumab IV at Week 0, Week 2, and Week 6 )will report to the clinic, study site, or 
other HCP office at Check -in (Day 1) and receive a 30 -minute IV infusio n of 300 mg vedolizumab 
at their approximately scheduled dosing time. Subjects will remain at the clinic, study site, or other 
HCP office unt il after the Day 1 PK and safet y assessments are com pleted. It i s ant icipated that 
visits on Days 4 ( ±1), 8 (±2), 15 (±3), or 29 (
±3) may be co mpleted in the subject’s ho me setting in 
the presence o f a qualified nurse. To facilitate these visits, the subject should have access to a 
telephone. In m ost cases, hom e nurses performing a visit to a subject may  com plete study data 
forms that can be entered into the database by [CONTACT_590024]. In other cases, subjects may 
visit a clinic, study site, or other HCP office for assessments or to provide milk samples. The Study 
Exit/Foll ow-up safet y assessment will occur on Da y 57 (±3). The total  durati on on study  for each 
subject will be approximately  3 months, including Screening .

9.1.8 Documentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions
Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing condit ions or diseases that are present
at signing of informed consent. This includes clinically significant laboratory  or physical 
examinat ion abnormalit ies noted at screening examinat ion. The condit ion (ie, diagnosis) should be 
described.

Day 1 pri or to dosing, and on Day  57 pri or to the next scheduled dose.
9.1.10 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedure
From  signing of informed consent, throughout the dura tion of the study, ([ADDRESS_777207] dose of 
study  medicat ion), female subjects who are sexually act ive with a nonsterilized male partner** 
must use adequate contraception. In addit ion they must be advised not to donate ova or breast milk 
during thi s per iod.
*Females NOT of childbearing potential are defined as those who have been surgically sterilized 
(hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) or who are postmenopausal (eg, defined 
as at l east [ADDRESS_777208] regular menses wit h an FSH>40 IU/L or at l east [ADDRESS_777209] 
regul ar menses, confirmed before any  study  medicati on is implemented).
**Sterilized males should be at least [ADDRESS_777210]

An acceptable method of contraception is defined as one that has no higher than a 1% failure rate. 
In thi s study , where medicat ions and devices containing hormones are excluded, the only 
acceptable methods of contraception are: 
Barrier methods (each time the 
subject has intercourse):Intrauterine devices 
(IUDs):Hormonal contraceptives 
(only Non -estrogen 
containing products 
allowed:
Male condom PLUS spermicide.

9.1.13 PK Sample/Milk Collection
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Breast Milk for PK Sampling
Milk fro m each breast will be completely empt ied using an electric milk pump at the specified time 
points according to Table 9.afor the determinat ion of vedo lizumab concentrations in the milk. 
Milk co llected fro m each b reast at each time point will be pooled, and the total volume o f milk 
collected and the starting and finishing time o f each co llection will be recorded on the source 
docum ent and eCRF. Two 5 -mL aliquots of milk will be stored at -70°C until analysis o f 
vedolizumab concentration by [CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Subjects with 
masti tis should not have milk samples co llected until the infection is co mpletely reso lved. If 
masti tis is not resol ved wi thin the allowed window for sample collect ion, the sample shoul d be 
collected at an unscheduled visit as close to scheduled time po int as possible. If the unscheduled 
collect ion overlaps with the next scheduled time point, the missed sample co llection shoul d be 
skipped. For milk sample collect ion on Days 4 through 57 (Days 4 through Day 29,prior to next

[IP_ADDRESS] Bioanalytical Methods
Milk concentrations of vedo lizumab will be measured by a validated ELISA to measure 
vedo lizumab concentra tions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] PK Parameters 
Milk PK parameters of vedo lizumab will be derived using non -compart mental analysis methods. 
The PK parameters of vedo lizumab will be determined fro m the concentration -time data for all 
evaluable subjects. Actual mid -point sam pling ti mes, rather than scheduled sampling times, will 
be used in all co mputations invo lving sampling times. The fo llowing PK param eters will  be 
determined fro m concentrations of vedo lizumab in milk: C max, AUC t, AUC τ, and t max. The 
estimated daily infant dosage t hrough breast milk on each sampling day, the mean daily infant 
dosage over the dosing interval and the percentage of weight -adjusted maternal dose consumed in 
breast milk may be calculated using the corresponding breast milk concentration(s) on the 
samplin g day  or AUC τvalues and the standardized breast -fed infant milk consumption o f 
150mL/kg/day per FDA guidance on clinical lactation studies [11], as appropriate. Addit ional PK 
param eters m ay be cal culated.

administered a drug; it d oes not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a d rug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_777221] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing c onditions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered u nfavorable by [CONTACT_4168]. 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanyin g signs or 
symptoms should NOT be recorded as addit ional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or 
symptom (s) shoul d be recorded appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related 
to study procedures. However, if the subject ex periences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as a 
PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medication) or an AE (worsening

or com plicat ion occurs aft er start of study  medication). Invest igators should ensure that the 
event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_176843] d only be captured as a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_45285], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a deg enerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recor ded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorde d appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or com plicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of anAE/serious PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AE s. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned sur gery shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. C omplicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of

Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for inform ation for special  interest AE reporting. 
Speci al interest AEs for vedolizumab below should be reported to [COMPANY_005] within 24 hours.
10.1.6 Severity of PTEs and AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The ev ent is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.7 Causality of A Es
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for whic h possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reaso nable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causali ty) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship shou ld be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or physician.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolv ed but with

Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study medication was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion was already 
stopped before the onset of the AE.
10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved –Subject returned to first asses sment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the di agnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to b aseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of deat h.

[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE Repo rting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the st udy. Subjects experiencing a

Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects rece iving vedo lizumab; hence such 
prem edicat ions are unlikely to be necessary or beneficial. At the discret ion of the invest igator, 
however, subjects may  be administered premedicatio n prior to any  vedolizumab administration. 
Corti costeroi ds, if given as a prem edicat ion, should be limited to the day  of administrati on. 
Vedolizumab should be administered by a health care professional prepared to manage 
hypersensit ivity react ions including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and 
medical support measu re shoul d be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed 
during the infusion and until the infusio n is co mplete.
Subjects should be instructed to report the development of rash, hives, pruritus, flushing, urticaria, 
etc. that m ay represent an infusio n-related reacti on to study  medicat ion. If signs or symptoms of 
infusio n-related reaction are observed during the administration of study, it should be immediately 
discontinued and the subject treated as medically appropriate. In the case of a mild react ion, 
vedo lizumab administration may be reinit iated (with appropriate premedication) at the discret ion 
of the invest igator. Subjects with severe or serious infusio n
-related reacti ons (eg, stri dor,

No data safet y monitoring co mmittee will be used in t his study . 
11.1 Adjudication Committee 
A PML Independent Adjudication Co mmittee (IAC) will be inst ituted for this study . The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist. 
11.1.1 Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP Program)
To address the theoretical risk o f the development of PML in subjects treated with vedo lizumab, 
the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a Risk Assessment and 
Minimizat ionfor PML, the RAMP pr ogram. The complete descript ion of the RAMP program, 
including materials and instructions for its implementation and monitoring, is included in the 
Study  Manual. The RAMP program is focused on early clinical detection and management of that 
specific safet yrisk, including the discont inuat ion of vedo lizumab, if applicable. Subjects are 
assessed for signs and symptoms of PML prior to administration of vedo lizumab using a PML 
subjective symptom checklist. Subjects with a positive PML subject ive symptom checkli st at any  
time after enrollment in a vedo lizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a prespecified 
algorithm (the PML Case Evaluat ion Algori thm). An IAC has been established as part of the 
RAMP program to review new neuro logical signs and sympto ms potentially consistent with PML, 
and will provide input regarding subject evaluat ion and management as defined in the IAC charter. 
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specific neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects about PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sites and are included in the Study Manual. Formal tea ching 
and training will be performed for site personnel prior to the start of the study . Subjects will 
receive training and educat ional materials prior to receiving treatment. The informed consent form 
will contain specific informat ion on the hy potheti cal risk of PML. Any documented case of PML 
will be reported as an SAE, regardless of whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149323].

(a) Conduct procedures for subjects discontinued early  per Protocol Section 7.8. The PK sample should be collected at 
the Early  Termination Visit, if possible. Study Exit/Follow -up visit should occur prior to subject receiving the 
subsequent, scheduled vedolizumab maintenance dose (not part of this study).
(b) Informed consent must be signed before any study -
specific procedures are performed.
(c) All physical examinations are to be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_590008], Day 1 (predose), and Day 
57 (±3)/Study Exit /Follow -up. Clinically  significant findings on the physical examination that occur postdose of 
vedolizumab will be recorded as AEs. For subjects participating in open enrollment, the physical examination may be 
performed by [CONTACT_423]’s local HCP, and a r ecord of that examination provided to the investigator as documentation.
(d) The PML checklist will be administered at screening, prior to dosing on Day 1 and Study Exit/Early Termination 
(ET)/Follow -up on Day  57.
(e) Vital signs (oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_51520], pulse, and blood pressure) will be obtained at Screening, on Day 1 
(predose and at 1 hours after the end of infusion), Days 4, 8, 15, and 29, and Study Exit/Follow -up (Day  57) or Early  
Termination) will be measured after 5 minutes supi[INVESTIGATOR_050].
(f) Height will only be collected at Screening.
(g) Record all ongoing medications from Screening and throughout the study.
(h) Urine pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, on Day 1 prior to dosing and on Day 57 prior to the next 
scheduled dose.
(i) Milk samp les for PK analyses will be collected at predose (within 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion) and 
approximately 1 hour after the end of infusion on Day 1, and on Days 4, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( for Q8W regimen only ) ,

57 (3)/Early Terminat ion visits. Addit ional unscheduled ECGs may be recorded 
where clinically  necessary  for subject safet y.
When an ECG is scheduled at the same time as milk collect ion or vital signs then the 
milk collection and vital signs will take priorit y and the ECG will be obtained before 
or after the scheduled milk collect ion/vital sign assessment. If an ECG coincides wit h 
a meal, ECG will take precedence followed by  [CONTACT_45325].
All stationary  12-lead ECG machines will be supplied by [CONTACT_779]. Subjects sho uld be 
in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_590014] [ADDRESS_777268] period for ECG 
recordings. Should technical difficult ies occur during recording of the ECG, a 
reasonable attempt should be made to repeat the ECG shortly after the failed attempt. 
ECGs wi ll be read automatically and also, the investigator or subinvestigator will 
manually interpret the ECG using 1 of the fo llowing categories: within normal limits, 
abnorm al but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. All 
12-lead E CGs will be stored for manual measurement of intervals, if necessary . 
Twelve -lead ECGs will be recorded using an ECG machine that automat ically 
calculates the heart rate and measures PR interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT

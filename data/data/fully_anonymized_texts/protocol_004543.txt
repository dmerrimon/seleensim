of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.  
Rationale :
The purpose of this study  is to test whether LY3016859 is efficacious in relieving diabet ic 
peripheral  neuropathi c pain (D PNP).  LY3016859 is a high affinit y humanized 
immunogl obulin G (IgG)4 monocl onal antibody  that binds to key  residues in the C -terminal
regions of transforming growth factor -α(TGF -α) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], prevent ing their binding to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_104442] (EGFR).  
Data will be collected to assess the safet y and tol erabili ty of LY3016859 in this study  popul ation. 
Pharmacokinet ic(PK)properti es, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and immunogenicit y profile 
will also be explored .  
The totalit y of data fro m this proof -of-concept study will assess the
benefit s and risksassociated with LY3016859 and inform  decisio ns for the clinical devel opment 
of LY3016859.
Objectives and Endpoint s
The primary  and secondary  object ives and endpo ints are stated in the master protocol H0P -MC-
CPMP (CPMP) and DPNP disease -state addendum ( [DSA ]H0P-MC-CPMP[ 3]).
Overall Design :
This is a 26-week, Phase [ADDRESS_115772] acebo -controlled study that will 
compare LY3016859 versus placebo in participants with DPNP .
Disclosure Statement : This is a rando mized, investigator -and participant -blind, placebo -
controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial .
Number of Participant s:
Approximately  
125participants will be rando mly assigned to study  interventi on(84 LY3016859 
and 41 placebo) with the assumption that 15% of the participants will drop out prior to the end of 
the double -blind treatm ent period.

132. Introduction
This ISA NP01 is an appendix to the master protocol CPMP and contains unique study  elements 
specific for LY3016859.  The mas ter protocol  contains the overarching study  elements that 
govern the DPNP DSA CPMP(3) and this ISA NP01.  
LY3016859 is a high affinit y humanized immunoglo bulin G (IgG)4 monocl onal ant ibody  that 
binds to key  residues in the C -terminal regio ns of transformi ng growth factor -α(TGF -α) and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], preventing their binding to the e pi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR).  
Engagement of LY3016859 results in internalizat ion of the membrane -spanning ligands and 
neutralizat ion of mature ligand activit y in vitro .
The EGFR and epi[INVESTIGATOR_77111] (Martin et al. 2017).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_77112]/insult (Martin et al. 2017).  Inhibit ion of EGFR with 
clinically available compounds strongly reduces nocifensive behavior in mouse models of 
inflammatory  and chronic pain, including spi[INVESTIGATOR_77113]

relief o f pain ( Kersten et al. 2013; Kersten et al. 2015; Juhasz et al. 2013); and the pain relief was 
independent of disease progression (Kersten and Cam eron 2012).  
2.1. Study Rationale
The purpose of this study  is to test whether LY3016859 is effic acious in relieving DPNP .  Data
will be collected to assess the safet y, and tolerability  of LY3016859 in this study  populati on. 
Pharmacokinet ic (PK)properti es, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and immunogenicit y profile 
will also be explored .  The totalit y of data fro m this proof -of concept study will assess the
benefit s and risksassociated wi thLY3016859 and inform  decisio nsfor the clinical development 
of LY3016859
.

Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for 
Risk Mitig ation Strategy
Study Intervention LY3016859
Development of treatment -emergent 
anti-drug antibodies (TE ADA) .Incidence of TE ADA was 50% after 
a single dose, and up to 57% after 
multiple doses.Collect samples up to 20weeks after 
last dose to characterize ADA 
profile . 
IVinfusion may be associated with 
infusion reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions . LY3016859 is a monoclonal 
antibody that will be administered 
via IV infusion. Hypersensitivity 
reactions and infusion reactio ns may  
occur during treatment with such 
agents.Monitor infusion reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions .
Guidance on management of 
infusion andhypersensitivity 
reactions are in Sections 8.2.[ADDRESS_115777] dermatological AEs .
Stop dosing for severe 
dermatological AEs .
Changes in eGFR in pa rticipan ts 
with diabetic nephropathy (DN)A modest and non -statis ti
cally
significant decrease in eGFR was 
observed in pa rticipa nts with DN 
who receive dLY3016859 in Part B 
of Study TGAB, but not in healthy 
participants in Study TGAA .Exclude pa rticipan
ts with moderate 
renal impairment in the study .
Monitor eGFR and stop dosing if 
necessary .
 
Fetal harm due to in utero exposure No effects on embryo -fetal 
development in enhanced pi[INVESTIGATOR_104444] -fetal development studies in 
rats and rabbits .  Definitive 
developmental and reproductive 
toxicity studies are not yet 
completed.Do not enroll women who are 
pregnant or breastfeeding in studies

236.1.1. Special Treatment Considerations
[IP_ADDRESS]. Premedication for Infusions
Prem edicat ion for infusio ns is not pl anned.  However, if an infusion react ion occurs, the study  
investigator(s ) should determine the appropri ate premedication for subsequent infusio ns for that 
participant .
The invest igator sand sponsor may decide to usepremedicat ion for all participants.  They  will 
decide this if the frequency of infusio n reactions amo ng participants warrants it .
Any premedicat ions given will be documented as a concomitant therapy  (see Secti on6.5).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Infusion Reactions
All participants shoul d be m onitored cl osely , asthere is a risk of infusio n reaction and 
hypersensit ivity (incl uding anaphylaxis) with any bi ological  agent.  
Symptoms and Signs
Symptom s and si gns that m ay occur as part of an infusio n reaction include, but are not limited to 
fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, throat irrit ation, rash, 
pruri tus, myalgia, and dizziness.  
Site Needs
The clinical site should have necessary equipment and medicat ions for the m anagement of any 
infusio n reaction, which may include but is not limited to oxy gen, IV fluid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
acetaminophen and ant ihistamine.
Management of Infusion Reaction s
Invest igators should grade the severit y of the infusio n reaction andmanage infusio n react ions 
based on standard of care and their clinical  judgment .  If an infusio n reaction occurs, then 
supportive care shoul d be used in accordance with the signs and symptoms.
This table outlines guidance when a mild to moderate infusio n reaction occurs.
If… Then…
a mild to moderate infusion reaction occurs the infusion rate should be slowed or stopped depending 
on the symptoms or signs present.
For example, reducing the rate by 50% from 
2 mL/ minute to 1 mL/ minute .
the infusion rate is slowed the infusion should be completed at the slower rate, 
as tolerated.
subsequent infusions may be administered at the 
discretio n of the investigator in agreement with the 
Lilly  medical monitor. 
the infusion rate is slowed, and subsequent infusions are 
continuedthe infusion rate must be maintained at the slowest 
tolerated rate used. 
CONFIDENTIAL Master Protocol Number H0P -MC-CPMP ISA:H0P-MC-NP01(a)
24The s tudy intervent ion infusio n shoul d be stopped immediately  and perm anent ly if it isan 
infusio n reaction
with systemic invo lvement, including, but not limited to significant treatment emergent 
hypotension, bronchospasm, or wide -spread urt icaria 
that does not respond to a slower infusion rate or oral medications
that is determined as clinically  significant by  [CONTACT_17062].  
If a participant permanent ly discontinues from  study  intervent ion, they  shoul dcomplete AE
monitoring and other procedures as stated in Section 4, Study  Design, and the CPMP and NP01 
SoAs.
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Study  intervent ion and placebo requi re refrigerat ion.
Study  intervent ion and placebo will be prepared and verified by [CONTACT_104457].
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Stratification Variables
Estimated GFR will be used for stratificat ion to ensure a balanced number of participants for 
analysis of renal effects.  Measurements will be collected at Visit 2 and the subsets are
greater than or equal to 90, and
less than 90. 
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participants will receive study  intervent ion directly fro m the invest igator or designee, under 
medical supervisio n.  The date and time of each study  intervent ionadministered in the clinic will 
be recorded in the source documents and case report form ( CRF ).  
Administration of intervent ion
and study  parti cipant i dentification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the 
study  site staff other than the person administering the study  interventi on.  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy

SoAs. 
LY3016859 specific assessments and procedures are described here. 
8.1. Safety Assessments
Planned time po ints for all safet y assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.1.1. Physical Examinations
Targeted physical examinat ions of skin, eyes, month, lungs and GI tract will be performed at 
each visit as described in the SoA. Any clinically significant abnormal physical examinat ion 
findings will be reported as AEs. 
8.1.2. Electrocardiograms
Single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that 
autom atically calculates the heart rate and measures pulse rate , QRS, QT , and QTc .
8.1.3.
Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See NP01 Appendix 1 (Secti on 10.1)for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and

8.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
8.2.1. Infusion Site Reactions
Symptom s of a l ocal infusi on site reacti on may  include ery thema, indurat ion, pain, pruritus, and 
edem a.If an infusio n site event is reported, the AE will be recorded, and additional data will be 
provi ded to the spon sor in the CRF.
Addit ional blood and urine samples should be co llected as described in NP01 Secti on 10.3, 
Appendix 3, “Recommended Laboratory  Test ing for Hy persensi tivity Events”.   Laboratory 
resul ts are provi ded to the sponsor vi a the central  laboratory .
8.2.2. Hypersensitivity Reactions and Infusion -related Reactions
Many  drugs, but parti cularly biologic agents ,carry the ri sk of systemic hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons. Drugs administered via IV infusio n may lead to a sy stemic infusio n-related reacti on. 
If such a react ion occurs, a dditional data describing each symptom should be provide dto the 
sponsor in the CRF.  
Sites shoul d have appropri ately  trained medical  staff and appropri ate medical equipment 
available when study  parti cipants are receiving study  intervent ion. It is recommended that 
participants who experience a systemic reaction be treated per the local standard of ca re.  
In the case of generalized urticaria oranaphylaxis ,or moderate to severe infusio n-related 
reacti ons, additional bl ood and urine samples should be collected as described in NP01

288.2.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Dermatological adverse reactions
EGFR ant ibodies or EGFR -associ ated ty rosine kinase inhibitors are associated with various 
derm atological AEs, including acn eiform  rashes, xerosis, pruri tis, and photosensit ivity. 
Secondary  infect ion can also develop. 
Participants shoul d use sun protection for the duratio n of the study .  Derm atological adverse 
reacti ons shoul d be managed by [CONTACT_77130].  Discont inuat ion 
of treatm ent m ay be considered if these AEs do not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_104449] (>30% body  surface area) or are severe.
If any o f these AEs are reported, sites will be prompted to provide addit ional informat ion. 
Renal Function
Changes in eGFR were observed in pa rticipants with diabetic nephropathy  in study  TGAB 
(Secti on 2.2).  Such changes were reversible and were not associ ated wi th increase in proteinuri a.  
Bloodand urine samples will be collected to characterize the effects of LY3016859 on renal 
funct ion and eGFR will be mo nitored during the study .
8.3. Treatment of Overdose
In case of suspected overdose, participants should be mo nitored for any  signs or symptom s of 
adverse reactions or effects, and supportive care should be provided as necessary.

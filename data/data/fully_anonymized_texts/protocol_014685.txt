1.0 Objectives 109 
1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research. 110 
Response:  111 
Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of extended pre-quit  varenicline therapy on smoking cessation.  112 
Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of extended pre-quit  varenicline therapy on smoking behavior and 113 
related processes prior to cessation.  114 
Aim 3: Evaluate the degree to which changes in pr e-quit smoking behavior (Aim 2) truly account [ADDRESS_471103] of extended pre-qu it varenicline on smoking cessation (Aim 1).  116 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : As detailed in [ADDRESS_471104] (EvarQuit Admin Supp Appl ication – 2020-04-21.pdf), “…to 118 
enhance this R01’s ability to inform and link to precision medi cine approaches, we propose to evaluate the 119 
role of variants in two families of genes previously associated  with varenicline concentrations, nausea, 120 
and/or smoking cessation” (select SNPs related to drug transpor t [OCT2] and nicotinic  receptor subunits 121 
[CHRNA4/CHRNB2]). 122 
1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested, if applicable. 123 
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to happen in your study 124 
that corresponds with your above listed objectives. 125 
Response:  126 
We hypothesize that extended run-in varenicline will improve bio-verified continuous abstinence 127 
rates at end-of-treatment and at long-term follow- up (6- months), compared to the standard run- 128 
in. Because extended pre-quit treatment may be particularly helpful fo r women (Becker et al., 129 
2008; Hawk et al., 2012), the study is powered to  evaluate moderation of treatment by [CONTACT_547]. [ADDRESS_471105] that  the extended run-in group will exhibit greater 131 
pre-quit reductions in smoking (cigarettes per da y, CO) than the standard run-in group. Effects 132

Response: 147 
Our primary outcome measure (for  Aims 1 and 3) is bio-verified self-report of continuous abstinence from 148 
smoking during the final four weeks of treatment (Weeks 8-[ADDRESS_471108]-quit, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_376542] 149

pre-quit phase of the study (Weeks -5 through -1), as reported during daily morning EMA assessments. 155 
Secondary measures for understanding the causal process include  expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]-air CO and varenicline levels 156 
will also be examined, as will la boratory measures of reinforce ment, craving, withdrawal, subjective effects 157 
of smoking, and nausea. 158 
3.0 Background 159 
3.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of the research based on 160 
the existing literature and how it will contribute to existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in 161 
current knowledge.  Include relevant preliminary findings or prior research by [CONTACT_093].  162 
Response: Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cau se of death in the US, killing an estimated 163 
480,000 people per year and linked to 1 in 3 cancer deaths. The  2014 Surgeon General’s Report (US 164 
DHHS, 2014) suggests that the consequences of smoking are even worse than previously thought. Cigarette [ADDRESS_471111] increased the risk smoking poses for lung c ancer, and smoking is now linked to an 166 
even larger number of cancers ( including colorectal and liver).   Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that 167 
smoking increases the risk for cancer recurrence and treatment toxicity (US DHHS, 2014).  168 
Although quitting smoking markedly lowers disease risk and impr oves health (US DHHS 2014), there are a 169 
limited number of effective smoking cessation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and lo ng-term cessation rates remain low. Three 170 
evidence-based pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_376544]:  nicotine replacement 171 
therapy (NRT), bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and var enicline. Both NRT and bupropi [INVESTIGATOR_376545] 172 
long-term cessation (6 months or more) when compared to placebo  (e.g., Fiore et al., 2008). Varenicline, 173 
approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2006, triples the odds of quitting compa red to placebo and outperforms single- 174 
NRT and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (for a review , see Cahill et al., 2013; c.f. Baker et al., 2016). Nevertheless, long-term 175 
abstinence rates remain low, with  only 1 in 4 varenicline users  smoke free 6+ months after quitting (Cahill 176 
et al., 2013). 177 
Given the tremendous costs of smoking and the benefits of quitt ing, the development of cessation 178 
approaches with greater efficac y is critical.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_376546] 179 
answer. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_376547] 180

reached the US market, “no new s moking cessation aid is nearing …FDA approval” (e.g., Rigotti, 2015). [ADDRESS_471112] – but that is 182 
exactly what we need. 183 
To advance clinical pr actice, we build on basic research, theor y, and compelling preliminary data from 184 
small-scale RCTs to evaluate a treatment approach that appears likely to beat our current “best in class” [ADDRESS_471113] (e.g ., Kraemer et al. 200 6; MacKinnon, 2008; 187 
Rigotti, 2015; TRIP, 1988). Varenicline binds to the alpha-4 be ta-2 receptor subun it of nicotinic 188 
acetylcholine receptors  (nAChR), exerting effects as both a par tial nicotine agonist, by [CONTACT_74873] [ADDRESS_471114]-cessation smoking cravings and satisfaction with cigarettes during 191 
lapses (e.g., Gonzales et al., 2006; Jorenby [CONTACT_2297]., 2006). For  varenicline, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_376548] 192 
a week prior to quitting and is hypothesized to work partly by [CONTACT_376566] 193 
(e.g., Rollema et al., 2007), it is also critical to examine pr e-quit treatment mechanis ms (e.g., Cummings & 194 
Mahoney, 2008; Fiore et al., 2008; Hawk et al., 2015; Rose, 200 9, 2011; Rose & Levin, 1991).  195 
From a learning perspective, when favorable consequences of a b ehavior are removed, the behavior 196 
decreases in frequency, or is extinguished. Consistent with the  hypothesis that varenicline diminishes the 197 
reinforcing value of smoking in humans, varenicline dose-depend ently reduces self-administration of 198 
nicotine in rats (O’Connor et al., 2010; Rollema et al., 2007).  For varenicline to promote extinction in [ADDRESS_471115] continue smoking while taking the drug  in order to learn that the reinforcing 200 
effects are attenuated. The typi [INVESTIGATOR_370928]-week run-in period for varenicline is likely insufficient, as extinction 201 
requires numerous “trials” (see B outon et al. 2012) and does no t generalize well from one situation or 202 
context to another (Bouton, 20 00, 2004a; Collins & Brandon, 200 2; see also Conklin & Tiffany, 2002).  203 
How can we effectively promote such extinction in smokers? The pi[INVESTIGATOR_376549]. (1988) [ADDRESS_471116] method: ext end the pre-quit run-in medication period to 205 
allow greater repeated natural e xposure to attenuated reinforce ment from smoking prior to the target quit 206 
date (TQD). We recently tested this approach in small-RCTs of b oth bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (Hawk et al., 2015 /Prelim 207 
Study 1) and varenicline (Hawk et  al., 2012 / Prelim Study 2; s ee also Ashare et al., 2012, Gass et al., 208 
2012); treatment-seeking smokers  were randomized to either a St andard run-in group (3 weeks of placebo, 209 
1 week of pre-TQD medication) or an Extended run-in group (4 we eks of pre-TQD medication); all [ADDRESS_471117]-T QD medication.  Hajek et al. (2011) [ADDRESS_471118] of va renicline. In all three pi[INVESTIGATOR_36035], the 212 
results were consistent with an extinction hypothesis: the exte nded run-in resulted in greater reductions in 213 
smoking rate (and tended to reduce craving and smoking satisfac tion) prior to the TQD and improved 214 
abstinence rates at short-term f ollow-up. (In both Hawk et al. studies, there was evidence that the extended [ADDRESS_471119] among women more than men; Hajek et  al. did not examine gender effects). 216 
Overall, the results of these th ree studies are promising, part icularly because the c ontrol condition was an 217 
approved cessation medication; in the case of varenicline, the extended run-in beat the current “best in 218 
class” treatment (standard run- in varenicline). However, the st udies were limited by [CONTACT_376567] 219 
sizes (Ns=60-100) and short-term follow-up (4 weeks – 3 months) .  [ADDRESS_471120] and far more quickly than tradi tional pharmaceutical d evelopment pathways 225

at clinic visits (e.g., Gonzales  et al., 2006; Jorenby [CONTACT_2297]., 2006; Ebbert et al., 2015), most laboratory [ADDRESS_471124] focused on participants who are not 234 
actively trying to quit (Mostchman et al., 2014). As in our pil ot RCT with varenicline (Hawk et al., 2012; 235

UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : An optional [ADDRESS_471126] to  screen to reach your target sample (i.e. your 269 
screen failure rate).  270 
Response: To accrue [ADDRESS_471127] developed conservative projections 271 
for accruing 9 ITT participants per month: screening approximat ely 55 potential partic ipants by [CONTACT_376569] 272 
month, with 50% (28) of those e ligible after phone prescreen, 5 0% (14) of those attend ing the intake visit, 273 
75% (10) of those at intake consenting and remaining eligible a fter full screening, a nd 90% (9) of those 274 
eligible ultimately achieve ITT status. 275 
2019-11 Update (approved/implemented early 2020-01):   In recent months, we have extensively 276 
reviewed our accrual process.  Accrual flow projections that we  made in the grant p roposal (e.g., 50% 277 
eligible on phone screen, 75% e ligible at intake visit) have be en accurate, with one c ritical exception.  We 278 

 7
predicted that we would lose no more than 10% of prospective pa rticipants between the intake visit and 279 
beginning treatment 1-2 weeks later (and counting as one of our  320 intent-to-treat, or  ITT, participants). In [ADDRESS_471128] more than twice that many people (21%) at  this stage. Importantly , the loss of potential 281 
participants between the intake visit and ITT disproportionatel y affects the represen tation of racial/ethnic 282 
minorities. That is, participant lo ss at this stage is 36% for people from minorities compared to 15% for 283 
non-Hispanic Caucasians.  284 
In an effort to improve the proportion of intake-eligible parti cipants who ultimately achieve ITT status, 285 
we made the following changes w ith the 2019-11 IRB modification : 286 
1. Increase remuneration for the lab visits (see Section 26.1),  which provide no clin ical benefit and last 287 
longer than clinic visits. 288 
2. Eliminate the 50% adherence requirement for the device-initi ated assessments in the Ecological 289 
Momentary Assessment (EMA ; see section 11.1). [ADDRESS_471129] access to? What 293 
percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? 294 
Response: Roughly 20% of adults in NY smoke, and most smokers s ay they would like to  quit. Thus, there 295 
is a large number of eligible p articipants in WNY. Indeed, our success enrolling 12 I TTs/month in a more 296 
demanding and restrictive trial (see Lerman et al., 2015) from 2011-2015 supports the feasibility of meeting 297 
our accrual target. 298

light of the growing number of daily smokers who smoke <10 CPD [e.g., Jamal et al., 312

 CBUCC. Participants will be instructed 545 
to arrive at the lab visits having not smoked 546 
since midnight; most sessions will be scheduled [ADDRESS_471159] overnight 548 
abstinence from smokin g (expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]-air CO must [ADDRESS_471160] 40% lower than the CO obtained at 550 
intake or the session will be rescheduled). 551 
During CBUCC (Gass & Tiffany, under review), 552 
smokers are exposed to a lit cigarette, a cup of 553 
water, or a portion of highly preferred food (12 554 
trials each, counterbalanced). These stimuli are 555 
located behind a movable glass door. On each 556 
trial, smokers rate their craving in the presence 557 
of the cue and then indicate the amount of 558 
money they are willing to spend to gain access 559 
to the cue. During the task, they will be video 560 
recorded. This video recording will be used to examine behavior during the lab task via coding paradigm. . 561 
Participants are given $10 at the beginning of the procedure and told they can keep whatever 562 
amount they do not spend during CBUCC. Participan ts may spend $.01 to $.25 on each trial. The 563 
more the participants spend, the greater the prob ability that the door will be unlocked and they 564 
will be able to sample the cue on that trial (proba bilities range from 5% to  95%). At each trial, 565 
participants are shown the CBUCC choice screen. Af ter deciding how much to spend, participants 566 
are told to try to open the door. If the door is unlocked, they can sample the cue (1 cigarette puff, 567 
sip of water, or bite of food).  568 
 CBUCC generates multiple indi ces of reinforcement, including self-reported craving, the 569 
amount of real money paid for th e opportunity to puff a cigarette, latency to attempt to open the 570 
door, and actual consumption (observed puff durati on). In contrast to conventional laboratory 571 
assessments of cigarette choice in which smokers delay smoking a single cigarette in exchange for 572 
money (e.g., McKee et al., 2012), CBUCC generate s multiple indices of smoking motivation and 573 
reinforcement and does so across numerous trials . Thus, CBUCC produces very reliable estimates 574 
of these variables within a single laboratory session. Moreover, unlike conventional cigarette 575 
choice procedures, CBUCC allows us to examine the relative reinforcing value of consumable 576 
reinforcers. 577 
 Ad-Lib Cigarette, Food, and Water Period. Following CBUCC administration at L2 (not 578 
L1), we will now offer participants a brief ad-lib  consumption period. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], participants have [ADDRESS_471161] 8 cigarettes left after CBUCC, and there is often leftover food/w ater from the procedure [ADDRESS_471162] 15 minutes to 583 
consume as much or as little as they wish. Part icipants will continue to be passively recorded 584 
during this period. We are expecting to use data fr om this period (i.e., count of cigarettes smoked, 585 
weight of food eaten, puff number /puff duration/interpuff interval of  cigarettes) as an additional [ADDRESS_471163] 588 
that this will significantly lengthen the session on  average from what is described in the consent 589 
(i.e., 2 hours). If they smoke or eat at all, they will also complete the Subjective Effects 590 
Questionnaire (same questions answered in CBUCC/on EMA).  591 
UPDATE 2020-06-12 - elimination of lab visits for remaining par ticipants: 592 
The COVID lockdown obviously too k a toll on all clinical resear ch, and now we are modestly behind 593 
in our accrual. Moreover, there i s the concern th at, as New Yor k slowly reopens, community members 594 
will be especially war y of trials such as ours because of the m any visits to campus. Finally, there’s [ADDRESS_471164] burdensome or concer ning – without aff ecting the overall [ADDRESS_471165].  599 
With the approval of our funding agency (the National Cancer In stitute), this modification requests that 600 
we eliminate the two laboratory a ssessments of smoking reinforc ement for the fo llowing reasons:  [ADDRESS_471166] study visits, and they are purely fo r research purposes, with no therapeutic 602 
component.  603 
- The lab task employed in these  visits requires participants t o repeatedly receive cigarettes, food 604 
samples, and glasses of water fro m the researcher. Even thought  we take all COVID-19-related 605 
precautions to reduce the risk of virus transmission, participa nts may still be concerned/distressed 606 
about the possibility of contrac ting the virus during this proc edure. 607 
- Although we value the mechanis tic data that comes from the la b visits, these data are secondary to 608 
our primary outcomes (smoking cessation outcomes, ecological mo mentary assessments (EMA), and 609 
biochemical measures of smoking exposure. The core study design  (a double-blind, placebo-controlled [ADDRESS_471167]-quit) is unaffected.  611 
Training for the EMA will be move d from Lab Visit 1 to the end of the Intake Visit. 612 
 613 
 Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).  Daily EMA data will be co llected for [ADDRESS_471168] TQD (i.e., Weeks -5 to +4) using an ap plication (app) that can be loaded onto 615 
the participants’ personal smart phone/tablet (significantly red ucing participant burden; e.g., Ginexi et al., 616 
2014) or onto a study cell phone or tablet provided to the part icipant. The app – mobile EMA (mEMA; 617 
http://mobileema.com; ilumivu, In c.) allows de-identified data (linked only to participant ID) to be 618 
synchronized with a secure serve r.  EMA training and assessment  procedures will follo w our recent work 619 
(Gass et al., 2012; Hawk et al., 2012). During the baseline lab  visit, participants will be trained on proper 620 
use of the app and will demonstrate the ability to complete bot h self-initiated assessments (questionnaires 621 
that the participant initiates, e.g., morning assessment) and d evice-initiated assessments (alerts to 622 
participant are provid ed on a pseudo-random  basis). Participant s will be informed that they will receive $1 623 
for completing each morning assessm ent and $1 for completing ea ch device-initiated assessment.  To 624 
improve adherence and reduce bur den/intrusiveness, participants  will select a 12-hour p eriod during which 625 
EMA prompts occur each day. Par ticipants will be contact[CONTACT_426] r esearch staff ~3 days into the baseline 626 
week to review adheren ce (based on incoming synchronized data) and troubleshoot any problems. [ADDRESS_471169] cigarette of the day and within one hour of  waking. In addition to reporting total number 629 
of cigarettes smoked during the previous day (CPD), participant s will report wake time and medication 630 
adherence on the previous day. T hey will also complete a brief measure of craving, withdrawal, or 631 
nausea/appetite. Altering the dom ain of assessment reduces both  burden and reactivity, and [ADDRESS_471170] participants  completed far more (mean=94%)  than the 43% (3 days per week) 635 
minimum required (Hawk et al., 2012).  636 
 Device-initiated assessments . Device-initiated prompts will be  delivered 4 times per day (e .g., 637 
randomized within 3-hour blocks) to assess time since last ciga rette and two of the following four domains: 638 
subjective effects of smoking, craving, withdrawal, and nausea/ appetite (see Measures f or details).  Thus, [ADDRESS_471171] en and reactivity compared to as sessing every domain in each device- 642 
initiated assessment. Sessions en d with a reminder about remune ration earned. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], 643 
participants completed far more than the 50% minimum required ( mean = 89%; Gass et al 2012).  644 
2019-11 update:  Note that in the 2019-11 IRB m odification, we eliminated the 5 0% minimum (see 645 
also Section 6.2) for the device-initiated prompts. Review of d ata for participants alr eady screened for the [ADDRESS_471172], were asso ciated with greater 649 
challenges for participants, and  roughly 10% of participants ei ther had to complete a second week of 650 
baseline or never met the 50% bas eline adherence threshold and were excluded or withdrew. To more 651 
efficiently complete the trial, w e eliminated the 50% requireme nt for device-initiated assessments. We do, 652 
of course, continue to encourage and remunerate completion of t hese assessments. 653 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONA L TROUBLESHOOTING SOFTWARE: As detailed above, [ADDRESS_471173] with the EMA app. To date, troubleshooting has generally r equired lengthy phone conversations 658 
and/or ad hoc participant visits  to the clinic for assistance. To minimize participant burden and more 659 
quickly address technical problems with the EMA app, participan ts will be offered (at Intake) the option 660 
install a free, HIPPA-compliant a pp (TeamViewer, https://www.te amviewer.com/en-us/) for [ADDRESS_471174] the option to decline having  this app installed on their device and, if it is 662 
installed, participants can remove it at any time. 663 
It will be explained to participants that, should they choose t o install the TeamViewer app: 664 
• TeamViewer allows research staff to, with the participant’s con sent, view and remotely control the 665 
participant’s smartphone for a remote troubleshooting session.  666 
• TeamViewer will only be used for troubleshooting EMA problems. During any troubleshooting 667 
session, research staff will use TeamViewer only to navigate in to the EMA app and related 668 
settings to address problems and demonstrate how to avoid furth er issues, all while the participant 669 
observes the staff member’s actions. 670 
• Staff cannot use the app without real-time consent (the partici pant must click a pop-up to start a 671 
session). The participant can continue monitor their phone and view what is being accessed. If the 672 
participant chooses, they can en d the remote session at any tim e.  673 
• TeamViewer does not collect o r store any information. 674

complete study measures (see be low), receive brief behavioral c ounseling (see below) and study 704 
medication (details below), and are instructed to begin the med ication the next day. Subsequent study visits 705 
are similar in pro cess and content. Randomization.  The study statistician (Co-I [CONTACT_376599]) will implement 706 
and monitor the small-urn randomization (within-gender in urns/ blocks of 8 [[ADDRESS_471179] 707 
run-in]), leaving remaining personnel blinded to group membersh ip. Participants are considered part of the 708 
intent-to-treat (ITT) sample once they are dispensed medication  at Clinic Visit 1 (C1). 709 
 Study medication.  At visit C1 (Week - 4), participants will be provided an initia l 1-week supply of 710 
study medication (either varenicline or identical appearing pla cebo) and instructed on use (one 0.5 mg 711 
tablet orally daily x 3 days, t hen one 0.5 mg tablet twice dail y x 4 days, then two 0.5 mg tablets twice 712 
daily). One week prior to TQD (Vi sit C3 / Week -1), participant s assigned to placebo will be switched over [ADDRESS_471180] dos e increases during the initial week of use.  During the pre-quit period, all 714 
study medication (active & placeb o) will be dispensed as 0.5 mg  tablets. This approach was successfully 715 
used in Hawk et al. (2012) and will facilitate switching over f rom placebo to active medication while 716 
maintaining blinding.  From TQD through EOT, all participants w ill receive open-label varenicline (one 1.0 717

Update 2019-11: Retention at EOT and 6M follow-up  has been substantially lower than anticipated. We [ADDRESS_471189] , because of the EMA remuneration (up to 753 
$35/week), remuneration at Clinic Visits is much higher than in  our prior studies. Second, remuneration at 754 
EOT and 6M is actually somewhat lower than in our prior work – we did this in an effort to stay under the 755 
$[ADDRESS_471190] to be issued, requiri ng participants to provide us with their 756 
SSN. We now re-balance the remuneration by [CONTACT_376574] (which already [ADDRESS_471191] greater value because of t he treatment received and the EM A remuneration) to the follow-up period 758 
(see Section 26). [ADDRESS_471192] observed that  many participants do not ans wer the reminder calls for follow- 760 
up visits, and when they do not answer the phone call they are very likely (70-90%) to miss the subsequent [ADDRESS_471193] th e reminder calls with brief (1- 2 questions) REDCap surveys (see App 11.1 – 763 
Template for REDCap Follow-Up Sur vey) delivered via a text mess age link to the participant’s phone. We [ADDRESS_471194] designed a plan we believe offers multiple advantages: 765 
1) Rather than requiring that a participant answer our phone ca ll at a specific time, participants can respond [ADDRESS_471195] already completed 9 weeks of 767 
electronic assessments, this should be convenient and low-burde n. 768 
2) REDCap allows us to automate reminders to participants’ who do not respond to the initial text of a 769 
survey link. We will send up to 3 reminde rs for each survey. 770 
3) In contrast to phone calls, which could be associated with s hame or embarrassment for participants who [ADDRESS_471196] 772 
mention of the behavior to study staff. 773 
4) Because the surveys are so brie f, we can actually have more frequent contact [CONTACT_376575] 774 
follow-up period (1, 3, and 5 weeks before EOT and 4 and 8 week s before 6M follow-up), which should 775 
enhance retention rates.    776 
Participant Satisfaction Surveys (C4 and EOT) Participants will be given s atisfaction surveys at 777 
Clinic visit #4 (C4) an d the End of treatment (EOT) visits. The se surveys will be distr ibuted in an unsealed [ADDRESS_471197]. Hawk; research 780 
assistants will not read the surv eys of their participants. The  C4 survey was not completed by [CONTACT_376576] 781 
had C4 before the 2019-05 modification. The EOT survey was mail ed to participants who completed EOT 782 
prior to approval of the 2019-05 modification. Please see Satis faction for EVQ 2019-05-02.docx.  783 
Update 2020-04 – COVID-[ADDRESS_471198]:  Anecdotally, our smoking cessation trial participants have [ADDRESS_471199] of COVID-19, we adde d a questionnaire (App - COVID-19 786 
Quitting Questions_v3.5 - EVarQu it 2020-04-20.docx) to be admin istered once per participant. The 787 
COVID-19 questio nnaire will be assessed at  each participant's e nd-of-treatment (EOT) (remote) visit.  If 788 
the person has already passed the EOT appointment, but has not yet reached the 6-mont h visit, we will ask 789 
them to complete it at the 6-month (remote) visit. The question naire is completely optional.  The 790 
questionnaire would be employed  until the stay-at-home order is  lifted or all currently e nrolled participants 791 
reach the 6-month milestone or gov ernment-mandated social dista ncing measures are eliminated in New 792 
York, whichever is later. 793 
Update 2020-5-21 – Further assessing COVID-[ADDRESS_471200] :  The EvarQuit project was forced to 794 
implement changes to the provision of treatment due to the COVI D-19 pandemic.  One of the primary 795 
changes involved the transition from in-person counseling to re mote counseling via Zoom software (when 796 
possible) or phone calls.  In order to understand the opi[INVESTIGATOR_376552] [ADDRESS_471201] 801 
participants by [CONTACT_376577] a s possible following the Clinic  6 visit to introduce the interview.  If the 802 
participant agrees to the procedures and provides verbal consen t, the interview will be  audio recorded so it 803 
can be coded by [CONTACT_376578]. Audio recordings, la beled only with a par ticipant number, will 804 
be stored on our secure server, and will be used to generate wr itten transcripts for qualitative analyses. We 805 
will keep the audio recording for up to 6 months as they will b e used to clarify information in the 806 
transcripts and will help to clar ify the context of information  obtained during interviews. Participant 807 
responses will remain anonymous. 808 
Update 2020-05-29:  COVID-19 -related procedural changes :  Per the UB Human Studies guidance 809 
05212020.docx, the following pro cedural changes will be impleme nted in an effort to minimize 810 
transmission of the virus: 811 
Engineering Measures:  812 
• The clinic hallway (3rd floor in  Diefendorf Hall) is approximat ely 11 ft wide; taped lines will be [ADDRESS_471202].  This will ensure that a distance of > 6ft can be main tained in the hallway at all times.  816 
• Participants typi[INVESTIGATOR_376553] y of the clinic to wait for their [ADDRESS_471203] and participants will be escorted to 818 
a private interview room upon arrival to the clinic.  819 
Administrative Measures:  820 
• Staff will be asked to enter the clinic using the elevator OR t he stairwell on the east end of the building [ADDRESS_471204] end. Staff arrival  and departure times will be staggered as 822 
well to minimize stairwell traffic.  823 
• Staff will be asked to wash their hands thoroughly and often, i ncluding immediately upon arrival, 824 
using CDC guidelines and to avoid touching their face.  825 
• Room occupancy will be limited to maintain distances of at leas t 6 feet between staff and research 826 
participants except for brief procedures (such as blood pressur e), during which staff will wear gloves, 827 
face mask, and eye protection (cons istent with UB  Human Studies  guidance 05212020.docx).  828 
• Signage outside the elevator and in the hallway will inform par ticipants regarding the above measures [ADDRESS_471205] only one person on the elevator at a given time.  830 
Prescreening of Resea rch Participants: 831 
As per the UB Human Studies guidance 05212020.docx, the followi ng will be done prior to all participant 832 
visits: 833 
During the reminder call the day before a visit: 834 
• Participants will be asked to take their temperature; if they d on’t have a thermometer, they will be 835 
asked whether they  feel feverish. 836 
• Participants will be asked about the presence of a ny COVID-19 s ymptoms including: fever, cough, 837 
shortness of breath , sore throat, muscle aches, headache, new l oss of taste or smel l, and repeated or 838 
shaking chills (as noted on page 2 of the UB Human Studies Guid ance 05212020.docx).    839 
• Anyone known to be COVID-19 positive or who exhibits COVID-19 s ymptoms will be restricted from 840 
enrollment / attending in-person  visits until symptom free and at least 14 days since date of diagnosis. 841 
For enrolled participants, remo te visits (telemedicine) will be  scheduled in the interim as the health of 842 
the participant allows.  843 
Before leaving home on the day of a visit 844 
 19
• Participants will be asked to take their temperature at home.  845 
• Participants will be asked to report any new symptoms on the da y of the visit to the project coordinator 846 
prior to coming to the clinic/lab. 847 
• Participants will be asked to w ear a face covering prior to ent ering the building; if they arrive without a 848 
face covering, a mask will be provided. 849 
Revised Visit Scheduling Enha nces Social Distancing:    850 
• To support physical distancing an d prevent congestion, intake a ppointment times will be arranged so [ADDRESS_471206] e space in Diefendorf 852 
to assure appropriate physical distancing with up to 8 private office spaces for participant 853 
interviews/counseling sessions.   854 
• Clinic visits will be scheduled w ith at least [ADDRESS_471207] su rfaces at the conclusion of eac h visit.  857 
Consent Addendum:  A consent addendum will be emplo yed that advises participants o f all COVID- 858 
related requirements and procedu res. See Section 29.0: Process to Document Consent. 859 
Disinfection of Shared Equipment and Spaces: 860 
• Before and after each in-person appointment or use of a shared room or pi[INVESTIGATOR_502], all hard 861 
surfaces such as equipment (incl uding the shared copi[INVESTIGATOR_3694]), count ertops, keyboards, computer mice, 862 
office chair arms, and doorknobs will be disinfected with EPA-a pproved disinfectant wipes or spray.  863 
• A disinfecting checklist will be  placed on the door of each par ticipant room or shared space; staff will [ADDRESS_471208] ion.   865 
• Participants will be given a pen  to use during their visit that  then will then take with them so multiple 866 
people aren’t using the same pen. 867 
Remote Study Visits : 868 
Study visits will be conducted re motely, rather than in person at UB, under the following circumstances. 869 
• If a participant reports COVID-[ADDRESS_471209] 14 days since the da te of diagnosis.  871 
• If UB determines that research p rojects cannot have in-person v isits for a period of time (for example, 872 
if there were a surge of COVID -19 cases in the area), all appoi ntments will be conducted remotely 873 
during that period of time. 874 
• Other circumstances in which stud y staff and the participant ag ree that one or more remote visits are 875 
appropriate in order to ensure uninterrupted smoking-cessation treatment 876 
• To enhance compliance with follo w-up appointments at which prim ary outcome measures are 877 
collected, these visits may be conducted remotely as well 878 
 879 
Participants will be instructed regarding the details of remote  study visits, including the need for privacy, 880 
the methods for delivery and return of study materials, and the  technology (Zoom or telephone; REDCap) 881 
for completing study visits. Informed consent for remote study visits will be obtained with the aid of the 882 
attached EVarQuit Consent Addendum – COVID-19.docx. [ADDRESS_471210] en, and perceived ppt risks, we are 886 
eliminating the lab visits for the remaining participants. 887 
 888 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS . Consistent with 889 
the administrative supplement submitted to NCI, ITT participant s will be asked to pr ovide an optional 890 
additional saliva sample for gene tic analysis. In brief, 30 min utes after eating, drinking, or smoking, 891 
 20
participants who consent to pr ovide a genetics sample will prov ide a 2 mL saliva sample using an Oragene 892 
kit (DNA Genotek, Inc.). [ADDRESS_471211] e, an overview and the consent 894 
addendum (see EVarQuit Genetics Sub-Study - Consent Addendum  -  onsite - 2020-06-30.docx) will be 895 
presented at Clinic 2 (future p articipants).  Reasons for waiti ng until Clinic 2 (as opposed to including with 896 
the initial study consent at intake) inc lude: a) Because the ma jor focus of these analyses is to better [ADDRESS_471212] measurable at Clinic 2, we do not 898 
wish to obtain samples from participants who are found ineligib le or withdraw prior to Clinic 2, and b) [ADDRESS_471213] udy visit (see EVarQuit Genetics S ub-Study - Consent Addendum  - onsite - 905 
2020-06-30.docx). If the participant has already completed all required study visits, st udy staff will attempt 906 
to reach the participant by [CONTACT_376579]/or email (see EVarQuit Ge netics Sub-Study Initial Contact – Phone 907 
and Email Scripts 2020-06-30.docx). No more than two attempts w ith each method will be made, to avoid 908 
“hounding” the participant. If th e participant is reached and e xpresses interest, or if the participant was not 909 
reached by [CONTACT_648]/email, the fo llowing will be sent by [CONTACT_376580]: 910

sample (see Remuneration). 915 
 916 
Regarding issues relevant to Section 2 of HRP-399 (WORKSHEET: A dditional Requirements for Genetic 917 
Testing (NY State)): 918 
• Consent will be obtained directly  from the participant (no samp les taken from deceased individuals). 919 
• As described in the consent a ddendum, samples will be stored in dependent of other participant 920 
information, making it impossible that genetic information woul d ever be incorporat ed into the records 921 
of a nonconsenting individual. 922 
• Consent for banking and additional genetic testing are explicit ly obtained in the consent addendum. 923 
• As explicitly stated in the consen t addendum:  “If you say yes now, but you change your mind later, it [ADDRESS_471215] your participation in EV arQuit. You can alw ays call (716-829- 925 
2323) or email us ([EMAIL_7265]) to say that you have c hanged your mind, and the DNA 926 
sample will be destroyed.”  In suc h an event, the PI ([CONTACT_376600])  will contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tyndale at the [ADDRESS_471216] royed. 928 
• “Family members of an individual who provided a stored tissue s ample will NOT be contact[CONTACT_5365] [ADDRESS_471217].” (HRP-399) As of this version of the protocol, we do not anticipate ever contact[CONTACT_376581] [ADDRESS_471218]. 933 
• “Information about an individual derived from genetic tests per formed on stored human tissue or 934 
information linking an individual with specific results of gene tic tests will NOT be released to any 935 
organization or person without the explicit written consent of the individual who donated the stored 936 
tissue to release of the informa tion for the purposes set forth  in the written consent document” (HRP- 937 
399). 938

Response:  1204 
☒  N / A :   This study does not require any other approvals. [ADDRESS_471260] subjects’ privacy in terests during the course of this research. 1208 
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.  Privacy applies 1209 
to the person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about individuals for the research will be 1210 
protected by [CONTACT_10758].  Confidentiality applies to the data.   1211 
Examples of appropriate responses include:  “participant only meets with a study coordinator in a 1212 
classroom setting where no one can overhear”, or “the participant is reminded that they are free to 1213 
refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering.”   1214 
Response: Above (sections 9 and 12) we describe how we will pro tect subjects’ privacy  interests during the [ADDRESS_471261] participan t’s rights to refuse 1216 
to complete any assessment and to  withdraw from the study at an y time, thus giving them control of 1217 
 27
information access to themselve s.  (When appropriate, we will r emind participants that refusal to complete 1218 
assessments may lead the study i nvestigators to withdraw the pa rticipant from the trial.) 1219 
Many of the measures will be sel f-administered, so participants  will directly enter their responses into a 1220 
computer/tablet/smartphone without the interviewer seeing their  responses.  This increases privacy and 1221 
reduces potential discomfort. 1222 
Participants will meet individually with study investigators an d staff in private offices ; privacy is enhanced [ADDRESS_471262] security sys tem (limiting access) and the whi te noise system (reducing concerns about a [ADDRESS_471263]). 1225

17.0 Data Management and Analysis 1245 
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  This section applies to both 1246 
quantitative and qualitative analysis.  1247 
Response:  [ADDRESS_471266] (Aims 1 and 3) is smoking cessa tion, a dichotomous variable indicating 1249 
bio-verified (cotinine ≤15 ng/ml) self-report (TLFB) of continu ous abstinence from smoking assessed at 1250 
end-of-treatment (weeks 8-[ADDRESS_471267]-quit) and long-term follow-up  (weeks 8-[ADDRESS_471268]-quit). We also propose [ADDRESS_471269] will be a 1252 
continuous variable representing percent reduction in smoking b ehavior (CPD from daily EMA 1253 
assessments) during the pre-quit phase of the study ([Week -5 C PD minus Week -1 CPD] / Week -5 CPD). 1254 
Our proposed analyses and power estimates focus on these primar y measures.   1255 
We focus above on percent reduction in CPD during the pre-quit period (from Week -5 to Week -1) 1256 
because this measure is both feas ible to assess in clinical pra ctice and is emphasized in prior work on pre- 1257 
quit pharmacotherapy (Hajek et al ., 2011; Hawk et al., 2012, 20 15; Rose et al., 1998). Indeed, some have 1258 
suggested that achieving a 50% pre-quit reduction in smoking ma y be a clinically useful target (e.g., Rose 1259 
& Behm, 2013), a hypothesis that  could be evaluated in suppleme ntary analyses. [ADDRESS_471270] on smoking and cra ving (Ashare et al., 2012; Haj ek et al., 2011; Hawk et al., 2012; Poling 1264 
et al. 2010). We will explore th ese trajectories at the group l evel but also consider individual differences in 1265 
 28
change. For example, even among participants with comparable ov erall reductions in smoking, it is 1266 
important to determine the degree to which abstinence is associ ated with a marked early  decline in smoking 1267 
(which may reflect a s tronger blockade of reinforcement by [CONTACT_094]- quit varenicline) or a more gradual 1268 
reduction in smoking across the pre-quit period (which would al low more extinction “trials” to occur). [ADDRESS_471271] is whether we can identify a gr oup characterized by a decline in smoking 1272 
during the pre-quit pe riod that is accompanied by [CONTACT_376586] s moking satisfaction and/or craving. If the 1273 
mechanism of the extended run-in operates as we hypothesize, th is pattern should be more likely in the 1274 
extended run-in than the standar d run-in treatment group and be  predictive of abstinence.  Such analysis 1275 
would involve growth mixture modeling to identify groups based on trajectories of smoking, smoking 1276 
satisfaction, and craving during the pre-quit phase. Our team h as extensive experience to extend our 1277 
proposed analysis to growth modeling and growth mixture modelin g (Colder et al., 2002, 2006, 2013, 1278 
2014; Trucco, Wright, & Colder, 2014). 1279 
In addition, we will ha ve a rich data set to examine a variety of alternative outcomes and potential 1280 
mediators and moderators; examples are provided below. An advan tage of our study is that it includes 1281 
multiple measures of smoking intake (CPD, CO, COT and 3HC) and additional measures relevant to 1282 
reinforcement and ex tinction (subjective effects of smoking; la boratory-based indices of the relative 1283 
reinforcement from cigarettes, f ood, and water), and measures o f alternative (though not mutually 1284 
incompatible) mechanisms of treat ment effects such as craving, withdrawal, and naus ea. This provides [ADDRESS_471272] assessed many of our 1287 
variables using multiple methods.  To maximize conceptual clari ty and reduce the number of statistical 1288 
tests, we will use confirmatory factor analysis, including Mult itrait-Multimethod Measurement Models  1289 
(MTMM, Kenny & Kashy, 1992) when appropriate, to inform constru ction of within-domain composites 1290 
and/or selection of a subset of secondary measures for analysis . For each of the aims, it will also be [ADDRESS_471273] of our ana lyses will be done in Mplus an d SAS (Proc Mixed and Proc Glmmix), [ADDRESS_471274] this aim.  Abstinence will be r egressed on treatment group (a binary 1299 
indicator).  Given evidence that extended pre-quit varenicline will be particularly helpful for women (Hawk 1300 
et al., 2012), we will include ge nder and the gender x treatmen t interaction to evaluate the hypothesis that [ADDRESS_471275] of varenicline run-in duration.  1302 
Aim 2 . We hypothesize that the exten ded run-in group will exhibit gr eater pre-quit reductions in smoking 1303 
(percent reduction in CPD, as we ll as decreases in biochemical measures), as predicted by [CONTACT_376587]-of- 1304 
reinforcement framework. Each h ypothesized mediator will be reg ressed on treatment group (a binary 1305 
indicator) using regression models appropriate for the nature o f the mediator.  As in Aim 1, gender and the 1306 
gender x treatment group interac tion will be included in the mo del. Comparable models will evaluate pre- 1307 
quit changes in other candidate mediators (withdrawal, craving,  subjective effects of smoking, nausea, and 1308 
behavioral measures of smoking, food, and water reinforcement f rom the laboratory CBUCC paradigm).  [ADDRESS_471276] smoking-specific changes in reinforce ment and related constructs, such as 1311 
reinforcer devaluation (i.e., from nausea). In addition to thei r conceptual and theoretical significance, a 1312 
clearer understanding of treatme nt mechanism may be important f or predicting success prior to quitting, 1313 
thereby [CONTACT_376588] f rom experiencing a failed quit attempt (e.g., 1314 
Rose et al., 2013) and providing precise targets to further enh ance treatment effectiveness. 1315 
Aim 3 .  We hypothesize that changes in pre-quit smoking behavior (i. e., percent reduction in CPD during 1316 
the pre-quit period) will mediate the effect of extended pre-qu it varenicline on smoking cessation. This aim [ADDRESS_471277]  pre-quit reduction in smoking (a continuous 1318 
 29
variable), which in turn, will predict smoking abstinence.  Sep arate models will be estimated for abstinence [ADDRESS_471278] the proposed 1321 
mediational path (MacKinnon 20 08). We will also evaluate whethe r gender moderates this mediated path 1322 
(moderated mediation, P reacher et al., 2007). 1323 
17.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis.   1324 
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of  studies, including chart/records reviews, survey 1325 
studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit whether the investigator has an 1326 
adequate sample size to achieve the study objectives and justify a conclusion.  1327 
Response: Altho ugh our analyses will u tilize methods to handle missing data (e.g., full-information 1328 
likelihood estimation; Enders & Bandalos, 2001), we conservativ ely estimated power b ased on N=320 ITT 1329 
participants and attrition estimat ed to be 5% at TQD, 18% at EO T, and 25% at 6-M (based on our 1330 
varenicline data from Hawk et al., 2012 and Lerman et al., 2015 ).  Our power estimat es are based on an 1331 
alpha level of .05 and adequate power considered ≥ .80. For the  main effects of treatment run-in group on 1332 
outcome (Aim 1) and hypothesized m ediators (Aim 2), power was c omputed using Proc Power in SAS [ADDRESS_471279] size estimates fr om Hawk et al. (2012) and Haje k et al. (2011); treatment run-in group [ADDRESS_471280] sizes are expected to be i n the range of small to medium  for Aim 1 (Odds ratios 1.3 to 2.3) and Aim 2 1335 
(f2 .05 to .12). Our proposed sam ple will provide adequate powe r to detect these effects.  For gender 1336 
interactions in Aims 1 and 2 and  all effects in Aim 3, we estim ated power using Monte Carlo simulations 1337 
estimated in Mplus (Muthén, & Muthén, 2002) with 10,000 replica tions and parameter s taken from our 1338 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Hawk et al., 2012). Our monte carlo simulation sug gested adequate power to detect the [ADDRESS_471281] errors (bias < 3%). For Aim 3, our Monte  Carlo simulation suggested adequate [ADDRESS_471282] (collapsing ac ross gender) with minimal bias in the [ADDRESS_471283] error (bia s < 2%).  Furthermore, our Monte Carlo [ADDRESS_471284] errors (bias < 1%).  Hence, we have adeq uate power to detect moderated mediation. [ADDRESS_471285] size estimates were based on 1347 
existing data, rather than hypoth etical estimates , which we bel ieve provides greater  confidence in our 1348 
calculations. 1349 
17.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data. 1350 
Response:  As part of the data a nd safety monitoring process, t he team will ensure that all  fields are 1351

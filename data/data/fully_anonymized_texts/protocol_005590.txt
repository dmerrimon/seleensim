 STUDY SCHEMA  
Primary Objective:  To study the effect of supervised exercise training on cardiopulmonary function in men 
receiving the combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of non-
metastatic, hormone-naïve prostate cancer. 
 
Design:  Subjects with histologically-confirmed, progressive, non-metastatic, hormone-naive prostate cancer, with 
a PSA ≥ 0.01  ng/ml , scheduled to be treated with ADT for ≥8 months, will be randomly allocated to one of two 
following arms:   
 
A. Enzalutamide (ENZ) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n= 20), or 
B. Enzalutamide (ENZ) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus supervised exercise training (n= 20) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  *The Lead -In Period  will consist of 4 weeks of either usual care or combined aerobic and resistance exercise training prior to 
starting ENZ – ADT. Upon initiation of ENZ – ADT, subjects on Arm B will continue the exercise training program for 12 
additional weeks. Hence, Trea tment Period 1  is 16 weeks in total.  
†Baseline exercise testing will be done prior to randomization, but after confirmation of eligibility.

 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
4.1 Study Disease 
 
Disease Background 
In 2013, it is estimated that 238,590 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 29,720 died of the 
disease.1 The course of prostate cancer from diagnosis to death can be categorized as a series of clinical states 
(Figure 1 ) based on the status of the primary tumor, presence or absence of visible metastatic disease on an 
imaging study, and the measured level of testosterone in the blood.2 The states are localized disease, rising 
levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radiation therapy or surgery with no detectable metastases, and 
clinical metastases in the non-castrate or castrate state. The patient ’s progression through these clinical states 
may take a decade or more. Blue arrows in Figure 1  show the clinical states that will be enrolled on this 
protocol ( Rising PSA ) and in which enzalutamide is currently approved ( Clinical Metastases: Castrate, Post-
Docetaxel ). 
 
Figure 1.   Clinical states of prostate cancer 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rising PSA Clinical State 
Although surgery, radiation, or a combination of both can be curative for patients with localized disease, a 
significant proportion of these patients have recurrent disease as evidenced first by a rising level of PSA. For 
these individuals, the issue is to determine whether the disease is local or systemic, and in the cased of the 
latter, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_157734] – a transition to the lethal phenotype of the illness and in 
what time frame. A number of nomograms based on the characteristics of the primary tumor, time to a 
detectable PSA following surgery, and rate of rise in PSA or PSA doubling time (PSADT) have been developed 
to estimate prognosis, which for the group as a whole is heterogeneous.3-5 
 
In one series of patients with rising PSA enrolled on clinical protocols (N = 148) PSADT was a statistically 
significant independent predictor for metastatic progression (P = 0.001).[ADDRESS_901205] men with a PSADT of 12 
months or less are treated, but restricting ADT to men with a PSADT of 9 months or less may be optimal based 
on the recently reported metastases free survival times in a contemporary series ( Table 1 ).

*Last subject sensored at 4 years. In each subgroup, the median MFS as well as the 5- and 10-year 
probabilities of MFS from the time of PSA recurrence are shown.  N/A, not applicable. 
 
In this series, 73% of men with a PSADT in the range of 3-9 months, and 95% of men with a PSADT of less than 
3 months developed visible metastatic disease at 5 years. 
 
Androgen Deprivation Therapy and/or Blockade for PSA Progression 
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and/or blockade as currently practiced with a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist with or without an antiandrogen produces declines in PSA followed by 
[CONTACT_54079], a period of quiescence during which the disease does not proliferate, followed by a rise in 
PSA and regrowth as a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that for most men is invariably lethal. 
Overall outcomes are inversely related to disease burden and the results of multiple series show th at patients 
with more advanced disease progress sooner in comparison to those with less advanced disease.9,10 
 
ADT Alone Does Not Completely Suppress Androgen Signaling 
ADT, or androgen depletion, as traditionally utilized does not completely inhibit androgen responsive gene 
expression (PSA, etc.),11 it does not consistently produce serum levels of testosterone below 20 ng/dl,12-[ADDRESS_901206] and/or survive in a low 
androgen environment when the disease is first manifest clinically.15 Overall outcomes with ADT are inversely 
related to disease burden and the results of multiple series show that subjects with more advanced disease 
progress and die sooner in comparison to those with less advanced disease.9,10 Even in the neoadjuvant setting 
where the disease is clinically confined to the gland, prostates removed after 3 months or up to 8 months of 
treatment are rarely tumor-free.16 Overall survival appears to be greater with the addition of a non-steroidal 
antiandrogen (i.e. bicalutamide) to ADT, at the expense of greater toxicity.[ADDRESS_901207] 
explored the approach with “on cycles” of varied duration, but in most studies, the maximal response is 
observed by [ADDRESS_901208] selected for the current study.23 
 
Deleterious Metabolic and Physical Side Effects of ADT 
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PC), with 
about 600,000 US men currently on ADT.24,25 However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_667427], ADT causes multiple 
deleterious metabolic and physical adverse events (AEs) including muscle wasting (atrophy), decreased lean 
body mass (sarcopenia), increased body fat mass (obesity) and increased insulin resistance leading to a 44% 
increased risk of new onset type II diabetes and 16% risk of new coronary heart disease.26-29   

Pro00053924:  Exercise Training & Enzalutamide/ADT (EXTEND) 
PT-PhII or III v05. 22.[ADDRESS_901209] started to examine the safety and efficacy of exercise training (i.e., aerobic training alone, 
resistance training alone, or the combination) in men either initiating ADT or undergoing ADT for localized as 
well as advanced prostate cancer.[ADDRESS_901210] published study, Segal et al.31 studied the effects of resistance exercise training on 
muscle strength and quality of life (QOL) in men with prostate cancer. Specifically, 155 men with diagnosed 
locally advanced prostate cancer scheduled to receive ADT were randomized to a supervised resistance 
training group or usual care group. Subjects randomized to exercise training participated in supervised upper 
and lower body resistance training three times per week for 15 weeks. Results indicated that resistance 
training significantly increased upper and lower body strength, increased QOL measures, and decreased 
fatigue as compared to usual care.31  
 
In a follow-up study, Segal et al.32 investigated the effects of efficacy of resistance training alone or aerobic 
training alone on fatigue, QOL, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (VO 2peak), and other related outcomes in 121 men with 
prostate cancer initiating radiotherapy with or without ADT. Results demonstrated that both aerobic a nd 
resistance training mitigated fatigue, although resistance training was associated with greater longer-term 
improvements in strength, QOL, and body composition. Finally, recent work by [CONTACT_667444].33 examined the 
efficacy of a combined 12-week aerobic and resistance training program on body composition, functional 
capacity, and QOL endpoints in 57 men undergoing ADT. Results indicated that exercise training was well-
tolerated and associated with significant improvements in a number of study endpoints relative to usual care. 
 
4.2 Study Agent 
The androgen receptor (AR) is a well-known target in prostate cancer, as prostate cancer growth is dependent 
on androgens. Depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of treatment for over 6 decades in 
the setting of metastatic disease or when prostate cancer recurs following resection and/or radiation.  
 
Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a selective AR signaling inhibitor. Enzalutamide exerts more substantial beneficial 
effects than bicalutamide in nonclinical models of CRPC.18 Enzalutamide has a novel mechanism of action that 
slows tumor growth and induces apoptosis via 3 complementary actions: 1) enzalutamide competitively 
inhibits binding of androgens to the AR, has higher affinity for the receptor than bicalutamide and is a pure 
receptor antagonist whereas bicalutamide has partial agonist activity; 2) enzalutamide inhibits nuclear 
translocation of the AR while bicalutamide enhances this effect and 3) enzalutamide inhibits binding of the AR 
to DNA better than bicalutamide even in prostate cancer cells resistant to antiandrogens and with AR 
overexpression. These three properties of enzalutamide impart a more complete blockade of the AR signaling 
pathway in the setting of AR overexpression. 
 
Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc. (Astellas) and Medivation, Inc. (Medivation) are developi[INVESTIGATOR_667428]. Enzalutamide was approved in the [LOCATION_002] on [ADDRESS_901211] 2012

Enzalutamide is formulated with Labrasol® (caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides) and provided as an orally 
available immediate-release dosage form filled into soft gelatin capsules containing 40 mg of the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient.

4.2.1 Pre-clinical experience (Enzalutamide IB, edition 7) 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of enzalutamide is inhibition of the AR signaling pathway. 
Enzalutamide inhibits androgen binding to the AR, AR nuclear translocation in the presence of androgen 
and AR:chromatin association. In multiple prostate cancer cell lines that specifically model castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (LNCaP/AR, VCaP, W741C LNCaP), the consequences of enzalutamide 
treatment include inhibition of AR-induced gene transcription, reduced cell proliferation, increased cell 
death by [CONTACT_667445]. In a mouse xenograft model of CRPC using prostate cancer 
cells that overexpress the AR (LNCaP/AR), enzalutamide inhibits tumor growth and reduces tumor size. 
One of the two major human metabolites of enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, demonstrates 
key primary pharmacodynamics of similar potency to the parent molecule, while the second major 
human metabolite, a carboxylic acid metabolite has no known pharmacodynamic effect. In humans, N-
desmethyl enzalutamide circulates at approximately the same steady-state plasma concentrations as 
enzalutamide and is assumed to contribute to clinical effects. 
 
Nonclinical studies have shown that enzalutamide suppresses the growth of AR-expressing breast 
cancer cells that also express the estrogen receptor (ER), as well as cells that do not express the ER. 
 
Enzalutamide and N- desmethyl enzalutamide bind to and antagonize the γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-
gated chloride channel. Enzalutamide given at high doses to mice induced dose-dependent convulsions, 
an observation that parallels the clinical safety data showing that dose appears to be an important 
predictor of the risk of seizure in subjects. As some molecules that antagonize the GABA-gated chloride 
channel are associated with convulsions, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide may both 
contribute to the convulsions that were observed in nonclinical studies. Safety pharmacology studies 
evaluating the central nervous, respi[INVESTIGATOR_667429] 160 
mg/day. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical studies with in vitro test systems have contributed to the understanding of enzalutamide 
pharmacokinetics and the potential for drug- drug interactions (DDIs). Enzalutamide has high 
permeability across Caco-2 monolayers. Both enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inducers 
and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
 
Data from a study with human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes showed that CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 are 
both responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide, and a clinical study showed that it is primarily 
CYP2C8 that is responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide and the subsequent formation of the 
active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide). Inhibition studies with CYP enzymes showed that 
enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite caused direct 
inhibition of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 and time-dependent inhibition 
of CYP1A2. Induction studies with CYP enzymes showed that enzalutamide caused induction of 
CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and that enzalutamide is not 
expected to induce CYP1A2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Subsequent clinical studies 
showed that enzalutamide is an inducer of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and possibly UGTIA1, while 
enzalutamide has no clinically meaningful effect on CYP2C8. 
 
Enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, and there is no in vitro 
protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and other highly bound drugs (warfarin, 
ibuprofen, and salicylic acid). N-desmethyl enzalutamide is 95% bound to plasma proteins.

PT-PhII or III v05. 22.[ADDRESS_901213] been previously observed with non-steroidal antiandrogen 
compounds, such as bicalutamide. Mild and reversible hypertrophy or hyperplasia of Leydig cells in the 
testes was found in repeat-dose studies of enzalutamide and/or N-desmethyl enzalutamide in mice and 
dogs. Leydig cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia is a common finding in toxicity studies for antiandrogen 
compounds such as bicalutamide, flutamide and nilutamide and is related to the occurrence of Leydig 
cell tumors in carcinogenicity studies for these agents. The extensive clinical experience with 
antiandrogens has shown that Leydig cell tumors in animals do not translate to a risk for humans. 
Mammary gland changes were not observed in male and female dogs treated with enzalutamide for [ADDRESS_901214] also been found for other AR antagonists. No effects on dams or on embryo-fetal 
development were found in rabbits.

Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of enzalutamide have been evaluated in subjects with CRPC , 
hormo ne-naïve prostate cancer patients, healthy male volunteers, and subjects with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment. Individual doses have ranged from [ADDRESS_901215] not been completed. 
 
After oral administration to subjects with CRPC, the median time to reach maximum enzalutamide 
plasma concentrations was 1 hour, and the mean terminal half ‑life was 5.8 days. Enzalutamide steady 
state was achieved by [CONTACT_4475] 28, and the accumulation ratio was 8.3-fold. At steady state, enzalutamide 
showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the range of 30 to 360 mg/day.  
 
A mass balance and biotransformation study in healthy male volunteers showed that enzalutamide is 
primarily eliminated by [CONTACT_171339].  
 
A food-effects study showed that food does not have a clinically relevant effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of enzalutamide or N-desmethyl enzalutamide; therefore, 
enzalutamide can be taken with or without food. 
 
A hepatic impairment study showed that the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl 
enzalutamide after single-dose enzalutamide was similar in subjects with baseline mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) relative to subjects with normal hepatic 
function, and no starting dose adjustment is needed. Enzalutamide is currently being evaluated in 
subjects with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
 
Based on population pharmacokinetics modeling, age, weight and renal function (creatinine clearance 
[CLCR] ≥ 30 mL/min) do not have clinically meaningful effects on enzalutamide  exposures; therefore, no 
dose adjustments are indicated for these covariates. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a study in 
Japanese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant differences in exposure

PT-PhII or III v05. 22.[ADDRESS_901216] of 
severe renal impairment (CLCR < 30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease on enzalutamide 
pharmacokinetics. 
 
A drug-drug interaction study in prostate cancer patients showed that enzalutamide can affect 
exposures to other co-medications. At steady state, enzalutamide reduced the AUC of oral midazolam 
(CYP3A4 substrate), S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) by 86%, 56% 
and 70%, respectively. Therefore, enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 inducer. Substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 with a narrow therapeutic index are to 
be avoided, as enzalutamide may decrease plasma exposure of these drugs. If enzalutamide is 
coadministered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), additional international normalized ratio (INR) 
monitoring is to be conducted. Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) did not have a clinically relevant effect on 
exposure to intravenous docetaxel (CYP3A4 substrate) or oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (CYP2C8 substrate). 
 
A drug-drug interaction study in healthy subject s showed that concomitant medications can affect 
exposure to enzalutamide. Coadministration of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) increased the 
composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2 fold; therefore, strong CYP2C8 
inhibitors are to be avoided. If coadministration with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is necessary, the dose of 
enzalutamide is to be reduced to 80 mg once daily. Coadministration of itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor) increased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3-fold; as 
this small change is not clinically meaningful, no starting dose adjustment is needed when 
coadministering enzalutamide with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
 
Efficacy 
The efficacy of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC was assessed in 5 clinical studies 
including two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, MDV3100- 03 (PREVAIL) and CRPC2 
(AFFIRM); phase 1 Study S-3100-1-01; phase 2 Study CRPCMDA- 1; and phase 1/2 Study 9785- CL-0111.  
 
In the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (MDV3100-03 and CRPC2) in men 
with metastatic CRPC, enzalutamide treatment showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo 
across multiple clinically relevant endpoints such as overall survival, radiographic progression-free 
survival (rPFS), time to first skeletal-related event, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, 
PSA response rate, best overall soft tissue response, and quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_245676] - Prostate (FACT-P). Notably, in MDV3100-03, a study of enzalutamide 
versus placebo in men with metastatic CRPC who were chemotherapy- naïve, enzalutamide delayed 
time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy compared with placebo. In both phase [ADDRESS_901217] a survival benefit in patients with prostate cancer. 
 
Further data from open-label Studies S-3100-1-01, CRPC-MDA-1, and 9785- CL-0111 in patients with 
metastatic CRPC provided supportive efficacy information. 
 
Overall Safety Profile 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC is primarily derived from two 
randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (MDV3100-03 and CRPC2), hereafter defined as the 
combined controlled population. Several other studies in patients with prostate cancer and healthy 
volunteers provide additional safety data. 
 
In the combined controlled population, the median duration of exposure to enzalutamide was 
12.7 months and the median duration of exposure to placebo was 3.8 months. Approximately

CONFIDENTIAL 52% of patients treated with enzalutamide remained on study drug for at least 1 year compared with 
14% of patients treated with placebo; approximately 9% of patients treated with enzalutamide 
remained on study drug for at least 2 years compared with approximately 2% of patients treated with 
placebo. 
 
Overall, enzalutamide treatment was generally well tolerated across all studies, and the safety profile in 
MDV3100-[ADDRESS_901218] 1 adverse event (AE) during each study. In MDV3100-03, a higher 
proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs compared with 
placebo-treated patients (42.9% vs 37.1%); however, time to event analyses showed that these events 
occurred much later in the enzalutamide group than the placebo group. The median time to first grade 
[ADDRESS_901219] grade 3 or higher event in the combined 
controlled population. In MDV3100-03, a higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 
observed for enzalutamide compared with placebo (32.0% vs 26.8%), but with a longer median time to 
first SAE (not yet reached vs 23.3 months). A similar pattern was observed for the incidence of SAEs and 
time to first SAE in the combined controlled population. 
 
In the combined controlled population, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment 
primarily as a result of an AE and the proportion of patients with fatal AEs were comparable between 
treatment groups. 
 
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified in patients with metastatic CRPC (either 
primarily in chemotherapy- naïve patients with earlier stage disease, or patients with more advanced 
stage disease after docetaxel): seizure, hypertension, fatigue, hot flush, falls/nonpathological fractures, 
cognitive/memory impairment, neutropenia, headache, anxiety, hallucination, pruritus/dry skin, 
gynecomastia and restless legs syndrome. 
 
4.3 Study Purpose/Rationale 
Enzalutamide Will be Used in Earlier Clinical Disease States of Prostate Cancer 
As discussed above, ADT does not completely suppress androgen signaling and the novel anti-androgen 
enzalutamide  (Xtandi®, Medivation/Astellas) provides more potent inhibition of the androgen receptor than 
prior anti-androgens (i.e. bicalutamide).  Enzalutamide was initially approved in men with metastatic, castrate-
resistant prostate cancer following docetaxel treatment based on a significant improvement in overall survival 
versus placebo in the AFFIRM  trial ( Figure 2 ).34 However, a recent press release from Medivation/Astellas 
announced that the PREVAIL  trial, which randomized men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer 
who had not received chemotherapy to 
enzalutamide versus placebo, was being 
stopped due to a favorable risk-benefit ratio 
including improved survival and radiographic 
progression free survival in the enzalutamide 
arm.[ADDRESS_901220] failed primary androgen 
deprivation therapy to either bicalutamide or 
enzalutamide ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Enzalutamide 
also has been studied as monotherapy in 
hormone-naïve prostate cancer by [CONTACT_667446].36 In this phase II study, men were 
asymptomatic at baseline and fatigue was the 

Pro00053924:  Exercise Training & Enzalutamide/ADT (EXTEND) 
PT-PhII or III v05. 22.[ADDRESS_901221] common adverse event (34.3%). For now, however, combining enzalutamide with ADT remains 
standard of care. ADT plus enzalutamide is also being studied in even earlier stage prostate canc er: for 
example, an ECOG-ACRIN  adjuvant trial in high-risk men post-prostatectomy is being planned. Therefore, 
alongside these efficacy studies there is a need to evaluate the functional and metabolic changes that occur in 
treatment-naïve men with enzalutamide and ADT, as well as possible mitigation strategies (i.e. exercise 
training) . 
 
Rationale for Exercise Training with ADT and Enzalutamide 
Overall, the extant data provides initial evidence to suggest that the addition of enzalutamide, an androgen 
receptor antagonist, to conventional castration therapy (GnRH agonists/antagonists or orchiectomy to 
maintain serum testosterone <50 ng/dL) may be a highly effective approach for the treatment of hormone-
naïve prostate cancer but also may exacerbate the we ll-described adverse toxicities associated with androgen 
suppression. Against this background, as described, there is strong evidence that relatively short-term 
supervised exercise training (aerobic alone, resistance alone, or the combination) is well-tolerated and 
associated with significant improvements in a broad range of physiological and subject-reported outcomes in 
men either initiating or currently receiving androgen suppression therapy.  
 
No study to date has examined the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of exercise training to prevent and/or 
mitigate common adverse toxicities in men receiving combination androgen suppression therapy for 
hormone-naïve prostate cancer.   
 
Rationale for and Clinical Importance of VO 2peak  
Over the past decade, there has been increased research and clinical interest in the application of exercise 
therapy following a cancer diagnosis. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have extensively evaluated the 
available literature investigating the role of exercise therapy following a cancer diagnosis.37-41  For example, 
Speck et al.42 identified a total of 66 ‘high quality’ studi es that examined the effects of exercise on [ADDRESS_901222] cancer with fewer studies in non- small lung cancer 
(NSCLC), hematologic malignancies, or involving subjects from various types of cancer populations.  
 
Of note, in the vast majority of exercise studies to date, subject-reported outcomes (PROs) such as QOL, 
fatigue, or physical functioning were the primary endpoint. To this end, in general, the current extant 
literature base indicates that exercise training is associated with significant improvements in PROs. Few 
adverse events (AEs) were reported. It was concluded that exercise training is a beneficial adjunct therapy 
both during and following the completion of adjuvant therapy in adult cancer subjects, with low incidence of 
AEs.42 
 
Although the importance of PROs are undisputed, there is growing sentiment in the scientific community that 
exercise – oncology trials now need to look beyond PROs particularly when assessing functional or 
physiological-based end points in oncology populations such as deconditioning, physical functioning, and 
fatigue.[ADDRESS_901223], reflects the integrative ability of 
the cardiopulmonary system to deliver adequate oxygen and substrate to metabolically active skeletal muscles 
for ATP resynthesis.45 Peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak) provides the gold standard (direct) assessment of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863]. Direct or estimated measurement of VO 2peak is a well-established independent 
predictor of mortality in a broad range of non-cancer populations.46,[ADDRESS_901224] range of cancer subjects both 
during and following cytotoxic therapy.44,48-50 In addition, a diagnosis of cancer and associated therapeutic

PT-PhII or III v05. 22.12  Duke Cancer Institute Page 16 of 64 
CONFIDENTIAL management is associated with significant impairments in VO 2peak,51-53 while low VO 2peak is a significant 
predictor of physical and functional QOL domains, fatigue, and other PROs in cancer populations.54,55 Finally, 
we also recently showed that VO 2peak was a significant predictor of overall mortality, that provided prognostic 
information beyond established factors including performance status.48,56 
 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Study Design 
This is a two-arm, non-blinded randomized (1:1) phase II trial to determine the efficacy on aerobic capacity of 
the combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to the same 
regimen plus supervised exercise training (ENZ-ADT plus exercise training) in men with hormone-naïve 
prostate cancer. This study will be conducted at 2 centers:  Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) and Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). A total of [ADDRESS_901227] their enzalutamide treatment 
interrupted for 1 week or until the toxicity grade improves to Grade 2 or lower severity. The

be assessed at Screening and all clinic visits. The dosage and regimen of the following medications and 
any chronic permitted concomitant medications should be stable during the screening period (≥ 4 
weeks prior to randomization) and held constant throughout the study: 
 Bisphosphonates (if applicable) 
 Denosumab (if applicable) 
 GnRH analogue. 
 
Subjects must be receiving androgen deprivation therapy (continuing therapy with a GnRH analogue) 
during the treatment phase starting at visit 3, day 29. If androgen deprivation therapy is discontinued, 
the subject must permanently discontinue study treatment. 
 
Subjects are encouraged to receive standard of care supplementation such as calcium and vitamin D.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Effects of Enzalutamide on Exposure to Other Drugs 
Clinical data indicate that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer 
of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index 
drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, 
warfarin), and CYP2C19 (e.g., S-mephenytoin) should be avoided as enzalutamide may 
decrease their exposure. If co-administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, conduct 
additional INR monitoring. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drugs That May Affect Exposure to Enzalutamide 
Drugs That Inhibit or Induce CYP2C8 
Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) increased the composite 
AUC 0-∞ of enzalutamide plus its active metabolite in healthy volunteers; therefore, co-
administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If 
co-administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce 
the enzalutamide dose to [ADDRESS_901229] not been evaluated in vivo. Co-
administration of enzalutamide with strong or moderate CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may 
alter the plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible. Selection of a 
concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP2C8 induction potential is recommended. 
 
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 
The effects of CYP3A4 inducers on the PK of enzalutamide have not been evaluated in vivo. 
Co-administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) may decrease the plasma exposure 
of enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible. Selection of a concomitant medication with 
no or minimal CYP3A4 induction potential is recommended. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St. John’s Wort may  also reduce the 
plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible.

stand as a measure of lower body strength in 70 adults over 60 years of age . There was a high correlation 
between chair-stand performance and maximum weight-adjusted leg-press performance for both men and 
women (r = .78 and .71, respectively) supports the criterion-related validity of the chair stand as a measure of 
lower body strength. Chair-Stand performance decreased significantly across age groups in decades --from the 
60s to the 70s to the 80s and was significantly lower for participants reporting low levels of exercise behavior 
compared participants reporting higher levels of exercise behavior. To date, the Chair-Stand Test has not been 
assessed in men with prostate cancer. However, our group is currently conducting Chair-Stand Tests in 
ongoing exercise intervention trials in subjects with non-small lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. This 
test, in combination with the Timed Get Up and Go and 6MWT, are widely established as the gold standard 
assessments of functional performance in older adults and will complement the performance-based primary 
outcome of cardiopulmonary function (VO 2peak).   
 
Timed Up and Go: The Timed Get Up and Go (TUG) is field- based test that assesses a person’s mobility. 
Specifically, the TUG measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn 
around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. This test has been found to be feasible in the majority of older 
adults.58 Scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 – [ADDRESS_901234] has not been assessed in men with prostate cancer.

6 Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) : Six-minute walk testing (6MWT) is a simple, clinically feasible and objective 
assessment of functional capacity that is practical even in severely deconditioned clinical populations (e.g., 
chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). 6MWT 
is a robust predictor of mortality in non-cancer settings;60-[ADDRESS_901236] investigated the 
prognostic importance of 6MWT in the oncology setting.64,65  
 
Specifically, Kasymjanova et al. investigated the association between 6MWD and survival in 64 subjects with 
inoperable NSCLC.64 Relative to <400m, a 6MWD ≥400m was associated with a 56% reduction in the risk of 
death after adjustment for important covariates. Similarly, in recent work among 118 subjects with 
histologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC, we found that compared with subjects achieving a 6MWD 
<358.5m, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.07) for a 6MWD of 
358.5 –  450m, and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.93) for a 6MWD >450m.66 Interestingly, in further work by [CONTACT_667449] 6MWD was not an independent predictor of prognosis in 243 subjects with grade III/IV 
recurrent malignant glioma,65 suggesting that 6MWD may not be an appropriate clinical tool for objectively 
assessing physical functioning in all cancer populations.  
  
QUANTITATIVE SKELETAL MUSCLE FUNCTION END POINTS 
It is well-established that ADT causes significant muscle wasting (atrophy), decreased lean body mass, and 
decreased muscle strength.67,[ADDRESS_901237] measures of physical performance using a cross-sectional 
design with 118 men (48 men undertaking ADT for prostate cancer and 70 healthy aged-matched controls) 
from a single tertiary center.[ADDRESS_901238] measure of intramuscular lipid content, as 
well as the muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in 39 men with prostate cancer.67 Muscle attenuation of the 
rectus femoris muscle was significantly reduced following the initiation of ADT by 18.9%. In addition, there 
was a significant decrease in the CSA for the sartorius, quadriceps and rectus femoris muscles.  These results 
indicate that not only muscle size but also muscle quality may be adversely affected by [CONTACT_667450]. Accordingly, measurement of skeletal muscle function in the present using gold-
standard, quantitative assessments is of obvious importance.   
 
In this study, skeletal muscle function will be quantified using three outcomes:  (1) lower extremity skeletal 
muscle cross-sectional area , (2) upper and lower body dynamic strength and (3) upper and lower body 
muscular endurance . Our team has extensive experience in assessing components of skeletal muscle function 
including muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area. For example, our investigative team recently 
completed a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_336636], for the first time, changes in skeletal muscle function in 
terms of muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area (MRI) among [ADDRESS_901239] 
Pro00053924:  Exercise Training & Enzalutamide/ADT (EXTEND) 
PT-PhII or III v05. 22.12  Duke Cancer Institute Page 21 of 64 
CONFIDENTIAL in the entire cardiopulmonary system improving functionality may be muscular endurance . Whereas muscular 
strength is the ability of a muscle or muscle group to generate maximal force, muscular endurance describes 
the muscle’s abili ty to exert successive submaximal force for a certain period of time. So, in addition to 1-RM 
testing for muscular strength, we will evaluate muscular endurance by [CONTACT_667451] 70% of 1-RM. These methods have been demonstrated by [CONTACT_667452] & Howley (1989) and others 
(Nieman, 1995); in particular, there may be discordance between muscular strength and endurance.    
 
METABOLIC AND RELATED END POINTS 
Metabolic Control (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HgbA1c) : Prospective clinical trials have documented that 
ADT leads to decreased insulin sensitivity, or insulin resistance (IR).71-[ADDRESS_901240] had a dramatically increased incidence of diabetes (HR 1.44, p<0.001).29 Exercise is known to 
improve glycemic control and reverse IR, and may prevent the development of diabetes in general 
populations.75 
 
The metabolic changes with enzalutamide in combination with ADT are not known. However, enzalutamide 
also has been studied as monotherapy in hormone-naïve prostate cancer by [CONTACT_319586].36 In this phase II 
study, IR developed as measured by HOMA-IR (+45.1% ± 192.5% at 25 weeks), although there was no 
significant change in fasting blood glucose (-0.1 % ± 14% ). The change from baseline to week 25 in HgbA1c was 
-2.0 ± 6.0% and fasting insulin was +39.4 ± 170.7%.  These data suggest that the addition of enzalutamide to 
ADT could cause worse insulin resistance and provide rationale for evaluating the metabolic changes in this 
setting. 
 
Body Composition : ADT causes a decrease in lean body mass (LBM) and increase in fat body mass (FBM) , 
termed sarcopenic obesity.[ADDRESS_901241] demonstrated that a combination of aerobic and 
resistance exercise training can help maintain LBM during ADT.76 In the study by [CONTACT_319586]. discussed above, 
the mean change from baseline to week 25 in LBM and FBM were -4.2 ± 3.4% and +6.9 ± 12.1%, respectively. 
These data suggest that the addition of enzalutamide to ADT could cause worse sarcopenic obesity and 
provide rationale for evaluating body composition changes in this setting. 
 
Food Frequency Questionnaire : Diet and exercise are inter-related; as such, beneficial changes may tend to 
rise and fall together. The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is the most common dietary assessment tool 
used in large epi[INVESTIGATOR_667433]. The self-administered FFQ booklet asks participants to 
report the frequency of consumption and portion size of approximately 125 line items over a defined period of 
time (e.g. the last month; the last three months).77 Each line item is defined by a series of foods or beverages. 
The Nutrition Assessment Shared Resource (NASR) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) 
periodically updates its standard FFQ to reflect U.S. food consumption patterns and major changes in the 
market place. The GSEL and MSEL FFQs were designed in 2001 under the direction of FHCRC nutritional 
scientists and epi[INVESTIGATOR_667434], the 
Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)78 and the VITamins and Lifestyle study (VITAL).79 The 
GSEL FFQ was updated in late 2010.  It is now called the GNA (General Nutrition Assessment) and has a male 
counterpart called the MNA (Men’s Nutritional Assessment) . A MNA FFQ will be administered at the Week 1 
and Week 17 time points to explore the collinearity of diet/exercise and to potentially correct for imbalances 
in the dietary intake between arms.

example Segal et al. randomized 155 men with prostate cancer treated with ADT76 to an intervention group 
that participated in a resistance exercise program three times per week for 12 weeks (82 men) or to a waiting 
list control group (73 men). The primary outcomes were fatigue and disease-specific quality of life as assessed 
by [CONTACT_6270]-reported questionnaires after 12 weeks. Men assigned to resistance exercise had less interference

CONFIDENTIAL from fatigue on activities of daily living (P =.002) and higher quality of life (P =.001) than men in the control 
group. In the phase II study of enzalutamide monotherapy in HNPC , fatigue was the second most common 
adverse event (34.3%) and quality of life data has not been reported.36 The changes that occur with ENZ – ADT 
+/- exercise training have not been described.  Therefore, we propose to describe the changes that occur in 
this setting. 
 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire is a commonly used, validated 
tool for assessing health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.  FACT-P was used by [CONTACT_667453].34,[ADDRESS_901242], we will also evaluate it using the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue ( FACIT-F ) questionnaire,82 which has been 
validated in subjects with prostate cancer.   Finally, because it will be important for interpretation of our data 
to understand baseline activity levels in both arms, as well as activity levels on the control arm (to assess for 
contamination) , we will evaluate leisure time exercise habits with the simple, Godin Leisure Time Exercise 
Questionnaire. 
 
PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA) END POINTS 
Prostate specific antigen (PSA), a glycoprotein produced by [CONTACT_667454], is 
useful for monitoring response to therapy. As there is no radiographic evidence of disease to follow, PSA is 
commonly used to monitor response to therapy in the Rising PSA  clinical state of prostate cancer.22 A phase II 
study of enzalutamide monotherapy in men with both metastatic (38.8%) and non-metastatic hormone-naïve 
prostate cancer documented a 92.5 % PSA response rate (≥80%) and 99.6% median PSA decrease.[ADDRESS_901243] (waterfall plot) and report the PSA 
response rate (proportion with ≥80% decline) and median PSA decrease in this population. 
 
METABOLOMICS END POINTS 
Metabolomics , the measurement of multiple small molecule metabolites in biological specimens, is a promising 
biomarker platform based on ease- of-use, cost, and close proximity to phenotype.  Metabolomics approaches 
have been used to both detect and predict drug toxicity.83,[ADDRESS_901244] study 
exploring untargeted metabolomic profiling changes in 36 prostate cancer subjects treated with ADT, measuring 
changes in plasma metabolomics profiles from baseline to after 3 months treatment.85 In this exploratory 
analysis, multiple steroids decreased; most bile acids and metabolites increased; markers of lipid beta-oxidation 
and omega-oxidation decreased; and two previously identified biomarkers of insulin resistance were stable to 
decreased. The metabolomics changes induced by [CONTACT_1583] a potent anti-androgen (e.g. enzalutamide) to ADT 
are unknown. This provides rationale for more detailed targeted metabolomics analyses in men with PC treated 
with potent combined androgen blockade with enzalutamide. 
6.4 Definition of Evaluable Subjects 
For the primary analysis of ΔVO 2peak , patients with measurements at baseline are evaluable. 
6.5 Early Study Termination 
This study can be terminated at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_667455]-sponsor.  If this occurs, all subjects on 
study should be notified as soon as possible.  Additional procedures and/or follow up should occur in 
accordance with Section 9.11, which describes procedures and process for prematurely withdrawn subject s.

PT-PhII or III v05. 22.12  Duke Cancer Institute Page 33 of 64 
CONFIDENTIAL 9.5 Lead-In  Period 
Subjects will be randomized to usual care or exercise training up to 14 days prior to Day 1 , but only after 
eligibility is confirmed and baseline exercise testing (specifically, CPET) has been performed . See Sections 6.1.4  
and 9.4 for randomization details. See also Schedule of Events , above.  
 
Arm A, ENZ – ADT  plus Usual Care:   Subjects randomized to usual care will be asked not to make any changes 
in their physical activity beginning on Day 1.  These subjects will start ENZ – ADT on Day 29 (week 5) after the 4 
week lead-in period.   This delay is felt to be insignificant from a clinical perspective.  While two Phase III 
studies are currently examining this question ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the delay in initiation of ADT in 
these studies is much longer than 4 weeks. There is currently no evidence that a delay, especially one as short 
as 4 weeks, in starting ADT in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, affects outcomes.88  
 
Arm B, ENZ – ADT plus Exercise Training:   Subjects randomized to exercise training will begin the exercise 
training program detailed below beginning on Day 1. The goal for the ENZ-ADT plus exercise training will be 3 
supervised exercise sessions per week at an intensity between 50 and 100% of the individually determined 
exercise capacity (at baseline) for aerobic training and an intensity between 60% and 80% of one-repetition 
maximum (1-RM) for resistance training for 30-90 minutes/session. The exercise training intervention is 
designed such that participants begin exercising at a low intensity (~50%-60% VO 2peak) that is subsequently 
increased to more moderate to vigorous intensity (~70%-80% VO 2peak) when appropriate. All interventions 
will be individually tailored to each subject following the principles of aerobic or resistance training 
prescription guidelines for adults as recommended by [CONTACT_25986] (ACSM).[ADDRESS_901273]. Lee Jones’ group at MSKCC or the CPX  Lab at Duke based on both the interpretation of 
the CPET plus Muscular Strength/1-RM data and a standardized template, within 24-48 hours of these tests. 
 
The major reason for early training during this Lead- In Period is to ‘buffer’ the expected rapid deleterious 
impact of hormonal therapy on cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function. This ‘pre-treatment’ exercise 
training is hypothesized to attenuate this impact that, in turn, will facilitate higher intensity exercise training 
during hormonal therapy. 
 
9.6 Treatment Period 1:  ENZ-ADT plus either Usual Care or Exercise Training 
Arm A, ENZ – ADT  plus Usual Care:   Beginning on Day 29 (week 5), subjects will be treated with androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) per standard of care (orchiectomy, GnRH agonist, or GnRH antagonist to maintain 
total testosterone <50 ng/dl for the remaining 32 weeks of the study).  In addition, subjects will take 
enzalutamide (ENZ) [ADDRESS_901274] and enzalutamide (160 mg daily) is the standard- of-care dosing. The treatment duration of 
approximately 8 months was selected to achieve maximal efficacy while minimizing toxicity and is based on 
intermittent hormonal therapy regimens studied in Phase III clinical trials.22,23 Concomitant medication will be 
evaluated at every clinic visit during enzalutamide therapy.  Concomitant medications include all vitamins, 
herbal remedies, over the counter, and prescription medications. 
 
Arm B, ENZ – ADT plus Exercise Training:   Beginning on Day 29 (week 5), Subjects randomly allocated to this 
group will receive the same ADT-ENZ regimen as described above.  In addition, subjects will continue the 
defined exercise training initiated during the Lead- In Period for a total of 16 weeks (through Day 113, week 
17).  
 
The window is ±7 days for this period, EXCEPT Day 29 (week 5) which has a window of ±3 days. See Schedule

PSA is higher than the preceding value, then the rising PSA will be confirmed in 4 weeks (± 
1 week) in the same laboratory as the first two values. If that third PSA value is higher st ill 
and the range of values is 50% above the baseline, then the patient is off study treatment. 
If not, the patient will remain on study, and the PSA will once again be checked when the 
patient presents for his regularly scheduled clinic visit.

Subjects who withdraw prior to completing the baseline assessment for the primary endpoint will be 
replaced. See also Sections 9.1 and 9.2 for eligibility criteria, as well as 12.1  and 12.4.3 for analysis 
related to withdrawals. 
9.12 Study Assessments 
9.12.1  Medical History 
Medical history, such as previous treatments, procedures, and conditions will be collected during the 
screening period. 
9.12.2  Physical Exam 
Evaluations should be performed by [CONTACT_107306]. 
Weight will be recorded at every visit. Height will be recorded at screening visit only. Body mass index 
(BMI) will be calculated at every visit. Vital signs include upright blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and oral or aural body temperature. A complete physical examination is required at the Screening, 
Day 113, and Day 252 visits.  A brief symptom-directed physical examination should be performed at all 
other clinic visits. 
9.12.3  Correlative Assessments 
All Correlative Assessments will be performed at Day 1 and Day 113 (see Schedule of Events at the 
beginning of this Section for details).  Patient reported outcomes will also be performed at Day 252. In 
addition, a CPET will be performed at Day [ADDRESS_901280] later 
changes in metabolic parameters.  All samples will be collected in the fasting, pre-exercise state unless 
otherwise noted below. 
 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) 
Exercise Capacity  will be assessed using a symptom-limited CPET on a motorized treadmill with expi[INVESTIGATOR_667439] 2peak, according to guidelines for clinical populations.[ADDRESS_901281] 30s value elicited during the CPET. During exercise, heart rate and rhythm will 
be monitored continuously using a 12-lead ECG. Equipment with similar technical specifications will be 
used across the two study sites to ensure reasonably accurate and precise results.   
 
Physical Functioning / Functional Capacity 
Physical Functioning / Functional Capacity  will be assessed using the following assessments :  chair-stand 
test, timed up and go, and [ADDRESS_901282] : The 5-repetition chair-stand test measured the time taken to complete [ADDRESS_901283] at 43cm in height and 47.5cm in depth. Standardized instructions will 
be provided as follows: “By [CONTACT_598545] 3, please stand up and sit down as quickly as possible for 
Pro00053924:  Exercise Training & Enzalutamide/ADT (EXTEND) 
PT-PhII or III v05. 22.[ADDRESS_901284] the chair's backrest at the end of every re petition.” Timing will start when the 
subject's back left the backrest and will be stopped once the back touched the backrest.  
 
Timed Get Up and Go: Subjects will be required to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk 3m, 
turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. The time taken to complete this task will be 
measured in seconds with a stopwatch.93  
 
6-minute Walk Distance (Duke patients only) : The six minute walk test will be conducted 
according to the guidelines of the ATS.[ADDRESS_901285] will be performed twice at each study timepoint with the averag e 
recorded. Age and sex-predicted 6MWD will be calculated from the equation of Gibbons et al.95 
 
Quantitative Skeletal Muscle Function 
Quantitative Skeletal Muscle Function  will be assessed by [CONTACT_667460]:   
 
Muscle Cross Sectional Area  (CSA ; protocol v1-v15 only ) of the dominant thigh will be assessed using 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 3.0T-scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla MRI, Erlangen, 
[LOCATION_013]). Imaging will be performed using sequence turbo spin echo (T1-weighted sequence) recall 
scans at the mid-femur level. Seventeen serial slices will be obtained with one at the juncture of the 
middle third of the femur (this point will be landmarked to ensure within subject reproducibility) as 
previously described.[ADDRESS_901286] using a combination of console 
software and/or third party commercially available independent workstation in conjunction, as needed. 
If the patients MRI screening form is positive, the muscle CSA will not be performed but the subject will 
continue on the study. 
 
Muscular Strength  of the upper and lower body will be assessed as a one-repetition maximum  (1-RM) .  
This dynamic strength assessment will be conducted using the following exercises: leg press, chest 
press, and row. The heaviest weight lifted while adhering to the strict technique and form will be used 
to score the assessment. A certified exercise physiologist or trained designee will conduct this 
assessment in a controlled environment. A 1- RM is defined as the greatest resistance that can be 
moved through the full range of motion in a controlled manner. Mean percentage of age and sex-
predicted muscle strength will be obtained from available normative data.  
 
Muscular Endurance  of the upper and lower body will be assessed as the number of repetitions to 
fatigue  at 70% of the 1- RM.  The same exercises and methods will be used as in the 1-RM 
determination, detailed above.  Subjects will continue until technique, tempo, volition or inability to 
complete two consecutive repetitions causes finality (per discretion of the exercise physiologist or 
trained designee).  
  
Metabolic Control (protocol v1-v15 only) 
Subjects will undergo sampling of fasting, pre-exercise, plasma insulin  and glucose  concentrations for 
calculation of HOMA- IR, as previously described.97 Glycosylated hemoglobin  (HgbA1c) will also be 
measured. These will be measured in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory.  
 
Body Composition  
Body composition  will be assessed by [CONTACT_11323] x-ray absorptiometry scan in the morning (after an 
overnight fast, if possible). Transverse scans from head to toe measured absorption of x-ray beams at 
two different energy levels allowing for a valid determination of lean body mass, fat mass and fat 
percentage.

changes in fatigue will be collected using the Functional Assessment in Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue 
questionnaire ( FACIT-F ), which can be found in Appendix B .  Data on leisure time exercise habits will be 
collected using the 4-item Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire , which can be found in Appendix 
D.100 
 
Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) 
A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed by [CONTACT_667461] (NASR) 
of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) will be administered at the Week 1 and Week 17 
time points to explore the collinearity of diet/exercise and to potentially correct for imbalances in the 
dietary intake between arms. Participants will be queried regarding their dietary intake over the last 1 
month prior to completing the questionnaire. 
 
Specifically, nutrient data will be collected using the Men’s Nutritional Assessment (MNA) . Nutrition 
Assessment uses the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR) software for 
data entry and nutrient analysis via the FFQ . A sample booklet is provided at: 
http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/sites/default/files/FFQ-MNA-Sample.pdf  
 
Questionnaires will be batched (approximately 30- 40 questionnaires/batch) and sent via UPS/FedEx to 
NASR for scanning. FFQs are optically scanned at FHCRC. Each batch of scanned FFQs yields files 
containing food consumption data, nutrient intake data, and an error report that specifies 
questionnaire completion errors (e.g. incomplete erasures, missed questions).

or evaluation of study assessments, whether an AE or SAE has occurred. 
10.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject undergoing a study 
procedure/intervention and/or receiving study drug; which may or may not have a causal relationship with 
study procedures, interventions or treatments.   For this protocol, the definition of AE also includes worsening 
of any pre-existing medical condition.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable, unintended or worsening sign 
or symptom (including an abnormal laboratory finding, or disease temporally associated with exercise testing 
for both arm A and arm B; exercise training for arm B; and/ or related to the use of enzalutamide.   Abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs.  
But laboratory value changes that require therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered adverse 
events. 
 
Research exercise-related adverse events will be collected from the baseline exercise testing to the End of 
Study visit (as defined in Section 9.8 ) for all subjects (Except anticipated AEs-see section 10.1.2).  All subjects 
will have enzalutamide related adverse events collected from the start of study drug on week 5, day 29 
through the Safety Follow- up visit .   
 
Serious adverse events that are related to study exercise procedures  (CPET, 1RM, Chair testing, etc ) are 
recorded from the time the informed consent form is signed until the Safety Follow-Up visit (withdrawal or 
screen failure).   All SAEs will be collected regardless of attribution starting once the patient takes his first dose 
of study drug through the Safety Follow-Up visit.  All AEs and SAEs must be recorded in the subject medical 
record and adverse events case report form.

of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life-threatening (4), or fatal (5). 
 
Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows: 
- Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study drug and/or exercise training and/or exercise testing 
- Probably:  The AE is likely related to the study drug and/or exercise training and/or exercise testing 
- Possible:  The AE may be related to the study drug and/or exercise training and/or exercise testing 
- Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug and/or exercise training and/or exercise 
testing 
- Unrelated:  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug and/or exercise training and/or exercise 
testing  
10.1.[ADDRESS_901291] 
“Fatigue” and “generalized muscle weakness”  (regardless of site) are AEs of special interest. Care 
should be taken to appropriately identify, grade, and note the attribution of these AES throughout the 
study. However, there is no special reporting requirement for these AEs. 
 
10.1.2  Expected AEs with Exercise Training and Testing (CPET) 
Anticipated (expected) side-effects associated with a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test or 
exercise training include: 
 Muscle soreness 
 Joint pain 
 Lower back pain 
 Leg cramps 
 
These anticipated side-effects associated with CPET will not be recorded as AEs as long as they are transient in 
nature.   
 
 
 
Unanticipated but possible side-effects that are rare, but serious  include: 
 Cardiovascular: angina, AV blocks, bradycardia, edema, hypotension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rebound 
hypertension, shock, syncope.    
 Arrhythmias  
 Myocardial ischemia  
 Sudden cardiac death  
 Cerebrovascular accident  
 
These rare but serious AEs that may be related to CPET will be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  The CPET may uncover 
previously unknown arrhythmias or other abnormal cardiac findings.  These will be assessed for clinical significance 
by [CONTACT_667464]/or Princip al Investigator and will be recorded and graded as AEs if deemed to be clinically 
significant.

nursing infant is considered a potential risk. Enzalutamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action. Subjects receiving enzalutamide are advised to use 2 
acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier method of 
contraception) starting at the time of screening for an enzalutamide study and continuing throughout the 
course of treatment and for at least three months after enzalutamide is discontinued.  
 
If during the conduct of the clinical trial, a male subject impregnates his partner, the subject should report the 
pregnancy to the Investigator. With the permission of the pregnant partner, the Investigator should report the 
pregnancy to Medivation/Astell as as an SAE within [ADDRESS_901294] menstruation, estimated fertility date, pregnancy 
result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information. 
 
With the permission of the pregnant partner, the Investigator should report the outcome of the pregnancy

stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly [including anomaly in a miscarried fetus, etc.]) in accordance 
with the same reporting procedure as for SAEs.  The date of outcome of the pregnancy, gestational age, date 
of birth and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information. Informed consent will need to be 
obtained from the pregnant partner to document her permission to disclose this information with 
Medivation/Astellas.  
10.4 Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) 
The Duke Cancer Institute SOC is responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor-
investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have an independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of safety data, toxicities and new 
information that may affect subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews includes but may not be limited 
to review of safety data, enrollment status, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12596], accrual, toxicities, reference literature, 
and interim analyses as provided by [CONTACT_456]-investigator.  The SOC in concert with the DCI Monitoring 
Team (see Section 11 .1 for Monitoring Team description) oversees the conduct of DUHS cancer-related, 
sponsor-investigator therapeutic intervention and prevention intervention studies that do not have an 
external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the protocol is conducted, recorded and reported in 
accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and 
applicable regulatory requirements.

 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Monitoring 
The Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Monitoring Team will conduct monitoring visits to ensure subject safety and to 
ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard 
operating procedures, good clinical practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.  As specified in the DCI 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the DCI Monitoring Team will conduct routine monitoring after the third 
subject is enrolled, followed by [CONTACT_12636] 1 – 3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and 
subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more than minimal risk.   
 
Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of serious 
and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of DUHS and DCI 
leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, Duke Clinical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA), the Safety 
Oversight Committee (SOC), the Sponsor-Investigator, the site  Principal Investigator, or the IRB.  All study 
documents must be made available upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized regulatory 
authorities, including but not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and the 
FDA.  Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring. 
11.2 Data Management and Processing 
11.2.1  Study Documentation 
Study documentation includes but is not limited to source documents, case report forms, monitoring 
logs, appointment schedules, study team correspondence with sponsors or regulatory 
bodies/committees, and regulatory documents that can be found in the DCI- mandated “Regulatory 
Binder”, which includes but is not limited to signed protocol and amendments, approved and signed 
informed consent forms, FDA Form 1572, CAP and CLIA laboratory certifications, and clinical supplies 
receipts and distribution records. 
 
Source documents are original records that contain source data, which is all information in original 
records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source documents include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject s’ diaries or evaluation 
checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_35418], microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories

treatment.    
 
The safety population will be all patients with at least one safety evaluation. 
12.[ADDRESS_901298] deviation, minimum, and maximum will be displayed by [CONTACT_667466].  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_667467].

Pro00053924:  Exercise Training & Enzalutamide/ADT (EXTEND)

CONFIDENTIAL The primary analysis will be comparison of the change in peak oxygen uptake ( VO 2peak) from week [ADDRESS_901300].  The primary analysis 
will be done for complete cases, (i.e. patients with VO 2peak measured at baseline and at week 17) in 
the ITT population. 
 
Descriptive comparisons of Δ VO 2peak will be done: 
 between baseline and end of week [ADDRESS_901301] of exercise (or usual care) alone ,  
 between end of week [ADDRESS_901302] of exercise during ENZ + ADT 
treatment, and  
 between the start of week [ADDRESS_901303] measurement following week 17.   A sensitivity 
analysis will be done including these patients with complete cases.   
 
12.5 Secondary and Exploratory Objectives 
Refer to Section 5  for the secondary objectives and endpoints.  Secondary objectives are to compare effects 
on physical functioning / functional capacity, primary physiological determinants of VO 2peak, metabolic 
outcomes of interest, and subject-reported outcomes (PROs) of interest. The safety, feasibility, and 
acceptability of exercise training will also be evaluated. 
 
Refer to Section 5  for the exploratory objectives and endpoints.  Exploratory objectives are to compare PSA 
response rates and describe metabolomics changes. 
 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints are generally assessed at baseline, week 17, and at the end of week 36. 
 
 Descriptive comparisons of changes in secondary and exploratory endpoints will be done both: 
 between baseline and the start of week [ADDRESS_901304] of exercise on changes due to ENZ + 
ADT, and 
 between the start of week [ADDRESS_901305] of 
the supervised  exercise regimen after it is discontinued. 
 
Continuous measures will generally be analyzed using a repeated measures model with the measure as the 
dependent variate and treatment arm and week of assessment as independent variates.  Appropriate 
transformations will be used in cases where the measures the assumption of normally distributed errors 
would be violated.   
 
Categorical measures will be analyzed using categorical data modeling techniques. 
 
Whenever possible, transformation or categorization of secondary and exploratory measures will done as 
reported in previous ly published studies in the field. 
 
Eligibility rate  is defined as the number of subjects found to be eligible for the study divided by [CONTACT_667469] (i.e. screen fail rate). (Note:  ineligible patients will not be randomized.)  Acceptance 
rate is defined as the number of patients agreeing to participate divided by [CONTACT_667470].

VO 2peak  and HOMA -IR.  Changes in metabolite concentrations and VO 2peak  or HOMA -IR will be compared 
between the usual care and exercise groups using ANOVA. Correlation analysis and linear regression will be 
used to describe the relationship between metabolomics biomarker changes and VO 2peak  or and HOMA -IR. 
Nominal statistical significanc e will be defined as p<0.05.  
 
In addition, the maximum PSA change from baseline in each patient will be described using waterfall plots.  
The PSA response rate, defined as the proportion of men with a ≥80% decline in PSA from baseline, will be 
reported for each arm.  The median decrease in PSA will also be reported for each arm. 
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed repeating primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint analyses using 
Last Value Carried Forward (LOCF) methods. The intent of this sensitivity analysis is to assay the robustness of 
results observed in the modified ITT population. 
 
Adjustment for multiple comparisons is not planned for secondary or exploratory measures.

cardiopulmonary function in men receiving the combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) and androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) for treatment of hormone-naïve prostate cancer.  
 
The initial sample size calculations was based on the expected change in VO 2peak based on relevant prior 
reports or unpublished observations by [CONTACT_3476]. Regarding the ENZ + ADT group, Segal et al.80 reported 
that VO 2peak showed a mean decrease of 1.4 mL.kg.-1min-1 in 41 men initiating radiation with or without ADT 
for prostate cancer. During the same period, structured supervised resistance training completely abrogated 
the decline in VO 2peak observed in the usual care group. In unpublished data from our group among 50 men 
following prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer, mean VO 2peak was 29.5 mL.kg.-1min-1 (± 5.0 mL.kg.-
1min-1). Following baseline assessments, subjects were randomly allocated to supervised aerobic training 
(n=25) or usual care (n=25) for 6 months. VO 2peak increased by 2.71 ± 3.5 mL.kg-1.min-1 in the exercise group 
and 0.6 ± 2.2 mL.kg-1.min-1 in the usual care group, resulting in a between group difference of +1.95 mL.kg-
1.min-1 that favored the exercise training group (p=0.024).  
 
Against this background, this protocol adopt ed the following assumptions: (1) a decline of 2.0 mL.kg-1.min-1 
ENZ-ADT group from baseline to 16 weeks, and (2) an increase of 1.0 mL.kg-1.min-1 ENZ-ADT plus exercise 
training group from baseline to 16 weeks, for a between group delta of 3.0 mL.kg-1.min-1, favoring the ENZ-
ADT plus exercise training group.  A total of 56 subjects (n=28 / per group) provides 80% power to detect a 
mean 3.[ADDRESS_901308]- to-follow-up rate of 
15%, thus approximately [ADDRESS_901309]-randomization. 
 
In November 2016, an interim analysis was performed due to the slow accrual and subjective feedback from 
subjects and exercise physiologists.  That is, subjects in the exercise training group (Arm B) seem ed to feel and 
perform better after the 16-week exercise training program compared with the usual care (Arm A) group at

CONFIDENTIAL the same time point.  A difference in the point estimates of VO 2peak (week 1 to week 17) between groups 
was seen in the first 8 subjects who had completed testing for the primary endpoint of VO 2peak at week 17 
(N=4 each in the usual care and exercise training groups), suggesting less decline of VO2peak in Arm B.  Based 
on the interim analysis data, the study statisticians revised the sample size calculation.   
 
We expect to use a one-sided t-test to check whether Arm B has a significant increase in VO 2peak from the 
baseline compared to Arm A. When each group has [ADDRESS_901310] 
80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the two groups have the same change of VO 2peak given the 
effect size is 0.68 (the ratio of mean difference over common standard deviation). In case the test result is not 
significant, we will report the mean reduction descriptively with 95% confidence interval for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
In summary, the revised sample size estimate is 40 total evaluable subjects, or 20 subjects in each arm.

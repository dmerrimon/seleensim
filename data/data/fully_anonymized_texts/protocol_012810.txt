        Study Title :  Diagnostic accuracy of using colonoscope with near focus capability in detecting residual 
colorectal neoplastic tissue after EMR: a prospective study  
  Protocol version number and date:       
 
Purpose  
 Hypothesis:   Using standard white light with and without near focus does not provide better sensitivity and negative predictive value compare to narrow band imaging with and without near focus when assessing previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) site for residual neoplasia     Aims, purpose, or objectives: 
 
- Compare the accuracy of using different endoscopic imaging technique (white light, white light w ith 
near focus, narrow band imaging (NBI), NBI with near focus) for detection of residual neoplastic tissue 
at site of prior EMR  
 
 Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 Residual neoplasia after EMR is a common. Optimal surveillance protocols are not clearly defined. There is a need for better imaging modalities to evaluate for residual disease. Suspected residual tissue can be confirmed with repeat colonoscopy or can be empi[INVESTIGATOR_411175]. However, this can lead to either frequent colonoscopy or overtreatment. This presents more cost and financial burden to the patient. With the introduction of newer colonscopes that have near focus/zoom capability, it is important to assess whether the near focus technology offers better accuracy for detection of residual neoplastic tissue. With better accuracy to confidently rule out residual neoplasia using newer imaging modality, additional treatment or biopsy at the previous EMR may be avoided. Furthermore, the interval for surveillance colonscopy can be lengthened.

Methods: D escribe, in detail, the research activities  that will be conducted under this protocol :   
 
Methods This is a prospective, comparison trial. Patients who need to undergo follow-up colonoscopy 6 months after initial EMR procedure will be enrolled at one tertiary -care referral institution. Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_411176]. All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_2329] a hgh-definition colonoscope (Olympus CFH190) with the near focus mode ca pability. For the [ADDRESS_518579] of care for all patients 
undergoing EMR. Little additional time (less than 5 minutes) will be needed for the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_411177].    Prior to study start, all EMR endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11432] a test set of images (10) including those with and without residual neoplasia. They will then be tested on an independent set of 10 images. A score of 90% or higher is 
required prior to starting participation in the study.  
 Different endoscopic imaging methods will be utilized to identify and evaluate the previous EMR resection site. The scar site will be examined for the presence or absence of residual neoplasia. The prior EMR site will evaluated using 1) high definition white light, 2) white light with near focus, 3) NBI, and 4) NBI with near focus in real time. Endoscopic images are taken us ing each of the endoscopic imaging methods. A total of at 
least four photographs will be taken for each subject to be reviewed offline blinded to histopathology.  While using imaging techniques to examine the previous EMR site, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_411178] a questionnaire during the procedure.  
One, does the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_411179] (yes/no).  Two, does the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_411180]/her assessment. 
 [CONTACT_411184] -Chung Chen and other research a ssistants of [CONTACT_411185] will be administering and recording 
the questionnaire during clinical procedure at Mayo [LOCATION_012].   Research coordinators and assistants of [CONTACT_411186] will be administering and recording the questionnaire during clinical procedure at Mayo [COMPANY_002]ster.  
 Research coordinators and assistants of [CONTACT_411187] will be administering and recording the questionnaire during clinical procedure at Mayo Arizona.    After careful inspection of the previous EMR site, at least four biopsies will be taken at the site to assess for any evidence of residual neoplasia. All resected specimens will undergo standard histopathology assessment by [CONTACT_411183].

 No statistical information . If checked , please explain: 
  
Statistical Considerations  
 Power Sta tement :   
 Sample size is estimated based on the degree of precision. We estimate that 20% of cases will have residual neoplasia. Thus, sensitivity will be the key limiting variable. In order to achieve confidence intervals < 5%, assuming 90% sensitivity, 150 cases are needed. To account for possible drop out, lower quality images, or inability to get 4 high quality images in all cases, we will enroll 200 patients.

Endpoints 
     Primary:  
 Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy for white light, white light with near focus, NBI, and NBI with near focus against histopathology as the standard reference.               Secondary :

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a driver of poor health outcomes and high healthcare costs. 
Comprehensive lifestyle change can improve glycemic control, reduce complications, and reduce 
cost of care among patients with T2DM. Unfortunately, many patients fail to achieve adequate 
lifestyle change and thus experience adverse health events and/or become dependent upon 
expensive medical care. The Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) is an Intensive 
Therapeutic Lifestyle Change program administered in the outpatient setting. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_104318]-controlled trial comparing the clinical, utilization, and financial outcomes of adult 
health plan members with T2DM offered CHIP versus those only offered standard health plan 
coverage.  
Sixty GHP members will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by [CONTACT_631371]1c value) into either 
the CHIP intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will attend 18 classes 
covering topi[INVESTIGATOR_631353], sleep, exercise instruction, stress management, and toxic substance 
avoidance. Biometrics (weight, BMI, waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood pressure), 
biomarkers (HbA1c, LDL-C) and psychometrics (Wellbeing360 survey) will be collected on all 
participants at baseline, 3-months and 6-months. 
We hypothesize that GHP members with type [ADDRESS_842545] improvement in HbA1c and as well as in other biometrics, 
biomarkers, psychometrics and utilization/financial outcomes. The primary aim is to compare 
change in HbA1c, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and waist circumference 
for GHP members offered CHIP versus members offered standard insurance coverage at 3- and 
6-months. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the focus of the analysis will be estimating the mean and 
standard deviation of the change at 3- and 6-month for each primary and secondary outcome. We 
will also estimate the difference of the changes between groups and the variability.  
 
We seek to validate a scalable and replicable intervention which could be offered by a health 
plan alongside standard medical coverage to improve key health and financial outcomes for 
members with T2DM.

Version: 2/23/[ZIP_CODE] BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a key driver of poor health outcomes and high cost of 
healthcare in the [LOCATION_002]. T2DM affects approximately 10% of adults in the [LOCATION_002] 
and is associated with complications including cardiovascular events, loss of vision, diabetic 
kidney disease, and premature death (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). 
Healthcare costs are 2.[ADDRESS_842546] costs of type 2 
diabetes care exceed $230 billion annually (American Diabetes Association, 2018). 
Lifestyle intervention can dramatically influence the course of T2DM. For example, in the 
DiRECT trial, 46% of patients undergoing intensive calorie reduction (825-853 calories per day) 
followed by [CONTACT_631372] T2DM, defined as 
HbA1c below 6.5% while off all diabetes medications (Lean, Leslie, Barnes, & Brosnahan, 
2018). Similarly, 30% of patients in a cohort drawn from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial 
achieved remission of T2DM through lifestyle change alone (Dambha-Miller, Day, Streiltz, & 
Griffin, 2019). Unfortunately, in the real world most patients with T2DM fail to achieve clinical 
remission, and only about half of patients achieve an HbA1c below 7% even with medications 
(Edelman & Polonsky, 2017). 
Several shortcomings of the most common lifestyle approaches in T2DM limit their population 
health impact. First, protocols based on dramatic calorie reduction may be challenging to sustain 
on a long-term basis. Admittedly, 24-month follow-up of the DiRECT trial cohort found 36% of 
intervention arm subjects remained in diabetes remission (Lean, Leslie, Barnes, & Brosnahan, 
2018). However, follow-up of calorie restriction programs has been inconsistent beyond 24 
months (Dombrowski et al. 2014). Second, achieving a consistent approach to lifestyle change in 
a real-world health system is challenging due to competing demands on providers and a lack of 
standardization. For example, 2019 guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
suggest that each patient develop a personalized diabetes self-management education and support 
(DSMES) plan, allowing some variety in lifestyle strategies (American Diabetes Association, 
2019). Unfortunately, as evidenced by [CONTACT_631373], adequate DSMES plans are not consistently implemented. Lastly, interventions 
focused narrowly on parameters specific to diabetes, such as glycemic control and body mass

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
Version: 2/23/2023index, may not be optimized to achieve other important health outcomes such as cardiovascular 
prevention, dementia prevention, and cancer prevention. 
An alternative approach to lifestyle intervention in T2DM would be to apply a lifestyle program 
designed to optimize overall health rather than one specifically targeting T2DM. In theory, such 
an approach could improve diabetes-related outcomes and might additionally help prevent 
adverse health events which are less directly linked to T2DM. Such an approach would offer the 
potential to achieve overall wellness and reduce overall healthcare costs. From the perspective of 
a healthcare payer, a standardized and scalable program offering general health benefits would 
be an appealing population health tool for improving members’ health while also controlling 
healthcare costs. 
Intensive Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (ITLC) describes comprehensive lifestyle programs 
aiming to improve outcomes for multiple common chronic conditions simultaneously. ITLC 
programs are designed to target the root causes common to the pathophysiology of multiple 
interrelated chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, fatty 
liver disease, certain cancers, T2DM, hypertension and dementia. Proposed mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_631374], stress response, 
malnutrition, impaired metabolism, DNA damage, and microbial dysbiosis (Bodai, et al., 2018). 
In general, ITLC programs address all Six Pi[INVESTIGATOR_631354] a range of 
disease drivers. These Six Pi[INVESTIGATOR_631355], nutrition, sleep, social relationships, 
stress management, and avoidance of risky substances (American College of Lifestyle Medicine, 
2020). Although ITLC overlaps significantly with the standard approach to diabetes management 
(e.g. DSMES emphasizing dietary improvement and increased exercise), ITLC is comparatively 
more comprehensive and more transformative. 
A major factor limiting widespread adoption of ITLC is the investment of time and money 
required by [CONTACT_631375]. Early ITLC programs required a residential experience, 
making large-scale implementation for community dwelling adults impractical. The Complete 
Health Improvement Program (CHIP) is a version of ITLC which was developed and validated 
for the ambulatory setting. CHIP is generally administered through a series of classes over a 1- to

Version: 2/23/[ZIP_CODE]-month period. CHIP has been shown in an RCT to improve key biometrics and biomarkers 
relevant to type 2 diabetes, including glucose, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-C (Aldana et al. 
2005, 371-381). This RCT included healthy adults and individuals with pre-existing diagnoses, 
such as hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], T2DM, and obesity. CHIP has been validated in multiple settings in the 
[LOCATION_002] and internationally and has demonstrated sustained biomarker/biometric 
improvements at 36 months (Morton, et al., 2014; Kent, et al., 2013; Kotekal, et al., 2019). Of 
particular interest, when offered to Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt Health System 
employees in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_631356], CHIP was shown to improve key biomarkers and biometrics, to 
decrease diabetes medication use, and to decrease total cost of care on participants’ employer-
sponsored health plans by >$1,000 per participant within 6-months (Shurney, et al., 2013). 
Another pi[INVESTIGATOR_631357] (Remy et al. 2017, 293-300) in an employed Appalachian 
population. The authors of the Ohio University study currently have a trial in progress assessing 
the effectiveness of CHIP for clinical outcomes, cost of care on the university health plan, and 
absenteeism which has enrolled university employees with various components of metabolic 
syndrome, including diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, overweight, hypertension, prehypertension, 
cardiovascular disease and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Their study will compare outcomes including 
healthcare costs in the interventional group to those of an observational control group (Drozek 
2020). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_631358], further study 
is needed to determine whether CHIP would be a viable population health tool from the 
perspective of a health insurance plan. It is important to note that many studies demonstrating 
various benefits of CHIP were conducted by [CONTACT_631376], which licenses CHIP (Aldana et al. 2005, 371-381; Kent et al. ). In 
addition, aside from the Rockford, Illinois CHIP RCT publications (Merrill, Taylor, and Aldana 
2008, 314-321; Aldana et al. 2005, 371-381), most CHIP studies have utilized pre-post designs 
without randomized control groups (Leibold et al. 2016, 84-91) and/or samples which may have 
been biased due to recruitment methodology (Kent et al. 2015; Shurney et al 2013; Drozek 
2020). An RCT by a research team unaffiliated with the Lifestyle Medicine Institute is needed to 
confirm the generalizability of the clinical effectiveness of CHIP and to assess CHIP’s ROI. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_631359], to our knowledge there has never been a rigorous evaluation of a

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
Version: 2/23/2023population scale implementation of CHIP intended to improve the overall health and total cost of 
care of high-risk individuals such as patients with T2DM. Specifically, both the Vanderbilt and 
Ohio University studies addressing ROI are pi[INVESTIGATOR_631360], thus making them subject to selection bias. Both of these studies rely upon 
combinations of pre-post comparisons and comparisons between presumably motivated 
intervention groups that were actively enrolled in CHIP versus non-randomized, observational 
health plan member controls, which likely represents a less motivated population (Remy et al. 
2017, 293-300; Anonymous; Drozek 2020). The lack of true randomization casts doubt upon the 
scale of ROI reported by [CONTACT_631377]. Unfortunately, implementing CHIP requires various licensing fees and per 
participant charges paid to the Lifestyle Medicine Institute, in addition to the local costs of 
administering the program. Even at large scale, CHIP can be expected to cost at least $300-$[ADDRESS_842547], it is imperative to rigorously evaluate the clinical and 
financial ROI of CHIP before implementing it at a population scale. Finally, to our knowledge 
there has never been a flexible online/in person application of CHIP. This could be an effective 
tool to bring CHIP to rural populations and might prove of general use in this era of uncertainty 
related to pandemics, climate events and other disruptions. 
In the current study, we will implement a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-scale randomized controlled trial assessing the 
effectiveness of an adaptation of CHIP which utilizes a flexible hybrid online/in-person protocol. 
We hope to assess whether this protocol, offered to Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) members, 
enables CHIP to be administered effectively to a rural population while respecting current social 
distancing limitations necessitated by [CONTACT_47098]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_631361], a comprehensive health and wellness center owned jointly by [CONTACT_631378][INVESTIGATOR_631362]. Through this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we 
hope to gain insight into whether and how such an application of CHIP could be a cost-effective 
tool for health plans such as GHP to achieve clinical and financial goals for adult members with 
T2DM. Through this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we hope to gain experience implementing CHIP at the Miller 
Center and to gain preliminary data to support efforts to obtain external funding in order to 
complete a full-scale clinical trial.

The CHIP intervention arm will be modeled after Vanderbilt’s version of CHIP with adjustments 
made to fit the needs of GHP members and current logistical limitations related to COVID-19 
(Shurney, et al., 2013). The CHIP curriculum will be administered during twice weekly 1-hour 
classes over a 6-week period, followed by [CONTACT_12884] 1-hour classes for an additional 6 weeks. The 
protocol will begin with a 1-month in-person period, with participants subsequently offered the 
choice between in-person and online attendance for the remaining sessions. The protocol will be 
flexible with contingencies for inclement weather and any necessary social distancing related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Online classes will be conducted by [CONTACT_631382] a HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Teams application.

Intervention
GHP members randomized to the intervention arm will participate in the following:
Attend 2 group meetings per week over 6 weeks, followed by [CONTACT_631383] 6 weeks (12 weeks total); meetings will be held in the evening and last 
approximately one to two hours. Meetings include:
oEducational materials presented through a small group interactive lecture format 
based on the standard CHIP curriculum, including topi[INVESTIGATOR_631353], sleep, 
exercise instruction, stress management, and toxic substance avoidance. The 
educational portion lasts approximately one hour.
oTen meetings will include a cooking demonstration and partaking in a meal 
prepared in the Cornerstone Kitchen according to The Optimal Diet, The Official 
CHIP Cookbook. Online participants will be encouraged to prepare the recipes at 
home. The group meal will last approximately one hour.
Receive a copy of The Optimal Diet, The Official CHIP Cookbook.
Receive access to online resources through CHIPHub.
Participate in virtual meetings should in-person meetings be restricted.
oParticipants will be sent the menu for meals associated with all sessions at the 
start of the class. When participants cannot attend due to pandemic restrictions, or 
if they choose to attend a meeting virtually, they will be encouraged to buy their 
own ingredients and prepare the same meal they would have been served on site 
at the Miller Center. Participants will be encouraged to prepare the meal before 
the class, post photographs and communicate via discussion board and/or video 
chat. The meeting can include discussion of participants’ experience cooking. 
oThe same interactive lectures used for in-person meetings will be used for virtual 
meetings.

least 80% of classes live (in-person or online) and to watch classes they miss within one 
week of the live event
Participants will be expected to attend in person at the Miller Center twice weekly for the 
first month, practicing appropriate social distancing measures as may be necessary at the 
time of this event. After the first month, they will have the option of attending either in-
person at the Miller Center or over Microsoft Teams for all subsequent classes except for 
the final class.
All classes can be moved to a mandatory online format in case of inclement weather 
and/or if current public health recommendations preclude in-person classes from being 
held. The facilitators will lead all classes from meeting spaces at the Miller Center. This 
decision to alter format due to weather or pandemic concerns will be made at the 
discretion of the Miller Center director
Participants will be disenrolled from the program if they request to be removed from the 
study (e.g. if they withdraw consent, if they move out of the area). The study doctor could 
decide to disenroll participants from this research study if they believe it is in the 
participant’s best interest, if a participant had two consecutive HbA1c results less than 
6.5% while off all diabetes medications, if a participant does not follow the study 
direction, if a participant is not able attend the required classes, or for any other reason
Part way through the program, the facilitators will send an email to all participants 
encouraging them to complete as much of the program as possible. It is expected that 
many, if not most, of the participants will miss at least some classes.  The facilitators will 
choose a time around the mid-point of the class to send an email reminding participants 
that materials are available online to review and to encourage those who have missed 
classes to attend the remaining classes if they are available. Participants will also be 
encouraged to eat CHIP meals from the Eat Well cookbook even if they are not able to 
attend classes 
oIf a participant reaches out indicating they do not have time to complete the entire 
curriculum, the facilitators will help the participant determine what is feasible and 
encourage partial completion of key material

whose participation is suboptimal will not be asked to disenroll unless they request to do 
so, and we will attempt to complete all biometrics, biomarkers, and surveys for these 
participants. All relevant available data will be used for all analyses except for cases 
where participants withdraw consent.
Control group
GHP members assigned to the control arm will receive the routine standard of care for GHP 
members. Members will receive a summary of diabetes-related benefits available to members 
with type 2 diabetes. Because there are slight variations in coverage between various GHP plans, 
we will provide control group members with a telephone number to inquire about their diabetes-
related benefits. We will track retention of the control group to inform design of a future fully 
powered study.
Participant Compensation
Participants will be compensated for their participation in the study as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
Version: 2/23/2023A study team member will attend the first CHIP session at the Miller Center and the last session 
to collect biometrics, biomarkers and psychometrics. Study samples (biomarkers) may also be 
collected at a Geisinger lab. All participants will also be scheduled for 6-month appointments 
with the research phlebotomist or at a Geisinger lab. The following data will be collected:
Biometrics: Weight, BMI, Waist circumference, Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
Biomarkers (blood tests): HbA1c, LDL-C
Psychometrics: Wellbeing360 survey
Current medication list
Data collection protocols will be as follows: 
Biometric, biomarker, and medication data will be collected by [CONTACT_631384] a Geisinger lab. Baseline appointments 
will be offered before and after the first scheduled class and 3-month data collection will 
occur the week of the final class. Data collection at 6-months will occur at appointments 
scheduled individually with participants. Participants will complete the Wellbeing360 
survey through CHIPHub. They will be given as much time as they need to complete the 
survey. Study staff will make up to three reminder calls to participants around the time 
they are due for each survey to encourage them to complete the surveys and assist with 
any technical difficulties. Data will be uploaded to the Lifestyle Medicine Institute’s 
HIPAA-compliant servers, with the raw data transferred to secure Geisinger servers 
within one week. Medication lists will be determined based upon a medication 
reconciliation process which will begin by [CONTACT_631385]. If a participant is not confident of his or her medication list, a study team 
member will obtain the medication list from the patient’s primary care office and/or 
review the patient’s chart in Epic to confirm medication list accuracy. The study team 
will obtain permission to access medication information for patients who are not seen 
within the Geisinger system. For participant with complex medication lists, or those 
which for any reason cannot be reconciled/entered into the database within the span of a 
standard biometric/biomarker appointment, the study team will prioritize collection of 
biomarkers and biometrics during the in-person encounter, as these need to be collected 
in-person and are especially time sensitive. For medication reconciliation and data entry

Randomization scheme: The randomization scheme will be stratified on the potential study 
participant’s most recent HbA1c value (< 6.5% vs ≥ 6.5%).
Analysis methods: Descriptive statistics and plots for each variable will be inspected to identify 
influential points and to assess normality. Non-normally distributed variables will be transformed 
(e.g., logarithmic) as appropriate for parametric analysis, otherwise non-parametric methods will 
be used. Means, standard deviations, medians, ranges (maximum/interquartile) and 95%

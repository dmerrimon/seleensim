Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m2 on days 1 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (one cycle) to constitute one therapeutic 
cycle.  On PLEX/IVIG days, carf ilzomib will be given in between PLEX and IVIG to avoid 
inadvertent blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Premedications for carfilzomib administration will be 
given as follows:  acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324543] interests of patien t care.  Preinfusion hydration with a 
one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride will be given at least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxi c AE.   Postinfusion hydration 
with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride may be giv en immediately after carfilzomib 
to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.  Concomitant therapy and clinical practice  Conventional therapy for AMR:  Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X) 1.5 plasma volumes 
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX with the exception of the 
final PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/k g will be given. On day 16, if th e IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, 
an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the IgG result is found to be 
700ml/dL or higher, the IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be 
given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324544] interests of patient care.  On days where IVIG and CFZ are given together, only one set of premedic ations will be administered. 
Conventional therapy requires an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) inse rted by [CONTACT_266655].  
Women of childbearing potential must either agree to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use an 
effective birth control method during treatment and for an addi tional [ADDRESS_324545] udy characteristics of patients.  
Univariate parametric and nonparametric assessments, where appr opriate, will be used to assess 
change from baseline in the efficacy and safety outcomes.  Kaplan-Meier method will be used to 
describe freedom from endpoints and mortality in the patients t reated with carfilzomib.  Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to visually represent the time to eve nts and overall event rate in the 
patients in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], not to compare events to any other group.

3-[ADDRESS_324548] shown that DSA is associated with se vere or recurrent acute cellular 
rejection (ACR) and lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), two forms of cellular rejection that are major 
risk factors for BOS.8,9  Moreover, detection of DSA with clinical antibody mediated re jection 
(AMR) in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266617] i s associated with higher morbidity 
compared to ACR.[ADDRESS_324549] shown an association be tween the development of 
anti-HLA Abs and/or DSA, BOS, and decreased survival.4,5,8-10  One such paper shows that anti-
HLA antibodies are associated with ACR and lymphocytic bronchio litis, two forms of cellular 
rejection that are major risk factors for BOS.8  We further investigated the relationship between 
DSA and BOS in 445 LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266618] h, over a 7-year period (2003-
2010). As shown in figure 1, DSA was associated with significan tly reduced freedom from BOS 
and decreased survival in LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266619] 3.4 ±1.6 y rs. Furthermore, we found that the 
risk of BOS was significantly increased in the DSA+ group compa red to the non-DSA group using 
a Cox proportional hazards model (HR 6.32; 95% CI 4.34-9.18; p<0.001).

DSA in lung transplantation recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266620].  
 
 
Moreover, the presence of high-grade BOS (BOS stage 2 or 3) was  significantly increased in the 
DSA+ versus the no-DSA group. Together, these data indicate tha t development of DSA is 
significantly associated with accelerated, high-grade BOS in lu ng transplantation recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], along 
with diminished patient survival. Thus, DSA and AMR are emerging as a formidable challenge in 
lung transplantation.

glomerulopathy (TG) and irreversible renal allograft failure.12 In particular, persistent complement 
binding DQ-specific DSA is associated with a 30% lower 5-year a llograft survival. In a recent large 
study in a cohort of [ADDRESS_324552]. Adriana 
Zeevi,  the presence of DSA and C1q-binding donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies at 1 year, or at 
the time of acute rejection within 1 year, was correlated with 5 year allograft survival (Figure 2). 
Patients with complement-binding DSA had significantly reduced 5-year allograft survival (54%) 
compared to those with non-complement binding DSA (93%) . C1q binding of de novo DSA was 
independently associated with graft loss whether it was detecte d in samples taken at the one year 
protocol biopsies or in samples taken during acute rejection in the first-year post-transplantation.

freedom from BOS (Figure 3A) compared to IVIG alone. These data  indicate that either IVIG alone 
or IVIG/rituximab therapy results in substantial persistence of DSA in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (35%), and is associated with significantly increased progression to BOS.

Since rituximab appears to add little to conventional therapy, proteasome inhibition with 
bortezomib alone and in combination with conventional therapy w as investigated in 6 renal 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Bortezomib-based therapy effectively tr eated 6 patients with refractory 
combined AMR/ACR and stably reduced DSA by [CONTACT_2669] 50% (figure  4, next page).14 Moreover, 
a single cycle of Bortezomib alone was as effective as Bortezom ib combined with PLEX and IVIG 
or rituximab in reducing de novo DSA.15 Of 11 patients (bortezomib alone), 4 had a 50% decrease 
in DSA, while 7 had complete remission (CR; MFI<1000) which lasted >2 years in 3/7.41 Patients 
with stable CR, had a lower serum CR at 14 months than those wi th DSA relapse –adding 
credence to the notion that successful treatment of DSA may alter outcome. Importantly proteasome inhibitors were well tolerated, and neither overall IgG nor IgG levels for childhood immunizations were changed.

  p. [ADDRESS_324558] of donor-specific ant i HLA-antibodies (DSA) and AMR on 
the early development and progression of BOS have been well-des cribed.3,13,[ADDRESS_324559] in ou r preliminary data, this needs to be 
validated with larger patient numbers. Moreover, the underlying  mechanisms of potential benefit 
remain to be elucidated.  
 
Conventional therapy for this problem, including plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins, are limited and targeted at removal of circulating antibody; not at the antibody-producing apparatus, the plasma cell.
13,23  Thus, our hypothesis is that the combination of 
conventional therapy with plasma-cell targeted therapy using th e proteasome-inhibitor 
carfilzomib in symptomatic lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266628]/stabilize allograft function and result in depletion of the immunodominan t DSA.  In this proposal, we 
will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_266629] s short-term outcomes after the 
diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection, and to identify the c ellular mechanisms that support 
these clinical benefits. Clinical and immune phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_266630].  Specifically, cellular mechanistic studies to 
detect immune system changes that will enable us to phenotype L TRs with AMR and determine 
or predict risk and outcomes, such as BOS.  Patients who have m et the clinical diagnosis of AMR 
requiring therapy will be targeted for enrollment in the study and treated with the open-label 
carfilzomib-based combination protocol.    
To execute this study, we have established the Combination Therapy with the Proteasome 
Inhibitor Carfilzomib for the Antibody-Mediated Rejection Diagn osis in Lung 
Transplantation (PI[INVESTIGATOR_266612]-Lung) Trial Study Group.  This clinical trial will be executed at the

  p. [ADDRESS_324560]-Lung investigators and the study center are highly e xperienced clinical and 
translational investigations in lung transplantation.  Successf ul completion of these specific aims 
will establish the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with carfilzomib/PLEx/IVIG for AMR after lung transplantation and elucidate important clinical and immunologic phenotypes and mechanisms associated with these outcomes.  Thus, the results of this trial will advance treatment 
efforts for AMR, which are desperately needed, as well as provi de important insights into the link 
between AMR and BOS, the latter of which significantly limits l ong-term outcomes in lung 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Lastly, we fully anticipate this study w ill lay the foundation fo r future clinical 
and basic investigation, perhaps at the multi-center level, to further delineate the role and immune 
effects of carfilzomib in the treatment of AMR and the preventi on of BOS. 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  Phase II, prospective, open-label, single-arm active treatment,  single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_266633].  
 Study site: University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_266634]:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given. On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered. If the IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered. Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324561] interests of pa tient care.  On days where IVIG and 
CFZ are given together, only one set of premedications will be administered. Conventional 
therapy requires an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) inserted by [CONTACT_266658].  
 
Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m
2 on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 to constitute one therapeutic cycle.  On 
PLEX/IVIG days, carfilzomib will be given in between PLEX and I VIG to avoid inadvertent 
blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Carfilzomib will be delivered vi a central access IV over 30 minutes 
(+15 minutes); slowed to 60 minutes (+15 minutes) if infusion reactions occur.  Carfilzomib will be diluted in a total of 80 mL dextrose 5% water (D5W) for adminis tration.  Premedications for 
carfilzomib administration will be given as follows:  acetamino phen [ADDRESS_324562] interests of patient care.  Preinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride will be given at least 
30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.   
Postinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sod ium chloride may be given 
immediately after carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE

  p. [ADDRESS_324563] represents an off label use of 
carfilzomib; thus, the criteria for phase II designation have been met.  This prospective, open-label, single-arm active treatment trial will establish the rat e of response to carfilzomib (in addition 
to conventional therapy) for AMR after lung transplantation.  T his information will be necessary 
for use in planning further larger dual-arm placebo or active t herapy controlled clinical trials.  This 
trial will enroll 30 patients at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589].  The volume of lung 
transplants performed and the rate of diagnosis of AMR at UPMC will allow for adequate 
enrollment of study patients within the 3-year study period.   
 The dosing strategy of carfilzom ib will follow that of the multiple myeloma schedule as described 
below in section 5.3.  This dosing strategy has been well-studied in patients with myeloma (see 
trial designations below) and has proven to result in an accept able AE profile for the patients with 
AMR after lung transplantation. In addition, our preliminary of f label experiences with this dosing 
strategy have yielded an acceptable AE profile in lung transpla nt recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266635].  
 
Trial designations:  Carfilzomib has been evaluated in 2 completed Phase 1 studies (PX-171-
001 and PX-171-002), 5 completed Phase 1b/2 studies (PX-171-003 , PX-

5.2 Treatment assignment  
 This is an open-label single-arm active-treatment study; thus, patients will be assigned to 
carfilzomib therapy in the order in which they are enrolled.   
5.3 Study treatment 
 Conventional therapy for AMR:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given.  On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the  IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324581] interests of patient care.  On days where IVIG 
and CFZ are given together, only one set of premedications will be administered. Conventional 
therapy requires an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) inserted by [CONTACT_266658].  
 
Conventional therapy rationale: PLEX serves two important roles  in this regimen: first, to remove 
circulating injurious DSA, and second, to turn on the plasma cell apparatus due to depletion in 
order to enhance selection of highly active cells by [CONTACT_266667].  IVIG also serves 
two purposes: first, to provide putative Ig replacement to decrease infectious complications from PLEX, and second, to blunt the rebound antibody response due to depletion.  Investigational carfilzomib will be given to enrolled patients between PLEX and  IVIG on PLEX days, and alone 
on non-PLEX days.  The rationale to insert carfilzomib between PLEX and IVIG is to avoid any 
derangements to the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) by [CONTACT_266668].  
 5.3.1 Investigational therapy 
 
Carfilzomib (in addition to conventional therapy).  Please refer to appendix D, investigators brochure for additional information regarding carfilzomib and c linical trial data.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, administration, and storage  
Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m
2 on days 1 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (one cycle) to constitute one therapeutic 
cycle.  On PLEX/IVIG days, carf ilzomib will be given in between PLEX and IVIG to avoid 
inadvertent blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Carfilzomib will be delivered via central access IV over 
30 minutes (+15 minutes); slowed to 60 minutes (+15 minutes) if infusion reactions occur.  
Protocol: PI[INVESTIGATOR_266612]‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 26 of 48  Carfilzomib will be diluted in a total of 80 mL dextrose 5% water (D5W) for administration.  
Premedications for carfilzomib administration will be given as follows:  acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324582] interests of patient care.  Preinfusion hydration with  a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride will be given at least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before 
carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.   Postinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 
mL 0.9% sodium chloride may be given immediately after carfilzo mib to minimize the nephrotoxic 
AE 
 Carfilzomib may be administered for 1-2 complete cycles in the study. A second cycle may be 
given for lack of resolution of AMR or for continued detection of DSA in the absence of allograft 
improvement.  If > one cycle is needed, the patient must still meet the enrollment criteria prior to 
the second cycle, and must not have had improvement after the f irst cycle or have experienced 
regression from initial improvement to qualify for a second study cycle.  If > two cycles are desired, 
these must be given outside of the study.  If > two cycles are desired, the third cycle must not be 
given within [ADDRESS_324583] cycle begins within this 90 day period, 
this will constitute a protocol violation.

Conventional therapy for AMR:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given. On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the  IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen [ADDRESS_324585] interests of patient care.  Conventional therapy requi res an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally  inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) 
inserted by [CONTACT_266669].   Contraception 
 
Female: 
Women of childbearing potential must either agree to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use an 
effective birth control method during treatment with carfilzomi b.  Given that carfilzomib was 
clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peri pheral blood lymphocytes, as a 
precaution, females of childbearing potential and/or their male partners should use effective 
contraception methods or abstain from sexual activity during an d for [ADDRESS_324586] to the fetus. Kyprolis (carfilzomib) should only be used during pregnancy if the 
potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  
 
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, carfilzomib can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Carfilzomib caused embryo ‐fetal toxicity in pregnant 
rabbits at doses that were lower than in subjects receiving the  recommended dose. Carfilzomib 
administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not 
teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day in rats or up to 0.8 mg/ kg/day in rabbits. If carfilzomib is 
used during pregnancy, or if the subject becomes pregnant while  taking this drug, she should 
inform the investigator or study staff immediately. The investi gator should notify [COMPANY_010] of the 
pregnancy and discuss follow ‐up with the subject. It is not known if carfilzomib will reduce the 
efficacy of oral contraceptives. Due to an increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with 
carfilzomib, subjects currently  using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception 
associated with a risk of thrombosis should consider an alterna tive method of effective 
contraception.  
Male:  
Males of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid fath ering a child while being treated 
with carfilzomib. The potential for carfilzomib to be transferred via semen and its effect on sperm are unknown. Male subjects treated with carfilzomib and/or thei r female partners (if of 
childbearing potential) should use effective contraceptive meth ods or abstain from sexual 
activity while treated with carfilzomib and refrain from donati ng sperm while on carfilzomib and

Carfilzomib is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA) to be used only in certain 
U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have tried and failed other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It has not been approved to be used for any other di sease or condition. In this study, 
carfilzomib is an investigational study drug because it is not approved for use in all patients in the 
[LOCATION_002], and it is not approved by [CONTACT_266676] (the agencies that are 
responsible for approving the use of a medicine in a country su ch as the European Medicines 
Agency and Health Canada).

  p. [ADDRESS_324601] (AE) definition 
 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with 
the use of an investigational medicinal product or other protoc ol-imposed intervention, regardless 
of attribution.   This includes the following:   
AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during c arfilzomib therapy (days 
1through 16, and 28, 42, 90), including signs or symptoms assoc iated with AMR that were 
not present prior to the AE reporting period.   Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 
 
AEs that occur prior to the assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol-
mandated intervention.   Preexisting conditions judged by [CONTACT_266677] (d ays 1through 16, and 28, 
42, 90).

Death 
 
Life threatening experience defined as any adverse experience t hat places the subject, in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of occurrence; i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more sev ere form, might have caused 
death. 
 
Requires prolongation of the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE, when, based upon app ropriate medical 
judgment, it jeopardizes the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
All AEs that do not meet these criteria should be regarded as n on-serious AEs.  
 The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. Severity refer s to the intensity of an 
AE; thus, severe AEs may not repr esent serious AEs. SAEs includ e only the above items 
that are based on patient or event outcome or action criteria associated with events that 
pose a threat to the patient’s life or vital functions and requ ire reporting to appropriate 
regulatory agencies as defined in this section.

 Have you had any new or changed heal th problems since you were  last seen?  
 These questions will be asked in person at days 28, 42 and 90 ± [ADDRESS_324610].  All AEs and SAEs, 
whether reported by [CONTACT_266678], will be recorded in the 
patient’s medical record and reported on the AE or SAE forms an d reportable SAE on the FDA 
MedWatch form.  For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigators will make an as sessment of seriousness and 
severity based on the CTCAE criteria, and causality to carfilzo mib.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_324611] be notified of the occurrence of any SAE within 24 hours of the 
investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the ev ent. The Investigator-sponsor is 
responsible for notifying the appropriate health authorities (H As), ethics committees (ECs), and 
investigators, of any expedited, annual, or other periodic safe ty reports in accordance with 
applicable regulations.  Any safety report submission will cros s reference the [COMPANY_010] 
investigational new drug (IND) or clinical trial approval (CTA)  number.  
 
The Investigator is also responsible for notifying the local EC s in accordance with local 
regulations. Additionally, the Investigator-sponsor is responsi ble for reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_010]. 
 SAE Reporting by [CONTACT_10670]-sponsor to [COMPANY_010] 
 
The Investigator-sponsor must inform [COMPANY_010] in writing by e-mail  or fax at the contact [CONTACT_266679]. Site 
will transmit the final CIOMS of that event to [COMPANY_010] within twenty-four (24) hours of submitting the report to the applicable regulatory authority. 
 
For regulatory reporting purposes, an event of “Death, Cause Unknown” from the study shall be processed as a S[LOCATION_003]R.  All forms must be completed and provided  to [COMPANY_010] in English.  
 The Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) may be referred to as an individual safety report or 
SAE Report, including Pregnancy Exposure Reports and Follow up Reports. The ICSR must be 
as complete as possible, at a minimum including event reference  number, protocol name [CONTACT_266692], investigator contact [CONTACT_3031], specific patient identifiers (e.g., initials, patient number, date of birth or age, or gender), the name [CONTACT_266693], the date and dosage(s) of

inquiries through Site for forwarding to such investigator(s). Site will be responsible to ensure such inquiries are completed and timely provided to Company.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the SAE, discharge summaries, lot numbers, relevant laboratory values, scan data a nd autopsy reports) which are  
received after the initial report must be documented on a follow-up form, and submitted to [COMPANY_010] in the same timelines as outlined above.  Sponsor shall be responsible for obtaining follow-up information for the SAEs and demonstrate diligence in attemptin g to obtain such information by, 
among other things, maintaining written records of such attempt s. 
 
Other aggregate analysis including reports containing safety da ta generated during the course of 
the study is to be submitted to [COMPANY_010] at the time the sponsor I SS submits to anybody governing 
research conduct i.e. RA, IRB etc. Final study report including  unblinding data when applicable 
and reports of unauthorized use of a marketed product to be sub mitted to [COMPANY_010] at the time the 
sponsor ISS submits to anybody governing research conduct i.e. RA, IRB etc. but not later than 
one calendar year of study completion.  
Sponsor will provide an annual IND report to [COMPANY_010]. Reports con taining safety data generated 
during the course of the study is to be submitted to [COMPANY_010] at t he time the sponsor submits to 
anybody governing research conduct, i.e. regulatory authorities  and IRBs.    Sponsor will support 
reconciliation of all ICSRs at the end of the study at a minimum. 
 
6.3.1 Diagnosis  If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the AE form rather than individual signs and/or 
symptoms.  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms  cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE. If a diagnosis is subsequen tly established, it should be 
reported as follow up information.    6.3.2 Persistent or recurrent AEs 
 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation time points.  Such events will only be recorded once unless sev erity has increased since initial 
recording.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it shall be  recorded again.  
 A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolved between patient evaluation time points and 
subsequently occurs again.  All recurrent AEs shall be recorded  again.

Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that requi re active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs.  If the lab is a sign of a disease, on ly the diagnosis needs to be 
recorded.  If the lab is not a sign of a disease, then the labo ratory value or the designated term 
should be recorded (e.g., transaminitis or ALT 1750).  Repeated  observations of the same lab 
abnormality from patient contact [CONTACT_266680] (e.g., serum creatinine of 1.8 for 2 lab draws will only be recorded 
once).   
 6.3.[ADDRESS_324613] be fulfilled.  All deaths, irrespective of cause, will be recorded as SAEs and will 
be reported to the Sponsor.  This includes death due to progression of AMR.  Cause of death, if known, shall be recorded on the FDA Medwatch form.  If deaths a re due to progression of AMR, 
progression of study disease shall be recorded as a contributing factor.  If deaths are due to study therapy, such notation shall be recorded as a contributing factor.  If death occurs, it shall be noted 
on the FDA Medwatch form whether this death was expected or une xpected.  After study 
completion (day 90), deaths due to progression of AMR shall onl y be recorded for the purposes 
of data analysis in the study.

Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Study Comparing Oral MLN9708 
Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Versus Placebo Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Adult Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Study Phase: 3
Number of Patients: Approximately [ADDRESS_86232] long-term safety data from patients who are 
continuing on ixazomib (MLN9708) and LenDex or LenDex (note the placebo capsule will be 
discontinued) because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all other study objectives 
and endpoints will be complete at the time of the final analysis and no further formal analyses will be conducted. The original lists of objectives are retained below for reference only.
Primary Objective:
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to the background therapy of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with 
relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
Key Secondary Objectives:
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
improves overall survival (OS)
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone improves the OS in high-risk patients carrying deletion del(17)
Other Secondary Objectives:
!To determine overall response rate (ORR), including partial response (PR), very good partial 
response (VGPR), and complete response (CR)
!To determine CR + VGPR
!To determine duration of response (DOR)
!To determine time to progression (TTP)
!To determine the safety of the addition of MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
!To determine pain re sponse rate, as assessed by [CONTACT_55817]-SF and analgesic use
!To assess change in global health status, functioning, and symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_4677]-reported outcome (PRO) instrument European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionn aire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and MY-20 module
!To determine the PFS and OS in high-risk cytogenetic patient groups such as translocations 
t(4;14), t(14;16), +1q, del(13), or del(17)
!To evaluate the potential relationship between response or resistance to MLN9708 treatment and proteasome and NFKB-related genes, such as PSMB1 and TRAF-3 in blood samples 
!To collect PK data to contribute to population PK analyses

5Overview of Study Design: 
This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
MLN9708 versus placebo in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who 
are treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as their standard therapy. The patient population 
will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 
1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria.
Following the Screening period, patients who will be enrolled and treated with lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone will be randomized to receive a study drug in a double-blind fashion, either 
MLN9708 or placebo. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, 
stratified by: 1 versus 2 or 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], proteasome-inhibitor (PI) exposed versus PI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve, and International Staging System (ISS) stage at screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
Patients will receive study drug (MLN9708 4.0 mg or matching placebo capsule) on Days 1, 8, and 
15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, 
and [ADDRESS_86233]. Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities. 
Patients with a low creatinine clearance ∀60 mL/min (or ∀50 mL/min, according to local 
label/practice) will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of 
a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cycles if the patient is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal function normalizes (ie, 
creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min or > 50 mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the patient 
continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily.
Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle 
intervals while they are participating in the study: twice a treatment cycle for the first 3 cycles, then 
once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if 
applicable, the PFS and OS follow-up phases of the study. As of Amendment 6, however, the primary endpoint has been met. As such, the PFS follow-up phase has been discontinued for patients 
currently receiving study therapy.
An independent review committee (IRC) will review all cases of disease response and progression. 
Response will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria for all patients every 4 weeks until disease progression. As of Amendment 6, however, because PFS 
follow-up is now completed for this study, for all patients still receiving study therapy, all central and investigator assessments of response and progression for protocol purposes are discontinued—IRC review will no longer be performed, and IRC response will no longer be assessed. 
All patients will continue to be followed for survival after progression. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_79014] 12 weeks until death or termination of the study by [CONTACT_456].

Patients continuing their current study treatment may do so until such time as other means of 
accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should complete an EOT visit and 
transition onto an alterna tive supply of (eg, commercially available) ixazomib and/or LenDex, or 
onto another standard of care treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by [CONTACT_79013].
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus LenDex will contin ue to receive ixazomib plus LenDex.  
Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will receive LenDex only; the placebo capsule will 
no longer be administered and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this 
study. Upon impleme ntation of Amendment 8, data collection requirements will be limited to 
collection of AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. Quality of life , health utilization, EQ -5D, 
and pain assessments are discontinued. Survival data will no longer be collected becau se the analysis 
of OS will be complete at the time of the final analysis. Other study assessments are no longer 
required, as noted in the new Schedule of Events. Patients will not be followed for the OS follow -up 
period because OS data are no longer being collected.
Study Population: 
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic MM and relapsed and/or refractory 
disease will be enrolled in this study .
Duration of Study:
The duration of the study, including enrollment, treatment, and follow -up, will be approximately 
81months.

201.   BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1   Scientific Background
1.1.1    Disease Under Treatment
Multiple myel oma (MM) i s a cl onal disease of pl asma cells that is characterized by [CONTACT_79019] (and other organs) and sometimes results 
in bone m arrow failure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. It constitutes 
approximately  1% of  all reported neoplasms and approximately  13% of  hematol ogic cancers 
worldwide. [1]In the Americas, Canada, and Western European coun tries, approximately 
5to 7 new cases of MM are diagnosed per 100,000 people each y ear.[
1-3] Although less 
commo n in Asian countries, MM is a growing health problem with an incidence that is 
approaching western countries and a larger populatio n base. [
4,5]In the [LOCATION_002], 
approximately  20,00 0 cases of MM are diagnosed each y ear and 10,650 deaths per y ear are 
due to the disease (approximately 2% of all cancer deaths). 
Although MM is uniformly  fatal, survival has dramat ically improved over the last [ADDRESS_86255] ivetreatment optio ns. Between 1990 and 2007, the cancer 
death rate for people wit h MM in the [LOCATION_002] decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 9% for 
males and 13% for females due to introduction of stem cell transplant and novel agents 
VELCADE®, thalido mide, and lenalido mide. [
6]Inaddition, 5 -year survival improved from 
25% in 1975 to 39% in 2006 because of the develo pment of m ore effective treatm ents. [
7]
Most patients receive mult iple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78928]; however, responses 
are transient despi[INVESTIGATOR_78929] .
Multiple myel oma is sensit ive to a number of cy totoxi c drugs such as alkylat ing agents, 
anthracyclines, and corticosteroids for init ial treatment and for relapsed disease. The last 
several years have wit nessed the introduction of several agents such as V ELCADE, 
thalido mide, and lenalidomide that have improved response, and contributed to the 
improved [ADDRESS_86256] ive agent in the pretransplant setting.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_78930], the disease remains incurable and 
there is a need for new and better agents. Patients who relapse a fter thei r initial therapy  
demonstrate vari able response to subsequent treatments with decreasing likelihood and 
durati on of  response (DOR). Patients ult imately become refractory  to approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78931]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, [ADDRESS_86257] no alternat ive treatment options. In an effort to further target the proteasome wit h 
improved activit y in MM and other cancers, Millennium has developed MLN9708, a small 
molecule 20S proteasome inhibitor.
1.1.2    MLN9708, Millennium’s Next -Generation Proteasome Inhibitor
VELCADE (bortezomib), the first -in-class, small -molecule proteasome inhibitor developed 
by [CONTACT_24312], Inc (Millennium), validated the proteasome as a therapeutic 
target. Recognizing that proteasome inhibit ion is an effect ive ant icancer therapeutic 
approach , Millennium has devel oped MLN9708 wi th the aim  of improving the 
pharmaco logy of the agent, building on the efficacy  seen wi th VELCADE in MM and other 
hematol ogic malignancies, and improving safet y and convenience of drug administration.
Like VELCADE, MLN9708 i s a m odified pepti de boroni c acid anal og. MLN9708 is the 
citrate ester of the bio logically  active di peptide boronic acid, MLN2238. MLN9708 was 
formulated to improve the chemical properties of MLN2238 for clinical delivery . MLN9708 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78932]2238 upon co ntact with either plasma or aqueous solutions. 
MLN2238 is the active form that potently, reversibly, and select ively inhibit s the 
proteasome. In contrast to VELCADE, MLN2238 demonstrates a faster dissociation rate 
from the proteasom e that m ay resul t in enh anced tum or penetrati on, exhibits ant itumor 
activit y in a broader range of tumor xenografts, and has more prolonged tissue penetration.
MLN2238 preferent ially binds the 5 site of the 20S proteasome; at higher concentrations, it 
also inhibits the activit y of the 1 and [ADDRESS_86258] ive for the proteasome 
over a panel of several proteases (IC 50values between 20 and100 M), 103 kinases 
(IC 50values > 10 M), and receptors (IC 50values > 10 M). MLN2238 and bortezomib 
have different 5 proteaso me dissociat ion terminal disposit ion half -lives (t 1/2), reflect ing 
differences in their on -off binding kinet ics (the 5 proteasome dissociat ion [t 1/2] for 
MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 minutes, respectively). Based on these favorable 
characterist ics, MLN2238 is ant icipated to be effective against MM.
1.2   Preclinical Experience
1.2.1    Nonclinical Pharmacology: In Vivo Studies
Antitumor activit y was observed wi th MLN2238 in 4 xenograft models: CWR22 (a human 
prostate cancer cell line), WSU -DLCL2, OCI- Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX -22L (3 human 
lympho ma cell lines). In contrast, bortezomib demonstrated weaker antitumor activit y in

22these latter 3 lymphom a models, dem onstrating that MLN2238 has improved activit y in 
nonclinical models co mpared to bortezomib. MLN2238 t reatment demonstrated an 
improved tumor pharmacodynamic response compared to bortezomib in WSU -DLCL2 
human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenografts. WSU- DLCL2 xenografts from 
MLN2238 -treated mice displayed greater tumor 20S proteasome inhibit ion compared to 
xenografts fro m bortezomib -treated mice and demonstrated increased downstream 
biological  effects, as determined by [CONTACT_79020] n. 
MLN2238 -treated xenografts displayed higher and more sustained 20S proteasome 
inhibit ion and increased downstream  biological  effects as determined by  [CONTACT_79021] 34 (GADD34) and Activat ing Transcript ion Factor -3 (ATF -3 levels). 
MLN2238 demo nstrated both an improved efficacy pro file and pharmacodynamic response 
compared to bortezomib.

The em erging safet y profile indicates that oral MLN9708 is generally well tolerated with 
manageable and reversible treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or adverse 
reacti ons. As noted in Table 1-1, the m aximum  tolerated dose (MTD) has been established 
in 1 trial administering MLN9708 twice -weekly (Study  C16003, relapsed/refractory  
multiple myelo ma [RRMM]) and in 2 trials administering MLN9708 weekly as a single

As of 12 October 2011, 2 ongoing phase 1 clinical trials were investigating oral MLN9708 
in RRMM: Study  C16003 and Study  C16004. Both studi es have co mpleted the phase 1 
porti on of  the study  and pati ents are enrolling into defined expansion cohorts: relapse d and 
refractory  multiple myel oma, VELCADE relapsed, proteasome inhibitor naïve, or 
carfilzo mib exposed. 
Study C16003 Single -agent; Twice -Weekly MLN9708
Study  C16003 has enro lled 56 patients. These patients are heavily pretreated as evidenced 
by a median number of 4 (range 1–28) pri or lines of therapy  with 47% ref ractory  to the last 
line of therapy .
[8]Patients have received a median of 3.5 cy cles of therapy  (range 1 -23). Six 
patients have achieved at least a partial response (PR) (1 complete response [CR] and 5 
PRs); addit ionally 1 patient and 28 patients achieved minor response (MR) and durable 
disease stabilizat ion for up to 12.9 months, respectively .
[8]
In Study  C16003, 1 of 3 patients experienced a protocol -defined dose -limit ing toxicit y 
(DLT) (Grade 3 rash) at a dose of 2.23 mg/m2. An addi tional patient at this dose experienced 
Grade 4 thrombocy topeni a (platelet count of 10,000/mm3). After a di scussio n with the 
participat ing investigators, an intermediate y et lower dose was evaluated as allowed in the 
C16003 protocol and supported by  [CONTACT_79022] (PK) data to further 
characterize dose -related toxici ties. Six pati ents were treated at the intermediate dose of

In Study  C16005, MLN9708 is given weekly  (Days 1, 8, and 15) in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide (Days 1 -21) and dexamethasone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28 -day cycle. 
Enrollment to the phase 1 portion of the study  is com plete, wi th enrollment open to the 
phase 2 portion. This study  has enrolled 15 patients as of the clinical data cut ([ADDRESS_86271] 2011) 
to 4 dose cohorts. No DLTs were seen at doses up to 2.23 mg/m2. Three of 3 patients tr eated 
at the 3.95 mg/m2dose cohort experienced Grade 3 nausea and vomit ing despi[INVESTIGATOR_78934]-emet ic therapy; 1 of which addit ionally  experienced Grade 2 syncope and in another 
patient the dose of lenalido mide was compro mised such that they received < 80% of the 
planned doses. As per protocol, subsequent patients were treated at 1 dose level below 
(2.97 mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (Grade 3 rash). The MTD of weekly  
MLN9708 in co mbinat ion with a 28 -day cycle of lenalidomide and dexameth asone was 
established at 2.97 mg/m2. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) estimat ion was 
established fo llowing evaluat ion of the available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial 
which included, but was not limited to analyses of efficacy results and tox icity 
characterizat ion (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral neuropathy , and treatment 
discontinuat ion). Based on this review the RP2D dose was determined to be 2.23 mg/m2in 
this combinat ion schedule. The clinical development of MLN9708 included a p opulation PK 
analysis evaluat ing the feasibilit y of switching f rom body surface area (BSA)- based dosing 
to fixed dosing. [10] The results of this analysis support the transit ion from BSA -based

Clinical Trial Safety Experience: Pooled IV and Oral Formulation
The potential risks reported with MLN9708 use, pooled fro m both IV and oral formulat ions, 
were ant icipated based on preclinical data and previous experienc e with VELCADE and are 
noted i n the MLN9708  IB and informed consent form (ICF) documents. The ty pe of TEAE 
reported is consistent, regardless o f the MLN9708 formulat io n, even though there are some 
differences in the frequency an
d severit y of the reported e vents. While the predominant 
potenti al  toxicities m ay be severe in so me cases, they are largely reversible and can be 
managed by [CONTACT_79023], which may 
include dose reductions and supportive care. Please refer to the IB

1.4   Study Rationale
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_78935]  (IMi D) agents thalidomide and lenalidomide in both previously  
untreated and treated patients with MM, the disease remains incurable. [14] Although 
multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78936], the frequent rel apses that characterize 
this disease highlight a need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78937] m prior treatm ents have 
failed . This study  is designed to determine whether adding MLN9708 to abackground
therapy  of lenalidomide and dexamethasone will improve the clinical outcomes of pat ients 
with RRMM.
1.4.1    Rationale for the Combination of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexametha sone
Clinical data support the combinat ion of a proteasome inhibitor, an IMiD, and a 
glucocorti costeroi d. The combinat ion of bortezomib, lenalido mide, and low- dose 
dexamethasone, as noted in clinical studies and theNational  Com prehensive Cancer 
Network ( NCCN) guidelines, illustrates that this combinat ion is very act ive and well 
tolerated in the MM populat ion.[15-18] From  a clinical perspect ive, adding proteasome 
inhibitors to lenalidomide and dexamethasone has demonstrated significant synergist ic 
effects. [
8,17]
Recognizing that proteasome inhibit ion is an effective ant
icancer therapeutic approach , 
Millennium developed MLN9708, which is a modified dipept ide boronic acid proteasome 
inhibitor similar to VELCADE ,with the aim  of improving the pharmaco logy of the agent

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
32and improving drug administration, while building on the efficacy  seen wi th VELCADE . 
Given that MLN9708 has improved binding kinet ics and a similar pharmaco logic profile 
compared wi th VELCADE, i t is expected that these differences will translate into simil ar, if 
not improved, efficacy and safety  profiles. [19] Nonclinical work by [CONTACT_79024]9708 in combinat ion with lenalido mide and 
dexamethasone based on their results reporting that MLN2238 combined with lenalido mide 
or dexamethasone triggers synergistic ant i
-MM activit y.[20]
In term s of safet y, the toxi cological profile of MLN2238 in nonclinical studies is generally
consistent with class -based effects of proteasome inhibit ion and is similar to what has been 
reported previously in nonclinical studies wit h bortezomib. The most commo n TEAEs, 
regardl ess of causalit y, of single -agent MLN9708 across all dose level cohorts in all 
phase 1studi es reported to date, as discussed in Section 1.3,
 were anti cipated based on 
preclinical data and previous experience with bortez omib. Given the available data, the 
similar nonclinical toxicit y profile between MLN2238 and bortezomib, and the toxicit ies 
demonstrated in studies with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and the low potential for 
drug-drug interactions, it is ant icipated that any potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_78938] a 
combinat ion of MLN9708, lenalido mide, and dexamethasone can be mo nitored in the clinic 
with routine clinical observations and laboratory  tests.
Patients enrolled in both arms of C16010 will receive lenalidom ide and dexamethasone, one 
of several  regimens recommended by  [CONTACT_79025] (IMWG) 
as well as the NCCN. While init ial data from ongoing trials are promising regarding the 
addition of  bortezomib to thi s regimen, longer fo llow up an d data from  rando mized phase III 
studi es are still needed before bortezomib is broadly  incorporated i nto treatm ent 
recommendat ions.[21]
This study  is proposed based on the results of VELCADE in previously treated MM, [
22]the 
emerging activit y seen wi th MLN9708 in the treatment of previously  treated and u ntreated 
MM (see Section
 1.3), and the urgent need for better treatment options for this incurable 
disease. This study  is designed to determine the efficacy and safet y of MLN9708 wi th 
lenalido mide and dexamethasone, compared wi th lenalido mide and dexamethasone alone in 
patients wi th relapsed and/or refractory  MM . The primary  purpose of this study  is to 
determine the progression -free survival of pat ients in the 2 treatment groups.

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, [ADDRESS_86280] imated MTD is 2.97 mg/m2with DLTs of transient rash, nausea, and vo miting. 
Given that the weekly schedule o f MLN9708 co mbines well with the established 28 -day 
lenalido mide plus low -dose dexamethasone regimen providing a simple course of therapy  
for pati ents, Study  C16005, a phase 1/ 2 study  of weekly MLN9708 plus a 28 -day cycle of 
lenalido mide (25 mg on Day s 1-21) and dexamethasone (40 mg weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22) was init iated. 
In the phase 1 portion of Study  C16005, 3 evaluable patients were enrolled in each of the 
following dose cohorts: Cohort 1 (1.68 mg/m2), Cohort 2 (2.23 mg/m2), and Cohort 3 
(2.97 mg/m2), respectively. There were no DLTs noted for any  of these patients during 
Cycle 1. Three evaluable patients were enro lled in Cohort 4 (3.95 mg/m2). DLTs were noted 
during Cycle 1 for 3 out of 3 patients in Cohort 4 at the 3.95- mg/m2dose l evel. The DLTs 
were Grade 3 faint ing/passing out, nausea, vo miting, and di arrhea. Per protocol, dosing at 
the 3.95 -mg/m2dose l evel was stopped. Since 6 patients were not enrolled at the previous 
dose l evel (2.97 mg/m2), 3 addi tional patients were enrolled at this lower dose. One of the 
additional 3 pati ents had a DLT of Grade 3 rash during Cycle 1. Therefore, DLTs were 
noted for 1 out of 6 patients enro lled at the 2.97 -mg/m2dose l evel; a ccording to the protocol, 
2.97 mg/m2was determined as MTD. 
The clinical data were evaluated for the available phase 1 data, which included the analyses 
of efficacy results (response rates: PR, VGPR, and CR) and toxicit y characteri zation 
(Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral neuropathy, dose holding, and treatment 
discontinuat ion). Cy cle1 data from  15 evaluable patients were reviewed, as well as the 
available clinical data supporting tolerance over mult iple treatment cycles. AEs that met 
DLT criteria in Cycle 2 and bey ond were considered, and toxicit ies leading to dose 
modificati on in Cycle 2 and bey ond were al so consi dered.
Six patients were enro lled at the 2.97 -mg/m2dose level. All 6 patients received all doses o f 
MLN9708 and dexamethasone during Cycle 1. However, 3 out of 6 patients were not able to

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
34receive all o f their lenalidomide doses during Cycle 1 due to Grade 2 or 3 rash. Three 
patients were enrolled at the 2.23 -mg/m2dose l evel. All 3 pati ents received all doses of 
MLN9708, dexamethasone, and lenalido mide during Cycles 1 through 3, except 1 patient 
who did not receive 1 dose of dexamethasone during Cycle 2. After 4 cycles of treatment, 
the pati ents enrolled at 2.23 mg/m2achieved responses of CR, PR, and VGPR, respectively. 
All 3 pat ients achieved PR after Cy cle 1, 2 of them achieved VGPR after Cy cle 2, and CR 
after Cycle 4 and Cycle 5. Given that the dose of MLN9708 at 2.97 mg/m2significant ly 
compromised the doses of the lenalidomide and dexamethasone background regimen, and 
that the dose of 2.23 mg/m2is very tolerable and clinically  active, the clinical team has 
proposed to use 2.23 mg/m2as the dose for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trial. More data will be 
gained fro m the phase 2 cohort of the ongoing C16005 study , in which pat ients will receive 
MLN9708 at 2.23 mg/m2. 
This recommended starting dose of 2.23 mg/m2is translated into a fixed dose of 4.0 mg 
based on the results fro m the popul ation PK analysis. At init iation of clinical development of 
MLN9708, early phase 1 clinical studies empi[INVESTIGATOR_78939] a BSA -based dosing approach that 
has been traditionally used in the development of cytotoxic anticancer agents. Accordingly, 
dosing of MLN9708 in individual pat ients was BSA -scaled (in m g/m2) in Study  C16005 and 
in 4 ongo ing single -agent tri als (Studi es C16001, C16002, C16003, and C16004). However, 
it is well known that the clearance of small mo lecule drugs is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_78940] a linear function 
of BSA and the appropriateness of tradit ional BSA -scaled approaches for dosing ant icancer 
agents has been crit ically quest ioned in the recent scientific literature. [23-26]
Therefore, a preliminary populat ion PK analysis was performed for MLN9708 based on the
available data fro m 4 ongoing phase 1 studies to quant itatively assess the contribut ion of 
interpat ient variability in BSA to the overall interpatient variabilit y in clearance of 
MLN9708, and thereby  [CONTACT_79026] y of switching from  BSA -based do sing to fixed 
dosing in future clinical development. A population PK model was built using data fro m 
both the twice -weekly and once -weekly  IV (n =86) and oral  (n=51) dosing regimens 
(N=137). Populat ion PK analysis showed that MLN9708 PK can be well de scribed by  a 
3-compartment m odel with linear eliminat ion for IV data and with an addit ional absorption 
compartment (first order absorption) for oral data. Covariate analyses indicate that 
interpat ient variability in BSA, and/or body  weight did not signific antly contribute to the 
variabilit y in clearance (CL) and vo lume of distribution (V2) in the central co mpartment. 
Clearance and vol ume of distribut ion in the central compartment (V2) are the PK parameters 
that will affect AUC and single -dose m aximum  (peak) concentration (C max). The l ack of  a 
discernable rel ationship between BSA and MLN9708 clearance based on data in

MLN9708

35137patients over a relat ively wide BSA range (1.4 -2.6m2) indicates that total systemic 
exposure (AUC) fo llowing fixed dosing should be indepe ndent of the individual pat ient’s 
BSA (see Figure 1-1). Therefore, BSA is not expected to affect C maxor AUC after IV or oral 
dosing, and thus fixed do sing is appropriate for both oral and IV routes of administration. 
The clinical development of MLN9708 has therefore transit ioned fro m use of BSA -based 
dosing to fixed dosing in all recent ly initiated phase 1/2 studies (eg, Studies C16007, 
C16008, and C160
09).
Accordingly , the starti ng dose of MLN9708 in the proposed phase 3 study  is a fixed dose of 
4.0mg, based on the recommended dose of 2.23 mg/m2(using mean patient BSA of 1.86 m2
from the 2208 pati ents wi th MM in VELCADE clinical trials for conversio n to a fixed 
dose).

36genes mappi[INVESTIGATOR_78941] 1 [27-29 ]or to outcome after single -agent VELCADE 
therapy ).[30,31] These studies highlight links between TRAF3, a key regulator of the NFKB 
pathway , and protein synthesis wit h clinical sensit ivity and resistance respect ively to 
VELCADE. A recent whole geno me sequencing study  of MM pati ents reported the presence 
of mutations in known cancer genes that had either not previously  been reported in MM 
such as BRAF, or that were present at much higher frequency in MM than previously 
reported (KRAS, NRAS). [
32]Similar studies with samples from VELCADE clin ical trials 
highlighted the link between mutations in these pathways and response to proteasome 
inhibitor. [
33]
In thi s clinical study , a screening tumor sample will be collected from each pat ient to test the 
link between clinical outcomes and the presence of specific gene mutations o f the RAF/RAS 
pathway , as well  as to test if express ion of NFKB or protein synt hesis gene signatures are 
related to the efficacy o f the MLN9708 -based co mbinat ion. This hypothesis will be tested in 
all patients. Addit ional analyses of tumor mo lecular characteristics may be done to ident ify 
biomarkers linked to clinical outcomes in this study . These tum or analyses may  include but 
are not limit ed to gene expressio n, DNA mutations, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_78942]. Similar 
analyses will be done in tumor samples fro m patients who init ially responded to therapy  and 
subsequent ly relapsed.
Recent data also ident ify host vari ation, specifically germline DNA variants in proteasome 
subunit s [34] and the NFKB p athway  [ 35]as important contributors to VELCADE clinical 
activit y. A blood sam ple will  be collected at screening in order to te st if specific 
polymorphisms in proteasome -
related genes are associated with MLN9708 efficacy. 
Variants in NFKB -related genes will also be assessed, as they  may relate to the activat ion of 
the NFKB pathway in the tumor or in the host microenvironment, impa cting the growth, 
survival, and/or drug resistance o f a given patient’s myelo ma. Addit ional associations with 
either the efficacy  or saf ety of MLN9708 m ay be examined if there is a reasonable approach 
to identify myelo ma pat ient populations with different ial risk to benefit rati os upon 
treatm ent wi th MLN9708.
Circulat ing proteasome levels have been demonstrated to be an independent prognostic 
factor in MM pat ients with increasing circulat ing proteasome levels correlat ing with 
advance disease. [36]Given that MLN9708 directly targets the 20S proteasome, this leads to 
the possibilit y that pretreatm ent ci rculat ing proteasome levels may be relevant for predict ion 
of patient response to therapy . Retrospective analysis of baseline proteasome levels from 
clinical trial samples for patients treated with bortezo mib in co mbinat ion with melphalan

37and prednisone demo nstrated that circulat ing proteaso me levels were associated with both 
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) only for bortezomib -containing 
therapy  leading to the possibilit y that hi gh-circulating protesom e levels coul d be both a poor 
prognosti c and also a specific marker of poor outcome with bortezomib. These data point to 
the potenti al value of further exploring the relat ionship between predose circulat ing 
proteasome levels and respon se to MLN9708. In this study , a bl ood sam ple will be collected 
at screening in order to test the levels o f circulat ing proteasome and its associat ion to 
MLN9708 efficacy .
1.4.4    Rationale for the Combination of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexamethasone in a Hi gh-Risk Patient Population 
The clinical outcome of relapsed myelo ma is highly variable and can be related to specific 
cytogeneti c subt ypes. Abnormalit ies such as t(11;14), t(6;14), and hy perdi ploidy are 
associ ated wi th neutral  or favorabl e prognosi s while t(4;14), t(14;16), delet ion(17p), and 
amplificat ion of 1q impart an unfavorable prognosis. [37] Recently Klein et al and Bahlis 
etal have described the outcome of these subt ypes in the context of patients with relapsed or 
refractory  MM treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Both del(17) and 
amplificat ion 1q21 were associated with significantly worse PFS and OS, and the median 
OS for the del(17) patients was only  6.7months.[38]Two recent reports showed that 
bortezo mib-based treatment improves outcome in patients with MM including patients with 
high-risk chro mosomal aberrati ons). [
39,40] Patients with del(17) had a notable benefit. The 
median PFS time was 26.[ADDRESS_86282] 
arm (p = 0.024), while the 3
-year OS rate in this subt ype improved fro m 17% to 69% 
(p=0.028). After mult ivariate analysis, del(17) was an independent predictor for PFS 
(p<0.0001) and OS (p <0.0001) only in the bortezomib arm. In light of these observat ions, 
this study  will assess the outcome of pat ients with del(17) RRMM to determine if addit ion 
of MLN9708 to l enalido mide and dexamethasone improves PFS and OS.

MLN9708 capsules and placebo capsul es will  be subsequent ly referred to as study drug.
4.1   Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, m ulticenter study  to eval uate the safet y and 
efficacy  of MLN9708 versus placebo in pat ients wit h relapsed and/or ref ractory  MM who 
are treated with lenalido mide and dexamethasone as their standard therapy. The patient 
popul ation will consist of adult men and wo men who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, 
who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy , and who m eet other e ligibilit y criteria (see 
Secti on 5). Approximately  [ADDRESS_86286] for up to 28 day s prior to 
rando mizat ion. An MPI/designee clinician will confirm pat ient eligibilit y prior to 
rando mizat ion. Determinat ion of disease progression as an entry criterion may be based 
on pati ent data obtained during or following the patient’s most recent prior 
antineoplastic therapy.
Following the Screening period, patients who will be enrolled and treated with 
lenalido mide plus dexamethasone will be rando mized to receive a study  drug in a 
doub le-blind fashio n, either MLN9708 or pl acebo. Eligible patients will be rando mized 
in a 1:1 rati o into those 2 treatm ent arms, stratified by : 1 versus 2 or 3 pri or therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], 
proteasome -inhibitor exposed versus proteasome -inhibitor naïve, and ISS stage at 
screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
Patients will  receive study  drug (MLN9708 4.0mg or m atching pl acebo capsul e) on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalido mide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone 
(40 m g) on Day s 1, 8, 15, and [ADDRESS_86287]. Dose modificat ions 
may be made based on toxicit ies. Patients with a low creatinine clearance 60 m L/min 
(or 50 mL/min, according to local label/pract ice) will receive a reduced lenalido mide 
dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of a 28- day cycle. The lenalidomide 
dose m ay be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cy cles if the pati ent is not responding

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, [ADDRESS_86288] ion norm alizes (i e, creatinine 
clearance > 60 mL/min or > 50mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the patient 
continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalido mide may then be escalated to 25 mg once 
daily .
Treatment periods will be defined as 28 -day cycles. Pati ents will  be seen at regular 
treatm ent cycle intervals while they  are parti cipat ing in the study : twice a treatm ent 
cycle for the first 3 cy cles, then once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their 
participat ion in the active trea tment and, if applicable, the PFS (every  4 weeks) and OS 
(every  12 weeks) follow -up phases of the study . As of Amendment 6, the primary  
endpo int has been met; as such, the PFS fo llow-up phase no longer applies to patients 
currently receiving study  therapy  or to any  patients who have discont inued treatment for 
reasons other than PD. However, all pat ients will continue to be fo llowed for survival.
Patients will  be assessed for disease response and progression by  [CONTACT_26708]. Response will 
be assessed according to the IMWG criteria for all patients every [ADDRESS_86289] igator 
assessments of respo nse and progression for protocol purposes will be discont inued —
IRC review will no longer be performed, and IRC response will no longer be assessed.
All patients will cont inue to be fo llowed for survival after progression or after 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent for reasons other than progression. Patients will be 
contact[CONTACT_457]  12weeks unt il death or terminat ion of the study  by [CONTACT_456].
Pain evaluat ion (using the BPI -SF) will include quant ified assessments of intensit y, 
frequency  and durati on, degree of disco mfort, locati on, and likely relationship to MM 
(versus prior therapy  or com orbidi ties). Time to pain progression will be based on pain 
assessments using the worst pain item on the BPI -SF rated on a scale from 0 to 10, 
collected as outlined in the Schedule ofEvents .
Health-related qualit y of life (QOL) will also be evaluated through patient self -reported 
instrum ents including the EORTC QLQ -C30, MY -20, and the EQ -5D generic healt h 
status measure. In addit ion to assessing selected symptoms, these instruments elucidate 
the effects of disease on physical, social, psycho logical/em otional, and cogni tive 
funct ioning.

14June 2010.
Unscheduled visits may  occur between treatm ent cycles as required. For example, 
symptom atic pain progressio n should result in an interim unscheduled visit, as would 
ongoing Grade 3 or worse AEs.
Patients will  attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit approximately [ADDRESS_86290] study  
assessments besides safet y are discontinued to eas e the burden of protocol -mandated 
assessments on patients.
Patients continuing their current study  treatm ent may  do so until  such time as other m eans of 
accessing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should co mplete an EOT 
visit and transi tion onto an al ternative supply o f (eg, commercially  available) ixazo mib 
and/or LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment. Discont inued patients will be 
treated by  [CONTACT_79033].
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plu s LenDex will cont inue to receive ixazo mib plus 
LenDex. Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will receive LenDex only; the 
placebo capsule will no longer be administered and patients receiving placebo will not be 
crossed over to ixazo mib in this study . Upon im plementati on of  Amendment 8, data 
collect ion requirements will be limited to collect ion of AEs, SAEs, local laboratory

healt h care utilizat ion, EQ -5D,and pain assessments are discont inued. Survival data will no 
longer be co llected because the analysis of OS will be complete at the time of the final 
analysis. Other study  assessments are no longer required, as noted in the new Schedule o f 
Events. Patient s will not be fo llowed for the OS follow- up peri od because OS data are no 
longer being co llected.
Three interim analyses (IAs) have been planned during the study . The first will occur when 
approximately  [ADDRESS_86291] two IAs, OS will be tested; however, the study  will 
not be stopped for OS efficacy or futilit y due to the predicted small number of death events 
at the first IA. 
As of Amendment 8, the [ADDRESS_86292] been performed. The primary analysis (data cutoff date, 
30 October 2014) occurred when 286 patients had experienced disease pr ogressi on or death; 
at this analysis, the primary endpo int of PFS was met. The next analysis (data cutoff date, 12 
July 2015) occurred when [ADDRESS_86293] IA (data cutoff date, 25 
October 2017) occurred when 333 deaths had been reported. The thresho ld for stati stical 
significance was not m et and the study  was to continue to the final analysis. The final 
analysis occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
An independent data monitoring co mmittee (IDMC) will revi ew safet y and efficacy  data at

Dexamethasone will be given as an oral dose of 40 mg/day weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
of a 28 -day cycle.
Dexamethasone should be taken at approximately the same t ime pr eferably  with food/milk 
to avoid stomach irritation. If a dose of dexamethasone is missed, the dose should be taken 
as soon as the patient remembers it. If enough time has elapsed that it is almost time for the 
next dose (within 6 hours), the missed dose s hould be skipped and the next dose taken 
according to the regular dosing schedule. A double dose should not be taken to make up for 
a missed dose. If the patient vomit s after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose 
but shoul d resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.

previous dose(s) according to the Schedule ofEvents. Toxi cities are to be assessed 
according to the NCI Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 
4.03. Each adverse event should be attributed to a specific drug, if possi ble, so that the dose 
modificati ons can be made accordingly . Only  1 dose adj ustment per cy cle will be performed 
for a given agent when toxicit y is suspected to be related primarily to that agent. Reduction 
of 1 agent and not the other is appropriate if the toxici ty is suspected to be related primarily  
to 1 of the agents. Dose reduction of mult iple agents may be considered after consultat ion 
with the Millennium clinician/study  clinician designee. Guidelines for dose modificat ion 
within cycles are provided in Sections 6.4.[ADDRESS_86315] ion

Further cl arificat ion can be obtained in consultat ion with the Millennium clinician/study  
clinician designee. If mult iple toxicit ies are noted, the dose adjust ments and/or delays should 
be made according to the most severe toxicit y guidelines. 
Alternat ive dose modificat ions may be recommended after discussio n with the invest igator 
and MPI [CONTACT_30223]/designee in order to maximize exposure of study  treatm ent while

standard of care/local pract ice.
Thromboembolism Prophyla xis
While on lenalido mide, patients should be on routine thromboprophylaxis. [45]Prophylact ic 
therapy  with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 -325 m g PO once daily ) or LMWH (equivalent to enoxaparin 
40mg subcutaneous [SQ] per day ) per published standard or inst itutional standard of care is 
requi red for all  patients to prevent thromboembo lic complicat ions that may occur with 
lenalido mide ‑based regimens in co mbination wit h dexamethasone. Thromboprophylaxis 
according to the American Societ y of Clinical  Oncology (ASCO) gui delines or inst itutional 
standard of care is recommended. [46]
Nausea and/or Vomiti ng
Prophylaxis wit h standard ant iemetics, including serotonin [ADDRESS_86337] ious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be maintained to 
avoid dehydration. Any fluid deficit occurring during treatment should be prompt ly 
corrected.
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
Rash has been reported with both lenalido mide and MLN9708. The lenalido mide induced 
rash is characterized as generalized, maculopapular, morbilliform, urticarial, papular, often 
with pruri tus, and is noted as a warning/precaution in the lenalido mide package 
insert. [43,47,48] Serious skin react ions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndro me, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_78948], and erythema mult iforme have been reported. Lenalido mide interruption or

69discontinuat ion shoul d be considered as described in the package insert (PI)/ summary  of 
product characteristics (SmPC). [43]
Rash may  range from  limited erythematous areas, macular or small papular bumps that may 
or may not be pruri tic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption that is 
predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. Rash has been most commonly characterized as 
maculopapular or macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported 
within the first 3 cy cles of therapy . The rash is often transient and self -limit ing and i s 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_78949] 1 or 2 in severit y. As in many other oncology  trials, rash may  occur in 
patients receiving placebo and in patients receiving MLN9708. If rash occurs, considerat ion 
shoul d be given to al ternate causes of the rash such as concomitant medications, infections, 
etc; these other causative agents should be discont inued and alterative agents considered if 
medically necessary
.
Symptom atic m easures such as ant ihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically  in subsequent cy cles. 
The use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] , IV, or oral  steroid (eg, prednisone 10 m g per day  or equivalent [see 
Secti on 15.5]) is permitted. 
Management of a Grade 3 rash may require IV ant ihistamines or corticosteroids. 
Administrati on of  MLN9708 (and/or other causative agent if given in combinat ion) shoul d 
be modified per protocol and re- initiated at a reduced level fro m where rash was noted (also, 
per protocol). In line with clinical pract ice, dermatolog y consult and biopsy of Grade [ADDRESS_86338] ic measures should also 
be considered if a patient has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free 
emollient cream on dry  areas of the body  or oral  or topi [INVESTIGATOR_12669]). 
The rare risks of Stevens -Johnson syndro me, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_78950], drug reaction with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), and pemphigus vulgaris have 
been reported in oncology  studi es when MLN9708 (or placebo) was given wit h concomita nt 
medicat ions that are known to cause rash (eg, Bactrim, lenalido mide, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]), and/or in the 
setting of confounding TEAEs. These severe, potent ially life-threatening or deadly 
condi tions may  involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be c linically  
managed according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological 
analysis are encouraged at the discretion of the investigator. Study  medicati ons shoul d be 
discontinued in the event of severe, potentially life -threatening rash . Addit ional informat ion 
regarding these reactions can be found in the IB.

Lenalido mide or study  drug administration should be modified as per dose modificat ion 
recommendat ions in theprotocol  when thrombocy topeni a occurs (see Table 6-1). Therapy  
can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platelet counts. Thrombotic 
microangiopathy  (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocy topeni a purpura and hemo lytic 
uremic syndrome, are rare, serious blood disorders that cause low levels o f platelets and red 
blood cells and result in blood c lots in small blood vessels. Symptoms may include fat igue, 
fever, bruising, nose bleeds, and decreased urinat ion. These disorders, including fatal cases, 
have been reported in patients receiving MLN9708. If TMA is suspected, consider 
withdrawal  of the suspected causat ive agent and manage according to standard medical 
practi ce. 
Neutropenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol  with addi tional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutrop enia may be severe but has 
been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to 
standard clinical pract ice. Lenalido mide or study drug administration should be modified as 
noted as per dose modificat ion recommendat ions in theprotocol when neutropeni a occurs 
(see Table 6-2). Therapy  can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of absolute 
neutrophil counts .
Fluid Deficit
Dehydr ation shoul d be avo ided since lenalido mide is substant iallyexcreted by  [INVESTIGATOR_22875] , and 
MLN9708 may  cause vomi ting, di arrhea ,and dehydrati on. Acute renal failure has been 
reported in patients treated with MLN9708, commonly in the setting of the previously not ed 
gastrointestinal toxicit ies and dehydration. Fluid deficit should be prom ptlycorrected before 
initiation of study drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration (see 
Secti on6.8).
Hypotension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope have been 
reported with MLN9708. Blood pressure should be closely monitored as per standard of care

71while the patient is on study  treatm ent and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, 
especially  in the setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomit ing, di arrhea, or 
decreased appet ite. Pati ents taking m edicat ions and/or diuret ics to manage thei r blood 
pressure (for either hypo -or hy pertensio n) shoul d be managed according to standard clinical 
practi ce, including considerat ions for dose adj ustments of their conco mitant m edicat ions 
during the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study  drug 
and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydrat ion.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported with MLN9708. 
This condit ion is usually transient and re versible. Itis characterized by [CONTACT_12704], seizures, 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_79038] (MRI) or com puted tom ography  (CT) . If the syndro me is 
diagnosed or suspected, sympt om-directed treatm ent shoul d be maintained unt il the 
condi tion is reversed by  [CONTACT_79039] n or other inst igating factors. 
Transverse Myelitis
Transverse myelit is has been reported with MLN9708. It is not known whether MLN9708 
causes transverse m yelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving MLN9708, 
the possibilit y that MLN9708 may  have contributed to transverse myelit is cannot be 
excluded. Transverse myelit is should be managed according to standard medical practice.
Overdose
An ove rdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual 
subject according to the study  protocol . If overdose occurs, consider close obs ervati on

issue is the same regardless of the study  drug assignment, the blind should not be broken. 
The event requiring breaking the blind must be documented in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF), including the date the blind was broken. In addit ion, the pati ent will be 
discontinued fro m further study  drug administrati on in this study .
The final analysis data cutoff has been conduct ed and as such, the study  is considered 
complete for stati stical analysis purposes. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, the 
investigator will unblind all patients remaining on study  treatm ent and will fo llow the new 
Schedule of Events presented in this ame ndment. Only patients who continue to demonstrate 
clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study  drugs will cont inue 
on the study . Pati ents continuing their current study  treatm ent m ay do so until  such time as 
other m eans of access ing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should 
complete an EOT vi sit and transi tion onto an al ternat ive supply o f (eg, commercially 
available) ixazo mib and/or LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment. 
Discontinued pati ents will  be treated by  [CONTACT_79043] l ocal standard of care. Patients 
who are receiving ixazo mib plus LenDex will continue to receive ixazo mib plus LenDex.

assessments for the patient, loc al hematol ogy and chemistry  laboratory  resul ts may  be used; 
however, samples must still be sent to central labs also. Local laboratory  evaluat ions may be 
done m ore frequently at the investigator’s discret ion, ie for acute m anagement of TEAEs. In 
general, l ocal laboratory  resul ts of safet y will not need to be entered into the eCRF. Local 
laboratory  evaluat ions should be entered into the eCRF only if required to document an AE, 
dose m odificat ion, or other event, and the informatio n entered should be limited t o that 
requi red to understand the event (eg, for a dose hold for thrombocy topeni a, enter the pl atelet 
count only). Handling and shipment of central clinical laboratory  samples are outlined in the 
Study  Manual.
As the centralized laboratory  resul ts may not be available at the init iation o f the next cycle, 
it is not required that these centralized measurements be reviewed before init iating the next 
treatm ent cycle unless eit her of the fo llowing applies:
1.The patient has an ongoing toxicit y. If the pati ent has had a toxicit y result ing in a 
dose hol d, it is m andatory  that safet y labs (local or central) are collected AND 
reviewed before starting the next cy cle of treatment.
2.It is requi red per y our local pract ice or guidelines to have safet y labs reviewed before 
starting the next cy cle of treatment.

dexamethasone improves PFS compared wit h placebo when added to lenalido mide an d 
dexamethasone in pat ients with relapsed and/or refractory  MM . The study  will not be 
stopped after the PFS analysis, however, even if a significant PFS is observed, in order to 
obtain an adequate event rate and statist ical power for OS analysis. To mainta in the overall

can be claimed at the analysis for PFS with 262 progression/death events. If the test for PFS 
is statistically  significant at the first IA, a non -inferent ial analysis o f PFS will be performed 
at the second IA where the PFS data is considered mature.
If the test for PFS is not statist ically significant at the first IA, the study  will cont inue and 
PFS testing will be conducted at the second IA when approximately [ADDRESS_86385] ratio 0.810 (median PFS of 15 months in control arm versus 18.5 months in

8.1.2    
Randomization and Stratification
Randomization schem e will be generated by  [CONTACT_79065] . Prior to dosing, a rando mizat ion number will be assigned to each 
patient. The randomizat ion assignment will be implemented by  [CONTACT_25003]. 
Eligible pat ients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, stratified by : 
1) 1 versus 2 or 3 pri or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , 2) proteasom e inhibitor exposed versus proteasome 
inhibitor naïve, and 3) ISS stage at screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
8.1.3    Populations for Analys is
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety population: The safet y popul ation is defined as all pat ients who receive at least 
1dose of any study  drug. Pati ents will be analyzed according to the treatment actually  
received. That is, those patients who are randomized to the active arm but received the 
regimen in the control arm will be included in the control arm; those patients who are 
rando mized to the con trol arm but received the regimen in the act ive arm will be included in 
the active arm for safet y analyses.
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population: The ITT population is defined as all pat ients who are 
rando mized. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they were rando mized to 
receive, regardless of any  errors of dosing.

8.1.6    Efficacy Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]    Analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Note that, as of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and analyses for 
the PFS have be en com pleted. 
The analysis of primary endpo int, PFS, will be based on the ITT populat ion using 
IRC- assessed progression data. PFS is defined as the time fro m the date of rando mizat ion to 
the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whi chever occurs first. 
Patients wi thout docum entati on of  PD will  be censored at the date of last response 
assessment that is stable disease (SD) or better. 
PFS will be analyzed when approximately  [ADDRESS_86390] to PFS at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 0.0163 and 
0.0337, which corresponds to a nominal p value o f 0.0451 based on O’Brien -Fleming 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106] (the Lan -DeMets m ethod). In addi tion, an unadjusted stratified Cox 
model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs for the treatment effect using 
the stratificat ion factors. The Kaplan Meier (K -M) survival curves and K -M media ns (if 
estimable), along wit h their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

2.PFS assessed by  [CONTACT_79068].
PFS assessed by  [CONTACT_79069], for example, not censoring for patients who discontinue treatment and go on 
transpl ant or al ternat ive neoplast ic therapy. Details of diff erent censoring approaches will be 
included in the SAP.
Subgroup analyses will be performed for PFS relative to baseline stratificat ion factors, 
demographic data such as sex, race and age, and disease characterist ics such as t ype of prior 
regimen. 
If it is determined that the study  will continue after PFS is significant at a [ADDRESS_86391] IA, a non -inferent ial analysis of PFS will be performed at the second 
IA. The PFS data will be considered as matured at the second IA.
[IP_ADDRESS]    Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy
In addit ion to the primary  com parison of PFS and the first key  secondary endpoint OS, there 
is 1 addit ional key  secondary endpoint: OS in high -risk patients carrying del(17). This key 
secondary  endpoint will be tested only  if the test of OS is statistically significant at the IAs 
or final analysis at the same significance level as OS to ensure strong ty pe I error control for 
both key  secondary  endpoints.
Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time fro m the date of rando mizati on to the date of death. Patients 
without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last 
known to be alive. OS will be analyzed based on the ITT populat ion. 
A 2-sided, stratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatm ent groups wi th respect 
to OS. The test significance level at the IAs and final analysis is decided by [CONTACT_941] 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the Lan- DeMets method). In addit ion, an 
unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate the h azard rati o and i ts 95% CIs for 
the treatment effect using the stratificat ion factors. The K -M survival curves and K -M 
medians (if est imable), along with their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each 
treatm ent group.

Disease response -related endpoints will be analyzed using IRC -assessed response r ate.
ORR
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved PR or better relat ive to the ITT 
popul ation. Stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH) test will be used to compare ORR 
between the [ADDRESS_86392] in term s of odds ratio. The odds ratio and its associated 95% CIs will be 
presented.
The IRC -assessed response data will be used for the analysis. Invest igator -assessed response 
data will be used as sensit ivity analysis.
Combined CR +VGPR rate
The combined CR +VGPR rate will be analyzed using the same similar method as ORR. 
Time to Progression
TTP is defined as the time fro m the date of randomizat ion to the date of first documentation 
of PD. Pati ents wi thout documentation of PD at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
date of l ast response assessment that is SD or better. TTP will be analyzed based on the ITT 
popul ation using the similar method as PFS.

10.1.2    Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occu rrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (invest igational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a

107previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline. 
10.1.3    Serious Adverse Event De finition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent [ADDRESS_86410] ious agent. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. 
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010. [51] Clarificat ion should be

108made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is consid ered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A s evere AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily  need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2   Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  [CONTACT_16037], physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 10.3 for the 
period of observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive event.
Regardles s of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 10.1) 
must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation) by [CONTACT_53342] (contact [CONTACT_53343]) by [CONTACT_51260] [ADDRESS_86411] be submitted via fax (see fax numbers below) within [ADDRESS_86412] be updated as soon

Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78973] (eg, surgery was performed 
earlier or later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must deter mine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures
Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010. [51] The criteria are provided in the 
Study Manual.

[ZIP_CODE].3   Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows:
!AEs will be reported from the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_86413] dose of study drug through death or termination of the study by [CONTACT_456]. AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).
!Serious pretreatment events will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) up to first 
dose of study drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
!Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee from the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_86414] be reported to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee. Serious 
adverse events should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined 
to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported, irrespective of causality to study regimen, to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance for a minimum of [ADDRESS_86415] dose of study drug through death or termination of the studyby [CONTACT_456]. 
10.4   Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within [ADDRESS_86416]’s last dos e of study drug, are considered immediately 
reportable events. Study drug is to be disc ontinued immediately. The sponsor must also be

15.2   Multiple Myeloma Diagnostic Criteria
IMWG Criteria for the Diagnosis of Myeloma
Diagnosis Diagnostic Criteria: All Three Required
Symptomatic multiple myelomaaMonoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow 10% and/or 
presence of a biopsy -proven plasmacy toma
Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urineb
Myeloma -related organ dysfunction ( 1)c
[C] Calcium elevation in the blood (serum calcium 
>10.5 mg/l or upper limit of normal)
[R] Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2mg per 
100ml)
[A] Anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g per 100 ml or 2 g <normal)
[B] Lyt ic bone lesions or osteoporosisd
Source: International Myeloma Foundation, myeloma.org. Accessed 16 January 2012.
aThese criteria identify Stage IB and Stages II and III A/B myeloma by [CONTACT_79082]/Salmon stage. Stage IA 
becomes smoldering or indolent myeloma.
bIf no mo noclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma 
cells and/or a biopsy -proven plasmacytoma required.
cA variety of other types of end -organ dysfunctions can occasionally occur and lead to a need for therapy. 
Such dy sfunction is sufficient to support classification as myeloma if proven to be myeloma related.
dIf a solitary (biopsy -proven) plasmacy toma or osteoporosis alone (without fractures) is the sole defining 
criteria, then 30% plasma cells are required in the bone marrow.

Progressive disease (PD)a
To be used for calculation of 
time to progression and PFS 
endpoints for all subjects, 
including those in CR (includes 
primary  progressive disease 
and disease progression on or 
off therapy)Progressive Disease: requires any 1 or more of the following:
Increase of 25% fro m nadir in
Serum M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be 
0.5g/dL)b
Urine M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be 
200mg/24 h
Only in subjects without measurable serum and urine M -protein 
levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. 
The absolute increase must be > 10 mg/dL
Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be 10%
Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions
or soft tissue plasmacytomasc
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium 
>11.5 mg/dL or 2.85 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the 
plasma cell proliferative disorder
Abbreviations: CR = complete response; PFS= progression -free survival .
aAll relapse categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at anytime before classification as relapse 
or disease progression and/or the institution of any new therapy.
bFor progressive disease, serum M -component increases of 1 g/dL are sufficien t to define relapse if 
starting M -component is 5 g/dL.
cA definite increase of plasmacytoma is defined as a 50% (and at least 1 cm) increase as measured serially 
by [CONTACT_79084] -diameters of the measurable lesion.

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
[ZIP_CODE].15    Amendment 2 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 2
The primary  rationale for thi s amendment is to establish a China continuation o f 
Study C16010. This amendment describes modifications to the global study  procedures 
specifically for patients who enroll in the China cont inuat ion. Pati ents fro m China who 
enroll in the gl obal study  will not be affected. Following completion o f enrollment in the 
global study  (703 patients), up to approximately [ADDRESS_86470] ive of progression -free survival (PFS) in patients fro m China. Select other 
secondary object ives that directly relate to disease response assessment and safet y will also 
be evaluated to thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safet y signals of MLN9708 in this 
popul ation. These objec tives are overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), 
complete response + very  good parti al response rate (CR + VGPR), duration of response 
(DOR), time to progression (TTP), and safet y. Addi tional secondary  and exploratory  
objectives will be explor ed in the gl obal study  but are not included in the China continuation 
because they  are signal -seeking in nature. Objectives that are subsequent ly determined to be 
of clinical relevance may  be evaluated in future clinical studies.
The primary  object ive of PFS will  be assessed when 50% of PFS events have occurred or a 
minimum o f 18months after the first patient is enrolled in the China continuat ion, 
whichever occurs first. OS will be assessed when 50% of events have occurred or a 
minimum o f [ADDRESS_86471]. These assessment times will allow detection of any trends in the data and 
demonstrate consistency with the global dataset.
This amendment will allow for in -depth characterization of the pharm acokineti c (PK) 
properties of MLN9708 for patients in China. While the global study  implements sparse PK 
sampling, the China cont inuat ion includes extensive PK sampling on up to 30 pati ents to 
obtain data on approximately 12 PK -evaluable pat ients in the MLN9708 plus lenalido mide 
and dexamethasone (LenDex) arm. 
Purposes for Amendment 2
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Add background epi[INVESTIGATOR_79004]
Clarify  that the primary  object ive w ill be assessed in patients fro m China
Update the number of pat ients from [ADDRESS_86472] the approximate number of 
patients f rom China that will be enrolled in the China cont inuat ion
Modify the PK objective and corresponding endpoint to remove spars e PK sam pling 
and add full characterization o f PK in up to 30 patients
Remove secondary  objectives (and corresponding endpoints and study  procedures) that 
do not di rectly contribute to the characterization of the efficacy or safet y of MLN9708

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
[ZIP_CODE].16    Amendment 3 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 3
The primary  reason for thi s amendment is to add an addit ional progressi on-free survival 
(PFS) analysis, which will be considered the final PFS analysis. The second PFS analysis 
will allow more PFS data at a later date in addit ion to the first PFS analysis in the current 
protocol , and update the assumption on median PFS for both arms for sample size 
calculat ion based on the reported delayed events in 2 ongoing phase 3 studies (also being 
conducted in the same disease setting wit h the same primary endpoint). The original planned 
first in terim  analysis (IA [which was the final analysis (FA) for PFS]) will be conducted at a 
later date when approximately  [ADDRESS_86473] occurred. The added PFS analysis (the 
new FA) i s to be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_86474] occurred. The a lpha 
allocat ion for PFS will be based on the O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the 
Lan-DeMets m ethod). If the PFS IA is statist ically significant, the PFS FA will be a 
non-inferent ial test only. Those [ADDRESS_86475] IA and se cond IA for 
overall survival (OS).
Purposes for Amendment 3
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Update the statist ical and quantitative analyses sections to include the assumpt ions on 
PFS for sample size calculat ion and addit ional IA
Remove the non -inferential test on PFS at the original planned second IA

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
[ZIP_CODE].19     Amendment 6 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 6
The primary  reason for thi s amendment is to discont inue study  assessments and the PFS 
follow-up period for patients still receiving study therapy, now that the primary  endpoint of 
progression -free survival (PFS) is co mplete. Endpoints relating to diseas e response (ie, PFS, 
response rate, time toprogression) will not be assessed for protocol purposes after the 
primary  endpoint is m et;as such, all efficacy  response data (i e, blood, serum , and urine 
samples for assessment of response) will stop being coll ected/sent to the central laboratory  
to minimize the burden on study  patients and avo id unnecessary procedures . The other main 
reason for this amendment is to remove the fut ility boundary for overall survival (OS) at the 
third interim analysis to ensure th e collection o f sufficient long- term safet y data and avert 
potenti al premature terminat ion of OS evaluat ion, a key  secondary endpoint.
Other changes clarify study procedures, as noted in the following list.
Purposes for Amendment 6
The purposes of this ame ndment are to:
Remove m ention of the Safet y Management Attachment, which no longer exists
Discontinue the PFS fo llow-up peri od and all efficacy  response assessments, including 
laboratory  assessments, for protocol purposes because PFS significance has been met 
in the study
Remove the fut ility boundary for OS at the third interim analysis and n ote that the 
actual efficacy  boundaries m ay be adj usted if the actual number of events does not 
correspond to the projected number of events in the remaining analyses
Update the excluded conco mitant m edicat ion informat ion to reflect recent population 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)analyses and drug -drug interaction study  resul ts from Study  
C16009 demonstrating that cytochrom e P450 inhibitors do not affect MLN9708 PK
Clarify  the m anagement of rash, including adding a table of steroid equivalent doses
Clarify  the management of overdose
Clarify  the instructi ons for study  drug dispensing
Clarify  the procedure for performing the physical examinat ion
Clarify  when central  laboratory  resu lts must be reviewed before init iating the next

[ZIP_CODE].20    Amendment 7 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 7
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment
No.7.This amendment describes modificat ions to the study procedures specifically  for 
patients who are enrolled in the China -specific protocol continuation o f Study  C16010. 
Patients fro m China who are enrolled in the glo bal C16010 study will not be affected by  [CONTACT_79089]. 
As of Amendment 7, analysis o f the primary  endpoint of progressi on-free survival (PFS) (at 
the primary  analysis) and of the secondary  endpoint of overall survival (OS) (at the final 
analysis) have been co mpleted. The rationale for this ame ndment is to discont inue disease 
response assessments (ie, PFS, response rate, time to progression), discont inue efficacy 
response assessments (ie, blood, serum, and urine samples), discont inue PFS and OS 
follow-up assessments for all pat ients, and discont inue all fo llow-up of  patients who have 
completed study  treatm ent. In addi tion, the obj ective of this amendment is to provide 
patients who are still on study  treatm ent wi th cont inued access to study  drugs and to 
continue to collect relevant safet y informat ion. Also, after unblinding of patients after the 
positive final survival analysis, this amendment will allow pat ients who are currently 
receiving placebo in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone the option to 
continue receiving lenalido mide and dexamethasone alo ne or, based on the invest igator’s

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
171Change 3:Clarifythat the final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and the study  is 
considered complete for statist ical analysis purposes.
The primary  change occurs in Section 8 STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE 
ANALYSES :
Added 
text:The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study is 
considered complete for statistical analysis purposes. The final analysis is 
expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 8, the investigator will unblind all patients remaining on study 
treatment and will follow the new Schedule of Events presented in this 
amendment . No subsequent formal inferential statistical analys es will be 
conducted; minimal descriptive analyses of safety will be performed on 
patient data collected after the final analysis. The description of the 
statistical methods presented below reflects the full design for the study for 
reference.
Rationale for Change :
To note that the data cutoff date for the final analysis has now occurred; no subsequent 
formal inferent ial stati stical analyses will  be conducted after the final analysis. 
Change 4:Add language to clarify ongo ing treatment of patients —pati ents still receiving 
study  treatm ent will stay  on thei r assigned study  regimen. Pati ents shou ld be moved off 
study  and onto an al ternative supply of (eg, commercially  available) ixazo mib  and/or 
LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment.
The primary  change occurs in the Schedule ofEvents :
Initial 
wording:As of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and as such, the 
PFS follow -up peri od is now com pleted and for all patients still receiving study  
therapy , all central  and invest igator assessments of response and progression for 
protocol  purposes will be discont inued. Thus, for ease of study conduct, the 
Schedule of Events now presented has been simplified to apply to the remainder 
ofthe study . The full  Schedule of Events as of Amendment 3 has been moved to 
Secti on  15.12. The PK sampling schedule has also been moved to Section  
15.12, as i t was applicable through Cycle 10, which has been co mpleted for all 
patients.
Amended 
or new 
wording:The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study is 
considered complete for statistical analysis purposes. Upon implementation 
of Amendment 8, the investigator will unblind all patients remaining on 
study treatment and will f ollow the new Schedule of Events . 
Only patients who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not 
have other means of access to the study drugs will continue on the study. 
Because no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only 
assessments contributing to long- term safety monitoring are required. Most 
study assessments besides safety are discontinued to ease the burden of 
protocol -mandated assessments on patients. Patients continuing their

complete an EOT visit and transition onto an alternative supply of (eg, 
commercially available) ixazomib (MLN9708) and/or LenDex, or onto 
another standard of c are treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by 
[CONTACT_79033].
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus LenDex will continue to receive 
ixazomib plus LenDex.  Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will 
receive LenDex only; the placebo capsule will no longer be administered 
and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this 
study. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, data collection requirements 
will be limited to collection of AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. 
Quality of life, health care utilization, EQ -5D, and pain assessments are 
discontinued. Survival data will no longer be collected because the analysis 
of OS will be complete at the time of the final analysis. Other study 
assess ments are no longer required, as noted in the new Schedule of Events. 
Patients will not be followed for the OS follow -up period because OS data 
are no longer being collected.
As of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and as such, the 
PFS follow-up peri od is now com pleted and for all patients still receiving study  
therapy , all central  and invest igator assessments of response and progression for 
protocol  purposes will be discont inued. Thus, for ease of study conduct, the 
Schedule of Events now presented has been simplified to apply to the remainder

Patients m ay be at an increased risk of infect ion including reactivation o f herpes 
zoster and herpes simplex viruses . Ant iviral therapy  such as acycl ovir or 
valacyc lovir may be init iated as clinically indicated . 
…
Nausea and/or Vomiting
Standard anti -emet ics including 5 -hydroxy tryptamine 3 serotonin receptor (5 -
HT3) antagonists are recommended for emesis if it  occurs once treatment is 
initiated; prophylact ic ant i-emetics may also be considered at the physician’s 
discreti on. Dexamethasone should not be administered as an anti -emet ic. Fluid 
deficit should be corrected before init iation of study drug and during trea tment.
Diarrhea
Prophylactic ant idiarrheals will not be used in this protocol . However, diarrhea 
shoul d be managed according to clinical pract ice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infect ious causes are excluded . Fluid intake should be 
maintained to avoi d dehydrati on. Fluid deficit should be corrected before 
initiation of treatment and during treatment . 
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
…
Rash may  range from  som e ery thematous areas, macular and/or small papular 
bumps that may or may not be prurit ic over a few areas of the body, to a more 
generalized eruption that is predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. Rash has

TEAEs. These severe, potentially life -threatening or deadly condit ions may 
involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be c linically managed 
according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological 
analysis are encouraged at the discretion of the investigator. Addit ional 
inform ation regarding these react ions can be found in the IB . 
Thrombocytopenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol  with 
additional testing obtained according to standard clinical practice . 
Thrombocy topeni a may  be severe but has been manageable with platelet 
transfusio ns according to standard clinica l practice . Lenalido mide or study  drug 
administration should be modified as per dose modificat ion recommendat ions in 
theprotocol when thrombocy topeni a occurs (see Table 6-1). Therapy  can be 
reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platel et counts . A rare risk is 
thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura, a rare blood disorder where blood clots 
form in small blood vessels throughout the body  characteri zed by  
[CONTACT_79093], petechi ae, fever, or possibly  more seri ous si gns and 
symptoms . Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be managed 
symptom atically according to standard medical practice.
Fluid Deficit
Dehydrat ion shoul d be avo ided since lenalido mide is substant iallyexcreted by  
[INVESTIGATOR_22875], and MLN9708 may cause vo miting, di arrhea ,and dehydrat ion. Acute 
renal failure has been reported in pat ients treated with MLN9708, co mmo nly in 
the setting of the previously noted gastrointest inal toxicities and dehy dration. 
Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study  drug as needed during 
treatm ent to avoi d dehydrat ion(see Section 6.8).
Hypot ension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope 
have been reported with MLN9708 . Blood pressure shoul d be cl osely  monitored 
while the patient is on study  treatm ent and fluid deficit should be corrected as 
needed, especial ly in the setting of conco mitant symptom s such as nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased appetite . Patients taking medicat ions and/or 
diuretics to m anage their blood pressure (for either hy po-or hy pertensio n) 
shoul d be managed according to standard clinical practice, including 
considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant medications during the 
course of the trial . Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study

known whether MLN9708 causes transverse myelitis; however, because it 
happened to a patient receiving MLN9708, the possibilit y that MLN9708 may  
have contributed to transverse myelit is cannot be excluded. Transverse myelit is 
shoul d be managed according to standard medical practice.
Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of 
investigat ional drug, to or by  a stud y subject, at a dose above that which is 
assigned to that individual subject according to the study  protocol . If overdose

updated documentation to support the extended shelf life.
Study  drug dispensed to the patient should remain in the blister packaging and 
carton until the point of use. Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual or equivale nt storage 
guidelines. In case of extenuating circumstances that prevent a patient from 
attending the study site (eg, the COVID- 19 pandemic), sites may use 
alternative strategies to deliver study drug to patients (eg, via courier or site 
staff), per local standard practice and regulations and with prior approval 
from the investigator and the sponsor’s project clinician/designee. 
Com prehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure 
compliance wi th, and understanding of, dosing proc edures. Patients who are 
receiving take -home medicat ion ordinarily shoul d be given only  1 cycle of 
study  drug at a time; more than [ADDRESS_86494] clinician/designee. (Note: patients in 
[LOCATION_009] are only permitted to receive 1 cycle of medication at a time). Should 
more than 1 cycle of medication be dispensed, the investigator and/or health care 
provi der m ust revi ew the proper dosing instructions with the patient to avoid the 
potenti al for incorrect self -administrati on or overdose of medication. 
Patients shou ld be instructed to store the medicat ion according to the storage 
condi tions that are outlined in the Pharmacy  Manual  or equivalent storage 
guidelines. Pati ents shoul d be instructed to return their empt y cartons to the 
investigat ive site, rather than disca rding them. Reconciliat ion will occur 
accordingly when the patient returns for their next cy cle of  study  drug. In case of 
extenuating circumstances that prevent a patient from attending the study 
site (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), drug packs and dosing diaries should be 
returned at the next available on -site clinic visit. Any extreme in temperature 
shoul d be reported as an excursio n and should be dealt with on a case -by-case

wording:Patients will  be evaluated at scheduled visits over 4 study  periods: Screening, 
Treatment, End of Treatment (EOT), and Follow -Up (PFS and OS). As of 
Amendment 6, however, the primary  endpoint has been met; as such, the PFS 
follow-up phase has been discontinued for patients currently receiving study  
therapy  and f or pati ents who discont inued therapy for reasons other than PD. As

In acknowledgement of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], local, state or national gover nment 
restrictions, or other site -related factors caused by [CONTACT_79096] (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic) that may prevent investigators 
from conducting the study according to the Schedule of Events at the 
clinical study site, investigators may con tinue patients in the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_79011]. Investigators are expected to 
evaluate the impact to the safety of the study participants and site personnel 
for patients to continue. In evaluating such requests, the investigator/study 
site staff will give the highest priority to the safety and welfare of the 
patients. Patients must be willing and able to continue taking study 
medication and remain compliant with the protocol.  For patients that are 
impacted by [CONTACT_79097], any procedures not 
conducted per the study protocol will be documented in the eCRF.  
Alternative methods should be considered for performing the assessments 
by [CONTACT_79098] (eg, remote 
assessment, havi ng lab assessment performed at a facility closer to the 
patient’s home, etc.) If a patient misses an in -person study visit, the 
investigator/study team staff will speak directly with the patient by 
[CONTACT_63195] (eg, a computer -based video comm unication) 
during each visit window to assess subject safety and overall clinical status. 
During this contact [CONTACT_10970], the study site physician or other 
qualified site staff should at minimum conduct AE collection and an 
assessment of clinical sym ptoms. Other study assessments may be collected 
remotely as is feasible and may involve audio or video recording. 
Assessments/procedures that cannot be completed during the protocol -
specified window because a site visit is done remotely (eg, complete physi cal

Upon implementation of Ame ndment 8, only patients who are 
demonstrating clinical benefit and are unable to access a commercial supply 
of ixazomib and/or lenalidomide and dexamethasone will remain in the 
study, until such time as other means of accessing the study drugs are 
arranged . Completion of study treatment will occur when patients 
discontinue study drugs provided by [CONTACT_79063], 
or when the patient experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or death. The reason for treatment discontinuation 
must be recorded in the eCRF but no approval is required.
Patients will attend an EOT visit 30 days (+1 week) after receiving their last 
dose of the study drug regimen unless next -line therapy is started before [ADDRESS_86495] dose of study drug, in which case the EOT visit should 
occur before the start of the next -line therapy. Refer to the 
Schedule of Events for End of Treatment visit assessments.
Rationale for Change :
To clarifythe definit ion of completion o f treatm ent upon implementation of Amendment 8.
Change 13:Clarifythe definit ion of Complet ion of Study .

Prior to implementation of Amendment 8, patients were considered to have 
completed the study if they were followed until death or until the sponsor 
terminated the study. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, patients will 
no longer be followed during any of the follow -up periods, as PFS and OS 
data are not being collected. Patients will be considered to have completed 
the study if they completed study treatment (see Section 7.7).

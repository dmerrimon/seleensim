Version	2	March	28,	2018								1. Introduction/Background/Purpose:		According	to	the	World	Health	Organization,	postpartum	hemorrhage	(PPH)	is	the	leading	cause	of	maternal	mortality	in	low-income	countries	and	the	primary	cause	of	nearly	one	quarter	of	all	maternal	deaths	globally	(1).	An	estimated	blood	loss	(EBL)	in	excess	of	[ADDRESS_107811]	at	delivery	can	approach	these	amounts	when	actually	measured	rather	than	estimated	(2).	More	than	half	of	all	maternal	deaths	occur	within	[ADDRESS_107812]	commonly	from	excessive	bleeding	(3).	Worldwide,	140,[ADDRESS_107813]	common	antecedents	to	postpartum	hemorrhage	are	uterine	atony,	placental	disorders,	and	trauma	during	delivery.		Improving	maternal	health	worldwide	is	one	of	the	WHO’s	8	Millennium	Developmental	Goals.	The	prevention	and	treatment	of	PPH	is	an	essential	step	towards	the	achievement	of	that	goal	(4).		Estimates	of	blood	loss	at	delivery	are	notoriously	inaccurate,	with	under-estimation	more	common	than	over-estimation	(5).	Traditionally,	the	surgeon	performing	the	cesarean	section	would	estimate	the	blood	loss	by	[CONTACT_97751].	Current	detection	and	management	of	hemorrhage	is	heavily	based	on	clinical	judgment,	which	often	leads	to	delay	in	recognition	and	intervention.	Often,	interventions	such	as	fluid	resuscitation	and	blood	transfusion	are	not	initiated	until	significant	hemorrhage	has	already	taken	place.	The	traditional	method	for	estimating	blood	loss	is	based	on	the	surgeon	and	surgical	staff’s	subjective	assessment	that	is	severely	limited	by	[CONTACT_97752],	irrigation,	or	both	(6).	Another	limitation	is	that	blood	loss	is	frequently	estimated	at	the	end	of	the	procedure.	Early	detection	and	treatment	of	this	potentially	life	threatening	obstetric	complication	is	of	utmost	importance	in	the	field	of	obstetrics.	Simulations	and	didactic	training	have	been	shown	to	improve	visual	estimations,	but	there	are	still	poor	associations	between	experience	level	and	accuracy,	and	a	
Version	2	March	28,	2018		significant	decay	in	blood	loss	estimation	skills	over	time	(7).	The	Triton	system	(Gauss	Surgical,	Inc.,	Palo	Alto,	CA)	is	a	novel	mobile	monitoring	platform	that	combines	mobile	computing	with	Gauss	Feature	Extraction	Technology	(FET)	to	directly	assess	Hb	mass	(mHb)	absorbed	by	[CONTACT_97753]	(8).	The device is an iPad like imaging device that will assess blood loss via imaging of the surgical sponges used in the surgery.	In	2014,	Konig	at	al.	showed	that	mobile	blood	loss	monitoring	using	the	Triton	system	is	accurate	in	assessing	mHb	on	surgical	sponges	across	a	range	of	ambient	light	conditions,	sponge	saturation,	saline	contamination,	and	initial	blood	Hb.	Utilization	of	this	tool	could	significantly	improve	the	accuracy	of	blood	loss	estimates	(9).	Holmes	et	al.	also	showed	that	the	novel	mobile	monitoring	system	provides	an	accurate	measurement	of	mHb	on	surgical	sponges	as	compared	with	manual	rinsing	measurements,	and	is	significantly	more	accurate	than	the	gravimetric	method	(10).   However,	these	studies	were	performed	on	patients	undergoing	a	myriad	of	surgical	procedures	not	just	limited	to	obstetrical	patients.	To	our	knowledge,	this	technology	has	not	been	validated	in	the	obstetrical	population	at	risk	for	hemorrhage.		The	gauss/triton	colorimetric	system	is	not	standard	of	care	at	UTMB.		Not	enough	data	is	available	to	support	its	use,	despi[INVESTIGATOR_97750].	Most	evidence	is	available	in	non-pregnant	patients.	In	the	obstetric	population	no	definitive	evidence	exists,	and	the	only	trial	that	has	been	performed	was	recently	published	in	AJP	reports	for	which	one	of	our	co-PIs	([CONTACT_97763])	is	the	chief	editor	(11).	In	that	trial,	only	the	accuracy	was	evaluated,	and	we	believe	that	further	evidence	is	needed	to	support	its	use.	Our	hypothesis	is	that	this	device	will	enable	clinicians	to	prospectively	and	objectively	assess	EBL.	Ultimately	after	its	validation,	our	results	will	be	used	to	propose	a	multicenter	clinical	trial	to	the	NICHD	MFMU	network	to	evaluate	the	clinical	utility	of	this	system.	This	study	will	be	a	prospective	cohort	study,	in	which	we	will	evaluate	two	methods	of	evaluating	intraoperative	blood	loss	during	cesarean	delivery	(usual	clinical	assessment	versus	Device).	Of	note,	the	subjects	consented	will	be	used	as	self-controls.	2. Summary	of	project:	This	study	will	be	a	prospective	cohort	study.	Patients	who	are	scheduled	for	an	elective	cesarean	and	meet	criteria	for	inclusion	in	the	study	will	be	approached	for	participation	at	same	day	of	admission.	Written	informed	consent	will	be	obtained	from	the	patients	by	[CONTACT_97754]-PI	([CONTACT_97764])	and	by	[CONTACT_97755]	([CONTACT_97765],	
Version	2	March	28,	2018		Mauricio	La	Rosa,	Joe	Eid,	Nadia	Megahed,	and	Mahmoud	Abdelwahab).	If	patients	agree	to	participate,	a	CBC	(complete	blood	count)	will	be	obtained	via	venous	puncture.	The	device	will	be	used	during	the	delivery	in	the	operating	room.	The	device	will	be	used	to	assess	EBL	by	[CONTACT_97756]/	EBL	assessment	will	be	masked	to	the	clinical	team.	Unmasking	will	only	occur	after	collecting	the	data	from	the	device	with	purpose	to	perform	data	analysis.	Patient	management	will	be	according	to	the	clinical	team.	All	patients	undergo	a	CBC	postpartum.	The	drop	in	Hgb	(DHgb)	between	the	pre	and	post	cesarean	CBCs	will	be	calculated	for	each	patient.	Patients	will	be	divided	into	quartiles	of	DHgb.	Cases	will	be	those	patients	whose	DHgb	is	in	the	upper	quartile,	while	controls	will	be	those	patients	whose	DHgb	is	in	the	lower	[ADDRESS_107814]	number	(MRN).		During	data	analysis,	all	patient	identifiers	will	be	deleted.			3. Study	procedures:																										VISIT#1	3.1	Screening,	Recruitment	and	Consenting:	When	a	patient	meets	inclusion	criteria	for	participation	in	our	study,	the	obstetrical	team	will	contact	[CONTACT_97757].	Written	informed	consent	will	be	obtained	from	the	patient	by	[CONTACT_97758],	study	coordinator,	or	collaborator.	Study	participation	will	be	complete	when	the	patient	is	discharged	from	the	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].	The	data	collected	will	be	kept	on	a	password	secured	UTMB	computer.	An	encrypted	USB	flash	drive	will	be	used	to	transfer	data.	The	data	will	be	linked	via	MRN,	which	is	needed	to	access	the	demographic	data	and	will	be	deleted	when	the	data	is	analyzed.	Our	target	sample	size	is	242	subjects.			3.2.	Baseline	procedures:	In	some	patients,	there	will	be	no	baseline	procedures	aside	from	using	the	masked	device	for	assessment	of	EBL.	If	a	preop	CBC	is	not	indicated	clinically	or	not	available,	then	a	preop	CBC	will	be	obtained	after	consent	is	signed.	Funding	from	the	Ob/Gyn	department	will	cover	the	cost	of	this	test.	The	device	will	be	set	by	[CONTACT_97759]	[ADDRESS_107815]’s	insurance	nor	the	subject	will	be	responsible	for	any	charges	relating	to	tests	done	only	for	research.	Please	see	attached	budget	and	departmental	letter	of	support.		3.3.	Study	visits/Follow-up:	One	study	visit	will	be	needed	during	the	trial.	The	subject	participation	will	be	considered	complete	when	the	subject	is	discharged	home.		3.6.	Withdrawals:	Subjects	who	withdraw	from	the	study	after	inclusion	will	be	excluded	from	further	follow-up.	Data	collected	until	the	time	of	withdrawal	will	be	analyzed.			3.7	Outcomes	• Primary	outcome:	Differences	in	EBL	between	cases	and	controls	using	clinical	estimate	versus	device	assessment.	• Secondary	outcomes:	System	performance	(ROC	sensitivity	analysis	and	correlation).	Delta	hemoglobin,	transfusion	requirements,	administration	of	uterotonics,	colloid	resuscitation,	post-partum	hemorrhage	or	hemorrhagic	shock.		4. Criteria	for	inclusion	of	subjects:		Pregnant	women	between	the	ages	of	18-50.	Scheduled	cesarean	delivery.		5. Criteria	for	exclusion	of	subjects:		•	Incarcerated	patients		•	Patient	unwilling	or	unable	to	provide	consent		•	Intrauterine	fetal	demise	(no	fetal	heart	beat	identified	and	documented	by	[CONTACT_97760])		•	Placenta	previa	or	other	known	placental	anomalies		•	Enrolled	in	another	trial	that	may	affect	outcome.		6. Sources	of	research	material:	Electronic	medical	records.		7. Recruitment	methods	and	consenting	process:	See	3.1	above.		8. Potential	risks	8.1	Loss	of	confidentiality:	Any	time	information	is	collected,	there	is	a	potential	risk	for	loss	of	confidentiality.	Every	effort	will	be	made	to	keep	the	subject’s	information	confidential;	however,	this	cannot	be	guaranteed.				9. Potential	benefits:	With	this	novel	approach	of	assessing	blood	loss	more	objectively	during	cesarean	section,	there	are	many	potential	benefits,	
Version	2	March	28,	2018		including:	decrease	in	the	delay	in	diagnosis	of	hemorrhagic	shock,	decrease	in	delay	in	interventions	and	improved	postpartum	surveillance.	In	addition,	this	data	will	be	useful	in	designing	a	level	1	trial	to	measure	outcomes	such	as	transfusion	rates,	transfusion	complications,	hemorrhage	and	maternal	death.		10. Data	monitoring:	The	PI,	research	coordinator,	and	collaborators	will	ensure	that	all	aspects	of	data	quality	adhere	to	the	study	design.	This	will	include	monitoring	for	adherence	to	consent	procedures,	inclusion	and	exclusion	criteria,	valid	abstraction,	correct	entry,	timeliness	and	responsiveness	to	data	queries.	Data	will	be	collected	and	stored	with	the	participant	ID	code	only.	The	master	enrollment	log	linking	patient	identifiers	with	study	ID	numbers	will	be	kept	in	a	password	protected	database	on	the	Ob/Gyn	department’s	internal	server.	Several	data	collection	forms	will	be	used.	Data	on	these	forms	will	be	devoid	of	personal	identifiers	and	will	be	securely	stored	at	the	division	offices.	The	research	coordinator	will	be	available	to	monitor	the	data	and	correct	any	discrepancies	based	on	source	documents	if	needed.		11. Procedures	to	maintain	confidentiality:	Each	subject	will	be	assigned	a	study	number	with	personally	identifiable	information	deleted	or	removed.	If	needed,	charts	will	be	reviewed	in	the	medical	records	area.	Subjects'	information	will	be	de-identified	and	tagged	with	a	number.	Data	will	be	collected	and	stored	on	a	UTMB	password-protected	computer.		Statistical	approach:	We	will	be	performing	a	prospective	study.	After	defining	cases	and	controls	using	the	cutoff	of	upper	quartile	for	pre-	to	postop-	hemoglobin	drop.	We	will	use	univariable	and	multivariable	analysis	to	check	for	association	between	both	blood	loss	assessment	techniques	using	the	device	and	the	subjective	clinical	assessment	among	our	cases	and	controls.	We	will	be	comparing	cases	versus	controls	(two	groups)	and	EBL	(continuous	variable	and	primary	outcome)	hence	t	tests/means	were	used	for	our	sample	calculation;	For	the	purpose	of	the	study,	we	believe	a	sample	size	of	220	will	be	able	to	evaluate	our	primary	outcome.	Accounting	for	10%	loss	of	data	or	follow-up:	N	total	is	242	subjects.	This	was	based	on	a	study	of	50	patients	having	cesarean	deliveries	using	the	Triton	System	(the	mean	measured	blood	loss	was	555.[ADDRESS_107816]	deviation	of	317	ml	(11).

We	will	also	perform	ROC	curve	analysis	(secondary	outcome)	to	compare	the	area	under	the	curve	(AUC)	to	predict	DHgb	in	the	upper	quartile	by	[CONTACT_97761].	The	coefficient	of	multiple	correlation	takes	values	between	0	and	1;	a	higher	value	indicates	a	better	predictability	of	the	dependent	variable	(EBL	Device)	from	the	independent	variable	(EBL	standard).

Version #: 5.0 Version Date: 12Aug19 Page 3 of 12  (LGMD). The primary objective is safety which we will measure using laboratory testing and forced vital capacity (FVC). The secondary objective is efficacy which will be measured by a change in MRI muscle mass, improved muscle performance, and quality of life.  We hypothesize that patients who receive oral weekly glucocorticoid steroids will have clinically significant improvements in strength and quality of life compared to their baseline. Furthermore, we anticipate that oral weekly glucocorticoid steroids will not have a significant adverse impact on patients.  BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoid (GC) steroids are a mainstay of therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, where they have been shown to prolong ambulation in for DMD in random clinical trials (Gloss et al., 2016).  Dosing regimen vary for DMD, but most trials utilized oral daily dosing at 0.75- 1 mg/kg of prednisone or deflazacort (Birnkrant et al., 2018).  The age at which to begin oral glucocorticoids and the age at which to cease steroid use are not well established by [CONTACT_390072].  High dose weekend dosing of oral glucocorticoid steroids has also been suggested to be noninferior to daily dosing when evaluated in a year-long study in DMD, and this approach is preferred in some settings since related to a reduced side effect profile, particularly with respect to behavioral changes which can occur with daily GC steroid dosing in children (Escolar et al., 2011).  The use of GC steroids for other forms of muscular dystrophy, including Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and the Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMDs) is not considered standard of care and has insufficiently been investigated by [CONTACT_390073].  An RCT of GC steroids in LGMD 2B (DYSF mutations) was associated with unfavorable outcomes in the steroid treated group (Walter et al., 2013).  Recently, weekly steroid dosing was investigated in preclinical mouse models of muscular dystrophy, including the mdx mouse model of DMD/BMD and two models of LGMD, including LGMD 2B (DYSF) and 2C (SGCG) (Quattrocelli et al., 2017a; Quattrocelli et al., 2017b).  All three models showed improved strength and reduced fibrosis with weekly GC steroid dosing.  Moreover, in unpublished data, long term studies (24-52 weeks duration) in mice, showed favorable results with improved muscle strength in the mdx and DYSF models.  We propose to carry out an open label safety and efficacy trial of oral weekly GC steroids in patients with BMD and LGMD subtypes.  Subjects will be recruited based on age, molecular diagnosis of BMD and LGMD subtypes, and willingness to participate.   Both ambulatory and nonambulatory subjects will be included.  Subjects will be excluded if they have diabetes mellitus, full time ventilator use, or severely compromised cardiac function, including symptoms referable to heart failure.   Subjects must provide consent.   Subjects will be asked to take weekly GC oral prednisone dosed based on weight (1mg/kg for patients who weigh less than or equal to 70 kg and 0.75 mg/kg for patients who weigh more than 70 kg). Subjects will also be instructed to take their weekly prednisone on Mondays after their last meal between 7 and 9 PM. Prior to initiation, subjects will provide a blood sample for baseline screening including serum chemistries, HgbA1-C, creatine kinase, and lipid panel (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol) and for exploratory biomarkers.  Subjects will also provide a urine sample to analyze changes in metabolic biomarkers that are excreted. Subjects will have a physical exam and medical record review.  Subjects will have strength testing and complete [ADDRESS_489306] (if ambulatory).   Subjects will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaire.  At [ADDRESS_489307] and 6 min 
Version #: 5.0 Version Date: 12Aug19 Page [ADDRESS_489308] (if ambulatory), blood draw for serum chemistry, HgbA1-C, creatine kinase, lipid panel and for exploratory biomarkers.  Subjects will also provide a urine specimen to be analyzed for any changes in excretion of metabolic markers as an exploratory endpoint.  Subjects will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire. An MRI/ MRS will be performed before starting GC oral prednisone and at 6 months.  STUDY ENDPOINTS: Primary Outcome: Safety  Safety monitoring: • Comprehensive chemistry panel, hemoglobin A1C, CK, lipid panel at screening and after 6 months of GC steroid dosing • FVC (sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) at screening and at 6 months • Phone calls to each patient each month to determine their state of health and study drug compliance.

In this study, subjects will be asked to take weekly GC oral prednisone, dosed based on weight (1mg/kg for patients who weigh less than or equal to 70 kg and 0.75 mg/kg for patients who weigh more than 70 kg). Subjects will be instructed to take weekly prednisone on Mondays after their last meal between [ADDRESS_489311] signed informed consent, passed screening, on Day 0 of their treatment. Subjects will return home with 6 months of study drug treatment. They will be educated on dosing, storage, and return of unused study drug by [CONTACT_5984]. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_8644] a monthly basis to assess medication and dosing adherence. They will be asked to confirm their medication and the dosing instructions and re-educated if not adhering.    PROCEDURES INVOLVED: This is an open label study that evaluates the safety and efficacy of oral weekly glucocorticoid steroids in patients with BMD and LGMD over 6 months. The study is comprised is three visits; screening to determine eligibility, initial dosing (Day 0), and final dosing (Month 6).  Screening All subjects will be recruited to the study through the Muscular Dystrophy (MDA) Clinic at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Prior to any study procedures, the study team will complete the full informed consent process with each patient. Upon obtaining informed consent, the study team will collect information from the patient including: demographics, vital signs, weight, height, medical history, concomitant medication, genetic mutation test results, EKG and Echocardiogram test results. If the subject does not have EKG or Echocardiogram results within the last [ADDRESS_489312] is ineligible, he/she will be notified and continue to seek treatment through their treating physician.    Data will be retained in paper source materials by [CONTACT_390074], 1109, [ADDRESS_489313]., Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE].

The following laboratory tests will be collected for safety purposes: A comprehensive chemistry panel, hemoglobin A1C, CK, and lipid panel.  A blood and urine sample will be taken for exploratory biomarkers. Samples will be collected by [CONTACT_390075][INVESTIGATOR_390059]. Records will be populated in the patient’s medical charts and stored by [CONTACT_390076].  A member of the study team will also collect forced vital capacity in a sitting and supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  The subject will be asked to undergo an MRI through the study team at the Center for Translational Imaging at Northwestern University.  Before the study participant completes the MRI, he or she must answer questions about their medical and surgical history on a MRI safety questionnaire to determine whether it will be safe for them to complete the MRI.  If not, they will not be eligible to participate in this study. No contrast will be administered. The MRI images will be de-identified and electronically transmitted to a secure file transfer (SFT) system to the University of [LOCATION_012] for interpretation.  Before dosing occurs, a member of the study team (physical or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) will complete the following functional assessments: Northstar Assessment for Dysferlinopathy (NSAD) –AMB, [ADDRESS_489315] if the patient is ambulatory, performance of upper limb (PUL) evaluation, Brookes and Vignos scales. A member of the study team will also collect the strength assessment, MMT MRC.  Subjects will be asked to complete two questionnaires; ACTIVLM and a Quality of Life Questionnaire.  The subject will also complete a bone density (DEXA) scan at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Monthly Phone Calls Between Day [ADDRESS_489316] has experienced any changes to their physical health (adverse events).  He or she will also ask the subjects about how they are taking the medication and if you are doing so correctly. If the subjects are not, the study member will help the subjects by [CONTACT_390077].  Month [ADDRESS_489317] will also provide a sample for safety laboratory analysis (Comprehensive chemistry panel, hemoglobin A1C, CK, and lipid panel).

Version #: 5.0 Version Date: 12Aug19 Page 10 of 12   WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_390063]. Subjects may also be withdrawn if it is found that they are not complying with the study’s required dosing instructions.  In the event that a subject is to be withdrawn, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_390064]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_390065], if necessary. A member of the study team will indicate that the subject was withdrawn in the subject binder.  RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS Participating in this study places subjects at minimal risk of the following:  Risks from glucocorticoid steroids • The risks associated with glucocorticoid steroids include: glaucoma (elevated pressure in the eyes), edema (fluid retention in lower legs), hypertension (high blood pressure), weight gain, problems with mood and memory, alterations in endocrine function, increased risks related to infections, decrease in bone density, and possible damage to your vision.  These risks are seen when people take glucocorticoid steroids daily for extended periods of time.  Based on preclinical studies in animals and limited studies in humans, it is expected these risks are much less when taking glucocorticoids steroids once per week.   Since the subjects will be taking glucocorticoid steroids once weekly, for [ADDRESS_489324], subjects will lie in a small closed area inside a large magnetic tube. Some people are scared or anxious in small places (claustrophobic).  The MRI scanner makes loud banging noises while taking a measurement, so either ear plugs or specially designed headphones will be used to reduce the noise.  Risks from DEXA bone scans Procedures such as CT scans, X-rays and/or radioactive drugs will be used during this research study to see how subjects are doing. The cumulative radiation exposure from these tests is considered small and is not likely to adversely affect subjects or their disease. However, the effects of radiation add up over a lifetime.  It is possible that having several of these tests may add to subjects’ risk of injury or disease. When deciding to enter this study, subjects will think about their past and future contact [CONTACT_341051]. Examples of contact [CONTACT_390080] x-rays taken for any reason or radiation therapy for cancer treatment.  Background radiation is present on Earth (soil, air, water, food) and also includes cosmic radiation. Exposure to radiation from natural sources is a feature of everyday life. Your 
Version #: 5.0 Version Date: 12Aug19 Page 11 of 12  participation in this study will involve additional exposure to radiation. The radiation dose received for one DEXA scan is approximately equal to 4.5 days of background radiation.  The effective dose for one DEXA scan (lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_390066]) is 4 mrem. The total effective dose of all research related radiation procedures is 8 mrem.   POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS There may be benefit from participating in this research.  Potential benefit may include increased strength and muscle mass.    DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_390067].  All subjects will receive once weekly prednisone, and no placebo arm is planned for this study.  Data will be compared between study entry and 6 months of once weekly steroids.  The data from this study will be used to plan for a larger trial.  In preclinical animal models, a 25% improvement in muscle strength and function was observed.    During the trial, study team members with access to Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s electronic medical records System, Epic, will have access to the subject’s medical chart. The study team will print, redact, and store all study-specific test results in the subject binders. All medical records will be de-identified and labeled with the subject identification number. The tests obtained from Epic include: genetic test results, medical history, concomitant medications, safety laboratory results, EKG results, Echo results, DEXA results, and MRI results. The remaining tests will be performed during the study visit and documented on case report forms (source documentation) located in the subject binders.  MRI images that are collected as part of this research study will be obtained at the Center for Translational Imaging and Northwestern University. The study team will obtain a de-identified copy of the MRI images for all study participants that contains the participant’s study number. A member of the study team will transmit the images to the University of [LOCATION_012] through a secure file transfer (SFT) system. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_390068].

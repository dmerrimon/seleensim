following the Nuss Procedure  
  SPONSOR  UCSF Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery 
  NUMBER OF SITES  1: UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41806], affecting approximately [ADDRESS_43986]-
operative pain is the primary determining factor for length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41807].  
      There is no standardized protocol for the management of pain following 
the Nuss procedure.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_41808] 
(PCA) are the two most commonly used techniques, employed either 
independently or together. While epi[INVESTIGATOR_41809], it carries 
significant risks and is limited to the first two to three post- operative days, at 
which time patients must be transitioned to alternate methods.  Cryoanalgesia 
is a means of long -term local nerve blockade, which has previously been 
used in adults for acute pain control following thoracotomy, as well as for 
treatment of chronic thoracic pain due to surgery or post -herpetic neuralgia. 
Anecdotally, cr yoanalgesia has been effective at controlling acute post -
operative pain following the Nuss procedure.  The procedure is particularly 
well-suited to the application of cryoanalgesia, as the operative exposure 
directly visualizes the intercostal nerves. However, no randomized trials 
have been performed to more rigorously evaluate this treatment.   We 
therefore propose a randomized, prospective trial to evaluate cryoanalgesia 
compared to epi[INVESTIGATOR_41810].  
 
  STUDY DESIGN This study is  a prospective, randomized trial to compare cryoanalgesia to 
standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_41811] -operative pain management in patients 
undergoing minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair (the Nuss 
procedure). 20 subjects will be randomized in 1:[ADDRESS_43987] -operative length of stay in patients receiving cryoanalgesia

• Pain medicatio n usage  
• Side effects 
• Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41817].  
  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Patient baseline characteristics will be analyzed with descriptive statistics 
(ie. mean age, % male, mean pectus severity index, etc.).  
Our primary outcome will be post -operative length of stay, which will be 
analyzed using a two -tailed unpaired t tes t, with results considered 
statistically significant for p< 0.05.  
Secondary outcomes include post -operative pain scores, pain medication 
usage, and side effects.   Pain scores will be analyzed with Mann -Whitney 
rank sum tests (to compare between groups at e ach time point) and 
Wilcoxson signed- rank test (to compare scores within groups over time), 
with results considered statistically significant for p< 0.05..   Pain medication 
usage between the two groups will be analyzed with two- tailed unpaired t 
test, agai n with results considered statistically significant for p< 0.05.   
Given our small sample size and the low rate of complications with both 
analgesic methods, we expect very limited side effect data. A descriptive 
overall side effect rate will be calculated  for each arm of the study, and the 
individual side effects will be listed in a table.  
A cost analysis will be performed, comparing the total cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41818].  Difference in total cost will 
be assessed with two -tailed unpaired t test.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Rationale for Number of 
Subjects  We used the UCSF Clinical & Translational Science Institute web -based 
sample size calculator ( http://www.sample -size.net/sampl e-size-means/ ) to 
determine study size.   Based on previous Nuss procedures over the past [ADDRESS_43991] 
approximately 2 days shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   With type 1 error rate of 0.05 
and type II error rate of 0.1 (yielding 90% pow er), our study would need 18 
patients total.   Allowing for some dropout, we will plan to enroll 20 patients 
to the study.

Hippocrates (460- 377 BC), who described the use of ice and snow packs for relieving surgical 
pain.12 Today, the term “cryoanalgesia” refers to the localized freezing of peripheral nerves.   
Freezing occurs through application of a “cryoprobe,” whic h releases high -pressure carbon 
dioxide or nitrous oxide that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_41820], causing cooling via the Joule -Thomson effect to 
temperatures of - 50 to - 70 °C.  This sudden freezing causes the formation of intra- and 
extracellular ice crystals, which disrupt the cell wall and alter cellular osmolality.   When nerve 
axons are frozen, Wallerian degeneration occurs, preventing the transmission of pain signals and 
providing analgesia.  However, the fibrous neural structures, including the perineurium and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_41821] , are able to resist damage and remain intact, which facilitates axonal regeneration. 10,12-

cryoanalgesia have demonstrated that repair and regeneration of the axon and myelin sheath 
following cryoanalgesia is complete by [CONTACT_3450] 4- [ADDRESS_43994] of cold on the nervous system since

commonly performed in this age -group, it is important for this study to include these patients to 
ensure the data is applicable to the pertinent patien t population.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
We believe that cryoanalgesia may provide better post -operative pain control following the 
Nuss procedure than the current standard therapy, thus allowing patients to return home sooner 
after surgery.   This randomize d study will demonstrate whether this hypothesis is valid.   If so, it 
will provide convincing data to encourage other surgeons to adopt this new method, benefitting 
future patients who undergo the Nuss procedure by [CONTACT_41841] d with 
the procedure. Furthermore, the post -operative pain and long hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41822], and knowing that the post -operative course is less arduous may 
make patients more comfortable prior to surgery.  Shortening the post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41823]; the cost analysis included in the study will further define the possible cost savings. 
Even if this study shows  there is no benefit with cryoanalgesia, and, in fact, the current 
standard thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_41824], this is also important information for physicians

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  8 STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Prior to enrollment, the patients will be randomly assigned to cryoanalgesia or thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_41827] a 1:1 ratio using a computerized random sequence generator ( http://www.random.org/ ). 
The values 1 -20 are entered in the system, which creates a random sequence of the integers, 
formatted in 2 columns of 10 integers each.  Column 1 is assigned to cryoanalgesia, and column 
two is assi gned to thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873].  The assignments are placed in closed envelopes with the 
integers on the outside of the envelopes.  The study surgeons are blinded to the randomization. As 
patients are enrolled in the study, they are assigned an integer in order  of enrollment (the first 
patient enrolled is patient 1, the next patient 2, etc.).  The envelope associated with each patient 
number is opened on the morning of surgery, revealing their group assignment. 
8.2 Blinding  
Due to the nature of the study, it is not possible to blind patients or clinicians to the method of 
analgesia once the patient’s group is revealed.  However, to prevent selection bias, the study 
clinicians and patients will be blinded to the randomization process and selection until the time of 
surgery.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REP ORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatment.  An  AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration 
of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An 
unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information 
in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each 
subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be 
recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop d ates 
and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
AE Severity  
The guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out 
that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; n o medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked lim itation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have c aused death if it were more severe.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015   
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines 
in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE  Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment 
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:

Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Interference with randomization  
• Non-compliance with study drug regimen 
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
violation. The investigator  will determine if a protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a 
subject.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor 
representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder 
and in the Sponsor’s files.  
14 STATISTICAL METHODS A ND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to 
the analysis plan described below.

Nuss procedures over the past [ADDRESS_44020] approximately 2 days shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836].   With type 
1 error rate of 0.05 and type II error rate of 0.1 (yielding 90% power), our study would need [ADDRESS_44021]’s 
visit into the protocol- specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) OR paper CRF when the 
information corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_41850] (or designee), but will be 
identified by a subject number.  
For eCRFs: If a correction is required for an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track the person 
entering or updating eCRF data and creates  an electronic audit trail.  For paper CRFs:   If a 
correction is made on a CRF, the study staff member will line through the incorrect data, write in 
the correct data and initial and date the change. 
The Investigator is responsible for all information coll ected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All

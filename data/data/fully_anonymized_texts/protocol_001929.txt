CONFIDENTIAL4.0 OBJECTIVES
4.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objective is:
!To describe the initial tolerability and safety and identify a recommended phase [ADDRESS_810797] GvHD 
prophylaxis therapy (tacrolimus plus short-term methotrexate) in patients undergoing 
allo-HSCT.
4.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives are:
!To characterize the PK of vedolizumab in patients on Days -1, +13 and +[ADDRESS_810798].
!To determine the cumulative incidence and severity of acute GvHD (compi[INVESTIGATOR_611472], skin, or liver) at [ADDRESS_810799].
!To determine the distribution of maximum severity of acute GvHD throughout the 
100-day period after allo-HSCT.
4.3 Exploratory Objectives
The exploratory objectives are:
CCI
Vedolizumab-[ADDRESS_810800] disease (GvHD) 
prophylaxis (tacrolimus plus short-term methotrexate) in adult patients (18—75 years old) 
undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Vedolizumab dose 
finding will be cohort based and follow a rule-based dose-finding study design with 
pharmacokinetic (PK) guidance. After a tolerated dose with acceptable PK has been identified, 
the cohort at that dose level may be expanded to further assess the tolerability and effectiveness 
of vedolizumab. 
Eligibility will be determined during the Screening period, which may last for up to 28 days 
before Day –1 (designation of the day of the fi rst IV infusion of vedolizumab). Patients who  
meet all eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will be enrolled in this study. 
Vedolizumab will be administered initially on Day –[ADDRESS_810801] and then on Days +13 
and +[ADDRESS_810802] or until the patient’s death or withdrawal of consent or 
termination of the study by [CONTACT_456]. All patients will be followed for overall survival (OS) 
until death, withdrawal of consent, termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], or for a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_810803] patient is enrolled in the study. Patients will attend a Day +100 visit (±7 
days) at which time they will enter post treatment follow-up. 
Dose escalation will start with a low-dose cohort receiving vedolizumab at 75 mg IV on Day –1 
and on Days +13 and +[ADDRESS_810804]. HSC infusion should occur on Day 0 (no sooner than 
12 hours after completion of IV infusion of vedo lizumab on Day –1). The first patient in each 
dosing cohort will then be monitored for dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) from the start of the 
first IV infusion of vedolizumab on Day –1 to Day +[ADDRESS_810805] (the DLT observation 
period) including assessment for neutrophil recovery by [CONTACT_2006] +28. If the first patient in the first CCI
Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_810806] 3 patients experience DLTs, the next cohort will 
receive vedo lizumab 300 mg IV on Day –1 and on Day s +13 and +[ADDRESS_810807] 3 patients in the 
cohort experiences a DLT, then 3 additional pat ients will be enro lled at the same dose level and 
monitored for DLTs from Day  –1 until  Day +28. If none of the addit ional pat ients experi ence a 
DLT, then the decisio n on whether to increase the vedo lizumab IV dose in the next cohort will 
be guided by [CONTACT_611477]. If 2 or more patients in a cohort of eithe r 3 or 6 pati ents experience 
a DLT, then the dose of vedo lizumab IV for the next cohort of 3 patients will be reduced. These 
patients will  be monitored f or DLTs in the same manner that patients in the previous cohort were 
monitored. DLT will be considered as a part of the PK/PD analysis and will be further outlined 
in the Clinical Pharmaco logy Analysis Plan (CPAP).
The graphical study  design is presented on Figure 4.a.

7.2.5 Conventions for Missing Concomitant Medication Dates
Start and stop dates for all conco mitant medicat ions are collected on the CRF. However, in case 
of missing or partial informat ion in these dates, the fo llowing rul es will  be used:
If the start date i s missing or parti al:
-If the day  is missin g, the start day will be the first day  of the m onth
-If the month is missing, the start month will be the mo nth cor responding to [ADDRESS_810824] study  medicat ion date
-If the year i s miss ing, the start year will be the year of the entry  visit (or consent date, 
for those missing entry  visit)
-If the entire date is missing, the start date will be the date of first study  drug 
administration
If the stop date is missing, partial or “continuing:”
-If the day  is missing, the stop day  will be the last day  of the m onth reported
-If the month is missing, the stop month will be the month during which the last dose 
of induct ion treatment was administered 
-If the year or the ent ire date i s missing or if th emedication is “cont inuing”, the stop 
year will be the y ear in which the last dose of induction treatment was administered.
Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_810825] Di sease will  be defined according to the 
modified Glucksberg criteria and Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT 
CTN)- modified Internat ional Bone Marrow Transplant Registry  Database (IBMTR) index (See
Appendix D).
The classificat ion the following rules apply :
1)For every  organ involvement ( skin, liver, or intestinal) i ftheGvHD invo lvement is 
marked as “YES” forthis organ involvement (skin, liver, or intestinal) on eCRF. andthe 
stage of this organ invo lvement is ≥ 1, t he subjects should to be coun ted as having GvHD
involvement for this organ (skin, liver, or intestinal respectively ). 
2)If the invo lvement of an organ (Skin, Liver, or Intestinal) is marked as “YES ” but the 
stage of invo lvement is = 0, then the subject shou ld not be counted as having GvHD of 
that organ.
3)A subject should be counted as having overall GvHD if this subject has at least one organ 
involvement with stage ≥1. 
4)To assess the grade level for Liver GvHD invo lvement, t he maximal bilirubin level 
within the visit window shoul d be used (See Table 7.a).
7.3 Populations for Analys es
The fo llowing popul ations will be used for analysis:
Safety population: The populat ion of patients evaluable for vedo lizumab safet y is 
defined as all pat ients who receive any  amount of  vedo lizumab IV.
PK population: Defined as patients fro m the safety set with at least 1 PK sample 
collected. 
PD population: Defined as pat ients from the safety set with at least 1 PD sample 
collected.
For the primary  endpoint, an evaluable pat ient is one who receives vedo lizumab IV and is 
assessed for engraft ment on or before Day  +28.
Any additional analyses/sub -analyses for cohorts wil l be outlined in the CPAP , if deemed 
necessary .

3Synopsis  
Study Description
The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) ascertain whether the transition to online ordering 
at a choice-based food pantry network in [LOCATION_001] City influences food security status 
among 386 food pantry clients and 2) determine whether there are differences in outcome 
by [CONTACT_551] (18-61 vs. 62 years). 
To accomplish Aim 1, study team members will conduct a natural experiment with two 
conditions in food pantry sites within the Met Council Kosher Food Pantry Network. To 
accomplish Aim 2, we will test for potential interaction effects at the individual-level by [CONTACT_21789]. 
Overall, the research study will occur over 18 months (see timeline below). Year 1 will 
involve survey design and data collection. Year 2 will involve data analysis and development 
of dissemination materials.

61 – Statement of Compliance  
1.1 Statement of Compliance
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations on the 
Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46), any other applicable US government research 
regulations, and institutional research policies and procedures. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21778], or changes to the protocol will take place without prior agreement 
from the sponsor and documented approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the study participants. All personnel 
involved in the conduct of this study have completed Human Subjects Protection Training.

In NYC, 1.5 million residents are food insecure, a 36% increase from before the COVID-19 
pandemic.14 Evidence from survey research suggests that food insecurity and hunger are also 
higher among immigrants (vs. non-immigrants) and older (vs. younger) adults in NYC, 
potentially due to higher rates of income inadequacy and fixed incomes, respectively.15-17These 
disparities are likely to grow in the future given how population growth in NYC is driven by [CONTACT_21790], and how population growth of older adults is driven by [CONTACT_21791].18
In the Parent Grant, we established how nutrition assistance programs, such as meal delivery 
programs and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), address key barriers to 
healthy eating in low-income adults. Food pantries are also a key source of nutrition and healthy 
foods for low-income adults, especially for low-income older adults, who use food pantries as 
their primary source of food assistance.19,[ADDRESS_20741] of emergency food resources may be disproportionately higher in immigrant 
(vs. non-immigrant) communities,27 potentially due to stigma, fear of interaction with government 
representatives (e.g. NYPD, ICE), and other factors.28Evidence from qualitative research, for 
example, suggests that the stigma of waiting in public to be served reduces utilization and 
satisfaction of food pantries.29This was corroborated by a recent review study noting how food 
pantry clients describe reasonable wait times and an “easy process” as a cornerstones of good 
customer service in food pantry settings.30Thus, strategies to increase food pantry use may 
support food security and healthy eating behaviors among low-income adults, especially those 
designed to mitigating the high opportunity costs of waiting in line and stigma, such as digital 
ordering. 
In the Parent Grant, we are leveraging the rapid growth in online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21779]. The recent shift to online 
ordering in some food pantries affords a similar opportunity to support food security and a 
healthy diet among low-income adults, which we aim to leverage in this Administrative 
Supplement. Online ordering is available in a small number of food pantries across the U.S., 
such as the Portland Open Bible Community Pantry in Portland, OR and The Open Door in 
Essex County, MA, largely due to increases in food insecurity and social distancing measures 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.31,32Anecdotal evidence suggests online ordering has 
contributed to increased food pantry use, potentially due to reductions in wait times, reduced 
stigmatization , and increases in self-efficacy and self-sufficiency .33-37Increases in food pantry, in

intake relative to a traditional distribution model,38,39especially in combination with changes to 
food “pricing” (e.g., assigning foods with high nutritional value fewer points than less healthy 
food). To our knowledge, however, there have been no evaluations of the transition to online 
ordering in food pantries.

REDCap form to facilitate data collection in the follow-up period, which will be conducted 
virtually, and to distribute gift cards.  The REDCap data will not be linked to Qualtrics survey 
responses. The content of the participants’ responses to survey questions will pertain only to 
their food and nutrition security status, intake of key foods, and frequency of food pantry visits. 
We will not be asking for information that could place the participants at risk of criminal or civil 
liability or be damaging to the participants’ financial standing or employability. 
 
Participants may receive texting over mobile/cell phones and this method of communication 
may also result in a breach of their confidential information because text messages to 
mobile/cell phones are not encrypted. This method of communication will only be used with 
participants’ agreement/consent.

104 - Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design
This research study includes two aims, though only Aim 1 involves human subjects. The 
duration of the study is 18 months. 
In Aim 1, study team members will recruit low-income adults aged 18 years. Participants will 
be recruited from a food pantry that is not scheduled to transition to online ordering (control) and 
a food pantry that is scheduled to transition to online ordering after the baseline data collection 
period (intervention). Participants in both arms will complete an in-person survey. Potential 
participants who are not able to take the survey in-person, will be offered the option to take the 
survey online. To assess potential changes in fruit and vegetable intake, we will administer the 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 6-item brief dietary assessment tool 
(questions 9-14 in the survey attached in Research Navigator).  A Research Assistant will 
record the food items they received in the relevant visit to the pantry. After the transition to 
online ordering at the intervention food pantry, participants will again complete the survey over 
the phone. The survey will be administered by a member of the study team using the Follow-Up 
Survey Guide. Participants in the control arm will record their food selections and send them to 
the study team during the phone call. Food selections for participants in the intervention arm will 
be accessible through the online ordering platform. The study team will then analyze the 
baseline and follow-up data for differences in outcomes between study conditions. 
 
In Aim 2, we will test for potential interaction effects at the individual-level by [CONTACT_21792] (18-

meet all of the following criteria:  
 
1) aged 18 years or older 
2) have capacity and willingness to provide consent  
 
In order to be eligible for participation in Aim [ADDRESS_20747] meet all of the following criteria:  
 
1) aged 18 years or older 
2) have capacity and willingness to provide consent  
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
The exclusion criteria for both arms of Aim 1 include: 1) aged <[ADDRESS_20748] to transition with their food pantry to online ordering 
after the baseline data collection period regardless of their participation in this research study. 
The change will be brought on “naturally” by [CONTACT_21793] (not the NYULH researchers or 
specifically as part of this research study). There will be no other restrictions during any other 
parts of the study pertaining to lifestyle and/or diet.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_20749] a control site that is similar to the intervention site 
based on food pantry characteristics (e.g., number of food pantry clients per week, primary 
language(s) spoken) and community-level characteristics (e.g., neighborhood poverty level).  
 
IRB-approved NYULH study personnel will recruit participants in person at two Met Council food 
pantries and will obtain permission from the food pantries prior to in-person recruitment at their 
Study Number: s22-[ADDRESS_20750] and/or pass out informing clients of the study and directing them 
to scan a QR code for the consent form with more information about the study and access to the 
study team’s contact [CONTACT_3031]. After scanning the QR code, clients will first see a short 
paragraph (“Pre-Consent QR Code Copy”) listing the eligibility requirements and explaining 
what the consent is, in addition to a note that they do not need to sign the form at that moment. 
After the short paragraph, they will be able to scroll down to view the consent.  
 
We will collect names, phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses from 
participants in a secure REDCap form to facilitate the follow-up data collection, which will be 
conducted virtually, and to distribute gift cards. 
 
Screen failures include those who do not meet all of our inclusion criteria. Potential participants 
will be asked to answer one pre-screening question about their age to determine their eligibility. 
If they do not meet our inclusion criteria, these participants will be told by [CONTACT_21794], “Thank you for your time, but unfortunately, you are not eligible for this study.” We will 
immediately discard information from screen failures and from individuals that do not provide 
consent to take part in this study. Re-screening is not applicable. 
 
Prior to the follow-up period, the study team will provide the food pantry with a flyer and post-
card-sized handouts to remind participants of the upcoming follow-up surveys. 
 
Aim 2 will not involve any participant recruitment.

136 - Study Procedures
6.1 Aim 1 
 
Data collection in the baseline period will occur during the two to four month period prior to the 
intervention month (months t-2 to t-4), and data collection in the follow-up period will occur 
during the two-to-four-month period after the transition to digital ordering (months t+2 to t+4). 
The months immediately preceding (t-1) and following (t+1) the intervention month will be 
omitted to account for potential uncertainty in the implementation of online ordering and to allow 
for sufficient time for food pantry clients to return to their food pantry, respectively.  
 
For the baseline period/visit (in person), consent will take place in person at the food pantry and 
data collection will take place in person at the food pantry, with the option to take the survey 
online offered on a case-by-case basis. The following will occur for both arms: 
 
 Participants will be asked to complete a survey about their food and nutrition security, 
diet behaviors, and frequency of food pantry visits. The survey will take about 10 
minutes to complete. Survey responses will be collected using Qualtrics. 
 
 We will administer the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 6-item brief 
dietary assessment tool to participants in both arms to assess potential changes in fruit 
and vegetable intake (questions 9-14 in the survey attached in Research Navigator).  
 
 Participants will be given a card with an appointment time of their choosing that falls 
within the follow-up period, which will also include the phone number for an IRB-
approved NYULH study personnel that they can reach if they need to re-schedule.  
 
 The food pantry items selected by [CONTACT_21795]-person by [CONTACT_21796]. It will take approximately [ADDRESS_20751] the participants’ food selections. 
 
For the follow-up period/visit (virtual/phone): 
 
 Intervention Arm 
 
o We will send follow-up reminders to participants via email and/or text, based on 
their preference.  
 
o Participants will be asked to complete a survey by [CONTACT_21797], diet behaviors, and frequency of food pantry visits. The survey 
will take approximately 20-25 minutes to complete. The survey will be 
administered by a member of the study team using the Follow-Up Survey Guide. 
 
o Data on participants’ food selections will be gathered from the online ordering 
system. This data will be provided to the study team by [CONTACT_21798]. Participants 
will not need to wait for the Research Assistant to record their selections.

157 - Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal
7.1 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
The participants are allowed to withdraw from the study at any point with no penalty.
7.[ADDRESS_20753] to Follow-Up  
Not applicable. 
 
Study Number: s22-[ADDRESS_20754] the working hypotheses that 1) food security will improve (i.e. food security 
score will decrease) among participants visiting a food pantry that transition to online ordering in 
the follow-up period, but not among those in the control arm, and 2) participants visiting a food 
pantry that transitions to online ordering will also select more fruits and vegetables per visit, 
have higher fruit and vegetable intake, and spend less time accessing food pantries in the 
follow-up (vs. baseline) period compared to those in the control arm. 
For Aim 2, we hypothesize that improvements in food security due to online ordering will be 
larger for younger adults. 
 
8.2 Sample Size Considerations  
To calculate our sample size, we used estimates from a similar study that found that a food 
bank-delivered intervention (diabetes-appropriate food packages, text-based health education, 
and referrals to health care) resulted in a decrease in the mean food security score from 2.8 to 
2.3, or a 6.3% decrease in the percentage of participants with low or very low food security 
status.[ADDRESS_20755] deviation of the food security score is 1.5 
and estimate that 155 participants in each condition (total n=310) will provide 90% power to 
detect a 0.5 difference in food security score between experimental and control conditions. To 
account for a potential attrition rate of 20% in the follow-up period, we plan to recruit a total 
sample size of 193 participants per condition (total n=386). 
 
8.3 Populations for Analyses  
The study population is a sample of adults aged 18 years.  
 
8.4 Statistical Analyses  
We will perform a linear regression to assess balance of demographic characteristics between 
conditions; because of the natural experiment design, these characteristics should be balanced. 
To assess differences in outcomes between study conditions, we will regress the outcome 
variable on indicator variables for the experimental conditions, with the control condition as the 
reference group; if necessary, we will also adjust for any respondent characteristics that may be 
unbalanced by [CONTACT_3004]. The design and methods proposed will achieve robust and unbiased 
results because random assignment to an intervention group or control group in the context of a 
natural experiment minimizes bias. 
We will also test for potential interaction effects at the individual-level by [CONTACT_21800] (18-
clients served are above [ADDRESS_20756] adequate variation to assess potential 
interactions by [CONTACT_551]. For assessing differences in the frequency of food pantry visits per 
month at the food pantry-level, we will also add an interaction term for age group, which the 
Study Number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] 
 September 7, 2023 
17food pantry network measures as child (<18 years), adult (18-61 years), and older adult (
years). 
 
8.4.1 General Approach  
For Aim 1, we will examine differences in outcomes between study conditions, including food 
and nutrition security, intake of key foods, and frequency of food pantry visits. 
For Aim 2, we will examine differences in outcomes between adult (18-61 years) and older adult 
 
 
8.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary outcome for Aim 1 is food security status. We will use the  [LOCATION_002] 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) six-item food security survey module to assess food security 
status, where the range of points is zero to six points, and higher points corresponds to lower 
food security.41 Food security status will be categorized according to USDA guidelines, including 
very low (5-6); low (2–4); and high or marginal (0-1) food security. We will perform a linear 
regression to assess balance of demographic characteristics between conditions; because of 
the natural experiment design, these characteristics should be balanced. To assess differences 
in outcomes between study conditions, we will regress the outcome variable on indicator 
variables for the experimental conditions, with the control condition as the reference group; if 
necessary, we will also adjust for any respondent characteristics that may be unbalanced by 
[CONTACT_3004]. 
The primary outcome for Aim [ADDRESS_20757] for potential interaction effects at the individual-level by [CONTACT_21792] (18-
25% of clients served are above [ADDRESS_20758] adequate variation to assess 
potential interactions by [CONTACT_551]. 
 
8.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The secondary outcomes for Aim 1 include changes in: 1) total cup-equivalents of fruits and 
vegetables selected per visit; 2) intake of fruits and vegetables; 3) time to obtain food from food 
pantry per visit (minutes); and 4) individual-level frequency of food pantry visits per month (n). 
To capture a potential increase in new clients visiting the food pantry due to the transition to 
online ordering, we will also measure changes in the frequency of food pantry visits per month 
at the food pantry-level (n). 
The primary outcome for Aim 2 is the same as Aim 1 and measured using the same 
specifications, including number of fruits and vegetables selected per visit; total energy intake; 
intake of key food groups; time to obtain food from food pantry per visit; and individual-level and 
food pantry-level frequency of food pantry visits per month. For assessing differences in the 
frequency of food pantry visits per month at the food pantry-level, we will add an interaction term 
for age group, which the food pantry network measures as child (<18 years), adult (18-61 
years), and older adult ( ).

For Aim 1, we will examine differences in outcomes between study conditions, including food 
and nutrition security, intake of fruits and vegetables, and frequency of food pantry visits. We 
will perform a linear regression to assess balance of demographic characteristics between 
conditions; because of the natural experiment design, these characteristics should be balanced. 
To assess differences in outcomes between study conditions, we will regress the outcome

199 – Ethical Considerations  
9.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21780] 45 CFR Part 46.  
 
The protocol, study information sheet (with key information), application for waiver of 
documentation of consent, recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted 
to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent materials 
must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require 
review and approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes 
to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether 
previously consented participants need to be re-consented. 
 
9.2 Informed Consent Process  
 
9.2.1 Consent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants  
 
Consent materials describing in detail the study, study procedures, and risks will be given to the 
participant and documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting study. 
 
9.2.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation  
 
Aim 1: IRB-approved NYULH study personnel will obtain verbal informed consent from 
participants in a private space at the food pantry. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to potential participants. Potential participants will be 
given an IRB-approved study information sheet (with key information) and asked to review the 
document. The NYULH study personnel will explain the research study to potential participants 
and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in 
terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the 
study and of their rights as research participants. Potential participants will have the opportunity 
to carefully review the consent document and ask questions prior to consenting. Potential 
participants will also have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or friends or think 
about it prior to agreeing to participate. Participants will give their verbal consent prior to any 
study procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants may withdraw consent at 
any time throughout the course of the study. The rights and welfare of the participants will be 
protected by [CONTACT_21802]. 
 
The consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be thoroughly 
documented in the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard consent process 
Study Number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] 
 September 7, 2023 
20(e.g. use of a translator, consent from a legally authorized representative, consent document 
presented orally, etc.) and the justification for such alteration will likewise be documented.  
Aim 2: NA 
9.3 Study Discontinuation and Closure  
The study will be terminated or temporarily suspended based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_21781], IRB decision in the 
event of an Unanticipated Problem. If an unanticipated problem is recognized, data collection 
will stop and any corrective action or explanation that can be given to participants experiencing 
this issue will be administered. Then, a modification to rectify the issue will be submitted to the 
IRB (and details sent to the sponsor if applicable) and new methods to avoid the problem will be 
used going forward. The study team will work with the IRB to ensure that any problems 
participants experienced prior to the change are ethically addressed. The consent document 
also includes text that informs the participants they can call or email the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_21782]. We will also inform participants that any questions, concerns, suggestions, 
or complaints that have not been or cannot be addressed by [CONTACT_3021], or if they wish to 
report research-related harm, they can contact [CONTACT_1201]. 
9.[ADDRESS_20760] by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, 
and the sponsor(s) and their agents. No information concerning the study or the data will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
 
We will only collect names, phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses from 
participants in a secure REDCap form during the baseline data collection period to facilitate 
follow-up data collection, which will be conducted virtually, and to distribute gift cards. Only the 
study team will have access to the data. PII will not be connected to Qualtrics survey responses. 
Extreme care will be taken to guarantee confidentiality of participants’ responses. 
 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be 
obtained from the NIH. This certificate protects identifiable research information from forced 
disclosure. It allows the investigator and others who have access to research records to refuse 
to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, 
legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level. By [CONTACT_21803], Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research objectives and 
promote participation in studies by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_21783].

219.5 Future Use of Stored Data  
Study data will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close out or 5 years after final 
reporting/publication. We are not be storing data beyond the current research study for future 
research and publications. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if 
required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the

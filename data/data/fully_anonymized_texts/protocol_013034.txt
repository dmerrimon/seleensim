Protocol Title: A multi-site, open -label extension trialof oral RPC1063 inrelapsing multiple 
sclerosis
Protocol No: RPC01-3001 (EudraCT Number 2015-002500-91)
Investigators: Approximately 275that participated in Trial RPC01- 201,Trial RPC01-301 , and/or 
Trial RPC01-1001
Regions North America, Europe, South Africa, and New Zealand 
Trial Duration :
Estimated date first patient enrolled: November [ADDRESS_1027935] patient completed: December 2022Phase: 3
Objectives:
Primary:
To characterize the long -term safety and tolerability of RPC1063 in patients with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis
Secondary:
To characterize the long -term efficacy of RPC1063 in patients with relapsing multiple 
sclerosis
Methodology:
This is a multi-site, open -label extension trial of oral RPC1063 (ozanimod HCl) 1 mg (equivalent to 
ozanimod 0.92 mg) administered once daily to patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS )who 
are eligible according to the enrollment criteria and complete done of the following trials : RPC01-201,
RPC01- 301, or RPC01 -1001 ( the “parent trials ”).  Regardless of treatmen t assignment in the parent 
trial, patients will receive RPC1063 at a dos e of 1 mg daily in RPC01 -3001 after a 7 -day dose escalation
regimen , as applicable (0.[ADDRESS_1027936] ).  
Approval from the Sponsor’s representative is required for enrollment more than 14 days after the 
patient’s last dose of investigational drug in the parent trial, and the patient must under go RPC1063 
dose escalation . Patients will receive RPC1063 at 1 mg/day until the end of the trial or until the Sponsor  
discontinues the development program .
Scheduled trial visits include :
Baseline (Day 1)
Evaluations every 3 months (91 days) and every 12 months, as specified in the schedule 
of events.  After a patient reaches their 3rdannual visit, the Every 3 -Month Visit will

6become the Every 6 -Month Visit (one visit between annual visits instead of 3).  Annual 
visits (Every 12 Months) are unchanged.
Early Termination /End of Treatment Visit
Visits at 1, 4, 7, 14, and [ADDRESS_1027937] dose of investigational drug to assess 
dependence and withdrawal symptoms 
Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) Follow -up Visit(s) every 14 days (± 3 days) after the 
last dose of investigational drug until ALC is above the lower l imit of normal (LLN) (the 
Medical Monitor should be consulted if the ALC is not > LLN by [CONTACT_48657] 90 Safety 
Follow -up Visit, and ALC visits should continue every 14 days (± 3 days)  until the 
Investigator is notified to discontinue).
Safety Follow -up Visit 28days after the last dose of investigational drug
Safety Follow -up Visit [ADDRESS_1027938] dose of investigational drug
In the event that commercial ozanimod or an access program becomes available prior to 
December 2022, subjects may transition to t he commercial product after discussion with 
the Investigator at his/her discretion. Subjects who transition to commercial ozanimod 
are not required to attend safety follow -up visits after their end of treatment visit as long 
as commercial ozanimod is star ted within 14 days of discontinuation of study drug. 
Otherwise, all other subjects continuing in the study and subsequently discontinuing prior 
to the availability of commercial ozanimod in their country/state or by [CONTACT_750793].
Trial assessments include evaluation of adverse events (AEs), review of concomitant medications, 
clinical laboratory tests, assessment of immune response, pharmacokinetic ( PK)sampling, physical and 
neurological examination ( magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ]with and without gadolinium contrast), 
vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), optical coher ence tomography (OCT), 
pulmonary function tests, dermatological examination, and Columbia Suicide Sever ity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) evaluation. The Cognitive Function subscale of the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 
(MSQOL -54) will be assessed to evaluate quality of life and subjective cognitive impair ment. In 
addition to the C
-SSRS, the physician’s withdrawal checklist (PWC -20), the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750775] n scale (HADS), and the Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526] (ESS) will be administered to assess 
dependence and withdrawal symptoms. These assessments will be administered on at least [ADDRESS_1027939] 80 evaluable patient s after discontinui ng study drug. All patient s should 
undergo these assessments until the Sponsor decides that no further withdrawal assessments are 
required.
Refer to the full protocol for instructions regarding baseline assessments .
If a patient experiences a relapse after completing a parent trial, but prior to entering RPC01- 3001, the 
patient may remain eligible for RPC01- 3001. Ther e is no minimum waiting period following the 
relapse; however, the Investigator should confirm that the patient is neurologically and medically stable
prior to initiating investigational drug .
Patients will be evaluated for relapses throughout the trial, including during the Safety Follow -upVisit ,
and patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_750794]. Number: 25840251 - 25791526Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No. RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027940] half a point 
on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or 2 points on one of the appropriate Functional 
System (FS) scores, or [ADDRESS_1027941] rating (EDSS 
or FS scores) that did not occur during a relapse .  The change in FS scale scores should correspond to 
the patient’s sym ptoms (eg, patient reported change in visual acuity should correspond to a change in 
the vision FS score).  Sympt oms must persist for > 24 hours and should not be attributable to 
confounding clinical factors (eg, fever, infection, injury, adverse reactions to concomitant medications).
Patients who are withdrawn early from the trial will be required to visit the trial site as soon as possible 
so that the Early Termination assessments can be conducted. Patients who 
withdraw from the trialwill 
be followed for collection of safety data, including lymphocyte recovery.   In addition, PK samples will 
be collected at the End of Treatment/Early Termination Visit, and for Day 28 and Day 90 Safety Follow -
up Visits.
Planned Number of Patients (approximately ): 
Based on an estimated dropout rate of 10% per year, a pproximately 2350 patients may be eligible for 
enrollment in the trialdepending on completion of one of the parent trials .

Safety
All safety data will be listed and summarized for the safety population. Adverse events will be 
monitored during the trialand the data analyzed with respect to incidence overall as well as severity 
and potential relationship of the A Es to investigational drug .  Adverse events with onset on, or after 
the first dose of investiga tional drug or with onset prior to the first dose of investigational drug that 
increase in severity on, or after the first dose of investigational drug will be considered treatment -
emergent. Treatment -emer gent A Es will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657], 
and presented in descending order of frequency within each system organ class.  Serious A Es, AEs of 
special interest, and A Es leading to withdrawal from the trialwill be summarized similarly.
Associated laboratory parameters such as he patic profile, renal function, and hematology values will 
be grouped and presented together.  For each laboratory test, individual patient values outside the 
standard reference range will be flagged and listed.  Shift tables will be produced showing the 
frequency of shifts from Baseline to the worst on- trialvalue in and out of the normal range as well as 
by [CONTACT_765].  Changes from Baseline to each visit for each laboratory parameter will also be summarized.

10The change from Baseline to each visit for each of t he vital signs parameters will be summarized.  
The change from Baseline to each applicable visit for each of the ECG parameters will also be 
summarized. 
For each dependence and withdrawal assessment (PWC -20, HADS, ESS, C-SSRS ,and vital signs) 
changes fro m the last assessment on study drug to post study drug Day s 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 , and 90 will be 
summarized .
Efficacy
For the annualized relapse rate , the number of patients with relapses, the total number of relapses, the 
patient -years on trial, the unadjusted annualized relapse rate, and the patient relapse rate will be 
presented.  The unadjusted annualized relapse rate will be calculated as (total number of relapses) / 
(total days in the trial) * 365.25.  The relapse rate will be based on only those relapses that were 
deter mined by [CONTACT_750795] -defined definition of relapse, based on 
the EDSS scores. New or recurrent neurological symptoms that occur less than [ADDRESS_1027943] 
onset days that are ≤[ADDRESS_1027944] relapse and time to onset of disability progression will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier
methods .  The estimated median time to event will be reported, along with the associated 95% CI.  
Disability progressions confirmed after 3 months and after 6months will be analyzed separately.
Other efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_750796] d escriptive statistics or counts and 
percentages as appropriate.

185. INTRODUCTION
5.1. Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central 
nervous system (CNS), characterized by  [CONTACT_750797], demyelinat ion, neuronal and 
oligodendrocy te loss, and disrupt ion of the blood -brain barrier.  The disease has a prevalence 
estimated at greater than 400,000 patie nts in the US and over 2.5 millio n individuals worl dwide 
(Noseworthy 2000).  Currently there is no cure for MS. Pathophy siologically , MS is driven by  
[CONTACT_750798], 
resul ting in demyelinat ion and axonal damage.  The utilit y of treati ng MS wit h immune 
modulat ing drugs has been well -established.  The goal of current treatment strategies for MS 
involves improving the qualit y of life o f patients by  [CONTACT_750799].
Current ly approved first -line immune -modulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_750778] (IFN)
-β 
products, glat iramer acetate (GA) and fingolimod. I FN-β and GA are disease -modifying 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_89149] m oderate efficacy , redu ce the rel apse rate by  [CONTACT_3450] 30% and reduce 
disabili ty accumulat ion compared to placebo ( IFNB Mult ipleSclerosi s Study  Group 1993; 
Jacobs 1996 ; PRISMS 1998
; Johnson 1995; Goodin 2002 ).  Response to treatment with IFN- β
products may be related to vari ation in a gene called interferon regulatory  factor 5 ( IRF5 )and the 
interferon gene signature, and may be asses sed based on data collected in this trial and the parent 
trials (Vossl amber 2011 ). Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal ant ibody , is another approved 
immune -modulating therapy that has been shown to reduce relapse rates by  68% and reduces the 
risk of sustai ned progression o f disabili ty by 42% com pared to pl acebo ( Polman 2006).  
Natalizumab acts by [CONTACT_750800].  Each of 
these drugs is characterized by  a combinat ion of limited therapeutic ut ility, safet y concerns 
and/or drug compliance issues, suggest ing the need for the development of effective, well 
tolerated orally  active MS therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].
5.2. RPC1063
RPC1063 (o zanimod hydrochloride [HCl ]
)is a sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S1P) receptor 
modulator, which binds wit h high affinit y select ively to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 
subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P 1and S1P 5). RPC1063 causes lymphocyte retention in lympho id tissues. 
The m echanism  by [CONTACT_750801]1063 exerts therapeutic effects in MS is unknown but may 
involve the reduction of lymphocy te migrati on int o the CNS .
RPC1063 is [ADDRESS_1027956] ivity on other S1P 
receptors (S1P 2, S1P 3, and S1P 4). RPC1063 is extensively metabo lized in humans to form a 
number of circulat ing act ive metabolites. In vitro , RPC1063 and its act ive metabolites 
demonstrated similar activit y and select ivity for S1P 1and S1P 5. In hum ans, approximately 94% 
of circulat ing total active drug exposure is represented by  [CONTACT_207382]1063 (6%), CC112273 (73%), and 
CC1084037 (15%).
EDMS Doc. Number: 25840251 - 25791526Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No. RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027957] ed receptor whose natural ligand is S1P.  Many  
cell t ypes express S1P 1, including vascular endothelial cells, brain cells and lymphocy tes (Rosen
2009).  Stimulation (agonism) of this receptor results in bio logical act ivities that are likely to 
ameliorate pathol ogical processes associ ated wi th MS.
5.2.1. S1P R
eceptor Modulation Experience in MS
Clinical experienc e with fingolimod strongly  supports the rati onale for therapeutically targeting 
S1P receptors in MS. Fingo limod, an oral  drug approved for the treatment of MS, has 
demonstrated a superi or efficacy  profile com pared to IFN -β, reducing relapse rates by  52% 
(Cohen 2010 ; Kappos 2010).  Fingo limod stimulates S1P 1, which induces lymphocyte 
sequestration in peripheral lymphoid organs, resulting in temporary  reducti on in ci rculat ing 
lymphocy te counts ( Sanna 2004 ).  An inabilit y of sequestered autoreactive lymphocy tes to traffic 
to and exacerbate inflammat ion in the CNS is thought to be the primary mode of act ion of 
fingolimod ( Kappos 2006). Therefore, this peri pheral  lymphocy te response represents a clearly 
defined pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of S1P 1stimulat ion (Sanna 2006). S1P 1stimulation also 
supports m aintenance of blood -brain barrier integrity  by [CONTACT_750802], 
thereby [CONTACT_750803]’s efficacy profile ( Sanna
2006; Sanchez 2003).
Fingo limod is not specific for S1P 1. The compound also stimulates three other related receptors: 
S1P 3, S1P 4, and S1P 5(Mandala 2002; Brinkmann 2002). Several toxicit ies associated with 
fingolimod treatment may be a consequence of the drug lacking specificit y for S1P 1and 
potenti ally having pharmaceut icalliabilit ies rel ated to the drug’s structural class ( Cohen 2010
; 
Kappos 2006).
Siponimod, a select ive S1P 1and S1P 5modulator with a safety  profile similar to fing olimod ,is 
another oral drug approved in the US and EU for the treatment of relapsing forms o f MS.  It has 
shown a relative risk reduction o f 21% in 3 -month confirmed dis ability progressi on versus
placebo in patients with secondary progressive mult iple sclerosis (SPMS) (Kappos 2018
).

5.3. Clinical Trial Rationale
The parent trials provided opportuni ties for adult patients with RMS to participate in important 
Phase 3 clinical trials to determine if RPC1063 is effective and safe ,andto pa rticipate in a 
clinical pharmaco logy study  characteri zing the multiple-dose PKand PDof RPC1063 in patients 
with RMS . This open -label extensio n (OLE )trialis designed to further characterize the 
longer-term safet y and efficacy  beyond that required for t he Phase 3 registration trials .In 
addition, the tri alallows all pat ients who are receiving clinical benefit from treatment with 
RPC1063 to con tinue to receive ituntil the end of the trial or until  the Sponsor di scont inues the 
development program .

To characterize the long-term efficacy of RPC1063 in pat ients with relapsing mul tiple sclerosi s .
6.3. Endpoints
6.3.1. Safety Endpoints
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be characteri zed in this tri al by [CONTACT_5205], rel ationship, and ty pe 
of adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to withdrawal fro m the 
trial; the incidence, relat ionship, and t ype of laboratory abn ormalities; vi tal signs; 
electrocardi ogram  (ECG) results; and physical examinat ion abnormalit ies.Suicidali ty 
(Columbia -Suicide Severi ty Rating Scale [C-SSRS] ) will be assessed in the trial. In addit ion, 
descript ive characterizat ion will be provided for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
including bradycardia and heart conduction abnormalit ies (ECG and vital signs), pulmo nary 
effects (forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_81632] 1 second [FEV 1], forced vital capacit y[FVC] , and diffusing 
capacit y of the l ung f or carbon monoxide measurements), macular edema (optical coherence 
tomography [OCT] ), hepati c effects (liver funct ion tests), serious or opportunist ic infections, and 
malignancy (see Sect ion12.4.[ADDRESS_1027960] of AESIs) .
Exploratory  measurements of immune response (eg, anti-SARS-CoV -2 serology ) will  be 
assessed fro m blood samples co llected at trial visits and end of treatment, and the potential 
associ ation between these measurements and selected endpoints related to safet y and/or efficacy.
In addit ion, dependence and withdrawal symptoms will be assessed in at least 80 evaluable 
patients who discont inue study  drug using the follo wing assessments: physician’s wit hdrawal 
checklist ( PWC -20), hospi [INVESTIGATOR_750779] y and depression scale ( HADS ), Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526]

237. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
7.1. Overall Trial Design
This is a mult i-site, open -label extensi on trialof oral RPC1063 (ozanimod HCl) 1 mg (equivalent 
to ozanimod 0.92 mg) administered once daily to pati ents wi th RMS who are eligible according 
to the enro llment criteria and completedone of the fo llowing trials: RPC01 -201, RPC01 -301, or 
RPC01 -1001 ( the “parent trials”).  
Based on an est imated dropout rate of 10% per y ear, approximately 2350 patients may be 
eligible for e nrollment in the trial depending on complet ion of one of the parent trials.
Regardless of treatment assignment in the parent trial, pati ents will  receive RPC1063 at a dose of 
1 mg daily  in RPC01 -
3001 after a 7 -day dose escalation regimen , as applicable (Section9.1).
Approval from the Sponsor’s representative is required for enrollment more than 14 days after 
the pati ent’s l ast dose of invest igational drug in the parent trial, and the patient must under go 
RPC1063 dose escalat ion. Patients from either the blinded extensi on of the RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027961] do se in RPC01 -3001 i s more than 14 
days.  Patients will receive RPC1063 at 1mg/day unt il the end of the tri alor until  the Sponsor 
discontinues the development program .
It is ant icipated that the trialwill include approximately 275 sites in North America, Europe, 
South Africa, and New Zealand that participated in one or m ore of  the parent trials .
Scheduled trial visi ts include : 
Baseline (Day  1)
Evaluat ions every 3 months (91 day s)and every  12 m onths ,as specified in the 
schedule of events (Table 2 ).After a patient reaches their 3rd annual visit, the Every  
3-Month Visit will be come the Every 6 Month Visit(one visit between annual visit s 
instead of 3). Annual visit s (Every  12Months) are unchanged.
Early Terminat ion/End of Treatment visit
Visits at 1, 4, 7, 14, and [ADDRESS_1027962] dose of investigational drug to assess 
dependence and withdraw al symptom s 
Absolute lymphocy te count ( ALC )Follow
-up Vi sit(s)every 14 days (± 3 day s) after 
the last dose of invest igational drug until ALC is above the lower limit of normal
(LLN) (the Medical Monitor shoul d be consul ted if the ALC is not > LLN by [CONTACT_48657] 
90 Safet y Follow -up V isit,and ALC visits shoul dcontinue every  14 days (± 3 
days) untilthe Invest igator is notified to discont inue).
Safety Follow-up Vi sit [ADDRESS_1027963] dose of investigational drug

24In the event that commercial ozanimod or an access program beco mes available prior 
to December 2022, subjects may transit ion to the commercial product after discussio n 
with the Invest igator at his/her discret ion.Subjects who transit ion to commercial 
ozanimod are not required to attend safet y follow-up visits after their end of treatment 
visit as lo ng as commercial ozanimod is started within 14 days o f discontinuati on of  
study  drug. Otherwise, all other subjects continuing in the study  and subsequent ly 
discontinuing prior to the availabilit y of co mmercial ozanimod in their country/state 
or by  [CONTACT_750804] y follow up visit s.
Trial assessments are described in Table 2. T hese include evaluat ion of adverse events (AEs), 
review of conco mitant m edicati ons, clinical laboratory  tests, assessment of immune response, PK 
sampling, physical and neuro logical examinat ion (MRI with and without gadolinium contrast), 
vital sign m easurements, [ADDRESS_1027964] ion tests, dermatological 
examinat ion, and C -SSRS evaluat ion. The Cogni tive Function subscale of the Mult iple Sclerosis 
Qualit y of Life -54 (MSQOL -54) will be assessed to evaluate qualit y of life and subjective 
cogni tive impairment. In addit ion to the C -SSRS, the PWC -20, the HADS, and the ESS will be 
administered to asses s dependence and wit hdrawal symptoms. These assessments will be 
administered on at least 1visit while on study  drug and in at l east 80 eval uable patients after 
discontinuing study  drug (Table 3).All patients should undergo these assessments unt il the 
Sponsor decides that no further withdrawal assessments are required.
Refer to Table [ADDRESS_1027965] 
day of dosing in RPC01 -1001. For the same patients, Baseli ne (Day 1) brain MRI, OCT, and 
pulmo nary function tests are not required to occur on the same day; these may be performed at 
any time between signing informed consent and first dose of RPC1063 in RPC01 -3001. The 
RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027966] dose of RPC1063 in RPC01 -
3001 may only be 
administered after com pletion ofall RPC01 -1001 End of Study  assessments and all RPC01 -3001 
Baseline assessments .
If a patient experiences a relapse after com pletingaparent tri al, but pri or to entering 
RPC01 -3001, the patient may remain eligible for RPC01 -3001. There i s no minimum wait ing 
period following the relapse; however, the Investigator shoul d confirm that t he patient is 
neuro logically  and medically stable prior to init iating invest igationaldrug. If the Invest igator 
suspects the patient may require more than [ADDRESS_1027967] igator should discuss this immediately with the 
Sponsor’s representative to determine ongoing eligibilit y.
Patients will  be evaluated for relapses throughout the trial,including during the Safet y Follow-up
Visit,and pat ients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_750805] a possible relapse .If the Investi gator 
suspects a possible relapse , an unscheduled visit is to be planned as soon as possible, ideally  
within 7 d ays o f symptom  onset. A relapse is defined as the occurrence of new or worsening 
EDMS Doc. Number: 25840251 - 25791526Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No. RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027968] ional System  (FS) scores, or [ADDRESS_1027969] rating (EDSS or FS scores) 
that did not occur during a relapse .  The change in FS scale scores should correspond to the 
patient’s symptom s (eg, pati ent reported change in visual acuit y shoul d correspond to a change 
in the visio n FS score).  Symptoms must persist for > 24 hours and should not be attributable to 
confounding clinical factors (eg, fever, infect ion, injury, adverse react ions to concomitant 
medicat ions).
A blood sam ple will be collec ted at the subject’s next visit after this amendment is implemented, 
every 6 m onths thereafter, and at the end of treatment for measurements of immune response (eg, 
SARS -CoV -2serol ogy). 
Patients who are wi thdrawn early fro m the trial will  be requi red to return to the trial site as soon 
as possible so that the final assessments can be conducted. P atients who wi thdraw from  the tri al 
will be fo llowed f or collect ion of safet y data, including lymphocy te recovery .  In addit ion, PK 
samples will be co llected at t he End of Treatment /Early Terminat ionVisit and for Day  [ADDRESS_1027970] to be 
taken to guarantee app ropriate safety fo llow-up of  all patients al ready  included in the trial.At 
the time o f trial terminat ion, all pat ients will co mplete the End of Treatment /Early Terminat ion 
Visitand the 28-Day and 90-D ay Safety Follow -up Visits. Central  laboratory  testi ng of ALC
will cont inue every 14 days (± 3 days) after discontinuat ion of RPC1063 or the End of 
Treatment /Early Terminat ionVisit until ALC i s above the l ower limit of normal or until  the 
Invest igator is notified to discont inue (Secti on12.2.1 ).
The Inst itutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and the 
Regulatory  Authori ties will  be inform ed in wri ting about an y terminat ion of the trial.
At the End of Treatm ent/Early Terminat ionVisit, pati ents will undergo assessments for 
dependency  and wi thdrawal  symptom s (Table 3). Assessments will be performed at the End of 
Treatment/Early  Terminat ion Visit and at scheduled fo llow up assessment visits after the last 
dose of invest igational drug.Patient s should schedule the End of Treatment/Early  Terminati on 
Visit within 24 hours of study  drug discontinuation, as appropriate.

8.2. Patient Withdrawal Criteria
Reasons for patient withdrawal fro m the trialinclude, but are not limited to the fo llowing:
Invest igator decision:The Invest igator may withdraw the pati ent from the trialif it is 
determined that it is not safe or is not in the patient’s best interest to receive further 
treatm entwith RPC1063 .  The Medical Monitor should be promptly notified of the 
decisio n.
Noncom pliance with invest igational drug: After consultation between the 
Invest igator , the Medical Monitor, a nd the Sponsor when appropriate, a patient may 
be withdrawn from the trialfor failure to com ply wi th dosing regimen as specified by  
[CONTACT_760].
Intercurrent illness :A pat ient may be withdrawn from  the trialif, in the judgment of 
the treating Invest igator , the patient develops an intercurrent illness or complicat ion 
that is not consistent with the protocol requirements or that, in any  way, j ustifies 
withdrawal .
Adverse event:  A patient must be withdrawn from the trialif, in the judgment of th e 
Invest igator or if specified in the protocol, the patient develops an AE such as an 
intercurrent illness or complicat ion that j ustifies withdrawal .
Lack of efficacy: Decisio n by [CONTACT_149473]/or the Invest igator to withdraw the 
patient from the trialdue to a l ack of expected or desired effect related to a therapy .
Withdrawal o f Consent : The patient may choose to withdraw fro m the trialat any  
time.  Every  effort shoul d be m ade wi thin the bounds of safety  and pat ient choice to 
have each pat ient com plete the Early Terminat ion Visitand the 28-D ay and 90-Day 
Safety Follow-up V isits.  If a patient withdraws consent, the only addit ional 
investigat ional data to be collected will be the fo llow up of SAEs as mandated by [CONTACT_12695] .
Pregnancy: If the patient becom es pregnant , the pati entmust be withdrawn from  the 
trial(see also Secti on12.4.5 )
Trialterminat ion by [CONTACT_2728]
Other
All patients who withdraw from the trialshoul d complete an Early Terminat ion Visit. Patients
shoul d be instructed to contact [CONTACT_24342] (e.g. by  [CONTACT_648]) if they  plan to wi thdraw from  the 
study  to discuss study  drug di scontinuati on plans, and schedule the dependence a nd wit hdrawal 
assessment visits. Central  laboratory  testing of ALC will cont inue every 14 days (± 3 days) after 
discontinuat ion of RPC1063 or the End of Treatment/Early Terminat ion Visit until ALC is above 
the lower limit of norm al or until  the Invest igator is notified to discont inue (Secti on12.2.1 ). 
Patients shoul d be encouraged to complete theALC and Safety Follow -up V isits for the

disease status. Treatment for MS can be started after the 28 -Day Safety Follow-up Visi t based 
on Secti on9.5.
The reason for withdrawal fro m the trialwill be recorded in the clinical records and the patient’s 
electroni c case report form ( eCRF ).  For those patients whose status is unclear because th ey fail 
to appear for trialvisits wit hout stating an intention to withdraw from trialparticipat ion, the 
Invest igator should document in the source documents the steps taken to contact [CONTACT_102] ( eg, 
dates of telephone calls, registered letters) prior t o withdrawing the pati ent from the trial.

9.6. Treatment Compliance
It is the Invest igator’s responsibilit y to ensure that patients are correctly instructed on how to 
take thei r invest igational drug and that each patient is fully co mpliant wi th their assigned dosage 
regimen.  Records of invest igational drug used and intervals between visit s will be kept during 
the trial.  Drug accountabilit y will be noted by  [CONTACT_750813].  Pati ents will  beasked to return all unused invest igational drug at each 
visit.  The invest igational drug shoul d be dispensed by  [CONTACT_24342], or by a qualified 
individual under the Invest igator’s supervisio n.  An up- to-date treatment inventory/dispensing 
record m ust be maintained as described in Section10.3.
Overall trialnon-compliance is defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of 
investigat ional drug during the ent ire treatm ent period.   Patients will record missed doses in a 
diary that will be reviewed at every  visit by [CONTACT_750814].  Pati ents exhibit ing 
poor compliance as assessed by [CONTACT_750815] ([ADDRESS_1027996] igational 
drug days in 1 week) should be counseled on the importance of good compliance to the trial
dosing regimen.  Patients who are persistent ly non-compliant (< 80% or > 120%) should be 
discussed wi th the Medical Monitor to determine whether th eyshoul d be wi thdrawn from  the 
trial.
9.7. Randomization and Blinding

11.1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Brain MRIs will be acquired with and without gadolinium (Gd) . The same MRI protocol  will be 
used across all sites.  To ensure qualit y data and standardizat ion
,the sam e machine and software 
shoul d be used throughout the trial.  MRIs for MS lesions will be read at a centralized reading

Total  number of Gd-enhancing (GdE) lesio ns, number of n ew or enlarging hyperintense 
T2-weighted lesio ns,lesion volume (T2 -weighted images), volume of unenhancing T1 -weighted 
lesions and brain vol ume ( ie, brain atrophy ) will be collected and reported.
The baseline MRI scans for patients from the Phase 3 parent trials (RPC01 -201 and RPC01 -301) 
will be read locally  only for non -MS pathol ogyto avo id potential unblinding of treatment 
assignments in the parent trials .Post-baseline MRI scans for these patients and all MRIs for 
patients from the RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1027999] dose of m ethylpredniso lone 
treatm ent for rel apse. Previ ously scheduled MRIs should be rescheduled as necessary  if a relapse 
occurs.
11.2. Expanded Disability Status Scale and Neurological Examination
The EDSS is a standardized method, widely  accepted, num erical scale use d to evaluate disabilit y 
in people with MS ( Kurtzke 1983).  The EDSS is evaluated according to signs and symptoms 
observed during a standard neurological examinat ion.  These clinical observat ions are cl assified 
in 7FS scales, each of them grading signs and symptoms for different neurological funct ions: 
pyramidal , cerebellar, brainstem , sensory
, bowel  or bl adder, visual , and cerebral .
The trialrequire sthat the same evaluator perfor msall EDSS assessments for an ind ividual patient when 
possible.  In addition, EDSS raters will be a neurologist or other health care practitioner who was certified 
using the Neurostatus Standardized Examination and Assessment prior to trialinitiation and examiners 
will be re -certified ev ery 2years throughout the conduct of the trial.
11.3. Relapse Assessment
A relapse is defined as the occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable 
to MS and immediately  preceded by a rel atively stable or improving neurological state of at least 
[ADDRESS_1028000] rating (EDSS or FS scores) that did not occur during a relapse .  The

42and should not be attributable to confounding clinical factors ( eg,fever, infection, injury, adverse 
reacti ons to concomitant medicat ions).  When a patient experiences new or worsening symptoms 
at any  time pri or to the 90-D ay Safet y Follow -up Vi sit that may indicate a possible relapse, 
he/she shoul d telephone the treatin g Invest igator within [ADDRESS_1028001] igator (or designee) will conduct a telephone quest ionnaire and, as necessary , will  
arrange an Unscheduled Relapse Visit. The visit is to be planned as soon as possible, ideally 
within 7days o f symptom  onset.
11.4. Multiple Sclerosis Disability Progression
MS disabili typrogressi on is defined as a sustained worsening in EDSS of 1.[ADDRESS_1028002] igator will discuss with the 
patient the treatm ent al ternat ives outside of the study.
11.5. Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite
The MSFC ( Cutter 1999) is a battery  of the f ollowing 3 individual scales:
The Timed [ADDRESS_1028003] ion
The [ADDRESS_1028004] i s a quant itative measure of upper extremit y (arm  and hand) 
funct ion
The Symbol Digit Modali ties Test ( SDMT )is a measure of execut ive function 
cogni tion that assesses processing speed, flexibility ,and calculat ion abilit y 
(Drake 2010).
The same person, either the evaluator or another independent designated te am member trained in 
conducting MSFC assessments should administer the 3 scales that make up the MSFC with each 
participat ing patient throughout the trial.  The MSFC z -score is calculated by  [CONTACT_750820] z -scores 
for each co mponent of the MSFC, as explained be low, and averaging them to create an overall 
composite score, ie, MSFC z -score = (Z25 -foot-walk + Z9HPT + ZSDMT)/3, where Zxxx refers 
to Z-scores. 
Details on the calculations of the z -score for each component will be described in the statist ical 
analysis plan (SAP).
11.6. Low
-Contrast Letter Acuity Test
The LCLA which is performed with the MSFC assessments, is performed with a standardized set 
of charts (Sl oan l etter charts or Tumbling E charts) to assess low contrast visual acuit y.  Each 
chart corresponds to a different contrast level, and charts are scored according to the number of 
letters that are identified correctly.  The LCLA captures aspects of neurological dysfunct ion that

11.7. Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life -
54
The Mult iple Sclerosi s Quali ty of Life -54 (MSQOL -54) is a m ultidimensi onal health-related 
qualit y of life measure that combines both generic and MS -specific i tems into a single instrument 
(Vickrey 1995).  Thi s 54 -item instrument generates 12 subscales alo ng with two summary  
scores, and two addit ional single -item measures.  The subscales are: physical funct ion, role 
limitations -physical, role limi tations-emotional, pain, em otional well -being, energy, healt h 
percepti ons, soci al function, cogni tive function, health distress, overall qualit y of life, and sexual 
funct ion.  The summary  scores are the physical health composite summary  and the m ental health 
composite summary.  The single item measures are satisfaction wit h sexual funct ion and change 
in health.
The MSQOL -[ADDRESS_1028005] the MSQOL -54 administered as an

12.1. Clinical Safety Assessments
12.1.1. Physical Examination
A co mplete physical examinat ion will include evaluation of heart, lung, head and neck, 
abdo minal, skin, and extremit ies.  The EDSS, performed by [CONTACT_191957], serves as the 
neuro logical examinati on.  An interim (or bri ef) physical  examinat ion will include areas wit h 
previously noted abnormalit ies and/or that are associated with any new co mplaints fro m the 
patient.
Initial neurol ogical  examinat ion will be a part of the physical examinat ion at baseline and if 
warranted, will be performed at an unscheduled visit.  All significant findings that are present at

4512.1.4. Pulmonary Function Tests
Pulmo nary function tests (PFTs) including FEV 1and FVC measurements will be performed as 
scheduled in Table 2.  In addi tion, DLCO will be assessed (where locally available) . DLCO will 
only be assessed at the End of Treatment/Early  Terminati on Visi t.  DLCO will not be required at 
sites where there is no l ocal testing facilit y.
These tests will be performed at a high qualit y pulm onary function laboratory  or respi [INVESTIGATOR_750782]. Please refer to the American Thoracic Society /European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_750783] ( MacInt yre 2005 ; Miller 2005a ; Miller 2005b ).
For pati ents wi th abnorm al PFTs (based on predi cted FVC or FEV 1< 70%), PFTs wi ll be 
repeated within < [ADDRESS_1028007] igator (based on a fo llow-up 
period of  not l ess than 3 m onths). If the PFT decrease persists , consult with the Medical 
Moni tor. If patients have a confirmed decline in PFT values (FEV 1and/or FVC) < 50% of the 
predi cted values, investigational drug should be discontinued and the Investigator should consult 
the Medi cal Monitor.
If a patient is temporarily or perm anent ly discontinued fro m invest igational drug due to a 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_207369], the Investigator should ensure that the patient has adequate evaluat ions as 
clinically indicated.
12.1.5. Ophthalmological Examination
OCT will be performed as scheduled in Table [ADDRESS_1028008] findings, or visual signs or symptoms of 
macular edema are observed, a general ophthalmo logic exa minat ion including eye history, visual 
acuity, and dilated ophthalmo scopy  will also be performed. If the ophthalmic evaluat ion reveals 
abnorm alities suggestive of macular edema, investigat ional drug will be temporarily 
discontinued. Patients will  be followed wi th repeat ophthalmo logy examinat ions until 
evaluat ions return to baseline or no further improvement is expected (based on a fo llow-up 
period of  not l ess than 3 m onths).
Confirmed Macular Edema. Invest igational drug must be permanent ly discont inued i n any  
patient wi th a confirmed diagnosis o f macular edema that is o f new onset or worsened since 
baseline. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of macular edema must be evaluated by [CONTACT_750823] a m onthly basis or more frequent ly if needed based o n the ophthalmo logist’s 
judgment. Further ophthalmo logical  evaluat ions will be conducted unt il reso lution or no further 
improvement is expected by [CONTACT_207410] (based on a fo llow-up peri od of  not less than 
3months). If the patient does not show d efinite signs o f improvement on examinat ion [ADDRESS_1028009] experi enced in the management of this

Derm atological (skin) evaluat ions will be performed by [CONTACT_750824], and as scheduled in Table [ADDRESS_1028010] for eval uation and treatm ent, if warranted.
12.1.7. Suicidality Assessm ent
Suicidali ty will be assessed using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011) as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1028011] igator and referred for further assessment by [CONTACT_750825]. It is important that the C -SSRS be completed early  in the visit to 
ensure the report and any associated alerts are reviewed during the visit, while the pati entis at 
the site.
12.1.8. Dependence and Withdrawal Battery
The Dependence and Wi thdrawal  Battery  include the C
-SSRS and addit ional assessments:
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physician’s Withdrawal Checklist (PWC -20)
The PWC -20 is a rater -administered 20-item scale to assess signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
Twent y items are rated on a 4-point scale as not present (0 points), mild (1 point), moderate (2 
points), or severe (3 points). The p oints from all items are calculated as a total score . Higher 
scores indicate more severe withdrawal symptoms (Rickels 2008
).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)
The HADS i s a validated patient reported outcome for assessing anxiet y and depressio n
(Zigmond 1983 ; Bjelland 2002). It consi sts of [ADDRESS_1028012] a statement (valued at 0 to 3 points) that 
closest matches their own feeling over th e past week. Separate total scores for anxiety  and 
depressio n are derived by [CONTACT_750826]. Total scores can range fro m 0 to 21 points. Higher 
scores indicate more severe anxiet y and depressio n and scores of 8 to 10 are generally 
considered indicat ive o f borderline anxiet y/depressi on disorders and scores of 11 and higher are 
generally considered indicative of anxiet y/depression disorders.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)
The ESS is avalidated self-administered questionnaire with [ADDRESS_1028013] ions(Johns 1997 ). 
Respondents rate on a 4- point scale (0 to 3) their chances of dozing off or falling asleep while 
engaged in [ADDRESS_1028014] be made to remain alert to possible AEs or 
SAEs.   Refer to Section 12.3 for definit ions of AEs/SAEs, monitoring ,and reporti ng.  Refer to 
EDMS Doc. Number: 25840251 - 25791526Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No. RPC01 -[ADDRESS_1028015]. Reductions in ALC, in general, need no tbe reported as AEs unless there are clinical 
consequences . The protocol requirements in Section 12.2.1 should be fo llowed for confirmed 
ALC < 200 cells/µL. The decisio n to report decreased ALC as an AE is at the Invest igator’s 
discreti on.
12.1.10. Monitoring of Concomitant Therapy
The use of conco mitant medicat ion and procedures will be monitored throughout the trial.  Ref er 
to Section 9.5for prohibited conco mitant therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].
12.1.11. Guidelines for Moni toring Patients Taking Their Day [ADDRESS_1028016] dose 
of investigational drug, then every  hour (± 10 min) for at least 6 hours thereafter (by  [CONTACT_24338] ,an assist ing nurse , or other m edically  qualified staff member ).  When obtaining the 
heart rate and blood pressure before the first dose, the patient should be allowed to rest in a 
seated posit ion at least 5minutes before taking measurements.  The heart rate and sitting blood
pressure measurements should be repeated 2 addit ional times (only before the first dose of 
invest igationaldrug) and all of these m easurements shoul d be recorded in the eCRF.  The repeat 
measurements will be made at approximately [ADDRESS_1028017] pre -dose value o f sitting heart rate and blood 
pressure (based on sy stolic bl ood pressure) will be recorded in the case report form and serve as 
baseline for comparison to post -dose values.
Patients shoul d receive t he first dose of invest igational drug before 12:00 pm (noon) in the clinic.  
The first dose of RPC1063 shoul d be administered in a setting in which resources to 
appropriately  manage symptom atic bradycardia are available.  A member of the Invest igator 
team  shoul d be available to monitor the patient for the [ADDRESS_1028018] ituted until 
the finding has reso lved.  Baseline an d hourly vi tal si gns measurem ents (Hours 1 through 6) 
shoul d be used to assess heart rate (criteria 1 and 2 below) and ECG should be used to assess for 
atrioventri cular ( AV)block and Fridericia’s corrected QT ( QTcF )interval (criteria 3 and 4 
below).

12.2. Laboratory Assessments
The central laboratory will analyze the l aboratory  samples.  Further details of the procedures to 
be followed for sam ple collect ion, storage, and shipment will be documented in a laboratory  
manual.
Addit ional and repeat l aboratory  safet y testing
, preferably  using the central  laboratory ,may be 
perform ed at the di scret ion of the Invest igator.  The fo llowing laboratory  tests will  be perform ed 
to assess the safet y profile of RPC1063 :
Hem atology -Red blood cell count, total  and different ial white blood cell ( WBC )
count (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocy tes, m onocy tes, and neutrophils), pl atelet

Hem atology
Starti ng wit h the Month 3 visit (ie , excluding the Baseline visit ), complete hematology  
laboratory values will be available to the Invest igator. Reductions in ALC levels is a known 
pharmacodynamic effect of RPC1063 . If any of the fo llowing resul ts are observed, the 
Invest igator will be notified and asked to repeat the laboratory tests within approximately 7 days :
Absolute lymphocy te count [ALC] < 200 cells/µL
Absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1000 cells/µL
Total  WBC > 2 0,000 cells/μL
If the ANC is confirmed <1000 cells/µL , the Investi gator will be requested to closely mo nitor 
for risk of serious infect ion and inst itute appropriate fo llow-up at his or her discretion.
If ALC is confirmed < 200 cells/µL, the Invest igator will temporarily discontinue treatment and 
then consult the Medical Monitor . Laboratory testing will be repeated weekly unt il ALC is
> 500 c ells/µL . When ALC hasreturned to >500 cells/µL , treatment may be reinit iated at the 
Invest igator’s discret ion.(See Section 9.3.1 for instructi ons on resuming treatment after missing 
doses.)
For pati ents who perm anently discont inue treatment or complete the tria l, central  laboratory  
testing of ALC will cont inue every 14 days (± 3 days) after discont inuat ion of RPC1063 or the 
End of Treatment /Early Terminat ionVisit until ALC is above the lower limit of normal .

50If an ALC Fo llow-up Vi sit is needed within the window of the 90 -Day Safety Fo llow-up Vi sit, 
the pati ent shoul d only  return for the 90 -Day Safety Fo llow-up Visi t and ALC shoul d be 
collected at that visit.  
Ifthe patient has started a lymphocy te-depleting treatment during the Safet y Follow-up peri od, 
ALC sho uld only be determined at the 90 -Day Safety  Follow-up Visi t.  The Medical Monitor 
shoul d be consul ted if the ALC is not > LLN by  [CONTACT_48657]  90 Safet y Follow-up V isit for subjects 
not started on lymphocyte -depleting disease m odifying therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014](DMTs ),and ALC visits shoul d 
continue every  14 days (± 3 days) until the Investigator is notified to discont inue.
Liver Funct ion Tests
If pat ients have elevat ions in ALT and/or AST >3x the upper limit of normal (ULN), a retest 
shoul d be perform ed as soon as possible but not later than 14days after the original test.  If the 
abnorm ality is confi rmed, weekly  testingshoul d continue unt il ALT and AST are < 3x ULN. If 
the ALT and/or AST stabi lizes at a level > 3x ULN, the M edical Monitor m ay agree to less 
frequent testing. The Invest igator shoul d establish causalit y. In addit ion, the confirmed 
elevation > 3x ULN is an AESI ( see Section 12.4.2 ) and should be reported by  [CONTACT_24342]. 
At any time, if any of the fo llowing occur and there are no apparent alternat ive causes for the 
finding , the investi gational drug m ust be perm anentlydiscont inued :

ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1028028] wi th the appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting,right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%) .
The Investigator should establish causalit y.
After di scontinuat ion due to el evation of ALT or AST > 5x ULN or concurrent elevat ions of 
ALT or AST >3x ULN and bilirubin > 2x ULN, further liver fu nction evaluation should be

12.3. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events
12.3.[ADDRESS_1028031] a causal relat ionship 
with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable or unintended sign ( including an 
abnorm al laboratory  finding ),symptom ,or disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of 
medicinal product ,whether or not considered related to the invest igational medicinal product
(ICH E2A, II.A.1) .
Relapses (confirmed or unconfirmed) and MS disease progression will be monitored as trial
endpoints, but will not be recorded as AEs. 
AEs will be monitored for each patient from their first dose fo llowing enrollment and through out
the duration of their part icipation in the trial , incl uding the 90-D ay Safety Follow -upVisit.  
Invest igators will as k the pati ent at each visit if they  have experi enced any  untoward occurrence 
since the l ast trialvisit.  All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs provided: a descript ion of the 
event, severit y, time of occurrence, duration, any  action (eg,treatm ent and foll ow up tests) and 
the outcom e shoul d be provi ded al ong with the Investi gator’s assessment of the relat ionship to 
the invest igational drug .
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condit ion/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.
An Adverse Drug React ion (ADR) is defined as all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicinal product related to any  dose (ICH E2A, II.A.2).  
An Unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product informat ion (ICH E2A, II.A.3).
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severit y, seriousness and causal relat ionship to the 
investigat ional drug.  The action taken and the outcome must also be recorded.
12.3.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose 
(ICH E2A, II.B):
Results in death
Is life -threatening
NOTE:  The term “life-threatening” in the definit ion of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at ri sk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypotheti cally  might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_750784]. Number: 25840251 - 25791526Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No. RPC01 -3001

52Results in persistent or si gnificant di sabili ty/incapaci ty, or
Is a congenital abnormalit y/birth defect
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical e vents that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or resul t in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092] j eopardi ze the pati ent or m ay require 
intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above.  These should 
also usually be considered se rious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]; or 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
In case of a fatalit y,the cause of death is considered as the SAE, and the death is considered as 
its OUTCOME.
Unco mplicated cases o f relapse and MS disease progression requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750785] , unless there are 
other diagnoses or complicat ions which meet serious criteria.
12.3.3 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity
The severit y of the AE will be characterized as “mild, moderate, or severe” according to the 
following definit ions:
Mild events are usually transient and do not i nterfere wi th the pati ent’s daily  
activit ies.
Moderate events introduce a low level o f inconvenience or concern to the patient and 
may interfere with daily  activi ties.
Severe events are incapacitat ing and interrupt the patient’s usu al daily  activi ty.
12.3.4 Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Drug
The causal relationship between RPC1063 and the AE has to be characterized as unrelated, 
unlikely
, possible, probable, or related.  This medical assessment should be made as soon as 
feasible when reporting an SAE.
The Investigator is requested to assess the relat ionship of any AEs to treatment using the 
following defini tions:
Unrelated: those AEs which are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes 
(concurrent drugs, environment etc.) and do not meet the criteria for drug relat ionship listed 
under Unlikely, Possible, Probable or Related.
Unlikely: An AE may be considered unlikely if it includes at least the first two features:
It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administrati on of  the drug
It coul d readily have been produced by  [CONTACT_25034]’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy  administered to the patient

53It does not follow a known pattern to the suspected drug
It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered
Possible: An AE may be considered possible if it includes at least the firs t two f eatures:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug
It coul d readily have been produced by  [CONTACT_25034]’s clinical state, environment or 
toxic factors, or other m odes of therapy  administered to the patient
It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug
Probable: An AE may be considered probable if it  includes at least the first three features:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug
It coul d not be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_750827]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy  administered 
to the patient
It disappears or decreased on cessat ion or reducti on in dose. There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear u pon di scont inuat ion of the drug (eg ,bone marrow 
depressio n, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc.)
It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug
Related: an AE may be considered related if it includes all of the fo llowing features:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug
It coul d not be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_207411]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy  administered 
to the patie nt
It disappears or decreased on cessat ion or reducti on in dose. There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discont inuat ion of the drug (eg,bone marrow 
depressio n, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc.)
It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug
It reappears or worsens if the drug is re- administered
All efforts shoul d be made to classify  the AE according to the above categories.  
After init iation o f investigational drug, all AEs, regardless of relat ionship to inves tigational drug, 
will be recorded until the patient completes his or her last trialvisit.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic has been identified as a potential risk to 
clinical trial subjects in general and may particularly affect individuals with underlying chronic diseases 
on immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It is not known whethe r taking ozanimod increases the risk of SARS -
CoV-[ADDRESS_1028036] practice .The s ponsor also suggests the investigator to refer to the Multiple Sclerosis
International Federation (MSIF) guidelines per DMC recommendation , and to consult the Medical 
Monitor as needed. 
Each study visit will include an assessment for AEs including SARS -CoV-2 and other infections. In order 
to facilitate reporting of SARS -CoV -2 events that occur during the study, all AEs and SAEs related to 
SARS CoV -2 should be reported from the time of consent until the final study Visit.

15.1 Study Monitor ingand Source Data Verification
According to the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Sponsor is 
responsible for implement ing and maintaining qualit y assurance and qualit y control  systems wi th 
written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
Qualit y control  will be applied to each stage of data handling.  
The fo llowing steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy , consistency, completeness, and 
reliabilit y of the data:
Central  laboratori es for clinical laboratory  parameters and ECGs 
Site Ini tiation visit 
Early sitevisits post -enrollment

An IRB/IEC shoul d approve the final protocol, including the final versio n of the ICF and any 
other wri tten information and/or materials to be provided to the pati ents.  The Invest igator will 
provi de the Sponsor and/or designee with docum entati on of  IRB/IEC approval  of the protocol  
and informed consent before the trialmay begin at the site(s).  The Invest igator should submit 
the wri tten approval  to the Sponsor or representative before enro llment of any pat ient into the 
trial.
The Sponsor or representative should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to 
meet l ocal requi rements.
The Investigator will supply documentation to the Sponsor and/or designee of requi red 
IRB/IEC’s annual renewal of the protocol, and any approvals of revisio ns to the informed 
consent document or amendments to the protocol.
The Investigator will report prompt ly to the IRB/IEC, any new information that may adversely 
affect the safe ty of patients or the conduct of the trial.  Similarly , the Invest igator will submit 
written summaries of the trialstatus to the IRB/IEC annually , or m ore frequent ly if requested by  
[CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  Upon completion of the trial, the Investigator will provide the Ethi cs Committee 
with a brief report of the outcome of the trial, if requi red.
16.[ADDRESS_1028053] of the Trial
This trialwill be conducted and the informed consent will be obtained according to the ethical 
principles stated in the Declarat ion of Helsink i (48th General  Assembly, Som erset West, 
Republic o f South Africa, October 2008 [or current versio n]), the applicable guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP; CPMP/ICH/135/95), or the applicable drug and data protection laws and 
regul ations of the count ries where the trialwill be conducted.
Good Clinical Pract ice is an internat ional ethical and scient ific qualit y standard for designing, 
conducting, recording and reporting trialsthat involve the participat ion of human pat ients.  The 
trialwill be conduc ted in com pliance wi th GCP and the applicable nat ional regulat ions so as to 
assure that the rights, safet y and well -being of the participat ing trialpatients are protected 
consistent with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

with either a copy  of their signed informed consent or, depending upon local requirements, a 
second original informed consent, signed by [CONTACT_49249].
The consent form may need to be revised during the trialdue to a protocol amendment or should 
important new informat ion become available that may be relevant to the safet y of the pati ent.  In 
this instance, approval should always be given by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and exist ing patients informed of 
the changes and re -consented, as directed by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and in accorda nce wit h its policies and 
procedures; however, in so me instances where an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an 
apparent hazard to patients, then it would not be necessary for a protocol amendment to receive 
IRB/IEC review and approval before being implemented.  Those patients who are present ly 
enrolled and act ively participating in the trialshould be informed o f the change if it might relate 
to the patients’ willingness to continue their part icipation in the trial. 
With the consent of the patient, the Invest igator should inform the patient’s primary physician 
about participat ion in the clinical trial.
16.4 Patient Data Protection
The ICF will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document 
incorporat ing) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislat ion.

GCP (GCP 1997); the US Code of Federal Regulatio ns (CFR) Title 21 parts 50, 56, and 312; and 
European Legislat ion; and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declarat ion of 
Helsinki.
The Investigator agrees to conduct the clinical trial in co mpliance wit h this protocol  after the 
approval  of the pro tocol  by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC in co mpliance wi th local regulatory  requi rements.  The 
Invest igator and the Sponsor will sign the protocol to confirm this agreement.

Synopsis  
Methodology, 7.1 
Overall Trial Design  Assessment of immune response   Assessment of immune response added to trial 
assessments 
7.1 Overall Trial Design , Table 2: 
Schedule of Assessments  A blood sample will be collected at the 
subject’s next visit after this amendment 
is implemented, every 6 months 
thereafter, and at the end of treatment  for 
measurements of immune response (eg, 
SARS -CoV -2 serology).  Due to COVID -19 pandemic , assessment of 
immune response in patients taking ozanimod 
will be evaluated. An additional blood sample 
will be collected at each patient visit after amendment 10 is  implemented.  
Synopsis Safety 
Endpoints,  
6.3.1 Safety Endpoints, and 
12.2 Laboratory 
Assessments   Exploratory measurements of immune 
response (eg, anti- SARS -CoV -2 
serology) will be assessed from blood  samples collected at trial visits and 
end of treatment, and the potential 
association between these measurements and selected endpoints related to safety and/or efficacy.  
 Due to COVID -19 pandemic, assessment of 
immune response in patients taking ozanimod 
will be evaluated  
Table 2: Schedule of Assessments, footnote 
R   Assessment of immune response may also include analyzing stored blood collected during previous visits prior to implementation of amendment 10.  To allow for stored blood to be evaluated in assessment of immune response

12.4.3 COVID -19 
Pandemic   The global coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) pandemic has been 
identified as a potential risk to clinical 
trial subjects in general and may particularly affect individuals with underlying chronic diseases on immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  It is not 
known whether taking ozanimod increases the risk of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1028074] practice. The sponsor also suggests the investigator to refer to the 
Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) guidelines per DMC 
recommendation, and to consult the 
Medical Monitor as needed.  
 
Each study visit will include an assessment for AEs including SARS -
CoV -2 and other infections. In order to 
facilitate reporting of SARS -CoV -2 
events that occur during the study, all AEs and SAEs related to SARS CoV -2 
should be reported from the time of 
consent until the final study Visit.  To provide background information on 
COVID -19 pandemic, and handling cases of 
COVID -19 and COVID -19 vaccinations 
throughout the trial

Procedures related to COVID -19 
identification (eg, MERS -CoV test, 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1028075]), and treatment (eg, 
intubation, dialysis) must be reported in the appropriate eCRF.  
 Non-live COVID -19 vac cination is 
considered a simple concomitant medication within the study. However, the safety and efficacy of non -live 
vaccines (including non -live COVID -19 
vaccines) in patients receiving ozanimod is unknown. Ozanimod treatment may cause vaccines to be les s effective.  If the 
assessment of the Investigator suggests the vaccine to be beneficial, it must be a 
non-live, replication incompetent vaccine, 
and be approved or authorized (ie, 
Emergency Use Authorization [FDA] or equivalent) by [CONTACT_750843].  
 Administration of vaccinations must be 
reported along with dosage information, 
dates of administration and vaccine name/trade name [CONTACT_750844]. A separate logline should be entered for each vaccine administered with the dose number following the 
vaccine name/trade name.

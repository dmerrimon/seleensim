Protocol Title:   A Phase 3b Study to Evaluate the Long -Term Safety of Elagolix in Combination with 
Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated w ith 
Uterine Fibroids in Premenopausal Women
Objective s:
The objectives of this study are 1) to assess the safety of elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with 
E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) compared to placebo at 12 -months in 
premenopaus al woman with heavy menstrual bleeding associated w ith uterine fibroids, 2) to characterize 
the impact of elagolix 300 mg BID w ith E2/NETA on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with 
heavy menstrual bleeding associated w ith uterine fibroids after up to 48 -months of treatment.
Investigators:  Multicenter
Study Sites:  Approximately 175 sites
Study Population:   Premenopausal female subjects (aged 18 to 50 years, inclusive) with uterine fibroids 
and HMB (> 80 mL blood loss per menstrual cycle).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500
Methodology:   
This Phase 3b, sequential, randomized, 12 -month double -blind placebo -controlled, 36 -month open -label, 
multi -center study is designed to evaluate the long term safety of elagolix with add back ther apy in 
women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Approximately 500 subjects w ill be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:
1.Elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) (n = 335) 
for 48 -months
2.Placebo (n = 165) for 12 -months, follow ed by  [CONTACT_530407] 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 
1.0mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) for 36 -months
Subjects randomized to elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in the [ADDRESS_970464] randomized to placebo in 
the 1 2-monthTreatment Period w ill switch to elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA during the open label 
Treatment Period after completing the 1 2-month Treat ment Period.
Study Duration:
The total duration for this study is up to 77 months.
The study consists of 4 periods:
Washout Period – up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking 
exclusionary medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of 
exclusionary medication being taken).

Study Duration (Continued):  
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period –up to [ADDRESS_970466] prematurely discontinues during the Treatment 
Period.
Washout Period:
Follow ing informed consent, subjects, who have been taking exclusionary medications, must enter a 
Washout Period.  Subjects must complete the Washout Period and then have at least 1 menses (refer to 
Table 2) after complet ion of washout, prior to entering the Screening Period.  The duration of w ashout 
period is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol.  The follow ing study procedures 
may be performed:  medical, social and gynecological history, a physical examination with vital signs, 
urine pregnancy testing; protocol -related adverse event review and documentation of current 
medications and a pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed 
after obtaining informed consent and prior to a subject entering the Washout Period in order to establish 
the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid an unnecessary and lengthy washout 
period.  Subjects w ill also begin the use of dual non -hormonal contraception and receive counseling on 
the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control and w ill have contraceptives 
dispensed as necessary.
Screening Period:
Follow ing informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects w ill enter into the approximately 
2.5to 5 Months Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
including the following assessments:  a pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU); a saline infusion 
sonohysterography (SIS); an endometrial biopsy ; a Pap test; a mammogram in subjects 39 years of age 
or older (at the time of randomization) if one was not performed w ithin 3 months prior to Screening; a 
dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (for BMD).  During the Screening Period, subjects must 
demonstrate MBL of > [ADDRESS_970467] all sanitary products 
(with or w ithout visible blood) on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting, and must return the products 
to the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of menses.  Subjects are required to use dual non -
hormonal contraception (as applicable), contraceptive counseling will be provided and contraceptives 
dispensed, as necessary.
Year 1 Treatm ent Period:

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids (leiom yomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur 
in up to 80% of women of reproductive age.[ADDRESS_970498] of s ymptomatic uterine fibroids exceeds 
$2billion per y ear in the [LOCATION_002].4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly  dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5
Although often as ymptomatic, fibroids may  cause sy mptoms severe enough to warrant 
therap y in 20% to 50% of women3and the most common sy mptom is heavy  or prolonged 
menstrual bleeding.  Other sym ptoms may  include anemia, pelvic pressure and pelvic 
organ compression, back pain, and adverse reproductive outcomes.  Heav y menstrual 
bleeding (HMB) (menorrhagia, defined as greater than 80 mL  per menstrual cy cle) is 
extremely  inconvenient, can significantl y impact quality of life and may lead to iron -
deficiency  anemia.
While there are numerous surgical options available to manage s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids, at present there is no long -term medical treatment for sym ptomatic uterine 
fibroids.
The ideal medical treatment for s ymptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to surgical 
interventions, should control HMB, improve non- bleeding s ymptoms and quality  of life, 
and prove safe and tolerable as a chronic therap y.  Unfortunatel y, currentl y available 
medical options provide only  short -term improvement of sy mptoms, and as such, are onl y
indicated prior to surgery, and/or their side -effects limit their long -term use.  A safe and 
effective chronic medical therap y for the management of HMB associated with uterine 
fibroids, as an alternative to hy sterectom y or other surgical intervention, ha s not y et been 
approved.

3.2 Elagolix
Elagolix sodium (hereinafter "elagolix," also referred to as ABT -620) is a novel, oral, 
short -acting, non -peptide, gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that 
competitively  inhibits the GnRH receptors in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_713082] -related pain and the chronic 
management of heav y menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids.  The initial preclinical and clinical evaluation of ela golix was conducted b y 
Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBI).  Safet y results from these studies show that elagolix is 
generall y well tolerated.  Elagolix, unlike injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose 
dependent suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_713083] l evels in women, i.e., from 
partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to nearly  full suppression at higher doses.  A 
detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology , metabolism, pharmacology  and 
pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in 
the Investigator's Brochure.6

information on clinical studies, exposure to study  drug, and safet y.
Clinical Program Overview
As of [ADDRESS_970500] 1 dose of elagolix in 
clinical studies conducted by  [CONTACT_112738] ([ADDRESS_970501] udies, 2 Phase 2 uterine fibroid studies [Studies M12 -663 and M12 -813], 
2 Phase 3 endometriosis studies [Studies M12 -665 and M12 -671], 2 Phase 3  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
21
endometriosis extension studies [Studies M12 -667 and M12 -821]), and ongoing Phase 3 
endometriosis studies [Stud y M14 -702 and Study  M16 -383].
In women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, [ADDRESS_970502] been 
completed b y [COMPANY_013], Study M12 -663 and Study  M12 -813.  The Phase 3 uterine fibroid 
registration program consists of 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], Study  M12 -815 and Study  M12 -817, 
and a single planned associated 6 -month safety /efficacy  extension study , Study  M12 -816.  
The Phase [ADDRESS_970503] a slightl y lower ovulation rate than 200 mg BID 
(27% versus 32%), and when the standard -dose estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 
0.5mg (standard- dose E2/NETA) was co- administered with elagolix 300 mg BID, the 
formulation for the current study , the ovulation rate decreased furth er to approximately  
10%.
Efficacy in Phase [ADDRESS_970504] recent version of Investigator Brochure for detailed description of the 
elagolix Phase 2b (Study  M12 -813) protocol and results.  Results from Study  M12 -813 
show that a ll treatment arms (both doses of elagolix [300 mg BID and 600 mg QD] alone 
or in combination with both strengths of E2/NETA in the form of Activella) met the 
primary  endpoint, which was the proportion of subjects who achieved a Menstrual Blood 
Loss (MBL) v olume of < 80 mL  at the Final Month and50% or greater reduction in MBL   
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
22
volume from Baseline to the Final Month compared to that of placebo (all P < 0.001), as 
measured b y the alkaline hematin method.
Additional results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that trea tment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA showed the following:
●Clinically  meaningful improvement in quality  of life measures and s ymptom 
severit y scores as assessed by [CONTACT_112743]- QOL
●Mitigation of BMD loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with standard -dose E2/NETA
●Substa ntial dose -dependent reduction in the incidence of vasomotor s ymptoms, 
e.g., hot flushes
●No evidence of endometrial safet y concerns
● Overall safet y profile remains unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings 
to date .
The conclusion from the Phase 2b stud y suggest that standard- dose E2/NETA as add- back 
therap y ma y be effective in preventing BMD loss during treatment with elagolix [ADDRESS_970505] on primary  efficacy  bleeding endpoints in premenopausal 
women with HMB associated with uterine f ibroids.  This dosing regimen could 
potentially  meet the objective of a long -term therapy  for the management of sy mptomatic 
uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.
Adverse Events in Elagolix Uterine Fibroid Studies
Please see Investigator Brochure Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_970506] extensive 
single stud y data set that examined the tolerability of elagolix at dosing to be used in 
Phase 3, including the present study  and show that, overall, the percentage of subj ects 
who reported treatment -emergent adverse events was generall y similar across all  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
23
treatment groups in both cohorts, ranging from 67.9% to 87.0%, with the highest values in 
the elagolix alone groups (300 mg BID, 80.0%; 600 mg QD, 87.0%).  Estrogen -depend ent 
adverse events from elagolix treatment were ameliorated significantl y with the estrogen -
progestin add -back regimens as detailed below.
The most common adverse events in both cohorts were hot flush, insomnia, and headache.  
The rates for hot flush in Cohort 1 were 3.1% for placebo and 44.6% for elagolix [ADDRESS_970507]- dose E2/NETA significantly  
decreased the rates b y approximately  20% and 34%, respectively  (25.0% for elagolix 
300mg BID + low -dose E2/NETA and 1 0.8% for elagolix 300 mg BID + standard- dose 
E2/NETA).  In Cohort 2, the rates of hot flush were 5.1% for placebo and 49.4% for 
elagolix [ADDRESS_970508]- dose E2/NETA 
significantl y decreased the rates b y approximately  31% and 35%, respectively  (18.4% for 
elagolix 600 mg QD + low -dose E2/NETA and 14.3% for elagolix 600 mg QD + 
standard- dose E2/NETA).
Adverse events of special interest in elagolix clinical studies are discussed in the 
Investigator Brochure and include hot flu sh, cutaneous adverse events, ovarian -related 
events, BMD decrease, fractures, uterine bleeding, mood changing disorders (suicidality 
and depression) and changes in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].
In the completed Phase 2 studies in uterine fibroids, there were a higher per centage of 
women experiencing cutaneous/h ypersensitivity  events and hot flush with elagolix 
treatment compared with placebo.  Adverse events of special interest will continue to be 
monitored in all clinical studies including the present study.
Serious Adve rse Events in the Elagolix Uterine Fibroid Program
Please see Investigator Brochure Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for details regarding Serious Adverse 
Events seen across the elagolix clinical program.  This section will summarize the SAEs 
noted in the elagolix Phase 2b study , Study  M12 -813. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
24
In Cohort 1 of the Phase 2b study  in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 
there were 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) that either occurred during the Treatment 
Period or within [ADDRESS_970509] dose in 8 subjects randomi zed to receive active treatment.  
There were six SAEs in placebo treated subjects (9.2%), 3 (4.6%) in the elagolix 300 mg 
BID group, 3 (4.7%) in the elagolix 300 mg BID + LD E2/NETA group, and 1 (1.5%) in 
the elagolix 300 mg BID + SD E2/NETA group.  Treatm ent-emergent SAEs were 
reported for [ADDRESS_970510] (1.3%) in the placebo group, 
5(6.5%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD group, 3 (3.9%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD + LD 
E2/NETA group, and 4 (5.2%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD + SD E2/NE TA group.  In both 
cohorts, the majority  of SAEs were reported by  [ADDRESS_970511] in the elagolix 600 mg QD + LD E2/NETA group had an SAE of uterine 
leiomy oma that was considered reasonabl y possibly related to study drug.
Effects of Elagolix on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in the Uterine Fibroid Phase 2b 
Study
In the 6 -month Phase 2b study  BMD was assessed at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 –L4), femoral 
neck, and total hip via DXA at Screening and at Month 6 of the Treatment Period, or 
Premature Discontinuation.
Results from the Phase 2b uterine fibroid stud y demonstrate that treatment with elagolix 
300 mg BID and 600 mg QD significantly decrease BMD, which is partially mitigated b y 
addition of E2/NETA in a dose -dependent manner.  I n Cohort 1, the mean percentage 
change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_112699] 300 mg 
BID alone group was –3.8% at Month 6; 19% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 
29% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 8% had a ≥8% BMD de crease.
In Cohort 2, the mean percentage change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_112699] 300 mg BID alone group was –3.4% at Month 6; 25% of subjects 
had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 21% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 7% had a 
≥8% BMD decrease.  The addition of standard -dose E2 (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
25
acetate 0.5 mg) substantially mitigated BMD loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_112700] 6 
compared with the elagolix alone group.  In Cohort 1 the mean change from baseline 
–0.1% v ersus –3.8%), while in Cohort [ADDRESS_970512] dose E2/NETA resulted in a mean 
change from baseline was –1.1% vs –3.4%.
After [ADDRESS_970513] E2/NETA (estradiol 
1.0mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) group 6.3% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD 
decrease, [ADDRESS_970514] (2%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and no subjects had ≥ 8% BMD 
decrease at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Similarly  after [ADDRESS_970515] E2/NETA group 9.6% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 3 subjects
(5.8%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and [ADDRESS_970516] (1.9%) had ≥ 8% BMD decrease at 
the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].
Taken together results from the Study  M12 -[ADDRESS_970517] E2/NETA 
dose would ameliorate bone loss observed during treatment of heav y menstrua l bleeding 
in women with uterine fibroids using elagolix 300 mg BID.
Effects of Elagolix on Clinical Laboratory Parameters
In the Phase 2 studies, changes in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], in particular total cholesterol and low -
density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C), wer e observed in this study , similar to those in 
which occur as women enter menopause7and these changes, as expected, were somewhat 
attenuated by E2/NETA in a dose- dependent manner.  Mean percentage increases from 
Baseline in total cholesterol, high densit y lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), L DL-C, and 
triglycerides were observed across each of the elagolix tr eatment groups over the [ADDRESS_970518] version of the Investigator Brochure for details. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -[ADDRESS_970519] frequently  in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone 
group and the elagolix 600 mg QD alone group, while the reports of no bleeding declined 
in a dose -dependent fashion with the addition of E2/NETA.
Of subjects who rece ived elagolix and were amenorrheic upon entering the Post -treatment 
Follow -up Period, the majority  of subjects (52% in Cohort 1 and 59% in Cohort 2) 
returned to menses at Month 1, and an additional 42% in Cohort 1 and 38% in Cohort 2 
returned to menses at Month 2.
Endometrial Safety in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids 
Endometrial biopsies were conducted at Baseline and at Month 6 in Study  M12 -813.  
Results from Cohort 1 show that, among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 39% to 
43% had normal quiesc ent/minimally  stimulated endometrium and 14% to 28% had 
normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically  significant findings were 
observed.
Results from Cohort 2 are similar.  Among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 21% to 
36% had normal q uiescent/minimally  stimulated endometrium and 20% to 32% had 
normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically  significant findings were 
observed.

As would be expected from a molecule that decreases serum estradiol, there was no 
endometrial h yperplasia in women treated with elagolix alone in the Phase 2b uterine 
fibroid study  nor was this observed after 6 months treatment with either addback arms.
3.2.3 Pregnancy  in Elagolix Studies
Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the most recent edition of the elag olix I nvestigator 
Brochure of a complete discussion of Pregnancies in the Elagolix Clinical Development 
Program.  As discussed above and in the Investigator Brochure, elagolix does not block 
ovulation although there is a dose dependent inhibition of ovulat ion with increasing 
dosage.
Pregnancies have been observed in the elagolix clinical studies.  Although there were no 
congenital malformations observed in the elagolix Phase 3 endometriosis program, earlier 
Phase 2 studies with elagolix did reveal 2 pregnan cies with congenital malformations.
In the aforementioned Phase 2b UF (Study  M12 -813) study , [ADDRESS_970520] also be monitored vigilantly  across the entire development 
program, including adverse events related to pregnancy  outcomes.  Women should also be 
counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to mothers exposed to 
elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.

Phase 3 Clinical Development Program for Uterine Fibroids
The overall objective of the Phase 3 registration clinical development program is to 
generate requisite safet y, tolerability, and efficacy data in 2 replicate 6 -month Phase 3 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_713084] 1 safety  and efficacy extension study  (total 12 -month treatm ent period) 
to support use of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone 
acetate 0.5 mg) for the intended indication of the chronic management of HMB associated 
with uterine fibroids.
The primary  objective of this current Phase 3b (St udy M16 -283) study  in women with 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids is to obtain extended data on the safety  of elagolix 
[ADDRESS_970521] dose E2/NETA .  All subjects will have the opportunity  to be 
treated with elagolix [ADDRESS_970522] dose E2/NETA for the second, third and 
fourth y ears of the study  enabling a careful examination of the long term safet y of this 
dose over [ADDRESS_970523] to bone loss compared to baseline.
3.3 Estradiol/Norethindrone A cetate
E2/NETA (1.0 m g E2 and 0.5 mg NETA) is a continuous combined oral 
estrogen/progestin regimen.  E2/NETA is approved in the [LOCATION_002] as 
postmenopausal hormone replacement therap y for the treatment of moderate to severe 
vasomotor sy mptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.  E2/NETA is also approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of 
moderate to severe s ymptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy  associated with menopause.  
The Phase 2b Study M12 -[ADDRESS_970524] 
study  subjects.  For this reason estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.[ADDRESS_970525] efficacy in reducing HMB and E2/NETA  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

is the optimal regimen for managing and limiting BMD loss, such that longer term dosing 
is feasible.
Continued assessments of this treatment regimen in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials will provide 
the requisite data to support registration of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA as safe and 
efficacious treatment for the chronic manage ment of HMB associated with uterine 
fibroids.
This long -term stud y will demonstrate safet y data of elagolix 300 mg BID plus estradiol 
1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.[ADDRESS_970526] common sy mptom of premenopausal women with uterine fibroids is heavy  
menstrual bleeding (HMB).  A safe and effective chronic pharmacologic therap y for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hy sterectom y or other surgical 
intervention, has not y et been approved, which is the objective of the elagolix Phase 3 
clinical development program.  Results from Phase 2 studies in women with HMB 
associated with uterine fibr oids demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
alone and in combination with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy  in reducing HMB 
associated with uterine fibroids.  I mportantly , when co -administered with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 m g/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) mitigated BMD loss 
observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone and substantially  reduced other hy poestrogenic 
adverse events such as hot flushes.  Also co -administration of elagolix and E2/NETA 
attenuated increases in serum l ipid parameters observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone.  
Furthermore, there was no evidence of endometrial safet y concerns and the overall safety 
profile remained unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
This therapeutic approach, if successful, could provide an alternative to surgical 
interventions as a chronic pharmacologic treatment for heav y menstrual period associated 
with uterine fibroids.  Based on the totality  of data to date from the Phase 2 clinical  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
30
development program, the overall benefit/risk profile of elagolix 300 mg BID with 
E2/NETA appears to be favorable for the chronic management of HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids, and will be established in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].  This Phase 3b study 
will extend understanding of th e safet y of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA compared 
to placebo for [ADDRESS_970527] to bone mineral densit y compared to baseline.
Considering the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to 
subjects participating in this study  has been re -evaluated.  Based on the information to 
date, no additional risk to study  participants is anticipated with the use of elagolix in 
combination with E2/NETA .
4.0 Study  Objectives
The objectives of this study are to:
1. Assess the safet y of elagolix 300 mg administered twice dail y (BID) in 
combination with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) 
compared to placebo at [ADDRESS_970528] of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA on bone mineral 
density  (BMD) in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids after up to 
48months of treatment.

about washout intervals for exclusionary  medication is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Study  
procedures to be performed during the Washout Period are specified in Appendix C, 
Study  Activities and described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Subjects must complete the Washout 
Period and then have at least 1 menses (refer to Table 2) prior to entering the Screening 
Period.  A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be 
performed prior to the Washout Period to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) 
or measure the uterine volume to avoid the subject unnece ssarily  undergoing a lengthy  
washout of hormonal medications.
Subjects will also begin the use of dual non -hormonal contraception during the Washout 
Period and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective 
use of birth contr ol and will have contraceptives dispensed, as necessary .
Screening Period
Subjects who do not require washout will enter the Screening Period (approximately  
2.5to 5 months) and will provide written informed consent before an y study -related 
procedures are performed.  Subjects will undergo screening procedures as outlined in 
Appendix C, Study  Activities and described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , to establish eligibility 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during screening, if not 
performed in the Washout Period, to determine the presence and size of qualify ing uterine 
fibroids and uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary criteria.  A saline infusion

sonohy sterograph y (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary gynecological 
disorders such a s intracavitary  submucosal pedunculated fibroids and endometrial polyps.
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by 
[CONTACT_713101] 
[ADDRESS_970536] been made, may  undergo an MRI for further evaluation 
during Screening (per imaging vendor request).
Subjects with previous invasive testing (e.g., endometrial biopsy, pelvic ultrasound, Pap 
test and SI S) in addition to DXA assessments within the last 3 months prior to screening
and original results available may  qualify  to participate in this study .
Eligibility  based on MBL (> 80 mL for each of 2 menstrual cy cles) will be established 
using the alkaline hematin method.  Sanitary  products and the collection kits will be 
dispensed during Screening.  Training will be provided to subjects to ensure collection of 
sanitary  products for menstrual bleeding assessment at the start of the subject's 
firstmenses in the Screening Period (Screening Menstr ual Cy cle 1).  Subjects will be 
required to collect all used or worn sanitary products (including products with no visible 
blood on them) on day s with menstrual bleeding or spotting over the course of [ADDRESS_970537] signed the informed consent and did not randomize because they  either 
did not complete the Washout Period (if applicable), did not complete the study -specific 
procedures during the Screening Period (e.g., TAU/TVU or SI S) or did not meet all entry  
criteria will be considered Screen Failures.  The reason(s) for screen failure will be 
recorded in the source documents and in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

Screening Sanitary Product Collection Visits
At each Screening Product Collection Visit, sanitary  products to measure menstrual blood 
loss will be collected and a venous blood sample will be obtained.  The site will submit 
the sanitary  products and venous blood sample to the alkaline hematin laboratory  for 
analysis of blood loss to determine eligibility .
Vital signs, a urine pregnancy  test, contraception counseling and adverse event and 
concomitant medication review will also be performed during these visits.  Additional 
sanitary  collection kits and contraceptives will be dispensed at each on -site visit.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Counse ling/Dispensing Contraceptives
Investigators and stud y staff will be trained b y the Sponsor on the importance of 
contraception in this clinical trial.  Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a 
bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion) will be counseled b y the Investigator or 
designated study  staff at every  visit throughout study  participation on the importance of 
pregnancy  prevention and the use of appropriate and effective methods of contraception.
Subjects must agree to use two forms of non -hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently  throughout the Washout (if applicable), Screening and Treatment Periods and 
the first month of the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.  Subjects may  begin the use of 
hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completion of the Post- Treatment 
Follow -Up Month [ADDRESS_970582] after 1 month off study  
drug and return to menses.
Acceptable methods of dual non- hormonal contraception include the following 
combination s:
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel or pol ymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may  or may  not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may  or may  not be used) 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to screening
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifesty le of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable
●Subject had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion at least 
4months prior to screening.
●Subject is not sexually  active with men; however, periodic sexual 
relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non -hormonal contraception 
as indicated above.
●Subject has begun the use of hormonal contraception after the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Month 1 visit .
●Subjects may  begin the use of hormonal contraception after the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Month [ADDRESS_970583] has not 
returned to menses b y Month 1 , the I nvestigator would use acceptable medical 
practice to reinitiate hormonal contraceptive (e.g., pregnancy  test, FSH, 
induction of withdrawal bleed).
The following measures will be taken to help ensure pregnancy  prevention during the 
study .
1. The informed consent form will include an attestation requiring the subject to 
confirm in writing (via signature) her full awareness that the potential risks of study 
drug on the unborn child are unknown and th erefore she must not get pregnant 
during the entire time of study  participation, and that she agrees to consistently  use 
protocol required dual non -hormonal contraception throughout her study  
participation.
2. The Investigator or designated study  staff will c ounsel the subject that the study  
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may 
have altered menstrual cycle patterns, and that fetal abnormalities have been  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -[ADDRESS_970584] received elagolix in clinical stud ies however, it is 
unknown whether these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the ty pes of protocol -allowed contraception methods, their effectiveness and pro per 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide all investigative sites with a supply  of materials to 
promote pregnancy  prevention, including contraceptives ( e.g., condoms and 
spermicides) to provide to subjects at no charge.
●Subjects should only  use the pregnancy  preve ntion material s provided b y the 
Sponsor as these products have undergone analytical testing b y the anal ytical 
lab to confirm there is no or limited interference with the alkaline hematin 
method.
●Subjects will be allowed to choose a n acceptable contraceptio n method of their 
choice from the contraceptives provided by [CONTACT_713105].  The site will 
assess the subject's basic understanding of the proper contraceptive use through 
discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, if needed, including proper 
diaphragm use.
●The site will provide contraceptives (and other supplies (e.g., lubricants) to 
subjects throughout Washout, if applicable, Screening and Treatment Periods, 
as needed.
●The source documents will capture date initial contraception counseling was 
performed , whether the subject meets protocol criteria for not requiring use of 
dual contraception and the ty pe of contraceptive provided to the subject (as 
applicable). At subsequent study  visits, the source documents will ca pture if 
there was a change in contraceptive method, use of a non -study  supply  brand, 
and whether additional contraceptives were provided to the subject.
●The subject will be asked to attest by [CONTACT_112756], and 
subsequently  in a stand -alone attestation form at all on-site study  visits that 
allowable methods of contraception, as described during the pregnancy 
prevention counseling, are being practiced.

●For subjects who have had a bila teral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion, 
(including Essure®), attestation is only  required to be collected once during the 
study  prior to randomization, ideally  at the time of consent.  Additionally , these 
subjects do not require contraception co unseling at any  study  visit or the 
associated documentation of that counseling.
4. On-site and phone visits are used to promote frequent interaction with site staff and 
opportunities for continued education.
5. At each Treatment Period visit (on -site and phone v isits), the proper use of 
contraception will be reinforced to address possible ineffective use and the risk of 
unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity .
COVID -[ADDRESS_970585] is unable to come on -site, the 
contraception counseling should be conducted during the phone visits (as applicable). 
The site should ship a reasonable quantity of contraceptive supplies for subject use until 
next on -site visit.  The ty peand quantit y of contraceptives shipped to the subject must be 
documented along with the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_642418].  When subject 
is able to go to the site, site should make sure that enough contraceptives are dispensed to 
the subject.

Fibroid and uterine assessments will be obtained using pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) 
at Washout (if applicable), Screening, Months 12, 24, 36, 48 or Premature 
Discontinuation Visit and SI S at Screening.  All ultrasound images will be sent to the 
Central I maging Core Lab (central reader) for review to determine eligibility  for 
randomization and to monitor safet y during the Treat ment Period.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU and SIS) and MRI  (if applicable) will be performed b y 
the investigative sites' or affiliated Radiology Department.  The ultrasonographer at each 
investigative site will be required to acquire the ultrasound, SI Sand MRI (if applicable) 
images according to the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines provided b y the central reader.  
Images should be sent/transmitted to the central reader to determine eligibility for entry 
into the study  and for subject evaluation during the course of the study.  Refer to the 
Image Acquisition Guidelines for instructions on submitting images to the central reader.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU and SIS) and MRI  (if applicable) will be assessed both 
locally  and by  [CONTACT_9251].  The cen tral reader will issue an Eligibility Form based 
on review of the pelvic ultrasound and SI S indicating the presence or absence of a 
qualify ing fibroid and/or uterine volume and whether an y exclusionary pathology was 
present.  If images are unevaluable, the central reader will inform the investigative site 
and additional images will need to be resubmitted.  If there is a discrepancy between the 
local assessment and the central reader's assessment, this should be brought to [COMPANY_013]'s 
attention and TA MD will d iscuss the findings with the local site and central reader on a 
case-by-case basis to determine eligibility .

Pelvic Ultrasound:  TAU and TVU
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed early in the Screening Period and 
should ideally  be performed during the subject's earl y proliferative phase of the menstrual 
cycle (approximately  Day s 4 –8 of the cy cle), or in the Washout Period, if applicable.  
Subsequent pelvic ultrasounds will be performed at the time points indicated in, 
Appendix C, Study  Activities.  The pelvic ultrasound will determine the presence of 
qualify ing uterine fibroids and uterine volume.  The TAU and TVU will be used to 
confirm the presence of qualify ing ut erine fibroids (at least 1 fibroid with diameter ≥ 2 cm 
(longest diameter), or multiple fibroids with a uterine volume of ≥ 200 cm3to 
≤2,[ADDRESS_970608] fibroid.  The TVU will be used to assess gy necological disorders, such as ovarian

cysts and endometriomas.  However, these assessments can also be made by  [CONTACT_112764], if 
necessary .
Assessments for the pelvic ultrasound include, but are not limited to the following:
●Endometrial thickness 
●Presence of abnormal endometrial appearance or endometrial pathology
●Presence of uterine fibroids
●Number of uterine fibroids
●Volume and location of the [ADDRESS_970609] fibroids
●Uterine volume in cubic centimeters

Saline Infusion Sonohysterography (SIS)
In addition to the pelvic ultrasound, an SI S will also be performed in all subjects during 
the Screening Period, to assess exclusion criteria based on the presence of focal 
intracavitary  lesions including:
●Endometrial poly p ≥ 1 cm
●Intracavitary  submucosal pedunculated fibroid
The SI S should be performed as early  as possible during the Sc reening Period to rule out 
any exclusionary  findings; for subjects entering washout, an SI S will not be performed 
until the subject enters the Screening Period in order to limit the number of invasive 
procedures prior to full y determining eligibility .  The subject must have a confirmed

Intracavitary Uterine Findings
An SI S may  be performed during the Treatment Period if the pelvic ultrasound (TAU and 
TVU) results suggest an intracavitary  lesion such as a poly p.  The finding of a poly p 
during the Treatment Period should be documented as an adverse event if the Investigator 
considers it to be clinically  significant.
The [COMPANY_013] TA MD should be notified of the subject's management plan for an y 
clinically  significant pathologic find ings during the Treatment Period.
Ovarian Findings:
During Screening, if the initial pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst > 5 and 
≤ 7cm in longest diameter, an ultrasound of the ovaries may  be repeated in approximately  
[ADDRESS_970614] be evaluated prior to Day  1 (Randomization) and 
not meet exclusion criteria (i.e., persistent simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm).
In Screening, if an y of the adnexal structures, such as an ovary, cannot be visualized on 
the pelvic ultrasound due to, f or example, fibroid location and/or fibroid size, the subject  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

may be eligible for randomization provided there are no exclusionary  findings based on an 
alternate imaging that can evaluate that adnexa such as an MRI (per central reader 
agreement).
During th e Treatment Period, if the pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cy st > [ADDRESS_970615] (including endometriomas) > 3.[ADDRESS_970616] diameter the 
findings should be documented as an adverse event if the I nvestigator considers them to 
be clinically  significant.
Bone Mineral Density (DXA Scan)
DXA scans of the lumber spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral neck and total hip will be performed by [CONTACT_112765]/radiologists at the site or affiliated imaging facility utilizing GE L unar or 
Hologic equipment and per the acquisition guidelines provided b y the Central Imaging 
Core Lab (central reader).  The DXA technologist/radiologist or designee for each 
investigative site should electronically  submit the subject's DXA images to the central 
reader for review and analy sis following acquisition.  Subject eligibility  and treatment 
management will be made based on the central reader review.  Sites will receive reports 
from the central reader detailing the results (including T -scores and BMD % change from 
baseline, as applicable) of the DXA scans performed.  Site training and qualifications,

prior to screening the first subject.  I nstructions on calibration and standardization of 
instruments and any additional required information will be specified in a manual from 
the central reader that will be provided to all study sites.  Sites will need to obtain 
approval from the central reader prior to initiating study  scans.
A DXA scan will be performed during Screening Period and sent to the central reader to 
determine eligibility  and serve as the baseline scan for subject management.  Subjects 
with a T-score of < – 2.0 at the lumber spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip or femoral neck on the screening

All clinical laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory , with the 
exception of the venous blood sample for alkaline hematin anal ysis which will be sent to 
the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory  during screening.
The laboratory  results will be provided by  [CONTACT_654386], signed and dated b y the I nvestigator.  For any  value outside 
of the reference range, the Investigator will review and indica te on the report if the result 
is clinically  significant (CS) or not clinically  significant (NCS).  The Investigator will 
evaluate clinically  significant laboratory  values per standard of care which may  include 
repeating the test to verify the out -of-range value.  Clinically  significant laboratory  
abnormalities post randomization may  be documented as adverse events, depending on 
the interpretation of the Investigator (Section 6.0).
All screening laboratory  results must be reviewed prior to randomization, including an y 
repeated test results.  Screening laboratory  tests may  be repeated one time prior to Day  1, 
however, results must satisfy  entry  criteri a prior to randomization.  Subjects will not be

Additional ly, there may  be times when a subject has had treatment interruption due to 
having forgotten to take study  medication, lost study  medication, etc.  If the subject has 
missed 10 or more consecutive day s of dosing (with either elagolix/E2/NETA or Placebo), 
the [COMPANY_013] TA MD must be consulted to determine whether the subject may  resume 
study  drug administration or continue in the Treatment Period.
These examples are not all- inclusive; if the I nvestigator has an y questions, these should be 
directed to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD who will provide a recommendation.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 3b study  will be conducted as a randomized, sequential, 12 -month double -
blind placebo- controlled, 36 -month open- label, multi- center stud y in premenopausal 
women 18 to 50 y ears of age with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.
This study  will evaluate the long -term safet y of elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in 
subjects with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The study will also assess the impact 
of elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA on BMD in women with HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids after up to [ADDRESS_970672] common sy mptom of women with uterine 
fibroids.  The quantitation of menstrual blood loss using the alkaline hematin method on 
sanitary  products has been validated b y the analytical t esting laboratory .  Pelvic  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -[ADDRESS_970673] Population
Premenopausal women 18 to 50 y ears of age with HMB (> 80 mL  per menstrual cy cle) 
and uterine fibroids were selected for this study because that is the population who suffer 
from HMB associated with ute rine fibroids.  The lower bound of the age limit (18) was 
chosen based on the relative paucit y of adolescent females with s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids prior to age 18, and the upper age of 50 is included to reduce the risk of subjects 
becoming menopausal during the stud y.  No studies in females outside of the reproductive 
years are necessary  for this proposed indication.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The results of the 3- month Phase 2a dose finding, Proof -of-Concept (POC) study  indicate 
that elagolix [ADDRESS_970674] effective dose in reducing HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids.  The 6 -month Phase 2b safet y/efficacy  study  confirmed these results and 
also demonstrated that E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) was 
effective in preventing BMD loss and ameliorating vasomotor s ymptoms due to estrogen 
suppression.  The data (PK/PD) from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) and 
folliculogenesis studies in healthy  subjects also provide additional support for the targeted 
elagolix dose.  All of these studies have demonstrated an acceptable safet y and tolerability  
profile.
Based on the totality  of safet y and efficacy data, elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA 
(estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) was selected for further evaluation in 
Phase 3.  The maximum elagolix dose administered in this study  will not exceed a total 
daily  dose of 600 mg.

All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactor y conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -[ADDRESS_970677] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
A BMD decrease at an y anatomic location (lumber spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip or femoral neck) 
during the Treatment Per iod that leads to discontinuation from study  drug should be 
reported as an adverse event.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -
existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the stud y (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for w hich the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.

Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability  is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as headache,

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  
elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered 
an important medical event.  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
For some adverse events, such as SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESI), 
such as elevated liver transaminases, bone mineral den sity decrease/fractures, and mood 
and depression- related events, hot flashes and other non-bone h ypoestrogenic events, lipid 
abnormalities, cardiovascular events, thromboembolic events, hormonall y sensitive 
malignancies, and alopecia, [COMPANY_013] may  require ad ditional information, including family

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event , 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic pla usibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.

Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
Analy sis details will be specified in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, all summaries/anal yses involving AEs will only
 include 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  TEAEs are defined as an y AE with an onset 
or increased severity  after the first dose of study d rug and no more than [ADDRESS_970695] dose time of 
study  drug.  If an incomplete onset dat e was collected for an AE, the AE will be assumed 
to be treatment- emergent unless there is evidence that confirms that the AE was not 
treatment -emergent (e.g., the AE end date was prior to the first dose date of study  drug).
AEs starting more than 30 day s following discontinuation of the study  drug will not be 
included in the summaries of TEAEs.
TEAEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
version 19.0 or higher.  TEAEs will be summarized using MedDRA s ystem organ clas ses 
(SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) and grouped b y treatment group.

M16 -[ADDRESS_970696] will be counted in the 
severit y/relationship category  of "unknown," even if the subject has a second occurrence 
of the same event with a severit y/relationship present.  The only  exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme sever ity (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possibility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severit y/relationship categories.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with TEAEs will be calculated for eac h treatment 
group as follows:
●Any TEAE
●Any TEAE reasonabl y possibly  related to study  drug
●Any TEAE leading to discontinuation of study  drug
●Any treatment -emergent serious AE (SAE)

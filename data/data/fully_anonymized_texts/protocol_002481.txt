in critically ill adults with pneumonia suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_105501] (MRSA).  
1.2 We hypothesize that when automated PCR is used to guide 
antibiotic therapy, antibiotic exposure will be reduced in critically ill 
subjects with pneumonia.  
 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance.  
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major problem in intensive care units 
(ICUs). (4-6) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate drug resistant 
infections affect more than 2 million individuals nationwide and cause 23,000 
deaths annually. (7)  In a recent executive order, the President of the United 
States (8) called for improved antibiotic stewardship and the development of 
rapid diagnostic tests to i dentify antibiotic resistant infections. (9)  In ICU patients 
with pneumonia, guidelines (10, 11)  advocate the routine use of broad spectrum 
antibiotics in most patients. In large part this is bec ause diagnostic testing for 
pneumonia is too insensitive and too slow to inform decision making about 
appropriate antibiotics. Overuse of broad spectrum antibiotics promotes drug 
resistance by [CONTACT_105502]. (12 -14) This 
proposal will apply a new diagnostic test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_105479] a drug resistant pathogen, methicillin resistant staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) to reduce inappropriate antibiotics in ICU patients with suspected 
pneumonia.  
MRSA is an important cause of drug resistant pneumonia associated with high 
mortality. (15, 16)  Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus  (SA) results 
from acquisition of the mecA gene located in the mobile element staphylococcal 
cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). (2)  Risk factors for MRSA are shown in  
 Table 1.  MRSA pneumonia requires specific antibiotic therapy, (17)  treatment 
guidelines recommend addition of empi[INVESTIGATOR_105480].  
(10, 11)  Our prior work 
demonstrates that there 
is significant overlap of 
MRSA risk factors with 
risk factors for other 
DRPs, (18) which 
potentially leads to the 
overuse of anti -MRSA 
antibiotics. (19, 20)   
Globally, MRSA 
pneumonia occurs in an 
estimated 2 -6% of ICU 
patients. (21, 22)  By

 Page 4 of 15  9/9/2016  majority of ICU patients with suspected pneumonia. (23)  We have shown that at 
our own institution, the prevalence of MRSA is 5.5%, but empi[INVESTIGATOR_105481] -MRSA 
therapy is prescribed in 89.5% of ICU patients with pneumonia. (24, 25)  The 
large gap between empi[INVESTIGATOR_105483] k of specificity of DRP risk factors, 
and the time delay of bacterial cultures. Overuse of antibiotics against MRSA has 
adverse consequences for patients, including new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105484] 
(HAIs), increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), and higher cost. (26-28) 
Faster and more accurate diagnostic tests for MRSA, such as PCR, have the 
potential to reduce antibiotic exposure and improve patient outcomes .  The time 
delay of bacterial cultures and the lack of specificity of DRP risk factors is a major 
limitation to the treatment of pneumonia, particularly in ICUs where the rapid 
delivery of appropriate antibiotics could be life savi ng. PCR has the potential to 
change the paradigm of empi[INVESTIGATOR_105485] a resistant pathogen. However, 
molecular diagnostic tests have not yet been validated for routine clinical 
practice. (29) 
2.2 Preliminary data.  
We will compare detection of MRSA in BAL samples obtained in 
intubated adult patients with suspec ted pneumonia using Cepheid Xpert® 
PCR to traditional microbiologic cultures.   
The Cepheid Xpert ® system. The Cepheid Xpert® is an automated, self -
contained platform designed to detect S. aureus  and MRSA in body fluids using 
PCR amplification. Two assays are available: Cepheid Xpert® SA Nasal 
Complete for nasopharyngeal samples and Cepheid Xpert ®MRSA/SA SSTI for 
use in skin and soft tissue samples. S. aureus (SA) is detected by [CONTACT_105503] A (spa) gene, MRSA is identified by [CONTACT_105504]. Prior studies report detection of MRSA is possible in 58 
minutes.  
Three groups (30- 32) have reported using Cepheid Xpert® to detect MRSA in 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_92198]. PCR exhibits a sensitivity of 80 -100% and 
negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.3% - 100%. The range in sensitivity is likely 
related to variation in the prevalence of MRSA and inadequate power. One study, Leone et al (30), reported that 10.6% of the tests were not interpretable, and 
there was 1 false negative. All the non- interpretable results and the false 
negative came from a single center using the Nasal Complete assay.

RCT of MRSA PCR  
 Page 5 of 15  9/9/2016  We are currently prospectively validating automated PCR using BAL 
samples from intubated ICU patients with suspected pneumonia. 
Residual BAL samples obtained for the clinical care of ICU patients will 
be obtained for analysis. The methodology for this is described in our 
prior IRB submission: PCR  to ID MRSA in BAL,  STU00201397.  
2.3 Innovation of the current proposal.  
In this proposal , we will use automated PCR to manage antibiotics in 
critically ill subjects  with suspected  MRSA  pneumonia. This is a novel 
approach to pneumonia diagnosis and treatment. A utomated PCR has 
not been used previously to withhold or stop empi[INVESTIGATOR_105487].  
 
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The primary safety endpoint is concordance of MRSA PCR result to the 
results of respi[INVESTIGATOR_19170].  In addition, clinical response subsequent to 
withdrawing/withholding MRSA drugs and subsequent documentation of 
MRSA infection(s) at other sites will be recor ded.

9.2. Study site.   
This study will be conducted in the medical ICU (MICU) at NMH, a 33 -bed unit 
staffed by [CONTACT_105506], trainees, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175] (RTs). In 
intubated patients  with suspected pneumonia, BALs are obtained by [CONTACT_105507] , or trained RTs for 
nonbronchoscopic BALs (NBBALs) . About 60 total BALs are collected monthly  in 
the MICU . 
9.3. Study design.   
An overview of the clinical trial is shown in Figure 1. Patients admitted to the MICU with suspected pneumonia will be screened for inclusion. 
Subjects with suspected pneumonia will be randomized to antibiotic 
management with automated PCR compared to usual care in a 1:[ADDRESS_117159] of MRSA PCR  
 Page 8 of 15  9/9/2016  9.4 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)  
Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens will be gathered from all study subjects by a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489] (RT) nonbronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (NB -BAL) or by a qualified 
physician bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (B -BAL). BAL is routinely preformed for clinical care 
of patients with pneumonia in ICU settings, and all subjects  enrolled in this study 
will have had a BAL done for clinical care rather than for the study. The most 
common risk is transient hypoxia which typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] [ADDRESS_117160] bleeding, and pneumothorax.  
These are seen rarely and occur in <1% of all non -bronchoscopic BALs 
performed.  
9.5 Sample processing and Study device  
Following collection, BAL samples gathered from subjects in the PCR arm will be transferred immediately to the molecular epi[INVESTIGATOR_105490] a qualified laboratory 
technician. Testi ng will be done using the Cepheid Xpert® Assay, performed on 
the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for rapid detection and differentiation of  Staphylococcus aureus (SA) 
and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA in body fluids using the  
Cepheid Xpert ® MRSA/SA SSTI developed for use in skin and soft tissue 
samples. SA is detected by [CONTACT_105508] A (spa) 
gene, MRSA is identified by [CONTACT_105509] (SCCmec). Prior studies report detection of MRSA is possible 
in 58 minutes. (30) the GeneXpert® Instrument is already available in the NMH 
Microbiology laboratory.  
Once the PCR is completed, the results will be relayed to the study  
physician who will communicate with the treating physician regarding whether  
MRSA antibiotic therapy (vancomycin or linezolid) will be started or stopped based on the study protocol. All BAL samples will be sent for routine bacterial 
cultures based on rout ine clinical care. If there bacterial culture result and the 
PCR result are discordant, the treating physician will be notified immediately.  
9.[ADDRESS_117161], and based on prior work the 
rate of false negative is approximately 0.1%. In subjects who are clinically 
unstable, as defined above, MRSA coverage will be provided until the 
result s of the PCR are available. Our prior study, PCR to ID MRSA in 
BAL, STU00201397, is designed to confirm there is high concordance of 
the two tests.  In the unlikely event that the PCR yields a false negative 
test for MRSA, the treating team will be informed  immediately and 
appropriate antibiotic therapy will be started.   
9.7 Patient data collection  
All relevant patient data will be collected using the Northwestern University Enterprise Data Warehouse (NU -EDW) from Cerner Powerchart and EPIC 
electronic health records. A program will be written using NU -EDW to extract 
clinical variables (see Appendix f or data collection form and coded identifier list).  
Patient data will be removed and subjects will be identified based a unique study 
identifier. A separate password protected file will map the study identifier to the 
subject’s medical record number. All patient data will be kept on a password 
RCT of MRSA PCR  
 Page 9 of 15  9/9/[ADDRESS_117162]. Patient data will be available 
for the duration of the study and publication of the manuscript, which is 
anticipated to be 1 year  from study completion.  
10.2 Specimen storage  
BAL specimens will be stored in a refrigerator contained in a locked room only accessible to the study staff and microbiology lab personnel. The specimens will 
be stored at 2 -8°C for up to [ADDRESS_117163] and/or LAR will have the option of participating to have any left over BAL

for use in other not directly related research.   These samples will be stored in a -
80°C  freezer in the Wunderink lab for up to [ADDRESS_117164] one dose of antibiotic is given. (37,

mortality will be calculated using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluate (APACHE) IV score. (39, 40)  Patient information will be collected using 
the NU -EDW.  Categorical outcomes will be analyzed using logi stic regression, 
continuous outcomes will be analyzed using linear regression. Statistical analysis 
will be conducted with SPSS (IBM corporation) and STATA .  We have budgeted 
statistical support to 
conduct the analyses for 
this Aim.  
11.2 Power  
calculation.   
Based on our prior work, 
89.5% of intubated 
subjects with suspected 
pneumonia in the MICU 
will receive empi[INVESTIGATOR_105492] ; however the prevalence 
MRSA pneumonia is approximately 5.5%. In patients with no evidence of MRSA, 
only 32.1% had antibiotics discontinued appropriately (24, 25)  Therefore the 
potential reduction in antibiotics -days of vancomycin or linezolid with a rapid 
diagnostic test based on current pract ices is 65.7%. With a conservative estimate 
that all subjects will have received up to 3 doses of vancomycin or linezolid prior 
to randomization, and that up to 94% of vancomycin or linezolid therapy can be discontinued at 72 hours in the usual care arm, w e anticipate PCR will be able to Table 4. Power calculation for clinical trial

a significant  trend in increased  mortality in the PCR arm (P < 0. 10) is 
seen,  the study will be immediately suspended. If a greater than 5 % false 
negative rate with PCR compared to routine bacterial cultures for the detection of MRSA, the study will be immediately terminated.    
 
13.0 Withdra wal of Subjects*  
13.[ADDRESS_117169] or his/her surr ogate withdraws 
consent after randomization, the  subject will continue to be followed by

 Page 11 of 15  9/9/2016  withdrawn from the study will be followed by [CONTACT_5051], but 
outcomes will not be included in the final analysis.  
13.3 Subjects with a new indication for vancomycin or linezolid  
Subjects who develop a new or suspected extrapulmonary infection due to 
MRSA  following randomization will be allowed to start vancomycin or linezolid 
per the treating physician’s discretion. Outcomes of subjects who start 
vancomycin or linezolid for an extrapulmonary indication following randomization 
will be included in the final  analysis.  
 
14.0 Risks to Subjects*  
14.1 Risks to subjects  
The main intervention of this clinical trial is  the decision to start or stop 
specific antibiotic therapy for MRSA pneumonia (the antibiotics 
vancomycin or linezolid) based on the results of the PCR. All PCR results 
will be followed up with bacterial culture, the current gold standard test. 
The primary risk to subjects is an inaccurate PCR test.  The time delay 
between the PCR test and bacterial cultures is between [ADDRESS_117171], the risk to subjects is 
continuing antibiotic therapy for MRSA (either vancomycin or 
linezolid per the treating physician’s discretion) until the results of 
the bacterial culture. This is consistent with  usual care of ICU 
patients of  pneumonia, and therefore adds no added risk to 
subjects.  
14.1b In the case of the false negative PCR test, the risk to subjects 
is stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_105494]. The probability of this 
occurring is extremely low based on weighted average of the 
negative predictive val ue (NPV) of prior work listed in Table 1:  
approximately 0.3%. The duration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_105495] [ADDRESS_117172] MRSA pneumonia may benefit from earlier tailored antibiotic therapy and therefore reduced antibiotic exposure ; 
however , the impact of these benefits are not known. Otherwise, w e not 
antici pate any direct benefit to subjects for participation in the trial.

19.0 Setting  
19.1 Clinical trial  
Patients who was admitted to the medical ICU (MICU) at Northwestern 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NMH) will be scre ened for inclusion in this trial. The 
NMH MICU is a 33 -bed unit staffed by [CONTACT_105506], trainees, 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175] (RTs). In intubated patients with suspected 
pneumonia, BALs are obtained by [CONTACT_105511], qualified trainee, 
or RT. About 60 BALs are collected monthly.  
19.2 Research procedure  
PCR will be conducted in the molecular epi[INVESTIGATOR_105496], PhD. PCR will be conducted using the 
GeneXpert® Instrument Systems (Cephaid Inc, Sunnyvale, CA ). using 
the The Cepheid Xpert® Skin and Soft Tissue (SSTI) Assay. The PCR is a is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for rapid detection and 
differentiation of  Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) in body fluids using PCR amplification. 
SA is detected by [CONTACT_105508] A (spa) 
gene, MRSA is identified by [CONTACT_105509] (SCCmec). Prior studies report detection of MRSA is 
possible in [ADDRESS_117175] of MRSA PCR  
 Page 13 of 15  9/9/2016  by [CONTACT_105512]. The PCR assay will be conducted by a qualified 
laboratory technician once the sample is received.  The GeneXpert® 
Instrument  is designed to require minimal laboratory expertise and 
laboratory technician qualified to perform the assay will be routinely 
available.

44 subjects over 12  months, or 3 -4 subjects per month. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_105497] 75% of time to clinical research, and the MICU 
research team devotes 75- 100% of effort to clinical research.  
 
21.0 Prior Approvals  
Not applicable.  
 
22.0 Recruitment  Methods  
Patients will be recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Unit at NMH.  
Potentially eligible patients will be identified during a daily screen of 
admissions to the medical intensive care unit  and/or RT orders for NBBAL 
by [CONTACT_21575].    
No materials will be used to recruit subjects and no payments will be 
made to subjects.  
23.[ADDRESS_117177] of 1996 (HIPPA).  Those r egulations require a signed 
subject authorization (included in the informed consent document) 
informing the subject of the following 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that informat ion and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their 
authorization for user of their PHI  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the  ability to use all information 
collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization 
As noted above, patient data will be kept on a single, encrypted, Northwestern 
University issued password protected computer on servers maintained by 
[CONTACT_105513] 14 of 15  9/9/2016  their “Data Security Plans for Identifiable Information Used in Clinical Research.”  
Only the study investigators will have access to the data. In the event that the 
data has to be transported to another computer, it will be done using a password 
protected USB drive.  Patient data will be available for the duration of the study.

27.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
The subjects will not accrue costs related to participation in this research  
 
28.0 Consent Process  
28.1 We anticipate that the majority, if not all, subjects in this trial will 
not be able to provide informed consent because of their critical illness. 
Therefo r, after identification, a member of the study team will discuss 
participation in the study with the patient’s legally authorized representative (LAR).  The LAR will be identified in the subject’s eMR via 
the advanced directives tab in accordance to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105498]  
28.2 Informed consent will be administered and the patient’s LAR will 
be asked to sign and date the approved informed consent document.  
The subject is not obligated to take part in research, and this will be made 
clear to their LAR.  Furthermore, LARs are not obligated to sign an 
informed consent doc ument the same day in which they learn about the 
study.  If the patient’s surrogate decision maker does decide to take part 
in the study and reads, understands, and decides to sign the informed 
consent, all of his/her questions must be answered prior to the consent 
being signed.  Once the consenting form is signed and dated, it will be 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_105499] a copy.  If at any point during the 
course of the study, a subject who was previously dependent on a LAR 
for consent regains the ability  to provide informed consent, the study will 
be reviewed with the subject and consent obtained.  A signature [CONTACT_105516].   In situations where the LAR is 
not immediately available in person a copy of the informed consent will be 
faxed or emailed for their review.  A member of the study team will review the consent with signee over the telephone.  The LAR may fax back

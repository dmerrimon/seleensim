3 1. Study  Personnel,  Collaboration  Plan  and Study  Organizations  
This study  will be a multicenter  prospective  single -masked,  two-arm randomized  clinical  trial. Seven  centers,  
including  the University  of [LOCATION_004],  San Francisco  (UCSF),  Bascom -Palmer  Eye Institute  (BPEI),  University  
of Colorado,  University  of Maryland,  Zhongshan  Ophthalmic  Center  (ZOC)  in China  and Asociació n para Evitar  
la Ceguera  en México  (APEC),  will jointly  enroll  for this trial. To ensure  the success  of this study,  we have  
partnered  with UCSF’s  Francis  I. Proctor  Foundation  (F.I. Proctor  Foundation),  which  is a center  that 
specializes  in ophthalmology  research.   
 
All sites will be responsible  for enrollment,  implementation  and follow  up visits.  The Proctor  Foundation’s  role is 
to serve  as the coordinating  center,  supporting  data management  and data analysis.  UCSF  will take the lead 
on analysis,  writing  of study -related  materials,  and journal  publications.  UCSF  will have  the most  current  
protocol,  consent  documents  and HIPAA  authorization  for reference.  UCSF  has prepared  the IRB application  
for this study.  All modificatio ns to the IRB of record  will be communicated  among  sites.  UCSF  will ensure  
protection  of all study -related  data by [CONTACT_603935]-identified  information  over a secure  server.  All non-compliance  
with the study  protocol  or applicable  requirements  will be reported  in accordance  with local policy.  There  will be 
ongoing  communication  of problems,  interim  results,  and study  closure  among  all sites.  
 
Multicenter  clinical  trials  require  an organizational  structure  that provides  efficient  operations  and facilitates  
commun ication.  Investigators  at the 6 Clinic  Centers  are responsible  for screening  potential  study  patients,  
enrolling  eligible  patients,  and following  the patients  according  to the study  protocol.  An independent  Safety  
and Data  Monitoring  Committee  (SDMC)  will monitor  all aspects  of the study. The primary  responsibility  of the 
SDMC  is to review  the differences  in failure  rates  and the occurrence  of adverse  events  between  treatment  
groups  with a view of halting  randomization  early  if treatment  benefit  or risk is so great  for one treatment  group 
that continuation  of patient  recruitment  is deemed  unethical.  The SDMC  will perform  an interim  analysis  to 
assess  for safety  once  30% of study  participants  have  completed  the 6-month  follow -up visit. The SDMC  will 
be led by [CONTACT_603936],  MD at the Univers ity of Washington  and Donald  Budenz,  MD, MPH  at University  of 
North  Carolina  at Chapel  Hill (UNC) . The Statistical  Coordinating  Center  (SCC)  will receive,  edit, process,  
analyze,  and store  all de-Identified  study  data.  The SCC  will coordinate  activities  at the Clinic  Centers  and 
monitor  adherence  to the study  protocol.  The SCC  is comprised  of Jennifer  Rose -Nussbaumer,  MD and Travis  
Porco,  PhD,  MPH,  both of whom  are faculty  at F.I. Proctor  Foundation.  The Steering  Committee  (SC) is 
composed  of the principal  investigators  from each  Clinic  Center  and this committee  has overall  responsibility  
for directing  activities  and formulating  policies  for the study.  
2. Patient  selection:   
2.1 Inclusion  Criteria:  
 Age 18 to 85 years  old 
 Inadequately  controlled  glaucoma  on maximum  tolerated  medical  therapy  with IOP ≥ 18 mm Hg 
 Ahmed  Glaucoma  Valve  (AGV)  implantation  as the planned  surgical  procedure  
 For patients  in whom  [ADDRESS_799756] eligible  eye to be implanted  is 
enrolled.  
2.2 Exclusion  Criteria:  
 Unwilling  or unable  to give consent,  unwilling  to accept  randomization,  or unable  to return  for scheduled  
protocol  visits  
 Pregnant  or nursing  women  
 Previous  cyclodestruction  or glaucoma  drainage  device  (GDD)  surgery   
 Patients  with nanophthalmos  
 Patients  with Sturge -Weber  syndrome  or other  conditions  associated  with elevated  epi[INVESTIGATOR_603927]  
 
4  Need  for glaucoma  surgery  combined  with other  ocular  procedures  except  cataract  extraction  (i.e., 
penetrating  keratoplasty,  or retinal  surgery)  or anticipated  need  for additional  ocular  surgery  
 Previous  scleral  buckling  procedure  or silicone  oil present  
 Uveitic  glaucoma,  if patient  have  had active  inflammation  during  last six months  (we will include  uveitic  
glaucoma  patients  if they haven’t  had active  inflammation  for more  than 6 months)  
3. Randomization  Scheme:  
The study  patients  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_603937] 3 categories  based  on type of glaucoma:  (1) 
primary  glaucomas,  (2) secondary  glaucomas  (excluding  neovascular  glaucom a), and (3) neovascular  
glaucoma.  Within  each  stratum,  the patients  will be randomized  into two arms,  either  AGV  with Mitosol® (for 
national  centers)  or Mitomycin -C (MMC)  (for international  centers)  adjunctive  treatment  or AGV  with Balanced  
Salt Solution  (BSS)  sham  treatment.  A randomization  of 100 patients  will be predetermined  by [CONTACT_603938]  a computer  program  (Statistical  package  R; Version  
3.1; R Foundation  for Statistical  Computing,  Vienna,  Austria).  This randomly  permuted  block  scheme  has 
varied  block  sizes  between  2 and 6 with an equal  number  of patients  randomi zed to each  treatment  group  and 
within  each  stratum.  
 
During  the trial, after informed  consent  is obtained  and the SCC  confirms  patient  eligibility,  the local study  
coordinator  (LSC)  at each  Clinic  Center  will assign  the study  participant  an identification  number  (ID, alpha -
numeric  code)  that will serve  as the patient’s  ID on all study  documents.  The LSC at each  center  will login  to 
the REDCap  database  and input  the patient’s  study  ID. Randomization  to AGV  with Mitosol®/MMC  adjunctive  
treatment  or AGV  with sham  treatment  occurs  at the time when  the patient  is enrolled  in the study  using  the 
REDCap  database.  Once  the patient  has been  randomized  to a treatment  arm, they will remain  in the intention  
to treat analysis.  Clinical  information  will be collected  via baseline  patient  forms,  follow -up patient  forms,  final 
visit patient  forms  and adverse  event  forms.  The data will be entered  into REDCap  database  by [CONTACT_603939].  The 
SCC  will not have  identifiable  patient  information  and de-identified  information  will be shared  using a password  
that is only known  by [CONTACT_603940].   
4. Study  Visits  
4.1 Baseline  Visit  
During  this visit, eligible  patients  at each  center  will give informed  consent  and be enrolled  in the study.  A 
comprehensive  eye exam  including  visual  acuity  (VA), intraocular  pressure  (IOP),  gonioscopy,  slit lamp  exam,  
and dilated  fundus  exam  will be performed,  along  with pachymetry,  specular  microscopy  and perimetry,  to 
establish  a baseline.  If diplopia  exists,  a basic  motility  test will also be performed.  The baseline  patient  form will 
be completed.   
4.2 Surgery  Visit   
The enrolled  study  participant  will undergo  either  AGV  with Mitosol®/MMC  or BSS (sham)  adjunctive  treatment  
surgery.  
4.3 Follow -Up Visits  
During  the postoperative  Day 1, Week  1, Month  1, 2, 3 and 6 follow -up visits,  VA, IOP, slit lamp  exam,  dilated  
fundus  exam  will be performed.  The follow -up patient  form will be completed.  Mitosol®/MMC  or BSS injection  
will be scheduled  on postoperative  week 1 and month  1.  
4. 4. Final  Visit  
During  the 12-month  postoperative  final visit, a comprehensive  eye exam  including  VA, IOP, slit lamp  exam,  
dilated  fundus  exam,  specular  microscopy  and pachymetry  will be performed.  If diplopia  exists,  motility  will be 
tested.  The final status  and follow -up patient  forms  will be completed.   
 
5 5. Procedures  
5.1 Masking  
All study  participants  will be masked  to their intervention.  Surgeons  will not be masked.  Technicians  performing  
study  exams  and imaging  will be masked.  The LSC at each  Clinic  Center  will not be masked.   
5.2 Mitosol®/MMC  and BSS Sham  preparation  
Mitosol®/MMC  (0.4mg/ml)  will be prepared  by [CONTACT_603941].  Prior  to AGV  surgery  
and follow -up appointments  when  Mitosol®/MMC  or sham  treatment  is scheduled  to be given,  if the subject  is 
in the Mitosol®/MMC  arm, the LSC at each  center  will order  Mitosol®/MMC.  Mitosol®/MMC  will be handled  
based  on protocol  for chemotherapy  agents  at each  Clinic  Center.  If the subject  is in the BSS arm, BSS will be 
either  ordered  or available  in clinic  depending  on each  Clinic  Center’s  set up.  
5.[ADDRESS_799757]  technique  for AGV  implantation  is used,  while  allowing  the surgeon  latitude  to perform  the 
procedure  in a manner  with which  he or she feels  comfortable.  The type of anesthesia  is at the surgeon’s  
discretion.   An Ahmed  FP-7 is used  in all cases,  and implantation  is performed  in the superotemporal  quadrant.   
Depending  on the randomized  treatment,  Mitosol®/MMC  (0.4 mg/ml)  or BSS injection  will be injected  into the 
subconjunctival  space  at 8-9mm  from limbus.  After  [ADDRESS_799758].  A donor  patch  graft composed  of sclera,  cornea,  or pericardium  
is used  to cover  the limbal  portion  of the tube. The patch  graft material  and suture  selected  to fixate  the patch  
graft are the surgeon’s  choice.  The conjunctiva  and Tenon’s  capsule  are closed  in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_603928]’s  
usual  practice.  A subconjunctival  antibiotic  and corticosteroid  are injected  at the end of the case.  A cycloplegic -
mydriatic  drop and steroid -antibiotic  ointment  may be instilled  at the conclusion  of the case,  as determined  by 
[CONTACT_603942][INVESTIGATOR_603929].  
5.4 Postoperative  Mitosol®/MMC  or BSS Sham  Injectio n 
Subconjunctival  injection  of Mitosol®/MMC  (0.4mg/ml)  or BSS for 0.1ml  is scheduled  in the region  of the end 
plate  at 1 week  and 1 month . The injectable  medication  will be prepared  at each  Clinic  Center  based  on 
treatment  assignment.  The doctors  performin g injections  will be able to identify  whether  Mitosol®/MMC  or BSS 
is being  used.  In order  to perform  the injection,  the conjunctiva  will be anesthetized  first by [CONTACT_2931]  a topi[INVESTIGATOR_603930]  (such  as proparacaine).  Cotton  tips soaked  with 4% lidocaine  will be applied  to conjunctiva  over 
injection  area.  Then  0.1 ml of 1% lidocaine  will be injected  subconjunctivally,  which  usually  results  in formation  
of an elevated  “blister.”  Using  a 30-gauge  needle,  another  0.1 ml Mitosol®/MMC  (0.4%)  or BSS,  depending  on 
treatment  assignment,  will be injected  within  the previously  formed  “blister”  into a space  between  the 
conjunctiva  and Tenon’s  capsule.  The eye will then be copi[INVESTIGATOR_603931].   
 
On postoperative  week  1 visit, subconjunctival  Mitosol®/MMC  or BSS injection  will be given  depending  on the 
treatment  assignment.  The injection  will be held if any of the following  conditions  exist:  IOP <5, wound  
dehiscence,  choroidal  detachment,  shallow  or flat anterior  chamber,  or conjunctiva  over the plate  of Ahmed  
valve is completely  white  and avascular  (Figure  1). The patient  will then be seen  depending  on the clinical  
situation.  In that situation,  injection  will not be given  within  the postoperative  month  1.   
 
On the visit scheduled  for the 2nd injection  at 1month  postoperative  follow -up, injection  will be held if any of the 
following  conditions  exist:  IOP <5, wound  dehiscence,  choroidal  detachment,  shallow  or flat anterior  chamber,  
or conjunctiva  over the plate  of Ahmed  valve  is completely  white  and avascular  (Figure  1). The patient  will then 
 
[ADDRESS_799759]  
beyond  postoperative  month  3, no 2nd injection  will be administered.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  1:  
 
5.5 Postoperative  medication  management   
After  the surgery,  all subjects  will receive  an antibiotic  drop to be used  4 times  daily for 1 week,  and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_246150]  (prednisolone  acetate  1%) starting  4-6 times  daily and tapered  over 4 to 8 weeks  depending  on 
surgeon’s  preference  and degree  of inflammation.   
Because  early  aqueous  suppressant  treatment  may improve  AGV  implantation  outcomes  and reduce  
hypertensiv e phase  frequency  21, 25, when  IOP is above  10mmHg  in either  treatment  arm, medications  that 
primarily  suppress  aqueous  humor  production  will be used  according  to the surgeon’s  discretion.  Medications  
that can be used  for aqueous  suppression  include  timolo l 0.5%,  dorzolamide  2%, brinzolamide  1%, or 
brimonidine  0.1%  or 0.15%  or 2%. If IOP is still not controlled,  as determined  by [CONTACT_56951],  
additional  therapy,  including  oral systemic  medical  therapy,  laser  therapy  or additional  surgical  therapy,  may be 
performed.   
5.[ADDRESS_799760] of study  measurements  for scheduled  follow -up visits  is shown  in Table  1. Baseline  demographic  and 
clinical  information  will be collected  for enrolled  patients  at baseline  visit.  The follow -up appointment  schedule  
will be generated  based  on the date of surgery  for each  patient  by [CONTACT_61604].  The study  entry  date is recorded  
as the date of surgery.   
Follow -up visits  are scheduled  1 day, 1 week,  1 month,  2 months,  3 months,  6 months  and 12 months  
postoperatively.  Patients  can be brought  back  sooner  than the required  study  visits  if there  is a postoperative  
complication.  The follow -up study  form will be filled out for those  visits.  Adverse  event  forms  may be completed  
if appropriate.  All scheduled  visits  would  be expected  in normal  postoperative  care.  Each  examination  includes  
measurement  of Snellen  VA, IOP, slit-lamp  biomicroscopy,  and ophthalmoloscopy.   Humphrey  perimetry  will 
be performed  at the baseline  visit to establish  the sever ity of glaucoma.  Early  Treatment  Diabetic  Retiopathy  
The arrow  points  to the complete  white  and avascular  conjunctiva  over the plate  of Ahmed  valve.   
 
7 Study  (ETDRS)  VA, pachymetry,  and specular  microscopy  will be checked  at baseline  and at the 6-month  and 
12-month  follow -up visits.

is completely  white  and avascular.  The patient  will then be followed  for a clinically  appropriate  interval  for the complication,  and the 2nd 
injection  will be given  if the complication  is resolved at a follow -up visit before  postoperative  month  3. Should  the complication  persist  
beyond  postoperative  month  3, no 2nd injection  will be administered.   
 
6. Assessment  of Primary  and Secondary  Outcomes  
Technicians  who perform  the ocular  tests  should  be masked  to treatment  assignment.  The primary  outcome  of 
the study  is IOP at postoperative  6 months.  The secondary  outcome  is failure  rate, which  is defined  by [CONTACT_43160]:  (1) IOP >21 mmHg  or reduced  < 20% from baseline  at 12-month  follow-up, (2) IOP ≤ [ADDRESS_799762] corrected  VA decreased  ≥ 2 lines  from baseline,  (3) use of oral anti-
hypertensive  medication  (acetazolamide  or methazolamide),  (4) loss of light perception  vision,  (5) reoperation  
for glaucoma,  or (6) removal  of implant.  Successful  repair  of a retracted  or occluded  shunt  will not be 
considered  a failure,  although  all complications  will be listed  and analyzed.  Eyes  that have  not failed  and are 
not on supplemental  medical  therapy  are considered  complete  successes.  Eyes  that have  not failed  but require  
supplemental  medical  therapy  are defined  as qualified  successes.   
Two alternative  IOP cutoffs,  18 mmHg  and 15 mmHg,  will also be used  in secondary  analyses  as 
suggested  by [CONTACT_603943]’s  Guidelines  on Design  and Reporting  of Surgical  Trials.46 All 
other  criteria  for failure  are the same  as in the primary  analysis  as outlined  above.  
Other  outcome  measures  include  VA, frequency  of hypertensive  phase  (IOP increase  to more  than [ADDRESS_799763] 6 months  after surgery) , number  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_603932].   
 
[ADDRESS_799764]  refraction  is performed  before  measurement  of VA at the baseline  examination  and 12-
month  follow -up visit. VA will be measured  using  two techniques.  Snellen  VA is measured  at the baseline  
examination  and every  follow -up visit. The Early  Treatment  Diabetic  Retinopathy  Study  (ETDRS)  VA47 is tested  
at the baseline  examination,  6-month  and 12-month  follow -up. The participating  clinician  will need  to specify  a 
cause  for Snellen  VA less than 20/[ADDRESS_799765]  accurate  measurement,  pneumatonometer  or Tonopen  (Reichert  Technologies,  Depew,  NY) will 
be used.  The right eye is to be measured  first and the left eye measured  second.  Two consecutive  
measurements  will be taken  for the study  eye. If the first 2 measurements  differ by > [ADDRESS_799766] 2 measurements  is > [ADDRESS_799767]  of diurnal  IOP fluctuation.   
 
Pachymetry.  Corneal  thickness  using  ultrasound  (contact)  pachymetry  will be perfo rmed  on the central  cornea  
at baseline  examination,  6-month,  and 12-month  follow -up visit. Contact  [CONTACT_603944].  
 
Gonioscopy.  Gonioscopy  will be performed  at the slit lamp  at baseline  examination  using  either  a Zeiss -type 
indentation  gonioprism  or a Goldmann -type nonindentation  gonioprism.  The purpose  of the preoperative  
examination  of the anterior  chamber  angle  is to document  neovascularization,  peripheral  anterior  synechiae,  
and to identify  an appropriate  implantation  site for the tube.  
 
Motility  Assessment.  Transient  diplopia  is not uncommon  after tube shunt  surgery.  The effect  of local 
Mitosol®/MMC  injection  on nearby  [CONTACT_603945].  To address  this issue,  a motility  assessment  is 
perfo rmed  in all patients  at baseline,  6-month  and 12-month  visits  if diplopia  is reported  by [CONTACT_1962].   
During  each  motility  examination,  the cover–uncover  and alternate  cover  tests  will be performed  at primary  
gaze,  upgaze,  downgaze,  left gaze,  and right gaze  for both distance  and near targets.  Any heterophoria  or 
heterotropia  will be documented.  The deviat ion will be measured  with a hand -held prism.  In patients  who are 
unable  to fixate  for cover  testing,  the deviation  will be measured  by [CONTACT_603946] a 
prism  using  the modified  Krimsky  method.  
 
Slit-Lamp  Biomicroscopy.  Examinatio n of the anterior  segment  using  slit-lamp  biomicroscopy  is performed  at 
the baseline  assessment  to document  preoperative  status  and at all follow -up examinations  to detect  any 
changes  during  the course  of the study  that may be attributable  to the disease  or treatment.  Mitosol®/MMC  
may slow wound  healing;  therefore,  the presence  or absence  of plate  or/and  tube exposure  or wound  
dehiscence  will be examined  and documented  at each  visit. In addition,  placement  of tube shunt  may lead to 
long-term damage  to the cornea;  therefore,  tube position  and length  within  the anterior  chamber  in relation  to 
the cornea  and iris on slit-lamp  examination  will be documented  at each  study  visit.  
 
Ophthalmoscopy  Examination.  A dilated  fundus  examination  will be performed  at all visits. At the baseline  
examination,  particular  attention  is paid to detect  signs  of proliferative  retinopathy,  retinal  neovascularization,  
vitreous  hemorrhage,  or preretinal  hemorrhage.  At all postoperative  follow -up visits,  ophthalmoscopy  is 
performed  to evaluate  posterior  segment  complications  of surgery,  such  as serous  choroidal  effusions,  
suprachoroidal  hemorrhage,  or hypotony  maculopathy.   
 
Specular  Microscopy:  Endothelial  cell density  will be assessed  using  specular  microscopy  performed  on the 
central  cornea  at baseline  examination,  6-month  and 12-month  follow -up visit. Three  images  are to be acquired  
and transmited  to the SCC,  and the best quality  image  will be selected  for quantitative  analysis  of central  
 
9 endothelial  cell density,  determined  by [CONTACT_484315] l cell count  at a reading  center.   
 
Perimetry.  Visual  field examinations  will be assessed  using  automated  perimetry  (using  either  Humphrey  24-2 
full threshold  program  or Swedish  Interactive  Thresholding  Algorithm  [SITA]  Standard , size III, white  stimulus,  
Carl Zeiss  Meditec,  Dublin,  CA). Visual  field testing  will be performed  before  tonometry,  gonioscopy,  or other  
technique  that could  affect  vision.  A visual  field is attempted  in any eye that has vision  equal  or better  than 
finger  counting  at a distance  of 2 feet. Perimetry  will be performed  before  surgery  (within  1 month  of enrollment  
in the study)  to establish  the severity  of glaucoma  and one year after surgery . 
7. Management  of Breach  of Protocol  
7.[ADDRESS_799768]  used  any 
concomitant  medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_603933]. Patients  should  
be scheduled  for study  visits  as closely  to the day specified  in the visit schedule  as possible.  
The invest igator  at each  Clinic  Center  must  adhere  to the study  protocol  and randomization.  Any 
violation  of the protocol  will be reported  to the HSC  to decide  whether  the corresponding  study  participant  
should  stay in the trial. The SCC  will be informed  of the decision to allow  for appropriate  data management.    
7.4 Early  Discontinuation  of Patients  
Patients  may voluntarily  withdraw  from the study  at any time.  Notification  of early  patient  discontinuation  from 
the study  and the reason  for discontinuation  will be sent to the SCC  and will be clearly  documented  on the 
appropriate  case  report  form.  
7.5 Withdrawal  Criteria  
The investigator  should  consider  withdrawing  a patient  from the study  early  if any of the following  criteria  are 
met: 
1. Patien t develops  (or has an exacerbation  of) a medical  condition  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  
would  put the patient  at an unacceptable  medical  risk by [CONTACT_603947]   
2. Patient  develops  (or has an exacerbation  of) a medical  condition  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  
compromises  the patient’s  ability  to participate  in the study   
3. Patient  is unwilling  or unable  to continue  to comply  with study  procedures   
4. Patient  is unwilling  or unable  to continue  in the study   
Whenever  possible,  the decision  to withdraw  a patient  from the study  or study  treatment  should  be discussed  
with SCC.   
7.6 Study  Termination  
The study  may be stopped  at his/her  study  site at any time by [CONTACT_6962].   
 
10 8. Diagnoses  and Management  of Adverse  Events  (AEs)      
8.1 Definitions  of Adverse  Event  
An adverse  event  (AE) is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  who has received  AGV  in this trial and 
that does  not necessarily  have  a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  However,  progression  of treatme nt 
indication  including  new or worsening  of anticipated  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  which  are collected  as clinical  
efficacy  variables  and assessed  as unequivocally  associated  with the disease  progression  and/or  lack of 
efficacy,  should  NOT  be reported  as AEs unless  the disease  progression  is greater  than anticipated  in the 
natural  course  of the disease.  
During  each  study  visit, the subject  will be questioned  about  AEs in a non-leading  manner.  All AEs,  
whether  observed  by [CONTACT_737],  elicited  by [CONTACT_737],  or spontaneously  reported  by [CONTACT_423],  will 
be documented  in the subject's  chart  and the AE form.  
8.2. Manage  Adverse  Event  
All AEs should  be followed  until they are resolved  or until a stable  clinical  endpoint  is reached.  Each  AE is to 
be classified  by [CONTACT_603948]  (SAE)  or NONSERIOUS  (NSAE).  A SAE is any adverse  event  
that results  in any of the following  outcomes:  death,  a life-threatening  AE, inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603934],  or a persis tent or significant  disability/incapacity.   
If a SAE occurs,  the investigator  at each  study  site must  verbally  and/or  in writing  notify  their medical  center  or its 
designee  within  [ADDRESS_799769]  (IRB)/Ethics  Committee  (EC) in accordance  with its requirements.  All AEs must  be 
reported  from the time that the subject  provides  informed  consent  through  the last study  visit.

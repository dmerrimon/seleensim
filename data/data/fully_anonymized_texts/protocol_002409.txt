Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 4 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information    
Investigational 
Drug  Active substance: VX -548 
Activity: Na V1.8 inhibitor  
Strength and route of administration: 10-mg tablets and matching placebo for oral 
administration  
  
Reference 
Drug  Active substance: hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP)  
Activity: opi[INVESTIGATOR_351564]: 5-mg/[ADDRESS_436973] will participate in the study for 3 days plus a 
Safety Follow -up Visit 14  ± [ADDRESS_436974] dose of study drug.  
  
Stud y Design  This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 doses in treating acute pain after an 
abdominoplasty ( Figure 2-1).  
On Day  1, subjects will undergo a standard (“full”) abdominoplasty procedure (as defined in 
Section 8.1). After surge ry completion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups 
if (1) the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is 
moderate or severe on the VRS at rest, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_436975] will not be eligible for this study.  
Approximately 256  subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4 treatment groups: high -dose 
VX-548 (100 mg/50 mg every 12 hours [q12h]); low -dose VX -548 (60 mg/30 mg q12h); 
HB/APAP (opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]); or placebo ( Table  2-1). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_351580] (<8 versus ≥8). To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the 
same number of tablets and/or capsules every 6  hours (q6h) in a double -dummy design.

CRU: clinical research unit; HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; NPRS: Numeric Pain 
Rating Scale; VRS:  Verbal Categorical Rating Scale  
Notes: After surgery completion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups if (1)  the 
subject r equests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate or 
severe on the VRS at rest, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_436976] will not be 
eligible for this study.

HB/APAP  5 mg/325 mg q6h  64 
Placebo   64 
HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen ; q6h: every 6 hours; q12h: every 12 hours  
Note: To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and/or capsules q6h 
in a double -dummy design. VX -548 active and/or VX -548 placebo will be administered to all 
subjects q12h: 0 hours (first dose) and at 12, [ADDRESS_436979] dose of study drug. 
HB/APAP active or HB/APAP placebo will be administered to all subjects q6h: 0 hours (first 
dose) and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, [ADDRESS_436980] immediately before each administratio n of 
rescue medication.  
Ibuprofen ( 400 mg orally q6h as needed ) is permitted as a rescue medication for pain relief 
upon the subject’s request starting any time after the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_436981] score is ≥4.  
  
Assessments  Efficacy : NPRS at rest and during movement, double -stopwatch assessment, and use of rescue 
medications  
Safety : adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, 
standard 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examinations  
PK: plasma PK parameters of VX -548 and its metabolite,  
Other : VRS at rest, PGA of study drug, and DNA blood sample (optional)  
   
Statistical 
Analyses  The sample size calculation is based on the comparison between VX -[ADDRESS_436982] size of 0.8 for VX -548 (high or low dose) 
compared to placebo, [ADDRESS_436983] 90% power at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05. This sample size would allow a minimal detectable 
standardized effect size of 0. 38 to achieve statistical significance between VX -548 (high or 
low dose) and placebo. With this sample size, a two -sided 95% CI for the estimated standard 
effect size will extend 0.[ADDRESS_436984] size, assuming the CI is 
based on the large sample z statistic. To allow for withdrawal of up to 15% of randomized 
subjects over 48 hours of treatment, the study will enroll and randomize approximately 256 
subjects in total.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on an analysis of cov ariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include SPI[INVESTIGATOR_124] 0-[ADDRESS_436985], 
with stratification factors (i.e., site and baseline NPRS at rest) as covariates. If the model 
estimation does not converge, site will be re moved from the model. The least squares means of 
difference versus placebo and the corresponding 95% CIs and P values will be presented.

treatment options for pain are limited by [CONTACT_351582] (AEs), 
leaving many patients without adequate pain control. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) pose a potentially serious risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with acute and chronic use, 
hematologic toxicity with acute use, and nephrotoxicity with chronic use.[ADDRESS_437020] 2 decades.2 More than 50,000 deaths attributable to opi[INVESTIGATOR_351567] 2019 to 
2020, and more than 80% of fatal drug overdoses in Europe involv ed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].3, [ADDRESS_437021] on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_351568]5; only [ADDRESS_437022] been approved by [CONTACT_351583] 2008.6-10 The majority of research 
activity focuses on developi[INVESTIGATOR_351569] -deterrent reformulations of existing narcotic pain drugs; 
however, these drugs do not substantially improve efficacy or safety.  
Voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) plays a critical role in pain signaling.11, 12 Support 
for this assertion arises from (1)  evaluation of the role N aV1.8 plays in normal physiology13-17, 
(2) pathological states arising from mutations in the Na V1.8 gene ( SCN10A )18, 19, (3) animal 
models20-23, and (4)  pharmacology of known Na V1.8-modulating agents.24-26 In addition, because 
NaV1.8 expression is restricted to peripheral neurons, particularly those that sense pain (e.g.,  the 
dorsal root ganglia [DRG])13, 15, Na V1.8 inhibitors are less likely to be associated with the side 
effects commonly observed with other so dium channel modulators and the abuse liability 
associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_218947]. Therefore, targeting the underlying biology of pain through 
selective Na V1.8 inhibition represents a novel approach to analgesic drug development that has 
the potential to ad dress an urgent unmet need for safe and effective acute and chronic pain 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_351570] . 
VX-548 is being developed for the treatment of pain. VX -548 is a Na V1.8 inhibitor that is highly 
selective for Na V1.8 relative to other Na V channels. Refer to the VX -548 Investigator’s Brochure 
for additional details.27 
5.2 Study Rationale  
Clinical data from 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating single and multiple ascending doses of VX -548 
demonstrated that VX -548 is generally safe and well tolerated in hea lthy subjects (Studies 001 
and 002).27 
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 VX -548 doses in treating acute pain after an 
abdominoplasty .

9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 doses in treating acute pain after an 
abdominoplasty ( Figure 9-1).  
On Day  1, subjects will undergo a standard (“full”) abdominoplasty procedure (as defined in 
Section 8.1). After surgery completion, a subject will be randomized to 1  of 4 treatment groups if 
(1) the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is 
moderate or severe on the VRS at rest, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_437034] will not be eligible for this study.  
Approximately 256  subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4 treatment groups: high -dose 
VX-548 (100 mg/50 mg every 12 hours [q12h]); low -dose VX -548 (60 mg/3 0 mg q12h); 
hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP;opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]); or placebo ( -1). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_351585] (<8 ver sus ≥8). To maintain 
the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and/or capsules every 6  hours 
(q6h) in a double -dummy design.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.1.1  Screening  
Screening assessments are listed in Table  3-1. Screening includes Screening Visit assessments 
required before the day of surgery and pre -procedure assessments required on the day of surgery.  
The Screening Visit will occur within 28  days before the scheduled abdominoplasty procedure. 
The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain  informed 
consent from each subject.  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screeni ng Assessments  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolysis of sample, equipment error).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening  
Subjects who do not meet the eligi bility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_351574]) in the [ADDRESS_437041] dose of study drug that was proper ly 
evaluated and which resolved fully  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screening window  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are una ble to 
commit to all study procedures  
• Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any 
exclusion criterion, with the exception of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version 
of the protocol  
Any subject who is r escreened for any of the exceptions listed above may have the screening 
window extended by [ADDRESS_437042] dose of study drug, all screeni ng 
assessments need to be repeated.  
9.1.2  Abdominoplasty Procedure to Randomization  
Assessments to be completed after the abdominoplasty  procedure through randomization are 
listed in Table  3-2. 
Subjects will receive 4  mg of intravenous (IV) ondansetron once at the beginning of surgery. 
After surgery, subjects may receive 4  mg of IV ondansetron every 8 hours prn for nausea and/or 
vomiting. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details on perioperative pain management.  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. If a subject does not meet the 
VRS and NPRS criteria ( Section 8.1) within [ADDRESS_437043] has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
scheduled inpatient portion of the study, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be 
notifie d, and the subject will be asked to remain in the clinical research unit (CRU) until such 
abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the CRU, the medical 
monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigator  will make every effort to 
arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the 
abnormalities.

Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be required to complete the 
Safety  Follow -up Visit 14  (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug.  
9.2 Method of As signing Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 256  subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4 treatment groups: VX -548 (high 
dose); VX -548 (low dose); HB/APAP (opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]); or placebo . The randomization ratio of 
1:1:1:[ADDRESS_437046] ( <8 versus ≥8 ). 
An interactive web or voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. 
The randomization code will be produced by [CONTACT_14448] a qualified randomization 
vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve t he production of the final 
randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded 
biostatistician who is not a member of the Study Execution Team (SET).  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
Abdominoplasty is a well -established, multi -dose, surgical, acute pain model. A randomized, 
double -blind study design was selected to avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes 
Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 25 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  arising from the subjects’ knowledge of treatment. A parallel design is considered most 
appropr iate given the acute nature of abdominoplasty surgery.  
Two VX -[ADDRESS_437047] -of-care treatment (HB/APAP 5 mg/325 mg q6h) was 
included to establis h the ability of the study, as executed, to successfully observe a treatment 
effect.  
Following a standard study design, subjects will be randomized after surgery and after the 
subject’s pain meets the pain threshold criteria. The pain threshold criteria ar e designed to ensure 
subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the drug is effective. Ibuprofen was selected as the 
rescue medication because it is a commonly used, short -acting, standard -of-care treatment for 
acute pain.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
VX-548 doses ( -1) were selected based on favorable safety and PK data from healthy volunteers 
in Study  001 (single ascending dose study) and Study 002 (multiple ascendin g dose study). 
Multiple oral doses up to 65 mg administered in solution/suspension every 24 hours (q24h) for 
[ADDRESS_437048] been evaluated and found to be safe and well tolerated.27 The selected VX -548 
doses are predicted to achieve concentrations that are able to produce 87% (60  mg/30  mg q12h) 
to 91% (100 mg/50 mg q12h) Na V1.8 inhibition in the in vitro human DRG assay.  
Based on population PK modeling, the mean exposures (AUC 0-24 and C max) for VX -548 and its 
major metabolite, , at the high dose in this study (100 mg/50 mg q12h 
administered as tablets) are predicted to  be within the range of exposures observed at the highest 
tested dose found to be safe and well tolerated in humans in Study [ADDRESS_437049] level (NOAEL) observed 
in monkey in th e 28-day GLP toxicity study:27  
• VX-548: 2.8 -fold and 3.8 -fold below the NOAEL for A UC 0-24 and C max, respectively  
• : 4.0-fold and 6.3 -fold below the NOAEL for AUC 0-24 and C max, respectively  
The population PK model was based on observed PK data for the suspension/solution 
formulation of VX -548 and adjusted based on the relative b ioavailability between the tablet and 
solution formulations of VX -548. 
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
VRS:  A 4-point VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included as part of the pain threshold 
inclusion criterion to ensure that all subjects have moder ate or severe pain at baseline, which 
ensures subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the study drug is effective.  
NPRS: NPRS is frequently used in abdominoplasty studies and is recognized by [CONTACT_4760] a 
valid pain intensity measure.28 Pain rated ≥4 on an 11 -point (0 to 10) NPRS at baseline ensures 
subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the study drug is effective.  
Pain at rest is the standard outcome measure in postoperative analgesic trials. However, the re is 
evidence that pain during movement, commonly referred to as “movement -evoked pain”, may be 
more sensitive to treatment effects than pain at rest.29, [ADDRESS_437050] 3 postoperative days,31 providing an opportunity to demonstrate 
differential efficacy among active treatments.29, 32 

Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 26 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Double -stopwatch assessment: The double -stopwatch assessment is a standardized assessment 
for determining the onset of pain relief.30, [ADDRESS_437051] 
watch when/if they first feel any pain relief (“first perceptible pain relief”) and stop the second 
watch when/if they  first feel pain relief they consider meaningful (“meaningful pain relief”). If a 
subject achieves “meaningful pain relief”, the time the first watch was stopped is considered the 
time to “confirmed perceptible pain relief”.  
Use of rescue medications: The use of rescue medications is an important covariate in pain 
studies that can impact the analysis of other efficacy assessments.  
PGA of study drug : The PGA of study drug is a single -item assessment of patient perceptions 
of the method of pain control with t he study drug and is evaluated on a 4 -point Likert scale 
(poor, fair, good, or excellent). The PGA of study drug provides subjects the ability to state their 
perceptions of the treatment that may not be captured by [CONTACT_351586].

Clinical laboratory assessmen ts during screening must have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by [CONTACT_093], for a subject to receive study 
drug on Day  1.  
Additional Tests at Screening : The following additional tests will be p erformed during screening 
to assess eligibility:  
• Serology : hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab), and 
antibodies against human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV -1/HIV -2 Abs)  
• Serum Follicle -stimulating Hormone (FSH) : Serum FSH will be tested at the Screening Visit 
for female subjects who are suspected to be postmenopausal. For a subject to be considered 
of non -childbearing potential, the serum FSH levels will be within the laboratory’s range for 
postmenopausal females.  
• Pregnancy Testing:  All female subjects will have a serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin 
(β-hCG)  test during the Screening Visit. Female subjects of childbearing potential (as defined 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), will also have a urine β-hCG  test on Day [ADDRESS_437086] be negative to receive study drug.  
• Drug and Alcohol Screening:  Drug screening for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], methadone, cannabino ids, cocaine, 
amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_306003] a 
urine test . Alcohol screening will be assessed by a urine, blood, or breath test. Subjects may 
undergo random urine drug screen and alcohol testing if deem ed appropriate by [CONTACT_1275]. Drug and alcohol screen results must be negative for a subject to receive study

otherwise exclusionary (e.g.,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) will n ot disqualify subjects; however, 
marijuana (or any cannabis derivative) will not be allowed.  
Additional evaluations:  Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used, 
with the following exceptions:  
• Day 1 (pre -procedure) drug and alcohol (breath) tests and urine β -hCG pregnancy tests will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_351581].  
• Local laboratories may be used  to repeat a screening assessment to determine eligibility on 
Day 1 (pre -procedure) if there is clear evidence of laboratory error (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) in the 
central laboratory assessment.  
• Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be veri fied by [CONTACT_351591]. If it is not possible to send a timely 
specimen to the central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the 
investigator may b ase the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.5.[ADDRESS_437087] 
study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments 
can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph  nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs.  
A focused PE of the operative site will be performed in order to assess wound healing.  Vital 
signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and 
oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The subject will be instructed to rest for at least  [ADDRESS_437088] 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs  will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be done before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood 
draws.  
• The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_351576]21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 38 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through the Safety Follow -up Visit will be rec orded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be r epeated at least hourly until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_437089] with a 
QTcF value above the threshold value will discontinue dosing.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
Evaluation of th e efficacy of VX -548 doses is the primary objective of this study. All efficacy 
endpoints will be analyzed based on the FAS. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and 
secondary endpoints will only be between VX -548 and placebo. All analyses on comp arisons 
between HB/APAP versus placebo will be exploratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time -weighted SPI[INVESTIGATOR_124] 0-[ADDRESS_437107] dose of study drug. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on an analysis of covarian ce (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include SPI[INVESTIGATOR_124] 0-[ADDRESS_437108], with 
stratification factors (i.e., site and baseline NPRS at rest) as covariates. If the model estimation 
does not converge, site will be removed  from the model. The least squares means of difference 
versus placebo and the corresponding 95% CIs and P values will be presented.  
Details will be provided in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Time -weighted SPI[INVESTIGATOR_124] 0-[ADDRESS_437109] dose o f study drug: analysis of this variable will be 
similar to the primary analysis.  
• Proportions of subjects with ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥70% reduction in NPRS at rest at [ADDRESS_437110] dose of study drug: These variables will be analyzed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_351592].  
All analyses of primary and secondary variables on comparisons between HB/APAP versus 
placebo will be exploratory, although similar to those between VX -548 versus placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity Adjustment  
There is no multiplicity adjustment for the pairwise comparisons between different doses of 
VX-548 and placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Missing Data Handling  
For the primary analysis, NPRS at rest  that were collected within [ADDRESS_437111] 0-48 values. Sensitivity analyses for handling 
missing data will be described in the SAP.  
12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of VX -548 will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i. e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis)  
• Standard 12 -lead ECG outcomes  
• Vital signs  
Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.[ADDRESS_437112] concentrations.  
Details of the analyses will be in th e CPAP.  
12.6.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
A population PK analysis of plasma concentration versus time data of VX -548 and 
 may  be performed using the nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach. A 
population approach may also be used to investigate the exposure -response relationship for the 
efficacy and safety variables. A more detailed description of the methodology to be followed  will 
be presented in the abbreviated modeling and simulation analysis plan (AMSAP). The results of 
the population PK and exposure -response analysis (if done) will be reported in a separate 
document.  
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONS IDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, a nemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 

Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 44 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the fo llowing:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value t hat is Grade [ADDRESS_437113]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the  following times:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g.,  screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent)  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a  Safety Follow -up Visit, [ADDRESS_437114] dose of 
study drug.  
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the case report 
form (CRF) and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently 
enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The follow ing data will be 
documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant  medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 45 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Advers e Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
September  2019). The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE 
will be determined according to the definitions in Table  13-1.  
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Description  
Grade  1 (Mild)  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade  2 (Moderate)  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADLa 
Grade  3 (Severe)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADLb 
Grade  4 (Life -threatening)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated   
Grade  5 (Death)  Death related to adverse event  
Source: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed September  2019)  
ADL: activities of daily living; AE: adverse event  
Note: A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_437115] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly rel ated There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as charac teristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.[ADDRESS_437116] to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administrat ion does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to  Section 9.7 for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be  followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the  AE. 
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values relat ed to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No ” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 47 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, base d upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a s ubject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351577] n ot be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n for purposes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specif ic 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action des cribed above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse  Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow -up Visit , 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_351593] 24  hours of 
identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safet y Follow -up Visit  and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of 
identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through  the Safety Follow -up Visit, the 
SAE Form will be completed for new /initial events as well as to report follow -up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it 
becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE F orms to Vertex GPS via:  
 
  
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact [CONTACT_756]:  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit  and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagn osis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_168801](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 

Protocol VX21 -548-102, Version  4.0 Page 48 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  only as related (includes poss ibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purpos es of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporti ng suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IEC, and participating

Intended Use: The PEEK anchors are intended to be used for soft tissue to bone fixation in the 
hip following hip capsule repair. 
Study Purpose: Assess safety and performance post-market of the PEEK suture anchor devices 
to address clinical data gaps for MDR. 
Primary Outcome: Evidence of safety and performance of the PEEK suture anchor devices in the 
hip. 
Statistical Rationale: The sample size for this study is determined based on the feasibility of 
recruitment, enrolment and follow-up considerations. The study is therefore not 
powered for any statistical hypothesis testing but will be able to estimate a 
clinical success rate of 91% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 80% to 100%. 
 
Sample Size: Minimum number of subjects, n=40  
Maximum number of subjects, n=240 
Enrollment distribution: 
Up to three sites will enroll a maximum of 40 subjects per anchor configuration 
therefore no more than 120 subjects will be enrolled for any anchor type.

 INTRODUCTION  
Suture anchors are small fixation devices used in surgical procedures for attaching or reattaching 
tendons and ligaments 
bone density and the procedure performed. 
Suture anchors are made of three components: the anchor which is inserted into the bone; the 
eyelet  which is a hole or a loop in the anchor that the suture passes through to link the anchor 
to the suture; and the suture  which is attached to the anchor through the eyelet of the anchor.  
An anchor- receiving hole is first drilled in the bone at the desired point of tissue reattachment.  
A suture anchor is deployed in the hole using an appropriate installation tool.  This effectively 
locks the suture to the bone, with the free end(s) of the suture extending out the bone.  Soft 
tissue is then moved into position over the hole containing the deployed suture anchor.  As this 
is done, the free end(s) of the suture is (are) passed through or around the soft tissue so that the 
free end(s) of the suture reside(s) on the far (i.e., non-bone) side of the soft tissue.  The suture is 
now used to tie the soft tissue securely to the bone. 
Smith & Nephew offers a variety of suture anchors including several polyetheretherketone (PEEK) 
suture anchors soft tissue to bone repair.  The PEEK devices included in study are all single use, 
sterile devices comprised of machined component anchor bodies that are manufactured from 
PEEK-OPTIMA Polymer (LT1).  This material meets ISO [ZIP_CODE] biocompatibility requirements for 
implant devices, bone/tissue contact [CONTACT_316893].  The anchor tips are molded 
components which are also manufactured from PEEK-OPTIMA Polymer (LT3).  PEEK-OPTIMA 
polymers provide an ideal combination of strength, biocompatibility, reviseability and inherent 
radiolucent characteristics.  Smith & Nephew also provides a variety of reusable and disposable

10.1    KNOTLESS SUTURE ANCHOR 
 
 
-in anchor that is manufactured 
from PEEK-OPTIMA® from Invibio®. The anchor is pre-assembled on an inserter comprised of a 
stainless steel shaft and an ABS and polycarbonate handle. The anchor is sized appropriately to 
facilitate both hip and shoulder procedures. The design consists of an outer anchor body and an 
inner shaft plug. The ribbed anchor, loaded with suture tails, is tapped into a pre-drilled prepared 
hole. The surgeon is now able to reapproximate the tissue to the appropriate tension and then use 
the torque-limiting knob on the insertion device that moves the inner plug down to lock the plug 
and achieve a secure fixation.

 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION 
This study is precision-based, as a result, the sample size is not based on statistical power 
calculations.   
The sample size for this study is determined based on the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment 
and follow-up considerations. The study is therefore not powered for any statistical hypothesis 
testing but will be able to estimate a clinical success rate of 91% with a 95% confidence interval 
(CI) of 80% to 100%.

 With an assumption of a 91% clinical success rate to be obtained in each of the PEEK anchor 
sutures and a corresponding 95% CI between 80% and 100%, enrolling between 20 and 120 
subjects for each PEEK anchor suture  precision analysis will provide between 15.2% to 95% 
probability.  Thus, an overall minimum of 40 and maximum of 240 subjects who had previously 
undergone surgery of the hip using PEEK anchor sutures will be enrolled into the study. 
Additionally, a minimum of 20 subjects will be enrolled at any investigational site.

16.1.1 Adverse Event 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of 
an IP/Ancillary Product, whether or not considered causally related to that IP/Ancillary Product.  
AE is used both to refer to AE which are non-serious non-IP or procedure-related and as an 
umbrella term referring to adverse events of all classifications.  
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease. For reporting purposes, emphasis is placed first and foremost on 
whether or not the event constitutes an untoward medical occurrence.  
16.1.[ADDRESS_389905] (ADE) is an adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is 
related to the IP or the procedure.

The end of study is defined as the date of the last subject, last visit (LSLV).    No additional care 
for subjects will be provided under the protocol, as this is a retrospective study.  
 
Should circumstances arise which require the termination of the entire study prior to its planned 
completion (e.g. safety concerns) or circumstances arise which mean the end of the participation 
of an individual site (e.g. departure of Investigator, non-compliance), and then this will be 
undertaken according to the SOPs of the Sponsor.  
 REVISION OF THE STUDY DEVICE 
If a subject has bilateral implants and has a revision, both implants will continue to be followed 
per the protocol visit schedule.

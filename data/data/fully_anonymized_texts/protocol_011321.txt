This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background 
Primary scarring alopecias (PSAs) are poorly understood dermatologic disorders that 
result in permanent hair loss (1). PSAs are classified based on the type of inflammatory 
infiltrate recognized histologically on biopsy: lymphocytic, neutrophilic, or mixed .  As 
p
ainful hair loss disorders, scarring alopecias have yet to be studied in a manner that 
explores the disease burden on the individual and how to more effectively manage 
debilitating symptoms.  Most of the scarring alopecias involve a painful course, with 
individuals reporting scalp pain, burning, itching, or tingling/crawling sensations that can 
ultimately impact physical and psychological health (1). It is well-documented that 
individuals with chronic pain are more susceptible to depression and other mood 
disorders (2). Thus, a better understandin g of the pain process in scarring alopecia 
would benefit patients and health care providers tremendously as scientists research to 
discover the origin and pathogenesis of these inflammatory and irreversible conditions. 
 
CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) has been proposed to play a role in pain 
transmission and inflammation (3, 4).  While originally found to be elevated in migraines, 
two patients with lichen planopi[INVESTIGATOR_22785] (LPP) at the University of Minnesota were found to 
h
ave elevated amounts of CGRP via immunohistochemical staining and confocal 
microscopic examination of scalp biopsy specimens . Seven patients, three with frontal 
fi
brosing alopecia and four with LPP, were also found to have decreased expression of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_692250].  This suggests that neurogenic 
inflammation may contribute to the disease state of scarring alopecia. Investigating this 
relationship between CGRP and scalp symptoms such as pain in the setting of scarring 
alopecia may lead to a long awaited breakthrough in disease pathogenesis and 
management. Agents that reduce the release of neuropeptides, such as gabapentin, 
may serve as potential treatment in scarring alopecia. Recent data from pi[INVESTIGATOR_692251] a reduction in CGRP compared to levels of CGRP in control 
unstimulated tissue, indicating that CGRP may realistically be an appropriate 
therapeutic target in scarring alopecia. 
 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
Gabapentin is a GABA analogue originally introduced in 1994 for the treatment of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_692252]-Lambert (today [COMPANY_007]). It is currently widely used to relieve pain, 
especially neuropathic pain syndromes associated with diabetic neuropathy, v ulvodynia, 
postherpetic neuralgia and other allodynia (5, 6) . While gabapentin ’s mechanism of 
action is not completely understood, it is thought to work through its effects on voltage-
gated calcium ion channels in the central nervous system once it crosses the blood-
b
rain barrier (7). Its neuromodulatory effects also impact the peripheral nervous system.  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_938987] focused on 
targeting the inflammation associated with the disease process that is reflected 
histologically. No one treatment has been found successful in all conditions nor is there 
a cure. Individuals with end-stage, non-symptomatic disease may be candidates for hair 
transplantation.   
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date 
There has been no study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_692253], such as gabapentin, to treat 
scarring alopecia. However topi[INVESTIGATOR_692254], burning, irritation, itch, or tingling, such as vulvodynia (5).  
 
Interestingly, gabapentin has been shown to be effective against migraine headaches, a 
condition associated with high levels of CGRP (6).  Gabapentin has also been shown to 
be effective in managing neuropathic pain.  This evidence suggests that gabapentin 
could be effective in the treatment of scarring alopecia, especially if increased CGRP is 
contributing to symptomatology. 
 
This study will serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_692255].   In this study, 10 subjects 
with symptomatic lymphocytic-type scarring alopecia will be recruited and treated with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_692256].  Disease burden will be evaluated before and after 12 weeks of 
treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology via surveys/questionnaire , 
neurometer study, clinical assessment, and biopsies measuring levels of CGRP before 
and after treatment.  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
The maximum daily dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_692246] [ADDRESS_938988] skin two 
times daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will be seen in follow up on Week 8 and Week 12 
(Visits 4 and 5). 
 
Gabapentin will be compounded into a 6% solution based on a preparation method 
described by [CONTACT_692274]. (5) and approved by [CONTACT_692275] (IDS) 
Pharmacy, University of Minnesota. IDS will prepare and dispense the drug .   
 
F
rom published data in which gabapentin was used in a cohort group with nerve-related 
symptoms from localized or generalized vulvodynia, the most frequently reported 
adverse effect was irritation at the site of application, which led to termination of use 
(8%). Common adverse effects of oral gabapentin, including dizziness, somnolence, 
and peripheral edema, were not reported by [CONTACT_692276]. 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_692257], the maximum daily dose will not exceed 2 mL of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_692256] 6% solution to affected scalp surface.

waking hours and the dose will not exceed the amount of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_692258] (60 ml per month). 
 
Subjects may directly benefit from analysis of nerve function, CGRP neuropeptide, and 
treatment with gabapentin, resulting in improvement of their symtoms that may prevent 
further hair loss and even possible hair growth. This analysis will also help us better 
understand the disease process in scarring alopecia to further improve management of 
the condition.   
 
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective : To assess the role of neurogenic inflammation associated with 
CGRP expression in scarring alopecia   
 
Secondary Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 6% gabapentin in 
subjects with symptomatic scarring alopecia.  
 
[ADDRESS_938989], clinical evaluation, survey completion, neurometer 
study, photography, and scalp biopsies. At this initial visit, a total of four 4-mm skin 
biopsies will be collected . Two biopsies will be collected from affected, symptomatic 
scalp, and two skin biopsies will be collected from clinically unaffected scalp. Routine 
histology, confocal microscopy examination, and, if indicated, ELISA CGRP level 
analysis will be performed on the biopsy specimens. Subjects will start topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 6% 
gabapentin treatment on Visit 2 (Day 0).  Four remaining visits will be scheduled to 
follow subjects after the start of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 6% gabapentin treatment.  Visits 3, [ADDRESS_938990].

Gabapentin is normally available in solid (powder) form and must be compounded into a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461]. Based on published data of effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_692263] , 
IDS Pharmacy of University of Minnesota will compound the gabapentin into the 
solution for topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785]. Once prepared, IDS will also be responsible for dispensing the 
solution of 6% gabapentin in an appropriate drug container to be given to subjects. 
Each subject participating in the study will receive enough gabapentin solution for use 
over four weeks, approximately a maximum of 2 mL a day; 60 mL for 4 weeks. After 4 
weeks of treatment (Visit 4) and 8 weeks of treatment (Visit 5) the subject will return for 
follow up with the prescribed gabapentin container and will be given a new dispensed 
bottle of the solution for use during the next four weeks.    
 
Treatment Regimen 
Qualified subjects will be educated by [CONTACT_692281] 6% solution two times daily onto intact skin of affected symptomatic 
scalp areas.  The minimum and the maximum size of the scalp areas to be treated will 
be determined for each subject respectively, based on their disease pattern assessed 
during Visit 2.   Treated sites will be initially recorded and should be treated for the entire 
12 weeks unless the skin is adversely affected by [CONTACT_391774][INVESTIGATOR_692256].

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
8.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_692285]-serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
  Page [ADDRESS_939000] be reported is normally defined as 
the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment 
follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as 14 weeks following 
the start of administration of study treatment (Day 0).   
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting 
condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as 
an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Gabapentin blood levels will be monitored to ensure gabapentin toxicity does not occur.  
If gabapentin levels reach or exceed 16 ug/mL, gabapentin treatment will be interrupted.  
Abnormal gabapentin levels will be recorded as an adverse event and followed by [CONTACT_692286]. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692267] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as 
an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.

CONFIDENTIAL 
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_692287], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692268] 
p
rocedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692269]
e study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5113]. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_939001], the investigators will seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all 
adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the 
source document, though will be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation will be recorded and reported immediately. 
 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
 
8.3.1  Study S ponsor Notification by [CONTACT_10670]

2. EXPLORATORY SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES, OBJECTIVES, AND ENDPOINTS  
Measurement of B & T -cell subsets and flu- specific responses  as a way of understanding 
immunosuppression in this patient population, correlating with influenza -like illness.  
3. BACKGROUND  
3.1 Influenza overview  
Influenza is an acute viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_850865] (A, B, and C), where type A is subcategorized based on viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).  Primary influenza pneumonia is a rare but severe, complicated by [CONTACT_850888][INVESTIGATOR_14437]. Other complications include otitis media, exacerbations of 
chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], myocarditis – often the concern is for influenza infection to ‘set the stage’ for a subsequent l ethal bacterial pneumonia.  Those at 
high- risk for complications include those with cardiopulmonary diseases, chronic 
care facility residents, and those over 65 years old.  Influenza vaccines contain antigens of the circulating influenza viruses and are intended to trigger antibody- mediated protection. Influenza A viruses undergo 
continual changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, which necessitate an nual updates.   Current influenza vaccines are available as 
inactivated vaccine (IV), trivalent (TIV) or quadrivalent (QIV), usually A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and either one or two strains of B), and as a recombinant vaccine which may be TIV or QIV.  
3.[ADDRESS_1182931] closely as it is associated with lethal bacterial infections especially when the absolute neu trophil 
count is less than 500/uL, and not surprisingly is associated with more influenza -
WINSHIP 4709- 19 SANOFI ISS FIM00017  
 
7 
 related complications than in the general population1. In two studies of different 
cancer patient populations, absolute lymphocyte count of less than 200/ uL was an 
independent predictor of progression to influenza -related pneumonia2. 
 
A review of vaccine immunogenicity among patients with both liquid and solid tumors demonstrated decreased seroconversion rate among cancer patients 
receiving chemotherapy (17% to 52%) compared to cancer patients not receiving 
chemotherapy (50% to 83%) and compared to healthy controls (67% to 100%)
3. 
 
People undergoing chemotherapy or those that have acquired profound immunosuppression seen after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at increased 
risk of influenza -related complications
4,5. People at highest risk include those with 
impaired cell -mediated and antibody- mediated immunity, as reflected by a 
decrease in the number or function of T and B cells6. Influenza -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850866] [ADDRESS_1182932] a week before a 
planned allogeneic stem cell transplant9.  Odds ratio for all -cause mortality was 
1.05 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.77) among those vaccinated. Influenza -related mortality 
was similar as well between the groups (2/40 among vaccinated versus 2/38 among non- vaccinated). Documented influenza infection rate was similar in 
vaccinated and unvaccinated patients (3/40 vers us 4/38, respectively). GMTs at [ADDRESS_1182933] -vaccination among the vaccinated population were significantly higher 
for influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2 strains (15 versus 10, p=  
0.03 and 30 versus 12.5, p< 0.001, respectively).  
 Another open- label randomized trial enrolled [ADDRESS_1182934], of 
which 35 were randomized to receive an adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluad) and the rest (38) randomized to a non- adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Influvac)
10. There 
were five cases (14%) of laboratory -confirmed influenza among patients receiving 
the adjuvanted vaccine compared to three cases (8%) in the non- adjuvanted 
vaccine group. Vaccine immunogenicity, reported as seroconversion rate, seroprotection rate, and GMTs, was not significantly higher in the adjuvanted vaccine group. This study was underpowered for conclusions regarding seroprotection or to identify differences in influenza -like illness between the 
groups. 
3.4 Multiple myeloma  
Multiple myeloma (MM) affects approximately 83,000 US citizens and over 50% of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis; more than half of patients older than [ADDRESS_1182935] improved 
overall survival and event -free disease periods in patients with MM, but relapses 
are inevitable
16,17 New therapeutic agents, such as new generation proteasome 
inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), immunomodulatory agents (lenalidomide 
and pomalidomide, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat, and 
monoclonal antibodies (elutuzumab and dara tumumab) have shown promising 
clinical benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Current treatments include regimens using proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulatory agents in 
combination with HDACi, alkylating agents, and monoclonal anti bodies. 
3.5 Myeloma patients and influenza  
In myeloma patients on treatment, there is a 20% likelihood of influenza -like 
illness18,19 with a 10- fold higher risk of viral URIs20 than the general population. 
Even patients with precancerous conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of 
undetermined significance (MGUS)  and Smoldering Myeloma are at increased risk 
of bacterial and viral infections21. While only 3 -5% of these viral illnesses are 
influenza, the mortality is high in the immunosuppressed and post -influenza 
bacterial pneumonias have high morality. In addition myeloma and it’s precursor 
diseases provide a novel window to studying vaccinati on in a full spectrum of 
immunosuppression from non- cancerous low -risk MGUS to end- stage 
lymphopenic patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.  
Vaccine preventable illnesses have not been prevented in patients with myeloma 
due in part to lack of seroresponse with standard dosing algorithms. Based on available trial data restricted to myeloma patients, serologic protection (HAI titer ≥40) to all three influenza strains following trivalent influenza vaccine is achieved in less than 20% of myeloma patients in each trial
22-24.  There have been two trials 
investigating the benefit of booster vaccine in myeloma patients. In 2005 Ljungmen et al, studied 70 patients with hematologic malignancies (10 with myeloma and 4 with WM) and administered a booster dose [ADDRESS_1182936] dose influenza booster 
vaccine after 30 days to 25 myeloma patients and noted a doubling of serologic protection (HAI titer ≥40) from 14% to 33%
26. This suggests that there may be a 
role for booster vaccines in patients with hematologic malignancies, however there 
is obviously much room to improve. 
Prior studies by [CONTACT_850889]. In the first 
SHIVERING trial, we analyzed a strategy of 2 vaccine Fluzone HD doses, which led to higher rates of se roprotection compared to historic controls
27. This was 
followed by a placebo- assisted randomized controlled study (SHIVERING -2 trial) 
comparing single dose versus 2- dose vaccination strategy. Th is trial28 provided first 
evidence that [ADDRESS_1182937] of annual influenza vaccination in these patients. At the end of the influenza season, the rates of sero- protection were 58% in the cohort wi th 2 
vaccines versus 33% for the cohort with standard vaccines (P<0.05). These results 
WINSHIP 4709- [ADDRESS_1182938] led to the design of the current trial, wherein we will evaluate 3 doses of the vaccine (versus standard influenza vaccinati on) in order to further extend the rates of seroprotection at the end of study 
and test the hypothesis that repeat dosing of influenza vaccines leads to superior sero-protection in patients with plasma cell disorders, compared to that achieved 
with current  standard vaccination strategy. If this trial replicates the findings with 
SHIVERING- [ADDRESS_1182939]  response after vaccination peaking at around 7 days after 
vaccination at which point it makes up to 16% of all B -cell, and returning to 
baseline levels by [CONTACT_4475] 14. Mem ory B -cell response, on the other hand, peaks  at 
14-[ADDRESS_1182940] -vaccination hemagglutination antibody 
inhibtion ( HAI) titer > 1:40; and seroconversion, the percentage of subjects with 
either a pre- vaccination H AI titer < 1:[ADDRESS_1182941] -vaccination H AI titer > 1:40 
or a pre -vaccination H AI titer > 1:[ADDRESS_1182942] common  serologic measurement of antibody 
protection following influenza vaccine administration is an HAI titer of 40 or higher. However, this cutoff corresponds to an estimated 50% clinical benefit of 
preventing influenza infections, based on studies in young healthy adults
34,35. It is 
believed that cell- mediated immunity  declines with age, which may help explain 
why the elderly are more vulnerable to influenza infections. HAI titers have also 
been shown to be lower in the elderly compared to young adults. Based on 
studies showing increased serologic protection, Fluzone HD (TIV)  was FDA 
approved in 2009 for adults aged 65 and older , the QIV formulation in Nov -2019.

 3.7 Study rationale  
The challenge of decreasing influenza infection rate and severity in patients with 
hematologic malignancies  are manifold: first, influenza virus undergoes antigenic 
drift and antigenic shift allowing it to overcome pre -existing immunity; second, 
the fact that most vaccine -elicited neutralizing antibodies are directed against 
hypervariable epi[INVESTIGATOR_850867], facilitating the emergence of antibody -
escape viral variants; third, the apparent short half -life of vaccine -mediated 
antibody titers in immunocompetent individuals; forth, the underlying immune suppressive state caused by [CONTACT_850890]; and fifth, the lack of high quality data looking at the response to influenza vaccination in patients with hematologic malignancy  at the different stages of their disease course. Therefore, more studies 
are needed to define the optimal timing of influenza vaccination in patients with hematologic malignancies  and to design an influenza vaccination strategy  that 
provides a long- lived antibody response  targeting  a conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_850868]. 
 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network still recommends yearly 
vaccination using an inactivated influenza vaccine with the hope of achieving some protection and decrease the severity in the event of an infection. It is presumed that the higher incidence of  viral infections in patients with hematologic 
malignancies  is due to immune suppression associated with treatment and poor 
rates of seroconversion after vaccination. However, the exact mechanism of how this occurs is not well understood, limiting our a bility to design better preventive 
measures against influenza infection. T his study will measure immune responses 
to influenza vaccination in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias . 
3.8 Potential risks and benefits  
3.8.1 Potential risks  
1. Additional blood draws  - The physical risk of drawing blood is local 
pain and bruising at the site of venipuncture. Qualified phlebotomists 
or designee will draw blood samples. Care will be taken to obtain 
these specimens in a safe and hygienic manner. A small number of 
people experience lightheadedness or fainting. There is a slight risk of 
infection. To minimize these risks, attempts will be made to draw study blood samples at the same time as blood draws needed for routine 
clinical care are obtained. Repeated blood drawing may be associated 
with iron deficiency anemia.  
2. Extra influenza vaccination  - The side effects from inactivated 
influenza vaccine are generally mild. They include soreness at injection site (10- 64% of subjects) that lasts <[ADDRESS_1182943] as skin rash (hives), angioedema, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, or hypotension. If these reactions occur, 
they can usually be stopped by [CONTACT_850891] 4709- 19 SANOFI ISS FIM00017  
 
11 
 medications by [CONTACT_44518].   It is not known whether 
additional influenza risk will increase the risk of Guillain- Barre 
syndrome (GBS), estimated at 2.84 per million doses.  
3. Data security - Subjects will be asked to provide personal health 
information (PHI). All attempts will be made to keep this PHI 
confidential within the limits of the law. However, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will see the subjects’ PHI. All records will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the 
participating sites. Electronic files will be password protected behind an academic institutional  firewall. Only people who are involved in the 
conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this study will be allowed 
access to the PHI that is collected. Any publications from this study 
will not use information that will identify subjects. Organizations that 
may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the 
participating sites for quality assurance and data analysis include 
groups  such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).

 a. Assessments on these days can be performed within a ± 5 day window.   Subsequent visits (weeks 5, 9, 17 , 21) are based on the 
actual time of Fluzone HD vaccination, not the pneumonia vaccination.   
b. Involves contact [CONTACT_850892]- like illness  and SAEs.  An in- person visit is not 
required.  
c. All patients (N= 148) will have research blood drawn for correlative science. In both arms, blood will be obtained at baseline, week 
5, and week 21.  The first 20  patients in each group (n= 40 total), split evenly between intervention arm ( 20 experimental, 20 
control), had additional blood drawn 1 week after each Fluzone HD dose  (week 2 for control arm and week s 2, 10, and 18  in the 
experimental arm ) – this was completed [ADDRESS_1182950] serum immunoglobulins and SPEP . 
f. Peripheral blood samples will be obtained and analyzed as described in correlative science section.   
g. Adverse events related to vaccination will be assess ed on day of vaccination, and 7 days after each Fluzone HD vaccination (in-
person visit for significant adverse events ).  If patient is unable to be seen in- person, every effort will be made to obtain 
documentation of patient evaluation, treatment, and resolution of vaccine- related toxicities.  
h. Survival information will be collected through chart review only .  An in -person clinic visit is not required.

Fluzone HD Quadrivalent (QIV) [2020 -2021] is supplied as a single -dose, 
prefilled syringe, without needle, 0.[ADDRESS_1182951] be recorded daily (excluding non-business days and holidays as applicable), monitored during the duration of the trial per the sites’ standard operating procedures, and documentation will be maintained. If the temperature fluctuates outside of the required range, the affected study product(s) must be quarantined at  the correct storage 
temperature and labeled as ‘Do Not Use’ (until further notice). The  
pharmacist must alert the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32528], if the temperature fluctuates outside of the required range. In the event the temperature fluctuates outside of the  required range, including accidental 
deep -freezing or disruption of the cold chain, the affected study product(s) 
must not be administered. Based on the information collected, the  
manufacturer will determine whether the affected study product(s) can be used. If it cannot be  used, the site will receive specific instructions on how to 
return the affected study product(s) to the manufacturer or destroy it on site.  

   
 
21 
 7.1.3 Route of administration 
Each dose of study vaccine will be administered via a single IM injection 
given in the deltoid muscle of the subjects’ preferred arm. Aseptic technique 
will be  used for the withdrawal and administration of each dose of study 
vaccine using a disposable sterile needle appropriate in length for each 
subject and a disposable sterile syringe.  
7.1.4 Returns, reconciliation, and destruction  
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_850873], the amount 
dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_110535].  
 Sponsor/Investigator drug destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:  
• On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the 
drug.  
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with 
applicable laws and regulations, including any special requirements for 
controlled or hazardous substances.  
• Written procedures for on- site disposal are available and followed. The 
procedures must be filed with the Sponsor SOPs and a copy provided to 
pharmaceutical supporter  upon request.  
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, 
including the date disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the 
person disposing the containers. The method of disposal, ie, incinerator, 
licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor must be 
documented.  
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up -to-date, and 
available for pharmaceutical supporter  to review throughout the clinical 
trial period as per the study agreement.  
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty 
containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.  
 Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used investigational product will be destroyed at the site per institutional policy. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, provided that  procedures for proper disposal have been established 
according to applicable federal, state, local and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.

 7.1.5 Expected adverse events / toxicities   
Adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_850874] -like reactions such as fever, feverishness (chills/shivering/  
sweating), gastrointestinal side effects (emesis and diarrhea), fatigue 
(tiredness), malaise (general unwell feeling), myalgia (body aches/muscular  
pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache, and/or nausea. Some subjects may develop reactions  at the injection site, including pruritus (itching), ecchymosis 
(bruising), erythema (redness), induration (hardness)/swelling, pain, and/or tenderness. With unadjuvanted licensed,  
inactivated influenza virus vaccines most of these reactions peak in intensity in the first 24 hours  after vaccination and usually disappear without treatment 
within 1 or 2 days. Analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, or ibuprofen or similar non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) and rest may generally 
relieve or lessen these reactions. Bruising can sometimes occur due to the  
vaccination procedure.  
 In addition, post -marketing surveillance indicates the following adverse 
events of special interest  (AESI) as potential risks for pandemic vaccines 
based on those identified for the seasonal  influenza vaccines: neuritis, 
convulsions, severe allergic reactions, encephalitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, and Guillain -Barré (GBS) syndrome. Reports of these reactions 
were rare; however, exact incidence rates cannot be precisely calculated.   
 Acute and potentially life -threatening allergic reactions are also possible. Very 
rarely, occurring  in about [ADDRESS_1182952] as 
skin rash (hives), swelling around the mouth, throat  or eyes, difficulty 
breathing, a fast pulse, or loss of blood pressure. If these reactions occur,  
they can usually be stopped by [CONTACT_295008]. As with any vaccine or medication, there is a very small chance of a fatal reaction  (death), although researchers do not expect 
this to occur.  GBS : During the swine influenza (H1N1) vaccine campaign of 1976, some 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_294958] a paralytic illness called Guillain -Barr. syndrome (GBS). 
GBS is an acute inflammatory  neuropathy characterized by [CONTACT_44107], 
hyporeflexia or areflexia, and elevated protein  concentrations in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_13858]. The rate of GBS was significantly increased in individuals  receiving the 
1976 swine influenza (H1N1) vaccine at about [ADDRESS_1182953] persons  who develop GBS recover completely, although the 
recovery period may be as little as a few  weeks or as long as a few years. 
About 30% of those with GBS still have residual weakness  after 3 years and 
about 3% may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations  
many years after the initial attack. Intensive surveillance of GBS after administration of  inactivated influenza vaccines since 1976 has shown a slight 
   
 
23 
 increase in risk over background cases (more than one additional case of GBS 
per million persons) following vaccination, typi[INVESTIGATOR_99927] [ADDRESS_1182954] declined37. A recent study in Canada showed that the 
2009 H1N1 vaccine was  associated with a small but significant risk of GBS in 
persons 50 years and older38. An active, population- based surveillance study 
conducted during the 2009- 2010 influenza season found less than 1 excess 
GBS case per million doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine administered – a  rate 
similar to that associated with some previously administered annual influenza vaccines
39,40. Another study using the Medicare system showed an elevated 
risk of GBS with 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccination (incidence rate ratio = 2.41, 95% confidence interval: 1.14, 5.11;  attributable risk = 2.84 per million 
doses administered, 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 5.48)
41. An international 
collaboration study also supported a conclusion of an association between 2009 H1N1 vaccination and GBS

 9. RESPONSE  
 
Time to progression  (TTP) : Time to progression is defined as the time from  last treatment  until 
progression. Patients who have died without evidence of progression are censored in the TTP 
analysis at the time of death and patients who are alive without progression are censored at the last disease assessment.   
 Progression -Free Survival (PFS) : Defined as the time from last treatment to the disease 
progression or death from any cause. Patients who have not progressed or died are censored at the date last known progression- free. Patients with no on- study assessment will be censored at 
the time of registration.  
 Overall survival (OS) : OS is defined as the time from randomization to death. Alive patients are 
censored at the date last known alive.   
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical hypotheses  
This is a randomized study to determine whether three doses of Fluzone  HD, aka 
continuous dosing throughout the influenza  season will maintain seroprotection 
throughout the entire study.  Specifically we hypothesize that 58% of patients in the experimental arm will achieve seroprotection  at week 21 , e.g. HAI>40;  the null 
hypothesis is that only 33% will demonstrate seroprotection at the end of the study.   
10.2 Analysis datasets  
Safety Population : The safety analysis dataset will include all  eligible patients who 
begin treatment and receive at least one dose of protocol therapy. Patients will be 
analyzed in the cohort to which they were enrolled.  Efficacy Evaluable Population : All evaluable patients will be included in the 
analysis of efficacy  endpoint. T he term evaluable is defined as any eligible patient 
who receives at least one dose of protocol therapy and does not withdraw consent  
until the patient’s first response assessment.  P atients who fail to have a response 
assessment due to early progression or death will be categorized as non -responders.  
10.3 Sample size determination  
In the initial design, the sample sizes of 81 in each group achieved 90% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.2520. T he proportion in group 
one (the intense Fluzone HD arm) is assumed to be 0.3330 under the null hypothesis 
and 0.5850 under the alternative  hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the control 
group) is 0.3330. The test statistic used is the two -sided Z test with pooled variance.  
The significance level of the test (the alpha) was targeted  at 0.0500, i.e. the 
probabi lity of rejecting a true null hypothesis that was desired. The significance level 
   
 
27 
 actually achieved by [CONTACT_171953] 0.0513.  The planned power was 0.9, i.e. the 
probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. We assume 10% drop off rate in the study so that we planned to enroll [ADDRESS_1182955] influenza season (2019- 2020), we enrolled 50 patients  of which only 
23 were evaluable as 27 patients missed the week 21 study assessment due to 
COVID19 .   
 
We aim to complete the trial during the influenza season 2020- 2021, and hence will 
need to control season as a confounder through a logistic regression model. A logistic regression of a binary response variable (e.g. HAI>40) on a binary independent variable (e.g. the treatment arms) with a sample size of 134 observations (of which the two treatment arms are evenly distributed ) achieves 80% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_1182956] a change in the rate of HAI>[ADDRESS_1182957] on the other independent variables (e.g. the seasons) in the logistic regression obtained an R -
Squared of 0.1. Henc e we will need 67 patients in each randomized arm. After taking 
into account the expected 10% dropout rate, we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_1182958] season, we will plan to enroll an additional 125 
patients  in the second season. 
10.4 Statistical methods   
10.4.1  Design operating characteristics  
N/A 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1182959]  (assessed only by [CONTACT_519808] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of  the event.  All vaccine-
related AE s will be recorded with start dates  occurring any time after patient 
receives any study drug until 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 100 days (for SAEs) 
after the last day of study  participation. At each study visit, the investigator 
will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, 
if the study participant’s  condition deteriorates at  any time during the study, it  
will be recorded as  an AE.  Changes in the severity of an AE will be  
documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level 
   
 
28 
 of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. 
Adverse events will be summarized and described within each cohort. They 
will initially be reviewed regardless of attribution, but also whether they are 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that are graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either “unrelated” o r “unlikely to be related” to study treatment in the event of 
an actual relationship developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The incidence of severe adverse events or toxicities will be described. We will assess the proportion of patients who experience grade 3 or higher non- hematologic toxicity. To assess tolerability, 
we will also capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse events.   Temporary suspension of enrollment 
due to toxicity (a ka stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) are 
described elsewhere.   
10.4.3  Baseline descriptive statistics  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized within each cohort  using 
descriptive statistics. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. For continuous variables, the median and range will be presented.  Inferential tests will not be performed.  
10.4.4  Planned interim analyses (if applicable)  
N/A 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1182960] will be used to compare the Seroconversion and 
Seroprotection between two groups, respectively. Logistic regression model will be used to compare adjusted difference in Seroconversion and Seroprotection between two groups after adjusting for other factors, respectively.  
 Spearman/Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to measure the relationship between correlation between HAI, predefined risk of influenza -
like illness (low, moderate, high), respectively. Finally Mixed model will be employed to test their correlations over the whole period with and without 
   
 
[ADDRESS_1182961], respectively. The TTP, PFS 
and OS  of each patient group at specific time points, such as 1 year, 3 years, 
and 5 years, etc. will be estimated alone with 95% CI. Cox proportional hazards 
models will be used in the multivariable analyses to assess adjusted effects of 
biomarkers on the patients’ TTP, PFS and OS  after adjusting for other factors. 
The proportional hazards assumption will be  evaluated graphicall y and 
analytically with regression diagnostics.  
 
Protocol therapy related toxicities rate will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as frequencies and proportions. Differences in the proportion of patients who experience protocol -related toxicities will not be compared 
between cohorts.  
 
10.5 Measure to minimize bias 
10.5.1  Randomization 
The total sample size of 148 patients will be split equally between the arms.  
10.5.2  Evaluation of success of blinding (N/A)  
10.5.3  Breaking the study blind / participant code (N/A)  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.[ADDRESS_1182962] relate to vaccination or influenza -like illness , and these will be captured  on the appropriate 
CRF. Changes in the severity of these AE ’s only will be  documented to allow an 
assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. These AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. 
   
 
[ADDRESS_1182963]  (assessed only by [CONTACT_850896] a diagnosis), and  time of resolution/stabilization of  the 
event.   
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will 
be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. Unanticipated problems will be  
recorded in  the data collection system throughout  the study. 
 
The site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_850876] 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 14 days (for 
SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator 
will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
11.[ADDRESS_1182964], systematic format using a grading scale based on functional assessment or  magnitude of reaction. 
Describe the method of determining the expectedness of an AE. Expectedness refers to the awareness of AEs previously observed, not based on what might be anticipated from the properties of the study agent.  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not  listed in 
the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) , consent, or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class  of drugs  or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the drug under  investigation. 
 The PI , working together with treating physician, will be  responsible for determining 
whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if 
the nature,  severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the  risk 
information previously described in the IB for the study agent. 
11.3 Adverse event characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.   
 For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical 
   
 
31 
 judgment.  The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories 
below:  
 
• Definitely  Related – There is clear  evidence to suggest  a causal relationship, 
and other possible contributing factors  can be ruled out.  The clinical  event, 
including an abnormal laboratory  test result,  occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_850897]. The response to withdrawal  of the drug 
should be clinically plausible. The event  must  be pharmacologically  or 
phenomenologically  definitive,  with use of a satisfactory  re-challenge procedure if 
necessary.  
• Probably Related –  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other  factors  is unlikely. The  clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory  test result, occurs  within  a reasonable time after  administration  of the 
drug, is  unlikely to  be attributed to concurrent disease or other  drugs or  
chemicals, and follows  a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  Re-
challenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship 
(e.g., the event  occurred  within  a reasonable time after  administration of  the trial 
medication).  However, other  factors  may have contributed to the  event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical  condition, other  concomitant  events). Although an AE may 
rate only as “possibly related”  soon after discovery, it can be flagged as  requiring 
more information and later  be upgraded to “probably  related” or  “definitely 
related,” as  appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose  temporal relationship to drug administration  makes a  causal  
relationship improbable (e.g., the event  did not occur within  a reasonable time 
after administration of the trial medication) and in which  other drugs  or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides  plausible explanations (e.g.,  the participant’s 
clinical condition,  other  concomitant  treatments).  
• Not Related –  The AE is  completely independent  of study drug administration,  
and/or  evidence exists  that the event is definitely related  to another  etiology. 
There must  be an alternative,  definitive  etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 The determination of causality will include some of the following characteristics: 
 
Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was exposed to the product 
such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc), expected pharmacologic effect, or 
measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
Time course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the product?  Is the time of onset of the AE 
compatible with a drug -induced effect?  
Likely cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_193449], other drug/vaccine, or other host or 
environmental factors  
Dechallenge  Was the product discontinued or exposure reduced?  If yes, 
did the AE resolve or improve?   
   
 
[ADDRESS_1182965] in this study?  If 
yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
Consistency with 
trial treatment 
profile  Is the clinical presentation of the AE consistent with previous 
knowledge regarding the product or drug class?  
 
11.4 Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
The only adverse events to be captured in this protocol must relate to 
vaccination or influenza -like illness .  Within this definition, a n AE is considered 
"serious " if, in the  view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the  
following outcomes:   
• Death,  
• Is life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (>24hrs) or prolongation of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
• A persistent  or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512768], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  thought to be related to an influenza -like 
illness  or influenza vaccination. 
 Events not considered to be serious adverse events (SAEs) are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]  
 
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with 
any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures of a condition 
unrelated to the studied condition or its treatment  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen 
• Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_850877] . Severity is a measure of 
intensity of an event (mild, moderate, severe). However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance; thus, a severe reaction may not necessarily be classified as a serious reaction. This differs from seriousne ss, which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. A severe adverse event 
   
 
33 
 does not necessarily need to be considered serious. Seriousness (not severity) serves 
as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.   Any vaccine-  or influenza -like illness related -AE considered serious must be 
submitted on an SAE form to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC )
 if 
one exists for the study.  The DSM C may request to receive real -time notification of 
all SAEs or only SAEs thought to be related to study agent.  
 All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_8704]. The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as 
possible but in no case later than 7 cal endar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of 
the information. 
11.5 Definition of unanticipated problems (UP) and reporting requirements  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)  considers unanticipated 
problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or an outcome that meets all  the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the parti cipant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
This study will use the OHRP definition of unanticipated problems. Incidents or 
events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require t he creation and completion of a  
UP report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor. The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the 
IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, 
or outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have 
been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.

12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
12.1 Source documents and access to source data  
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this trial, in  compliance with relevant federal and institutional requirements pertaining to 
ICH E6 for the protection of confidentiality of participants.    If applicable, a s part  of participating in a NIH IC -sponsored or NIH IC - affiliated 
study, each site will permit authorized representatives of the NIH IC and regulatory agencies to examine (and when permitted by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the  study 
safety, progress, and data validity.  
 Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other  activities in a clinical trial necessary for  the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
trial. CRFs can be source documents as well as the medical record.   
12.2 Quality assurance  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
   
 
36 
  
Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol.  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source 
data/documents, and reports for monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and 
inspection by [CONTACT_3482].  
12.3 Data collection and management responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at  the site under the 
supervision of the site  PI. The  investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure  
accurate interpretation of data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a single 
line, and initial and date the change.   
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_850880]  (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents 
and maintained for recording data  for each participant  enrolled in the  study. Data 
reported in the  eCRF derived from  source  documents should be  consistent  with the  
source documents  or the discrepancies  should be  explained and captured in a 
progress  note and maintained in the participant  official  electronic study record.  
 At the coordinating center, c linical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, 
and expected adverse reactions data)  and clinical laboratory d ata will be entered into 
OnCore , a data capture system available at each center. The data system includes 
password protection and internal quality checks, such  as automatic range checks, to 
identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. 
12.[ADDRESS_1182969]. These documents  should be  retained  for a longer  period, however, if required 
by [CONTACT_56819].  No records  will be  destroyed without  the written  consent  of the 
sponsor, if  applicable. It is the  responsibility  of the sponsor  to inform  the investigator  
when  these documents  no longer  need  to be retained.  
12.5 Winship Data and Safety Monitoring  (DSMC)  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Winship Cancer Institute will provide oversight for the conduct of this study.  The DSMC functions 
   
 
[ADDRESS_1182970] internal monitoring 
functions to ensure that research being conducted by [CONTACT_163845]- quality scientific data in a manner consistent with good 
clinical practic e (GCP) and appropriate regulations that govern clinical research.    
Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC review may occur every [ADDRESS_1182971] 5 subjects being reviewed.  Subsequent monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the Winship Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)
.  
 The DSMC will review pertinent aspects of the study to assess subject safety, compliance with the protocol, data collection, and risk- benefit ratio. Specifically, the 
Winship Cancer Institute Internal Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed conse nt, eligibility, data entry, accuracy and availability of source 
documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential regulatory documents.  Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a preliminary report of monitoring findings to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_850881].  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_328792].  Prior to the completion of the final summary report, monitors will discuss the preliminary report responses w ith the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163791] (when appropriate).  
A final monitoring summary report will then be prepared by [CONTACT_2037].  Final DSMC review will include the final monitoring summary report with corresponding PI [INVESTIGATOR_163792], submitted CAPA (when applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_228415], and available aggregate toxicity and safety data.   
 The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_163794].  Continuing Review submissions will include the DSMC recommendation letter.   Should any revisions be made to the protocol -
specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC approval, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163795].  The Committee reserves the right to conduct additional audits if necessary.  
12.6 Protocol deviations  
A protocol deviation in this protocol relates only to the administration of vaccine – specifically incorrect dose, incorrect timing, incorrect administration procedure (including injection) .  Within this definition, a deviation is any noncompliance with 
the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or MOP requirements. The noncompliance may be  
either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. Because of  
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_850899]. 
 These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
   
 
38 
 • 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.[ADDRESS_1182972] be  sent to the 
local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and 
adhering to their IRB requirements.  
12.7 Publication and data sharing policy  
This study will comply  with the  NIH Public  Access  Policy, which  ensures  that the 
public has access to  the published results  of NIH funded research. It requires 
scientists  to submit  final peer -reviewed journal  manuscripts  that arise from  NIH 
funds to the  digital archive  PubMed Central upon acceptance for  publication. 
 The International Committee  of Medical Journal  Editors (ICMJE)  member journals 
have  adopted a clinical trials registration  policy as  a condition for publication. The 
ICMJE defines a  clinical trial as  any research  project that  prospectively assigns 
human subjects  to intervention  or concurrent comparison or control  groups to study 
the cause -and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health  
outcome. Medical  interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, 
behavioral  treatments,  process -of-care changes, and the like. Health  outcomes 
include any  biomedical  or health -related  measures  obtained in patients  or 
participants,  including pharmacokinetic  measures and adverse events.  The ICMJE  
policy, and the Section [ADDRESS_1182973] be obtained before any participant is enrolled. 
Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_850900]. All changes to the consent form  will be 
IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need to be re -consented.  
13.3 Informed consent  
Consent forms describing in  detail the study agent, study procedures, and risks are 
given to the  participant and written documentation of informed consent  is required 
prior to starting intervention/administering study product.   Informed consent is  a process  that is initiated prior to the individual consent  to 
participate  in the  study and continues  throughout the  individual ’s participation. 
Extensive  discussion of risks and possible benefits  of participation will be provided 
to the  participants and  their families. Consent  forms  will be IRB approved and the 
participant  will be asked  to read and  review  the document. The  investigator  will 
explain  the research study to  the participant  and answer any questions  that may arise.  
All participants  will receive  a verbal  explanation in terms suited to  their 
comprehension of the  purposes, procedures, and potential risks  of the  study and of  
their rights  as research participants.  Participants  will have the  opportunity to 
carefully review  the written  consent form  and ask questions prior  to signing. 
The participants should have the opportunity to discuss  the study with their surrogates 
or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done  specifically for the  study. The 
participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_850901] g to 
them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.

General Information  
Huntington’s  disease  (HD)  is a devastating inherited  neurologic  disease  that encompasses  motor,  cognitive 
and psychiatric symptoms, the latter often being the most troublesome leading to frequent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357441]. Common neuropsychiatric symptoms include depression, irritability, impulsivity, and apathy and often precede the onset of motor symptoms. Irritability in HD frequently leads to aggressive behavior and emotional outbursts that can be harmful to both the patient and their caregiver. There are currently no medications approved specifically to treat irritability in HD. The current available treatments are off– label and  imperfect.  
We are proposing a clinical trial using dextromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q), Nuedexta, a medication 
approved by [CONTACT_34033] [ADDRESS_446062] or exaggerated emotional exp ression 
incongruent to mood due to an underlying brain disorder. DM/Q has recently been studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease who had clinically meaningful agitation and was found to significantly improve 
agitation. Additional evidence suggesting a potential effect of DM/Q for agitation comes from controlled 
clinical trial data in nondemented patients with pseudobulbar affect, case descriptions, and anecdotal 
reports of improvement in patients with dementia and symptoms suggestive of agitation.  
We plan to enroll 20 adults  with  HD and irritability.  We are proposing a crossover  trial design  which  means 
that half the patients  (10 individuals)  will be given  the study  drug (DM/Q) and half will be give placebo  for 
4 weeks, after which the reverse will occur. This study design will optimize our study results with a relatively small number of  patients.

Huntington’s  disease  (HD)  is a devastating inherited  neurologic  disease  that encompasses  motor,  cognitive 
and psychiatric symptoms, the latter often being the most troublesome leading to frequent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357441]. Common neuropsychiatric symptoms include depression, irritability, impulsivity, and apathy and often precede the onset of motor symptoms. Irritability in HD frequently leads to aggressive behavior and emotional outbursts that can be harmful to both the patient and their  caregiver.  
There are currently no medications approved specifically to treat irritability in HD. The current available 
treatments are off– label and imperfect. Multiple classes of medications have been studied to treat the 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of HD with varying levels of efficacy and evidence.  
We are proposing a clinical trial using de xtromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q), Nuedexta, a medication 
approved by [CONTACT_34033] [ADDRESS_446063] or exaggerated emotional expression 
incongruent to mood due to an underlying brain disorder. DM/Q has recently been studied in patients 
with Al zheimer's disease who had clinically meaningful agitation and was found to significantly improve 
agitation. Additional evidence suggesting a potential effect of DM/Q for agitation comes from controlled 
clinical trial data in nondemented patients with pseud obulbar affect, published case descriptions, and 
anecdotal reports of improvement in patients with dementia and symptoms suggestive of agitation.  
We plan  to enroll 20 adults  with  HD and irritability.  We are proposing a crossover  trial design  which  means 
that half the patients  (10 individuals)  will be given  the study  drug (DM/Q) and half will be give placebo  for 
[ADDRESS_446064] unwanted side effects. 
Irritability in HD can lead to aggressive behavior which can result in injury to the patient and/or caregiver and even incarceration. An effective medication to address this significant disruptive and destructive behavioral  symptom  that can destroy  patient/caregiver relationships  and negatively  impact  quality  of life 
is imperative. We hypothesize that dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) will decrease irritabi lity in 
individuals with HD and minimize aggression and  outbursts.  
 
Objectives  
To prove efficacy and safety of dextromethorphan/quinidine 20mg/10mg (DM/Q 20mg/10mg) in patients 
with irritability due to Huntington’s disease  
Specific Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of DM/Q 20mg/10mg (one capsule BID for 4 weeks) in 
addressing irritability in individuals with HD.  
Specific Aim 2: To assess the motor response to DM/Q 20mg/10mg (one capsule BID for 4 weeks after 
one week of QD dosing both before and after t he 4 weeks of BID and one week of washout) using the 
motor portion of the UHDRS 99’ total motor score (TMS) and the chorea subscale (TCS).  
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the impact that DM/Q 20mg/10mg (one capsule BID for 4 weeks) has on 
functional independen ce using the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and the Independence scale.

A randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, crossover, proof of concept study. Investigator Initiated 
trial (IIT).  
Expected duration of study: One year. 
DURATION OF TREATMENT  
- A total of 13  weeks:  
- First treatment group: DM/Q 20mg/10mg one capsule once daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 
[CONTACT_193875]/Q 20mg /10 mg or placebo twice daily for subsequent 4  weeks;  
- First  tapering  and washout:  DM/Q  20mg/10mg  or placebo  once  daily  for 7days  followed  by a washout 
phase of 1  week;  
- Second treatment group (crossover): DM/Q 20mg/10mg or Placebo once daily for 1 week, followed 
by [CONTACT_357446]/Q 20mg/10mg twice daily for 4  weeks;  
- Second tapering placebo or DM/Q 20mg/10mg once daily for 7  days.

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S):  
To assess irritability  in response  to of DM/Q  20mg/10mg  compared  to placebo  on irritability  as quantified 
by [CONTACT_357447],  where  the informant  is a friend  or family  member  familiar with  the daily  activities 
of the subject after four weeks of treatment with the study drug or  placebo.  
The primary efficacy parameter is the Irritability scale treatment adjusted for baseline. For this scale,  we 
define the clinically significant improvement as [ADDRESS_446065] for the sample size 
determination.  
 
 
SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S):  
- The following secondary variables will be  analyzed:  
- Irritability as quantified by [CONTACT_357448];  
- Change of behavioral symptoms (UHDRS, HADS, NPI -  Q),

ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS:  
The primary  outcome  is the irritability  scale  and the secondary  outcomes  in this primary  objective  include 
PBA-s, CGI -S, CGI -I, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_357442]/aggression domain. For the irritability scale, we define 
the clinically significant improvement as [ADDRESS_446066] the above difference, we need 20 subjects in total to achieve 
80%  power  at an alpha  level  of 0.05.  Consi dering a 10%  dropout  rate,  we will enroll  [ADDRESS_446067] size of 1.3 in other behavioral symptoms and outcomes in the secondary objectives (i.e., chorea, patient’s global  functioning).

CRF/Data Collection Form attached to this protocol.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
Dextromethorphan/quinidine is an FDA -approved medication (NUEDEXTA).  
Expecte d adverse  reactions:  The most  common  adverse  reactions  (incidence  of ≥3%  and two-fold greater 
than placebo) in patients taking NUEDEXTA are diarrhea, dizziness, cough, vomiting, asthenia, peripheral 
edema, urinary tract infection, influenza, increased gamma- glutamyltransferase, and  flatulence.  
Warnings and precautions:  
*Thrombocytopenia and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions: Quinidine can cause immune -mediated 
thrombocytopenia that can be severe or fatal. Non -specific symptoms, such as lightheadedness, chills, 
fever, nausea, and vomiting, can precede or occur with thrombocytopenia.  
*Hepatotox icity: Hepatitis, including granulomatous hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving 
quinidine, generally during the first few weeks of therapy.  
*Cardiac Effects: NUEDEXTA causes dose -dependent QTc prolongation. QT prolongation can cause 
torsades d e pointes –type ventricular tachycardia, with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation 
increases. Some risk factors include use with CYP3A4 inhibitors or drugs that prolong QT interval, 
electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia, or left ventricular hy pertrophy or dysfunction. If patients taking 
NUEDEXTA experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias (eg, syncope 
or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]), NUEDEXTA will be discontinued, and the patient further evaluated.  
Concomitant Use of CYP2D6 S ubstrates: NUEDEXTA inhibits CYP2D6 and may interact with other drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6.  
Dizziness: NUEDEXTA may cause dizziness. Take precautions to reduce the risk of falls.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1049 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/28/2021  
Page 8 of 8  Serotonin  Syndrome:  Use of NUEDEXTA  with  selective serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  increases  the 
risk of “serotonin  syndrome.”  
*NUEDEXTA will be discontinued immediately if any of these occur.  
 
 
Measures in place to minimize the risks listed above:  
1. Participants  will be asked  to report  any experienced  adverse  reactions  to the study  staff immediately;  
2. Screening for adverse reactions will be performed  periodically;  
3. ECG and vital signs  examination  will be performed  at the screening visit,  visit 3 (at the end of the first 
arm of the study and ju st prior to crossover) and week 13 (at the end of the study).  
4. Laboratory  examinations  (haematology,  clinical chemistry,  and urinalysis)  will be performed  on visit 1 
(screening visit), visit 3 (at the end of the first arm of the study and just prior to crossover) and week 
13 (at the end of the study).  
5. A phone interview will be conducted at weeks [ADDRESS_446071]  correlation.  The independent  variables  include  the treatment 
group, sequence, period, and the baseline values. For the missing data, if missing is random, we  will 
analyze the data as it is. Otherwise, we will follow Ibrahim and Molenberghs’ book on longitudinal study 
for data analysis. The analysis for the secondary aims will be similar. For safety analysis, descriptive 
statistics  will be provided  for all adverse  events.  We will stop  the study  if there is evidence  to support  rate 
of one type of adverse events more than 30% in all participants. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357444] 95% Blyth -Still- Casella confidence bounds. If the number of cases of on e type of adverse event 
exceed the specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: ≥ 7 in 10 patients or ≥ [ADDRESS_446072]  (IRB)  for the University  of 
[LOCATION_007] Health Science Center at Houston. Baylor College of Medicine and the Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357445].  
The University of [LOCATION_007] -Housto n has its own IRB and Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects 
(CPHS).  There are two classifications  of adverse  events:  adverse  event (AE) or serious  adverse  event  (SAE). 
AE information will be documented throughout the study. The study team will record all AEs on the 
Adverse  Event  case  report  form.  AEs will be monitored  until  they  are adequately  resolved  or explained  as 
mentioned  previously.  
The trial will be perfor med in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization 
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.

submission to appropriate national and international scientific meetings and a manuscript for 
submission to a peer -reviewed journal. Authorship will be based on guidelines issued by [CONTACT_357453], and will require active input into protocol design or manuscript 
preparation.  The order  of authors  will be determined  by [CONTACT_357454].  Negative  publication  bias 
is a significant problem in modern medical research; the results of this trial w ill be published, after 
manuscript approval by [CONTACT_357455].  
- We plan to publish/disseminate the results even if the results are negative as even a “negative” trial can be helpful in the management of individuals with HD and the evaluation for future therape utic 
agents.  
- We plan to implement the use of this medication as needed if we have favorable results as this drug is already FDA approved. We will consider moving forward with modifying the indication for the medication and future studies pending the study  results.  
- If needed, future funding will be sought through the NINDS/NIH and/or nonprofit organizations that 
fund HD related  research.  
- Clinically significant results will be returned to research  subjects.

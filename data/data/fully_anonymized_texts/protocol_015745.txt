 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to [LOCATION_002] standards of Good Clinical Practice in accordance with applicable Federal regulations and institutional research policies and procedures.  
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third most common cause of cancer related death in the United 
States and is the most prevalent non- cutaneous cancer [1].  Pelvic lymph node dissection 
(PLND) following robot -assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is an established technique for 
determining lymph node metastases [2].  The most frequent post -operative complication of 
PLND is lymphocele formation. Lymphoceles occur as a result of lymph leakage from lymphatic channels that ha ve been cut during dissection. The Principal Investigator (PI) has  previously 
published findings of an occurrence rate of 51% for lymphocele formation with 15.4% from them being clinically symptomatic. The overall frequency of symptomatic ly mpocele in patient’s 
that underwent bilateral PLND was equal  6.6% of the evaluated group in this publication [3].   
 We hypothesize that the incidence of lymphocele’s  should decrease significantly by [CONTACT_507007] [3].    
Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 Bovie Medical Corporation’s J -Plasma® helium based plasma technology is a hemostatic t ool 
with FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The J -Plasma® 
system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and a supply of helium gas.  Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_506997].  When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.  The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy.  Previous studies comparing J -Plasma® to 
other energy sources demonstrated less or comparable lateral and depth of thermal spread for J -
Plasma® in porcine peritoneum, bladder, and small intestine [4].  The precise delivery of energy and minimal thermal injury to collateral tissue makes J -Plasma® a useful surgical too l in 
procedures such as radical prostatectomy where minimizing damage to collateral tissue is crucial to preserving sexual function and continence.  As an example, J -Plasma® has been shown to be 
clinically effective in the treatment of endometriosis on fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], ovaries, and other delicate structures where current RF energy sources cannot be used due to risk of damage [5,6].  
 This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of the J -Plasma® helium based plasma technology 
in the reduction of lymphoceles  following PLND during RARP.  The J -Plasma® h andpi[INVESTIGATOR_506998].

 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the J -Plasma ® helium based 
plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following PLND during RARP.  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE /AIM/GOAL/HYPOTHESIS  
J-Plasma ® helium based plasma technology will reduce the occurrence of lymphoceles 
when used to perform PLND  during RARP.

Study Design  
RESEARCH DESIGN  
The study will be a single institution, single arm prospective trial where by [ADDRESS_654283] their PLND performed using J -Plasma® for dissection and sealing of lymphatic channels. An 
abdominal -pelvic ultrasound will be completed at a follow -up peri od ranging from 4- [ADDRESS_654284]. Vipul Patel’s clinical practice for all patients who undergo a PLND during RARP .  The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group of 100 patients  will 
be compared to retrospective data of 100 patients  acquired from the IRB approved 
Urologic Robotic Surgery Outcomes Registry  # 237998  using the same inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria as defined for enrollment in this protocol   and f rom other published data to 
determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.    
  
STUDY AGENT , DEVICE , AND/OR INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 
The study will be conducted using components of the Bovie Medical J -Plasma® 
system that have received FDA clearance and are currently commercially available.  The J -Plasma® handpi[INVESTIGATOR_506999] 510k numbers 
K112233 and K151325 for the delivery of helium gas plasma for cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The Bovie Ultimate high frequency electrosurgical generator was cleared under FDA 510k number K142975 for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate, and ablate soft tissue.  Therefore, the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during PLND would be c onsidered on label for the study devices.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS  
The primary variable of interest is the incidence of lymphocele formation measured at approximately [ADDRESS_654291] -operatively.  The incidence of lymphocele formation will be 
compared between the 100 enrolled  “treatment ” group and a propensity matched “ non-
treatment ” group that will be established using  equal inclusion/exclusion criteria, this  
retrospective lymphocele data will be retrieved from the
 Urologic Robotic Surgery Outcomes 
Registry  identified by [CONTACT_507009] #237998 .  Additional comparisons of demographic (age, 
race/ethnicity) and oncological information will be accessed to ensure no differences between the two groups.     
Potential Risks and Benefits 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Lymphocele’s can l ead to symptoms and secondary complications such as abdominal 
pain, leg pain, lower limb edema, constipation, urinary frequency, deep vein thrombosis and infection or sepsis . 
The potential benefits  of enrollment of this study will be a hypothesized reducti on in the 
incidence of lymphocele formation thus resulting in a decrease of the symptoms associated with such formation.    
POTENTIAL RISKS  
Risks associated with robotic radical prostatectomy as discussed and stated by [CONTACT_507013]: severe loss of blood, damage to surrounding organs, 
tissues, vessels, infection / any of which may necessitate a return to surgery, cardiac arrest which may result from the performance of any surgery/ procedure(s), and in some cases, may lead to partial or permanent disability or death.  Additional risks may include, but are not limited to: urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, rectal/bowel/ureter injury, bladder neck contracture, pulmonary embolism, urine leak, pneumonia, problems related t o positioning and endotracheal tube, blood transfusion, embolus from pneumo-
peritoneum, unrecognized injuries and lymphocele  formation . 
 JPlasma® has minimal lateral and depth of thermal spread in a variety of tissue types however; possible  risks associate d with JPlasma® are: unintended surgical site burns due 
to direct contact [CONTACT_507014].  Inadvertent activation or movement of the cutting tip instrument outside the field of vision may result in injury to the patient or

research team members are trained to follow [LOCATION_012] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s policy on the protection of patient’s  health and private information.  The collection of sensitive information about 
subjects will be limited to minimum necessary to achieve the aims of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information will be collected.    
Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
INVESTIGATOR  WITHDRAW AL OF  SUBJECTS  
Patients  that did not receive a pelvic lymph node  dissection at the discretion of the 
surgeon during their robotic radical prostatectomy will be withdrawn from the study.    Patients that do not return for the abdominal ultrasound post operatively as ordered by [CONTACT_507015]. 
 
If a patient is withdrawn from the study they will be notified vi a telephone call by [CONTACT_507016] . After [ADDRESS_654293] -operative abd ominal ultrasound will not 
be included in the final analysis as the re would be unsuccessful collection of the  data 
necessary to conclude  the study’s  end point .  Patients who request to withdraw after the 
abdominal ultrasound will have their data maintained  in the research database up to the

Adverse Event Reporting:  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether o r not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 Adverse events will be documented as anticipated or unanticipated; minor or serious; and, related or unrelated to study intervention.   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : A Serious Adverse Event is defined as an AE meeting 
one of the following outcomes:  
• Death du ring the period of protocol defined surveillance  
• Life Threatening Event (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343395]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for “serious ” should be regarded 
as minor  adverse events .  
 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507004] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.

2/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 4: 
RATIONALE 
The following changes have been made in this amendment:  
• Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea has been changed to 
Grade ≥  2 diarrhea  
• Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea that persists for more than 2 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_235204] (e.g., 
loperamide) has been added as an AESI  
• Recommendation to Management of Gastrointestinal Toxicities that patients 
experiencing Grades ≥ [ADDRESS_284218] weekly (e.g., by [CONTACT_756]) 
has been added 
• Adverse Event assessments at Weeks [ADDRESS_284219] been added for 
a general assessment of adverse events 
 
Rationale :  The above changes were prompted by [CONTACT_235269], one of which resulted in colitis.  These changes, including the addition 
of adverse event assessments at W eeks [ADDRESS_284220] been made to increase 
monitoring of diarrhea.  
Other changes are as follows:  
• Added collection of additional blood sample at 4-week Post-Surgical Follow-Up visit 
for ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers analysis. 
Rationale :  This is aimed to enable correlation of response with biomarkers and 
potential identification of high-risk population(s)  
• Requirement added for Target Lesion #2, if selected, to be ≥ 10 mm.  
Rationale :  No minimum size was previously defined; therefore, this change 
was made to improve clarity.  
• Added additional restriction to the following ex clusion criterion: “History of prior or 
currently active small or large intestine inflammation (such as Crohn’s disease or 
ulcerative colitis).  Any patient with a baseline medical condition involving the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who may have a predisposition for GI toxicity requires 
prior approval from the Medical Monitor .”  
Rationale :  This was added with the intention that it may further prevent patients 
with potential predispositions to GI side effects from being enrolled.  
• Included “Investigational Agents” amongst prohibited Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].    
Rationale :  This was not previously specified; therefore, this change was made 
to improve clarity.  
• Added specification that there is a 4-week “wash-out” period for any other 
Investigational Agents prior to initiation of treatment with GDC-0032.    
Rationale :  This was not previously specified; therefore, this change was made 
to improve clarity

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
GLOBAL CHANGES 
Non-serious has been deleted from “non-seri ous adverse event of special interest” 
throughout the protocol.   
IND number has changed from [ADDRESS_284222].   
SECTION 1.3:  BACKGROUND ON TH E PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network [CGAN] 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by [CONTACT_235270] (PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235205] (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); 
(4) AKT1 somatic gain-of-function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 
amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995).  Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast 
cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
SECTION 1.4:  BACKGROUND ON RE VERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE 
BY [CONTACT_235271]3K/MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, the PI3K signaling pathway seems to play an 
important role in mediating hormonal resi stance and is a viable therapeutic target.  
Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo  (primary) 
and acquired (secondary) resistance to hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines 
and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and . simultaneous   Simultaneous blocking of 
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus , an mTOR inhibitor,  and the ER pathway 
with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005).  Importantly, a baseline protein signature [CONTACT_39299]3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
5/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor,  were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial 
(Baselga et al. 2009). … 
SECTION 1.5:  BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
…In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated 
approval of pertuzumab ( Perjeta®) as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory, or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting. 
SECTION 1.6:  BACKGROUND ON GDC-[ADDRESS_284223] of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant). … 
SECTION 3:  STUDY DESIGN  
In addition to the safety assessments conducted at the scheduled follow-up visits, patients will be contact[CONTACT_235272] a general assessment of adverse events at Weeks 7 and 11. 
Blood samples  for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, and 
prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-weeks postsurgical 
follow-up visit . 
SECTION 3.3.1:  Rationale for Conduc ting the Study in the Neoadjuvant 
Setting  
…Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these groups of tumors have 
revealed critical differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment 
(Sotiriou et al. 2003) .  As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast 
tumors are expected to emerge.  Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management 
is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen and minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
SECTION 3.3.3:  Rationale for Control Group  
The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen (IMPACT ) trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER + operable or locally 
advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. … 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
6/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ( ACOSOG ) Z1031 trial compared 
three AIs in a randomized, Phase II, neoadjuvant trial designed to select agents for 
Phase III investigations. … 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rationale for E fficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole  plus placebo , pCR 
rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab (Perjeta®), 
an HER2 dimerization inhibitor, as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting.   
SECTION 3.3.7:  Rationale for GDC-[ADDRESS_284224] been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 
was 9-mg capsules daily. 
Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole, one patient at 6 mg capsule had a cPR.  The PIK3CA  mutation status of this 
patient is unknown.  Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg  capsules , and the 
long-term safety suggests that 6 mg capsule is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study 
will utilize 6-mg GDC-0032 capsules in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg  capsules  and 
1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg  capsules . 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82−[ADDRESS_284225] on efficacy is anticipated. … 
SECTION 3.3.8:  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
7/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the tuberous sclerosis 1 ( TSC1 ) gene 
was found in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer with a prolonged response 
(> 2 years) to everolimus as single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional patients 
with bladder cancer treated with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant 
tumors remained on therapy longer than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-[ADDRESS_284226] cancer that received an  alpha-isoform PI3K blocking agent and 
succumbed to her disease after a lasting clinical response (Juric et al. 2015).  Extensive metastatic sampling was performed post-mortem, with the main finding being the emergence of molecular aberrations leading to loss of PTEN; thus, indicating a new mechanism of secondary resistance to PI3K blockade.  Similar approaches could be of 
great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
SECTION 4.1.2:  Exclusion Criteria  
Patients who meet any of the following cr iteria will be excluded from study entry: 
• History of prior or currently active small or large intestine inflammation (such as 
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) .  Any patient with a baseline medical 
condition involving the gastrointestin al (GI) tract or who may have a 
predisposition for GI toxicity requires prior approval from the Medical Monitor.   
SECTION 4.5.10:  Laboratory Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [RBC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells,  if applicable ]), and 
platelet count.   
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Tumor tissue should be from the primary tumor (not lymph nodes) and  of good 
quality based on total and viable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s tumor 
sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to 
initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior 
diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection (Weeks 17 −18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various 
reasons (e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site 
should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, 
unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
8/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17 −18).  Except in the case 
of pCR, every effort should be made to obtain a fresh-frozen tumor tissue 
sample at surgery.  
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA   
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35% −40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 (helical and 
kinase domain, respectively) in the codons encoding amino acids E542, E545, and 
H1047 (Saal et al. 2005). … 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Management of Rash 
Rash and other dermatological events should be closely monitored, and patients with 
severe rash should be monitored for associated signs and symptoms such as fever and hypotension that may be suggestive of a system ic hypersensitivity reaction.  For severe 
rash, dosing of GDC-0032/placebo  should be interrupted, and patients should be treated 
with supportive therapy per standard of care.  Use of antihistamines, as well as topi[INVESTIGATOR_90541], may be considered (see Table 4).   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Manageme nt of Diarrhea and Colitis 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the 
investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Weekly patient contact (e.g., 
telephone call) for all events of diarrhea Grades ≥[ADDRESS_284227] of  care.  For example, prompt management 
of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the 
approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 /placebo  for Grade ≥
 2 diarrhea.     
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg  capsule  
in combination with letrozole; another patient at 6 mg capsule in combination with 
fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications 
such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids that can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
SECTION 5.2.3:  Non Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(Immediately Reportable to ABCSG) 
Non serious  aAdverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235273] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Grade ≥ 3 
2 diarrhea  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
9/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea for > 2 weeks after following medical management guidelines in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
 
SECTION 5.4.1:  Emer gency Medical Contacts  
Genentech’s Medical Monitor Contact [CONTACT_7171]: 
Medical Monitor: , M.D., Ph.D. 
Telephone No.  
 
SECTION 5.5.1:  Investigator Follow-Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_093], the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.   With regard to the adverse event of 
special interest of diarrhea, it is recommend ed that investigators follow every adverse 
event of 
≥ Grade 1 diarrhea with weekly patient contacts (e.g., telephone calls) and 
follow up until resolution.  Cases that do not resolve within 1 −2 weeks should be 
aggressively managed per protocol recommend ations for gastrointestinal toxicities.  
SECTION 5.6:  POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The investigator should report these events by [CONTACT_235274] a paper Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using 
the fax numbers provided to investigators  directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either 
by [CONTACT_25752]/Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact [CONTACT_7171] & List of 
Investigators”). 
SECTION 6.1:  DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20% for each analysis 
population , we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary 
endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
SECTION 6.4.1:  Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint  
…The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR.  The two alpha values account for a 
family-wise type I error rate of 20%  for each analysis population .  Patients with early 
study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as 
non-responders.

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2-negative (ER  +/HER2  −) early stage breast cancer, as measured by [CONTACT_235280]-primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235282]3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235283]3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
[CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284247] criteria (Appendix 3) using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
22/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Compare the centrally derived,  preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score upon 
treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
[CONTACT_235284]. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by [CONTACT_235285] (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possibl e drug interaction between letrozole and 
GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284248] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER
 +/HER2  − untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer whose primary tumors 
are ≥ [ADDRESS_284249] of care 
assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment.  ER, PR, HER2, and

23/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284250] 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies.  Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets) or 
placebo on a 5 −days-on/ 2 −days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be adminis tered.  Letrozole can be continued up to 
surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses.  Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_284251] ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235207] (Figure 6).  
In addition to the safety assessments conducted at  the scheduled follow-up visits, patients will 
be contact[CONTACT_235272] a general assessment of adverse events at Weeks [ADDRESS_284252] MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by [CONTACT_235286] 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by [CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the investigator’s decision.  If the patient goes off-study  
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy sample prior to beginning 
another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis.  Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample s for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to dosing, at 
Week 9, prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-w eeks postsurgical follow-up visit . 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17 −18.  Surgery 
should be performed within [ADDRESS_284253] observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice.  However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be colle cted and recorded.  Sur gery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endo cri
ne therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
24/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks ( + 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study.  Assessment of  adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning the 
surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and bot h the planned and actual surgical treatment 
should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be 
established via a local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and directions 
for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be us ed to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  IRF 
procedures are detailed in the IRF charter.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuati on visit.  All concomitant medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat [ADDRESS_284256] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to 
randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
27/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of

• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate 
medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin,

Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 
120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235293]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%  for each analysis population, 
we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, 
and pCR, respectively. Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_284259] an absolute percenta ge increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the 
GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; 
Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance 
level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by [CONTACT_235294] (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235295].

Determination of Sample Size   
Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every [ADDRESS_284260] patient has completed study treatment.  
Additional details (e.g., DMC members, communica tion, affiliations) will be provided in the iDMC 
charter.   
The iDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 
[ADDRESS_284261] either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on 
study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (f or those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
iDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the iDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The iDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by [CONTACT_235300].  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) ( Cantley 2002 ), 
a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins  in 
the AKT-ma 
mmalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway ( Guertin and Sabatini 2007 ).  
Activating and transforming mutati ons, as well 
as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors ( Li et al. 1997 ).  In addition, 
the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by [CONTACT_235301], the lo
ss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) and Inositol 
Polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999; Cantley 2002 ; Massion et al. 2004 ; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.[ADDRESS_284269] frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths ( Jemal et al. 2011 ).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, 
especially in developed countries, ar e now diagnosed in early stages, th
ey are amenable 
to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER
 +)/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2-negative 
(HER2  −) breast cancer accounts for about 60% −70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy ( Davies et al. 2011 ).  
There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/
or secondary hormonal 
resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or 
upregulation of growth factor signaling pathways, such as the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways ( Johnston 2009 ). 
In the setting of ER+
 /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to explore ( Miller et al. 2010 ). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
36/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network [CGAN] 
2012 ).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTO R pathwa
y include the following: 
(1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005 ; Wu et al. 2005 ); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN,  either by [CONTACT_235302] (PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235205] (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amp lificat
 ion and/or overexpression ( Brugge et al. 2007); 
(4) AKT1 somatic gain-of-function mutations ( Stemke-Hale et al. 2008 ) and AKT2 
amplification
s (Bellacosa
 et al. 1995 ).  Overall, it is estimated that up to 70 % of breast 
cancers can
 have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
(CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
[CONTACT_235271]3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, the PI3K signaling pathway seems to play an 
important role in mediating hormonal resi stance and is a viable therapeutic target.  
Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo  (primary) 
and acquired (secondary) resistance to hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines 
and xenograft models ( Sabnis et al. 2007 ).  Simultaneo us bl ocking of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus , an mTOR inhibitor, and the ER pathway 
with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005 ).  
Importantly, a baseline pr otein signat
ure of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of 
a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy ( Miller et al. 2010 ). 
In the clinical  setting, 
impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus  were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial ( Baselga et al. 2009 ).  This trial 
compared everolimus and exemest ane with plac ebo and exemestane in 
724 postmenopausal pa
tients with ER  + advanced breast cancer who had experienced 
recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.[ADDRESS_284270] ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35 −0.54 (<
 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27− 0.47; p<
 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone ( Bachelot et al. 2012 ).  The 
6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47% −74%) with tamoxif en plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29% −56%) with tamoxifen alone.  Time to progressio
n 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
37/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
(HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 −0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 −0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 ).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal pa tients with o
 perable ER  + 
breast cancer were randomly assigned to re ceive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment 
with letrozole and either everolimus or placebo.  The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical response by [CONTACT_23302], was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation ( Tabernero et al. 2009 ).  This finding suggests th at 
alternative pharmacologic strategie
s to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of 
AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.[ADDRESS_284271] adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003 ; Scholl et al. 1994 ; Semiglazov et al. 2004 ; 
Fisher et al. 2012 ; Wolff and Davidson 2000 ).  The randomized studies evaluating 
neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve bre ast cons erv
ation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy ( Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012 ).  A 
meta-analysis of nine randomized st udies comp
aring adjuvant with neoadjuvant 
systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease progression, or distant disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 ).  The concept of neoa djuvant therapy is now well established 
and a stand
ard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative 
Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2014 ).  The results of this meta-analysis con firmed an 
associat
ion of pCR with favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., 
HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnitude of pCR improvement pred ictive of the long-term survival benefits 
could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

1.6 BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 (also known as taselisib) is a potent selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, 
delta, and gamma isoforms, with 30-fold less potent inhibition of the beta isoform that is being developed as a therapy for human cancers.   Nonclinical studies with GDC-[ADDRESS_284273] of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant).  GDC-[ADDRESS_284274] ics consistent with a compound that can be 
delivered orally to achieve clinical exposure similar to the nonclinical efficacy findings 
described herein.  Additional studies, including 16-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs, phototoxicity studies, and an embryo-fetal development study, support the Phase II neoadjuvant trial with GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapy.   
In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations (see Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the 
aromatase-expressing breast cancer cell line (MCF7X2.3.ARO) showed positive combination effects between GDC-0032 and endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone caused growth inhibition (50% effective concentration [EC
50] = 95 nM).  Effects on growth were also observed with letrozole and  fulvestrant.  
Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination.  In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type (WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was 
added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA  WT model are not 
available because these cell lines do not grow as xenografts.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7 −43.[ADDRESS_284280] there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24  = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008 ).  Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, w
ere within the 
range predicted by [CONTACT_78013].  Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that [ADDRESS_284281] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a PK DDI.

Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA  WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >

GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by [CONTACT_26702]/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).

45/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284288] that is approved in the European Union (E.U.) and the 
[LOCATION_002] (U.S.) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 
capsules in combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT patients with breast 
cancer.  Maintenance of cPR has been observed in a patient who had a dose reduction from [ADDRESS_284289] been built 
into the protocol through the means of inclus ion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, 
protocol design, and management guidelines.  These will also be clearly highlighted and discussed in detail at investigator meetings and site visits.  In addition, please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding potential risks, associated precautions, and other relevant nonclinical and clinical safety information. 
Due to the need to develop improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235216]2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/[COMPANY_002]

within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies.  Presurgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets) or placebo on a 5 −days-on/2− days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks 
(see Figure 5).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole 
can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.

In addition to the s a
fety assessments conducted at the scheduled follow-up visits, 
patients will be contact[CONTACT_235272] a general assessment of adverse events at 
Weeks [ADDRESS_284294] MRI.  Patients with primary disease not evaluable by [CONTACT_235286] 9.  Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_235311][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
[CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3) can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decision.  If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy sample prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis.  
Clinical breast examination, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be 
conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood samples  for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-weeks postsurgical 
follow-up visit . 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
52/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice.  
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks ( +
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study.  Assessment of adverse ev ents and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical treatment should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and 
directions for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be used to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  
IRF procedures are detailed in the IRF charter.

The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the iDMC to review ongoing safety data.   
3.[ADDRESS_284297] patient in.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
53/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284298] cancer (Luminal A, Lum inal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like) have 
been identified and intensively studied ( Perou et al. 2000 ; Sørlie et al. 2001 ).  Known as 
the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, t hese groups of tumors have revealed critical 
differences in incidence,
 survival, and response to treatment ( Sotiriou et al. 2003 ).  As 
genomic studies evolve, further sub-classificat i
ons of breast tumors are expected to 
emerge.  Thus, a major challenge in breast c ancer management is how to prospectively 
select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen and minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of patients with early breast cancer.  Outcomes of 
patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy ( Mauri et al. 2005), and the former offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with lar ger tumors.  The tumor may shrink prior to surg
ery, thus 
increasing the rate of BCS ( Coudert et al. 2006 ), and since the response  to therapy can 
be monitored, the patien
t might be also spared further treatment with inactive 
medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents.  Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens.  On-treatment biopsies may also be prespecified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level.  Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well.  The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes of breast cancer ( von Minckwitz and 
Fontanella 2013 ; Cortazar et al. 2012 ). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy, and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
Recently, everolimus was approved by [CONTACT_235312] (AIs).  In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
54/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ 
breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 ). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, confirm a 
previously identified pharmacodyna mic paradox: 
 while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an 
upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop (Tabernero et al. 2009 ).  This finding suggests th at alternative pharmacologic strateg
 ies 
to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level.  PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models ( Sanchez et al. 2011 ); therefore, it 
is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate gre
ater anti-tumor 
activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284299] been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer ( Eiermann et al. 2001 ; 
Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011 ). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER + breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen ( Eiermann et al. 2001 ).  
The primary 
endpoint of P024 was the percentag e of patients in each trea
tment arm with objective 
response as determined by [CONTACT_235313].  Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by [CONTACT_235314].  The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared with tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  An improved ORR for letrozole was also 
observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p  < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; 
p < 0.001).  The higher response rate assessed by [CONTACT_235315] a 
significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022).  Median 
time-to-response was 66 days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen 
(IMPACT ) trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER + operable or locally 
advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of

55/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or 
a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery.  The tumor ORR was assessed by [CONTACT_235316].  No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen.  However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; 
p
 = 0.23); this difference became significant for patients deemed by [CONTACT_235317] (46% vs.  22%, respectively; p  = 0.03).  All treatments 
were well tolerated. 
The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ( ACOSOG ) Z1031 trial compared 
three AIs in a randomized, Phase II, neoadjuvant trial designed to select agents for 
Phase III investigations.  Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II −III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant 
exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole.  The primary endpoint was clinical response.  No 
formal comparison between arms was prespecified in the statistical plan.  ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole, and anastrozole arms, respectively.  On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by [CONTACT_235318] (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007 ; Baselga et al. 2009 ).  
Guidelines for RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_284300]  
lesions 
in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ).  In addition, MRI has been shown to be 
more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, 
and mammography for measuring 
residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006 ; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY 
trial ( Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_235319] a  co-primary 
endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
56/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival ( von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013 ).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is  an unlikely event.  For instance, in t
he 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole  plus placebo , pCR 
rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively ( Baselga et al. 2009 ). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage has been observed, and some patients presented
 sustained partial responses.  As pCR 
is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial.  Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab (Perjeta
®), 
an HER2 dimerization inhibitor, as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER + breast 
cancer ( Dowsett et al. 2011 ).  Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of 
cell-cycle arrest, and du ring neoadju
vant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of 
endocrine agents to suppress proliferation ( Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis et al. 2011 ).  In the 
neoadjuvant trial of letroz ole with everolimus, by [CONTACT_10540] d
efinition that patients with 
natural log (Ki67)  < [ADDRESS_284301] an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders versus 30% in the placebo arm, with a 
significant p  value of <  0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009 ).  Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline 
was greater in 
the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%  ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002).  In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery ( Smith et al. 2005).  For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean 
Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for t
amoxifen at both timepoints 
(p = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination.  In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial ( Ellis et al. 2011 ), although no data on 
Ki67 at Day 15 were ava
ilable, no differences were found between treatments at 
baseline and at surgery (after 16 −18 weeks of therapy).  The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
57/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial (Eiermann et al. 2001).  Treatment with letrozole led to higher , treatment-induced 
reduction of 
Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 
75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p  = 0.0009) based on the 
185 specimens with available data on Ki67 ( Ellis et al. 2003 ).  With a median follow-up of 
61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of tr eatment were significantly 
associat
ed with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the 
Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2 −1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 95% 
CI 1.1− 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 
2 weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in t
hese hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy 
outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n  = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen ( Regan et al. 2011 ), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 
trial (n  = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen ( Cuzick et al. 2010 ), 
similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n  = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane ( Goss et al. 2013 ), mirroring neoadjuvant 
ACOSOG Z 1031 (n  = 266).  These results suggest that a biological superiority 
hypothesis generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3 −8 versus negative 
Allred score 0 −2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent 
prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial ( Ellis et al. 2008 ).  
A PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratio 
s, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent 
data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008 ).  No relapses were recorded in either 
trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_27809] 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level ≤
 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_235218].

58/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing O RR by [CONTACT_235320] 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by [CONTACT_235321], 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery.  These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3.  The concurrent acquisition of ORR 
data with these techniques, in additi on to MRI-based measures, will al
so provide 
valuable comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by [CONTACT_235322] I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012).  However, there are no established resp onse criteria
  for volumetric 
data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients ( Loo et al. 2011 ).  Additionally, 
there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volu me 
during the course of neoadjuvant treatment.  For these reasons, 
changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by [CONTACT_235323] a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.[ADDRESS_284302] been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety 
data on long-term tolerability, the recommended  single-agen
t dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage was 9-mg capsules daily. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
59/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg capsule had a cPR.  The PIK3CA  mutation status of this 
patient is unknown.  Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg  capsules , and the 
long-term safety suggests that 6 mg capsule is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study 
will utilize 6-mg GDC-0032 capsules in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg  capsules  and 
1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg  capsules . 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82−[ADDRESS_284303] on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/[ADDRESS_284304] cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability with similar efficacy  for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as 
compared with daily continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor ( Mayer et al. 2012). 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284305] been shown to 
vary among patients ( CGAN 2012 ).  Therefore, all patients may not equ ally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be evaluated to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from [ADDRESS_284306] cancer, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers ( CGAN 2012 ).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence  of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted ( Loi et al. 201
0) and stress the need to 
find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT /mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents ( Saini et al. 201
3). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep gen
ome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the tuberous sclerosis 1 ( TSC1 ) gene 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
60/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 was found in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer with a prolonged response 
(> 2 years) to everolimus as single agent ( Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional patients 
with bladder cancer treat
ed with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant 
tumors remained on therapy longer than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-[ADDRESS_284307] cancer that received an  alpha-isoform PI3K blocking agent and 
succumbed to her disease after a lasting clinical response ( Juric et al. 2015 ).  Extensive 
meta s 
tatic sampling was performed post-mortem, with the main finding being the 
emergence of molecular aberrations leading to loss of PTEN; thus, indicating a new mechanism of secondary resistance to PI3K blockade.  Similar approaches could be of 
great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/[ADDRESS_284308] cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235219].  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76915] ( Higgins et al. 2012 ).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal 
to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284309] m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared with letrozole and placebo ( Baselga et al. 2009 ).  This Day 15 biopsy will

for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 ( Wilson et al. 2012 ).  Assays 
to assess th e expressio 
n of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of patients with cancer is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008 ; Maheswaran et al. 2008 ).  Assays are available that can detect the 
major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related 
genes) in plasma, and results from this 
analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during prescreening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_284311] cancer in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in patients with early breast cancer is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
62/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes.  Samples will be used for the evaluation of genetic 
polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants, which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.  Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan ( O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006 ).  Preliminary 
results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-[ADDRESS_284312] recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of genes that may regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by [CONTACT_180277]-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
63/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.15 Rationale for Patient- Reported Outcome Assessments  
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly 
from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” ( FDA Guidance for Industry 2007 ).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  eluc idating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often a
symptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and 
compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms ( Lemieux et al. 2011 ).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23 , were selected 
because the
y were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and 
experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999; see Appendix 4).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 ( Qu
inten et al. 2009 ).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or Web-based response system (IxRS).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
69/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on 
the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1 −2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative).  If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235223], then fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) or core biopsy is required to confirm nodal status.

PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-[ADDRESS_284317] (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing).

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that [ADDRESS_284323] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
[CONTACT_097]2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential.  Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-[ADDRESS_284324] that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
73/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284325] of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of 
GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this 
protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent :  If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-[ADDRESS_284326] be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will maintain a screening log

74/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284327] reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Vital Signs eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  Oxygen saturation is obtained by [CONTACT_235326] a seated position for ≥
 5 minutes.  Obtain vital signs predose. 
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
75/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or 
abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC:  bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.[ADDRESS_284328] criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by [CONTACT_5292] (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, [ADDRESS_284329] tumor measurement by [CONTACT_4733] (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within [ADDRESS_284330] Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235224], then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF.  The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week [ADDRESS_284331] lesion is not

Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within [ADDRESS_284332] site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen–Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by [CONTACT_235328].  Guidelines regarding pathology s pecimen preparation, labeling, and review are 
outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells,  if applicable ), and 
platelet count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a ≥  10-hour fast 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
77/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be from the primary tumor (not lymph nodes) and  of good 
quality based on total and viable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior 
diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).   
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17 −18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various 
reasons (e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site 
should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, 
unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a 
surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17 −18).  Except in the case 
of pCR, every effort should be made to obtain a fresh-frozen tumor tissue 
sample at surgery.  
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In 
addition, other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K 
signaling pathways may be evaluated, including protein expression and 
molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include but are 
not limited to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• PK assessment  
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2).  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may be used for ex ploratory bi
omarker profiling, metabolite 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
78/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes 
as appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35% −40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 (helical and 
kinase domain, respectively) in the codons encoding amino acids E542, E545, and 
H1047 ( Saal et al. 2005 ).  Real-time polymerase chain react i on (RT-PCR) assays that 
amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative 
method to detect mutations from a tumor specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor 
samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include but are not limited to the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with <
 10% 
tumor content may not be evaluable for the PIK3CA  assay.  Samples will be run on  
cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation status (mutant or WT) will be made using 
appropriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by 
[CONTACT_235329] (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by [CONTACT_235330].   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by [CONTACT_235331]-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by [CONTACT_235332].  The basis of the 
technology is to immobilize small amounts of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
79/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by [CONTACT_235333] a protocol that has been validated for 
specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include but is not limited to a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], breast cancer biology, and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent.  The goal will be to determine whether the percentages of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assa y) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ 
hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
80/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by [CONTACT_17196], gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA  gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are 
somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] DL CO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO) test will be required at 
baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DL
CO test should be repeated if there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  Further 
guidance regarding DL CO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines for pneumonitis (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Osteoporosis Asses sment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency (Gaillard and Stearns 2011 ).  For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or  
fractures, or
 who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density 
assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density will be measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235226].  When either the hip or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235227] a valid skeletal site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be measured.   In some patients, measurement of the 
hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of patients w ho are at increased risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
81/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, 
current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, and conditions predisposing to secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease) (Kanis et al. 2005).   
4.5.[ADDRESS_284333] Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity.  The measure 
consist
s of “five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three 
symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” ( Aaronson et al. 1993 ).  Scale 
scores can be obtained for each of t 
he multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, 
and six single items by [CONTACT_2329] a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47− [ADDRESS_284334] cancer and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by [CONTACT_235334].  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by [CONTACT_235335], validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
82/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284335] 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by [CONTACT_121158], with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by [CONTACT_235336], storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to [ADDRESS_284336]/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_9535] (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
84/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the 
entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0.  General safety assessment s will in
clude 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate observed adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for [ADDRESS_284339] to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by [CONTACT_235337] (see Table 9).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤
 1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
85/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event 
eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_235228].

events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperglycemia 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.   
Specific dose modification and management gui delines for hyperglycemia are provided 
in Table 2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Rash 
Rash and other dermatological events should be closely monitored, and patients with 
severe rash should be monitored for associated signs and symptoms such as fever and hypotension that may be suggestive of a system ic hypersensitivity reaction.  For severe 
rash, dosing of GDC-0032/placebo  should be interrupted, and patients should be treated 
with supportive therapy per standard of care.  Use of antihistamines, as well as topi[INVESTIGATOR_90541], may be considered (see Table 4).

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Management of Diarrhea and Colitis 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the 
investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Weekly patient contact (e.g., 
telephone call) for all events of diarrhea Grades 
≥ [ADDRESS_284345] of  care.  For example, prompt management 
of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the 
approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 /placebo  for Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_284346] been reversible with corticosteroid treatment.  Prompt initiation of corticosteroids for persistent diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_235231]-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
89/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284347] been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is discouraged 
as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medica tions that exacerbate colitis are also 
recommended during colitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg  capsule  
in combination with letrozole; another patient at 6 mg capsule in combination with 
fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications 
such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids that can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5.

Patients will be monitored throughout the study treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by [CONTACT_235339], hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate criteria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for patients with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7.

5.1.6 Management of Increases in QT Interval  
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless there is a clear alternative cause for the changes: 
1. Sustained (at least two ECG measurements >
 30 minutes apart) QTcF that is 
> 500 msec and > 60 msec longer than the baseline value 
2. Sustained absolute QTcF that is > [ADDRESS_284353] arrhythmias such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving placebo during 
periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert electrophysiologic advice be sought to conf irm any ECG changes and to ascertain the

with letrozole were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea.  Clinically significant adverse events also include bone effects (osteoporosis and bone fractures) and hypercholesterolemia.  Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
There are no expected significant overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_235235]-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-[ADDRESS_284355]; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
94/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284356], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
95/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235340] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_284357] (Immediately Reportable to 
ABCSG)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235341] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest 
for this study include the following: 
• 
Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade ≥ 3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade ≥ 2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea  
• Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea for > 2 weeks after following medical management guidelines in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Grade ≥ 3 rash 
• Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis  
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver inju ry that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257]   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4− Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se
e Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_284358] dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
96/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures (Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 8 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
97/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 9): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 9 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_284360] dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_284361] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
98/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
99/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [ADDRESS_284362] associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
100/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests as Hy’s Law 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or an adverse event of 
special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This includes de 
ath attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_284363] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
101/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be 
replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25675] (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])

are met: 
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_235238] 
• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100635] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_235239] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_235240] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
102/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 [IP_ADDRESS] Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient 
responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.[ADDRESS_284364] report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_284365] report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Adverse events of special interest  (see Section 5.2.3)  
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follo w-up information for the
se events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming 
aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results • Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee,

and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
An iDMC will monitor the incidence of the above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization.  Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by [CONTACT_17628]. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
6.[ADDRESS_284374] of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 
330 patients in total.  Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available 
(unknown) for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant 
is 40%, there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical pow er in this cohort.  To ensure the study 
provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235342]3CA  MT is 40% versus 60%.  The sample size 
was calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction ( Ury and Fleiss 1980 ). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20% for ea ch a 
nalysis 
population , we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary 
endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 
[ADDRESS_284375] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only

and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is 
approximatel
y 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis and Ma 2007 ) in 
the PIK3CA MT cohort at the 4% two-sided significance level.  The minima
l detectable 
difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size 
may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.

Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_2939].  The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by [CONTACT_235343] (centrally assessed) and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_235344]3CA MT population .  Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345].  The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR.  
The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%  for each analysis 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
107/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 population .  Patients with early study termi nation and hence missing efficacy outcome 
will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_235346] (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235347]. 
 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by [CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status (centrally assessed): 
• ORR using modified RECIST criteria by [CONTACT_51856]:  clinical breast 
examination, mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (centrally derived) • Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by [CONTACT_235348] 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235349]:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by [CONTACT_235299], adjusted for tumor size and nodal status.  All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES   
Individual C max and trough plasma concentrations (C min) of GDC-0032 and letrozole from 
all patients enrolled will be reported.  Mean of trough plasma concentrations of GDC-0032 and letrozole will be tabulated.  The population pharmacokinetics of letrozole and GDC-0032 in this study will be compared with historical single-agent pharmacokinetics to assess the potential DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole in this population.   
Additional PK analyses on metabolites of GDC-0032, letrozole, and/or other concomitant 
medications may be conducted as appropriate. 
6.[ADDRESS_284379] Cancer module

All available information of all enrolled patients with all available assessments at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the iDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the iDMC at any time during the study to review safety data. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data.  The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABC SG’s data management plan and corresponding 
specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
110/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_6624]. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by [CONTACT_235351]-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by [CONTACT_235352] c linical data management.  Consequently, no 
further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible.  The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by [CONTACT_235353]. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections).  Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by [CONTACT_1720] a designee: 
• misspellings/typi[INVESTIGATOR_235242] 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
• standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard • data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a Web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receive training by [CONTACT_235354] a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at the end of the study.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
111/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
112/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284381] of this study and the distribution of

also assessments by [CONTACT_2207], 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target

BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  All baseline evaluations s hould be performed as close as possible to 
the treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_284417] cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

130/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284418] lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  Up to 
[ADDRESS_284419] may be identified as target lesions.   Per this protocol, target 
lesion #[ADDRESS_284420] be ≥ 2 cm and, if selected, target lesion #[ADDRESS_284421] be ≥ 10 mm.  A sum of 
the diameters of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, 
and lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see 
below for more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment.  The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality.  If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment timepoint, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by [CONTACT_235361].  Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on 
imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline.   Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in 
the assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions

Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
131/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 should be followed qualitatively, as descr ibed below at each response assessment 
timepoint.   
Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged • Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244] 
• Rim enhancement 
• Decreased echogenicity of cortex • Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.

132/Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284422] diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) • PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension  
 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor.  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an

133/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  A lesion identified during the 
study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.  
Table 1  Timepoint Response:  Patients with Target Lesions 
(with or without Non-Target Lesions) 
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response 
CR CR, or no non-target lesions

CR Non-CR/non-PD No PR 
CR NE No PR 
PR Any except PD No PR 
SD Any except PD No SD 
NE (Any lesion) Any except PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or no PD 
Any PD Yes or no PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; 
PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease. 
 
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response.  Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

134/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table 1.

be measured to the nearest millimeter.  If the tumor size is slig htly less than or greater than a cut-off for a given T classification, it is recommended 
that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cut-o ff.  For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is r eported as 1 mm, or a 
size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2 cm.  Designation should be made wi th the subscript "c" or "p" modi fier to indicate whether the  T classification was

Correction of Predicted DL CO for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DL CO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ATS/ERS) guidelines ( MacIntyre et al. 2005).  
The predicted DL CO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able 
to provide the value for DL CO, corrected for v a.  A single breath v a may be used to obtain 
DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DL CO, 
corrected for H b and v a: 
Predicted DL CO, corrected for H b and v a = [DL CO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 ×  Hb / 
(9.38 +  Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DL CO value (now 
corrected both for H b and v a):  
% of predicted DL CO (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DL CO / (predicted DL CO 
corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

RATIONALE 
Protocol GO28888 has been amended to include the following major changes: 
• GDC-0032 two-mg tablet formulation information has been added.  
• Information regarding the relative bioavailability of GDC-0032 capsules and tablets 
has been included.  In summary, the GDC-0032 tablet had a 1.5-fold higher drug 
exposure (area under the curve; AUC) in healthy volunteers as compared to the GDC-[ADDRESS_284459] very similar drug exposure as 
the 3-mg capsules used in previous clinical trials with GDC-0032.     
• The requirement for taking GDC-0032 on an empty stomach has been removed.  
The drug exposure (AUC) for GDC-0032 in a healthy volunteer study was not 
affected by [CONTACT_235374] a high-fat meal.   
• Management guidelines for adverse events of special interest have been updated. 
More detailed information on the dosage of recommended corticosteroids for 
diarrhea and colitis has been included.  In addition, extra language regarding 
caution with using steroids has been added.   
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

GDC 0032 is currently in Phase  I (Study  PMT4979g).  Study  PMT4979g is an open label, 
dose escalation trial using a 3  + 3 design to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of GDC 0032 administered orally daily for 28  days to patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic solid t umors and in combination with endocrine therapy in 
ER+ breast cancers.   As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of 
Study PMT4979g had been completed with 34 patients enrolled at GDC-0032 doses 
with a range of  ranging from  3  to 16 mg daily…. As of the cutoff date, a total of 
[ADDRESS_284462]  had been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts.

SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Pre liminary Pharmacokinetics 
Preliminary data f rom a healthy volunteer study showed that the 3-mg GDC-0032 
tablet produces an estimated geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 196% (177.1  − 217.0) for 
Cmax and 152.2% (141.9  − 163.2) for AUC time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-inf) when compared 
with the 3-mg Phase I capsule.   For this reason, a new 2-mg tablet has been formulated 
to deliver GDC-0032 exposure  similar to the 3-mg ca psule formulation.

SECTION 1.8:  STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Nonclinical data support… endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, 
advanced  breast cancer. 
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 
capsules in combination with letrozole… 
SECTION 2.1:  EFFICACY OBJECTIVES 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284464] criteria (Appendix 3 ) using the 
following methods… 
• Compare the centrally assessed  derived , preoperative endocrine prognostic index 
(PEPI) score upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus 
placebo. 
SECTION 3.1:  DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6  4 mg (two 2-mg 
tablets)  or placebo on a 5  − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see 
Figure 5). 
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at screening,  at Week 3  9, and prior to surgery.

of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issue s anticipated in 
this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, 
are outlined in the following sections.  
SECTION 3.3.1:  Rationale for Conduc ting the Study in the Neoadjuvant 
Setting  
Over the past [ADDRESS_284468] cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, 
HER2-enriched, and basal-like) and a Normal Breast like group  have been identified and 
intensively studied… 
SECTION 3.3.2:  Rationale  for Patient Population  
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce  confirm 
a previously identified  pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to 
an upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation 
through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop 
(Tabernero et al. 2009). 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine 
Prognostic Index Score  
In this trial, the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_235250]. 
SECTION 3.3.7:  Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules. Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 
12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1). 
In Study  PMT4979g, as of the 5  July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87  safety 
evaluable patients treated w ith single agent GDC 0032 capsules  (3  − 16 mg daily).  A 
total of 97% of patients experienced at least one  adverse event per the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version  4 (NCI  CTCAE  v4.0).  
The most frequently repo rted adverse events  of any grade , occurring in ≥ 10% safety
evaluable patients regardless of causality, were diarrhea  (55%), fatigue  (49%), 
nausea  (47%), decreased  appetite (39%), hyperglycemia (38%), vomiting  (28%), 
dizziness (22%), rash  (22%), dyspnea (1 8%), hypokalemia (18%), pyrexia  (17%), cough 
(16%), anemia (13%), dehydration  (13%), headache (13%), stomatitis  (13%), AST 
increased (12%), mucosal inflammation (12%) and pruritis (10%).   
As of [ADDRESS_284469] been treated with GDC 0032 caps ules in 
combination with endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant 
(Cohort  F) at either  6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose 
escalation in either Cohorts E or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6 mg dose level were  
enrolled to obtain more safety data on long term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the [ADDRESS_284470] one adverse event that was assessed as related 
to GDC 0032.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 7 Of the 54 patients, 17 patients were treated with GDC 0032 capsules  plus letrozole. 
Adverse events of any grade  that occurred in ≥ 10% of patients that were assessed as 
related to GDC 0032 (6mg and 9mg) were diarrhea (67%), nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), 
rash (30%), hyperglycemia (26%), decreased appetite (26%), stoma titis (26%), 
dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), vomiting (15%), pruritis 
(15%), muscle spasms (11%), dry skin (11%), and dry mouth (11%).  
SECTION 3.3.8:  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be asses sed evaluated to assess the biologic activity 
of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Secondary  Efficacy Outcome Measures

hypertension… 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  GDC-0032 and Placebo 
GDC-0032 is provided for use in clinical studies as a white, film-coated, 
immediate-release tablet formulation of 3  2 mg strength.  The tablet formulation consists 
of GDC 0032 active, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose 
sodium, magnesium stearate, and Opadry 2 white film coating.  All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_235252] (USP/NF/Ph. Eur/JP) grade with the exception of the film
coating.  The film coating consists of polyvinyl alcohol part hydrolyzed, titanium dioxide, 
polyethylene glycol 3350, and talc, and these ingredients are compendial.  
Placebo tablets will be identical in shape and color to the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032 
and will be indistinguishable from the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032.  The ingredients in 
the placebo tablets are identical to those in the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032, except for 
the absence of GDC-0032 active. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  GDC-0032 and Placebo 
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 4 6 mg (two 2-mg tablets) GDC-0032 or 
placebo on a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off for a maximum of 16 weeks.  Patients will take GDC-0032 or placebo at the same time of day
 ± 2 hours… 
Unless otherwise instructed, GDC 0032 or placebo should be taken on an empty 
stomach (i.e., approximately 1 hour before or 2  hours after a meal).  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Letrozole 
Both GDC-0032 or placebo and le trozole should be taken together (in no particular 
order) at the same time each day ±  2 hours, unless otherwise instructed.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 9 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].1  Management of Diarrhea  and Colitis 
Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade  ≤ 1.    
Steroid-responsive diarrhea and colitis have been difficult to distinguish in patients treated with GDC-0032.  All cases of colitis have been reversible with corticosteroid 
treatment.  Prompt initiation of corticosteroids for persistent diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_235253].  Patients who develop severe steroid-responsive diarrhea usually 
have been on GDC-[ADDRESS_284476] 2 months, with an average onset between 4
 − [ADDRESS_284477] been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is 
discouraged as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medications that exacerbate colitis are also recommended during colitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg in 
combination with letrozole; another patient at 6mg in combination with fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5. 
TABLE 6:  GDC-[ADDRESS_284478] changes to the protocol. 
SECTION  [IP_ADDRESS].2:  Mana gement of Colitis  
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately [ADDRESS_284479] scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has 
resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids.  
For persistent Grade  2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade  ≥ 3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work up 
(e.g.,  abdominal/ p elvis CT  scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for 
cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade  ≥ 2 colitis should be 
managed by [CONTACT_235378].  In addition, discontinuation of nonsteroidal 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284480] of care should be considered.  It is suggested 
that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol  (for IV administration) are the 
corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 
60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tap ered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine 
(or other 5 aminosalicyclic acid derivatives) may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis.  
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for colitis are provided in Table 7.

SECTION 5.1.2:  Management of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Some patients have experienced elevations of liver function tests (e.g., AST or ALT). 
Patients will be monitored throughout the st udy treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by [CONTACT_235379], hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate crit eria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for pati ents with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7. 
SECTION 5.1.3:  Management of Asymptomatic Lipase and/or Amylase 
Elevations  
Some patients treated with  GDC-[ADDRESS_284483] experienced asymptomatic lipase and/or 
amylase elevations in blood tests without any clinical or radiographic symptoms of 
pancreatitis or another clear etiology for the abnormal laboratory values.  Upon 
discussion with the Medical Monitor and after a risk-benefit assessment, investigators 
can consider continuing GDC- 0032 therapy in such patients  at the same dose or one

SECTION 5.6:  POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for adverse events after the 
end of the adverse event reporting period ([ADDRESS_284485] dose of study drug).  However, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any death, other serious adverse event, or non-serious adverse event of special interest occurring after the end of the adverse event reporting period, regardless of causality.  The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events by [CONTACT_235274] a paper Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using 
the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact [CONTACT_7171] & List of Investigators”).

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by [CONTACT_235307]-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235282]3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235283]3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
[CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284505] criteria (Appendix 3 ) using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 24 • Compare the centrally derived,  preoperative endocri ne prognostic index  (PEPI) score upon 
treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
[CONTACT_235284]. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by [CONTACT_235285] (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possibl e drug interaction between letrozole and 
GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284506] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors

assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284508] 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once  daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets)  
placebo on a 5  − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be adminis tered.  Letrozole can be continued up to 
surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_284509] ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235207] (Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by [CONTACT_1697]-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by [CONTACT_235286] 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by [CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_284510] after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within [ADDRESS_284511] observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 26 The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning the 
surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical treatment  
should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be 
established via a local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and directions 
for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be us ed to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  IRF 
procedures are detailed in the IRF charter.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat [ADDRESS_284514] on the pharmacoki netics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomita n
t use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284517] of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 
120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235293]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_284518] an absolute percenta ge increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the 
GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; 
Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance 
level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.

Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every [ADDRESS_284519] patient has completed study treatment.  
Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 
[ADDRESS_284520] either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on 
study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (f or those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by [CONTACT_235300].  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by [CONTACT_235383], the loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) and Inositol 
Polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) , or RAS mutations 
(Shayesteh et al. 1999; Cantley 2002; Massion et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.[ADDRESS_284529] frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, especially in developed countries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or upregulation of growth factor signaling pathways, such as the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to 
explore (Miller et al. 2010). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 38 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by [CONTACT_235270] (PTEN null), inactivation mutations and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235205] (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); (4) AKT1 somatic gain of function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
[CONTACT_235271]3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating 
hormonal resistance and is  a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling 
pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to hormone 
therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and 
simultaneous blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005). Importantly, a baseline protein signature [CONTACT_39299]3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 
In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 2009). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer who had experienced recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.[ADDRESS_284530] ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012). The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 39 (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in 
improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to re ceive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment 
with letrozole and either everolimus or plac ebo. The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical 
response by [CONTACT_23302], was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.[ADDRESS_284531] adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003; Scholl et al. 1994; Semiglazov et al. 2004; Fisher et al. 2012; Wolff and Davidson 2000).  The randomized studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve breast cons ervation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012).  A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies comparing adjuvant with neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease 
progression, or distant disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic 
therapy (Mauri et al. 2005).  The concept of  neoadjuvant therapy is now well established 
and a standard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative 
Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of 
clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2014 ).  The results of this meta-analysis confirmed an 
association of pathologic complete response [pCR] with favorable long-term outcomes in 
high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnit ude of pCR improvement predictive of the 
long-term survival benefits could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not 
grow as xenografts.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.[ADDRESS_284539] there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, were within the range predicted by [CONTACT_78013]. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that [ADDRESS_284540] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a PK DDI.

GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by [CONTACT_26702]/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).

overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 
1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT breast cancer patients.

All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 
2-mg tablets)  or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks 
(see Figure 5).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole 
can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.

the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, and prior to surgery.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 54 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical 
treatment  should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.

3.[ADDRESS_284556] patient in.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284557] cancer (Luminal A, Lum inal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like) have 
been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000; Sørlie et al. 2001). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, t hese groups of tumors have revealed critical 
differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast tumors are expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will 
derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005), and the form er offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing the rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006), and since the response to therapy can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013; Cortazar et al. 2012). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
Recently, everolimus was approved by [CONTACT_235388].  In 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 56 the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved 
responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, confirm a 
previously identified  pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an 
upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation 
through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop 
(Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies 
to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011); therefore, it 
is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001; Smith 
et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001). The primary endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each treatment arm with objective response as determined by [CONTACT_235313]. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by [CONTACT_235389], and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by [CONTACT_235315] a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was

trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 57 a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. 
The tumor ORR was assessed by [CONTACT_235316]. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by [CONTACT_235390] (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by [CONTACT_235318] (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007; Baselga et al. 2009).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_284559] 
lesions in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). In addition, MRI has been shown to be more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammography for measuring residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY trial (Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_235391] a co-primary endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 58 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage 
has been observed, and some patients presented sustained partial responses. As pCR is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadjuvant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011).  In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with everolimus, by [CONTACT_235392] (Ki67)
 < [ADDRESS_284560] an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p  value of <
 0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009). Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%
 ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002). In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 59 (Eiermann et al. 2001). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003). With a median follow-up of 61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2
 − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 
2 weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in these hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n
 = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 trial (n
 = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n
 = 266). These results suggest that a biological superiority hypothesis 
generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008).  A PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratios, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_27809] 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_235218].

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 60 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing O RR by [CONTACT_235320] 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by [CONTACT_235321], 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by [CONTACT_235322] I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012). However, there are no established response criteria for volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011).  Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volume during the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by [CONTACT_235323] a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.[ADDRESS_284561] been enrolled into the single-agent expansion 
cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in 
capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested 
(see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety 
data on long 
-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 61 Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg. 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82 − [ADDRESS_284562] on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/[ADDRESS_284563] cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability with similar efficacy for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as compared to daily 
continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor (Mayer et al. 2012). 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284564] been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be 
evaluated to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from [ADDRESS_284565] cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010), and stress the need to find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents (Saini et al. 2013). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 62 genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>  2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated with 
everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remained on therapy longer 
than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p  = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-[ADDRESS_284566] effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 
somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/[ADDRESS_284567] cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235219].  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76915] (Higgins et al. 2012).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284568] m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009).

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 63 3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response 
to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012).  Assays to assess the expression of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008; Maheswaran et al. 2008).  Assays are available that can detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during pre-screening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_284570] cancer patients in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in early breast cancer patients is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples will be used for the evaluation of genetic 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 64 polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, 
CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006).  Preliminary results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-[ADDRESS_284571] recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by [CONTACT_180277]-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient- Reported Outcome Assessments  
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 65 anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often asymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23, were selected 
because they were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009).

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that [ADDRESS_284582] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
[CONTACT_097]2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-[ADDRESS_284583] that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 75 4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this 
protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-[ADDRESS_284584] reasons for screening failure, as applicable.

were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 
7 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline 
should be recorded on the General Medical History and Vital Signs  eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  Oxygen 
saturation is obtained by [CONTACT_235326] a seated position for 
 ≥ 5 minutes.  Obtain vital signs predose.

Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 77 • For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.[ADDRESS_284585] criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by [CONTACT_5292] (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, [ADDRESS_284586] tumor measurement by [CONTACT_4733] (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within [ADDRESS_284587] Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235224], then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by [CONTACT_2207], or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284588] site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan

4.5.9 Surgical Specimen – Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by [CONTACT_235328]. Guidelines regarding pathology specimen preparation, labeling and review are outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet 
count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following

• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 79 • Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten 
unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for 
enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss 
with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a 
minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17
 − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• PK assessment  
 
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2).  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may be used for ex ploratory bi
omarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as appropriate. 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 80 4.5.11 Assay Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005).  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a tumor 
specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may not be evaluable for 
the PIK3CA assay. Samples will be run on  cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation 
status (mutant or WT) will be made using appr opriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by [CONTACT_235329] (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by [CONTACT_235330].   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by [CONTACT_4658], including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by [CONTACT_235333] a protocol that has been validated for specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 81 [IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 82 After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by [CONTACT_17196], gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  Further guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines for pneumonitis (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Osteoporosis Asses sment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency  
(Gaillard and Stearns 2011) .  For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or 
fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density will be measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235226].  When either the hip or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235227] a valid skeletal site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be measured.   In some patients, measurement of the 
hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of patients w ho are at increased risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
conditions predisposing to  secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature

questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993). Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, and six single items by [CONTACT_2329] a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − [ADDRESS_284591] cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by [CONTACT_235334].  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by [CONTACT_235335], validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by [CONTACT_2329] a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.

4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by [CONTACT_121158], with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by [CONTACT_235336], storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to [ADDRESS_284593]/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 86 Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for [ADDRESS_284596] to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by [CONTACT_235337] (see Table 9).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_235228].

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperglycemia 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.

etc.).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Management of Diarrhea  and Colitis  
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_284605] 2 months, with an average onset between 4
 − 6 months of treatment.  A stool cultur e is helpful in identifying concurrent 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284606] been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and 
appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is 
discouraged as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medications that exacerbate colitis are also recommended during colitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg in 
combination with letrozole; another patient at 6mg in combination with fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5.

Patients will be monitored throughout the st udy treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by [CONTACT_235379], hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate crit eria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for pati ents with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7.

Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
There are no expected significant overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_235235]-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-[ADDRESS_284614]; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284615], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 97 Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235340] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_284616] (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235273] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis  
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257]   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se
e Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_284617] dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures (Section 5.6). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 98 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 8 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Table 8 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale 
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only;

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 99 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 9): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 9 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_284619] dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_284620] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 100 If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 101 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [ADDRESS_284621] associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 102 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  as Hy’s Law  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section 5.4.2 ). This 
includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_284622] seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 103 death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be 
replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100635] 
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_235239] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_235240] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 104 [IP_ADDRESS] Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient 
responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.[ADDRESS_284623] report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_284624] report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest 
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
• Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery • Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

However, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any death, other serious adverse event, or non-serious adverse event of special interest occurring after the end of the adverse event reporting period, regardless of causality.  The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events by [CONTACT_235274] a paper Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using

6.[ADDRESS_284634] of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 
330 patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available 
(unknown) for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant 
is 40%, there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235342]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 
[ADDRESS_284635] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power 
and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled 
patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284636] an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole

If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.

Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_2939]. The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by [CONTACT_235346] (centrally assessed) and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla 
(total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_235344]3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows:

available assessments at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the IDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the IDMC at any time during the study to review safety data. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_6624]. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by [CONTACT_235351]-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 112 requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, 
dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by [CONTACT_235352] c linical data management.  Consequently, no 
further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by [CONTACT_235353]. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections).  Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by [CONTACT_1720] a designee: 
• misspellings/typi[INVESTIGATOR_235242] 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
• standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) • if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by [CONTACT_235394] a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 113 7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], 
complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
7.[ADDRESS_284642] of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc.

BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_284674] cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284675] lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to [ADDRESS_284676] may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.

Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3   132 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244] • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284677] diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3   134 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3   135 Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].

Correction of Predicted DLCO for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DLCO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ATS/ERS) guidelines (MacIntyre et al. 2005).  The predicted DLCO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H
b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able to provide the value for DLCO, corrected for v
a.  A single breath v a may be used to obtain 
DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DLCO, corrected for H
b and v a: 
Predicted DLCO, corrected for H b and v a = [DLCO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 ×  Hb / 
(9.38 +  Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DLCO value (now corrected both for H
b and v a):  
% of predicted DLCO  (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DLCO / (predicted DLCO 
corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

Protocol GO28888 has been amended to include the following major changes: 
• Language has been amended to clarify that the investigator has the sole 
responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations.  These changes 
have been incorporated into Section 4.2.3 of the study protocol.  
• Because pneumonitis is a known GDC-[ADDRESS_284714] been updated to exclude patients with diffusion capacity of 
the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values < 60% of predicted (Section 4.1.2).  
Calculations for DLCO have been included in Appendix 7.  Management guidelines 
for pneumonitis (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) have been updated to repeat the DLCO test if 
there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  The schedule of assessments has been updated to include DLCO testing at baseline and at the end of study treatment 
(Appendix 1, footnote n).  Additional language describing DLCO testing has been 
added to the study assessments in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• To ensure that the appropriate patients are enrolled into this study, exclusion criteria 
have been updated (Section 4.1.2) as follows:   
– Patients for whom upfront chemotherapy  is clinically judged appropriate as 
optimal neoadjuvant treatment will be excluded from this study.  
– Patients for whom immediate surgery is indicated will be excluded from this study. 
• Because letrozole is a potent estrogen-lowering agent, it can cause bone loss and 
may increase the risk of fractures.  Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been amended to include a baseline bone mineral density assessment and adequate monitoring of women 
with a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of 
osteoporosis.  The schedule of assessments (Appendix 1, footnote o) has been updated to reflect these changes.  In addition, protocol language has been added to 
ensure appropriate monitoring.   
• Section 4.4.2 has been amended to clarify that bisphosphonates can be used for the 
treatment of osteoporosis.   
• The list of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235256] 4.4.[ADDRESS_284715] been made to improve clarity and consistency.

• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis in patients who have been receiving them at a stable 
dose for at l east 2 weeks prior to randomization.  Patients who develop osteopenia 
or osteoporosis in the follow up period may receive bone targeted therapy as per the 
clinician’s discretion.  Primary use of bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 4 • Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenobarbital ) with GDC-0032 should be 
avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients 
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at 
baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is  clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  Further 
guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management guidelines for pneumoni tis (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Osteoporosis Assessment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in  bone loss due to estrogen deficiency.  
For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density wi ll be measured via

measured.  In some patients, measurement of the hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of  patients who are at increa sed risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory  bowel disease) (Kanis et al., 2005).   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Management of Pneumonitis 
Patients who have DLCO values  < 60% will be excluded from the study.  … The DLCO 
test should be repeated if there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  The DLCO test will also be repeated presurgery after completion of study treatment. 
TABLE 3:  Dose Modificat ion and Management Guid elines for Pneumonitis   
Table 3 has been revised to include diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) testing for managing pneumonitis.

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by [CONTACT_235307]-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235282]3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235283]3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
[CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 17 • Compare the centrally  assessed, preoperati ve endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score 
upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC- 0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
[CONTACT_235284]. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by [CONTACT_235285] (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole and GDC-
0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284734] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors

assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and

to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:[ADDRESS_284737] us either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 
5 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A maximum of 
16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_284738] ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235207] (Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by [CONTACT_1697]-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by [CONTACT_235286] 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by [CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, and 
prior to surgery. 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within [ADDRESS_284739] observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat [ADDRESS_284742] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomita n
t use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

Non-Investigational Medicinal Products  
Letrozole 
Letrozole is a marketed product  that is approved in the Euro pean Union and the [LOCATION_002] 
for the treatment of hormone receptor-positiv e breast cancer.  Based upon the different 
mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-esta blished safety profile of letrozole, there 
are no expected overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.   
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 2.5 mg letrozole for 16 weeks (o r until time of surgery 
at the investigator’s discretion).   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284745] of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 120 
patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235293]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_284746] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-
0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozol e-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and 
Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The 
minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by [CONTACT_235400]3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.

Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every [ADDRESS_284748] patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first [ADDRESS_284749] either 1) finished the 30-day follow- up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study 
for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284757] 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by [CONTACT_235300].  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by [CONTACT_235383], the loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999 ; Cantley 2002; Massion et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.[ADDRESS_284758] frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, especially in developed countries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or upregulation of growth factor signaling pathw ays, like the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to 
explore (Miller et al. 2010). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 31 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit of 
PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor suppressor 
gene PTEN, either by [CONTACT_235270] (PTEN null), inactivation mutations and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235205] (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); (4) AKT1 somatic gain of function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
[CONTACT_235271]3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and may be a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to 
hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and simultaneous blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitum or activity of either agent alone (Boulay 
et al. 2005). Importantly, a baseline protein signature [CONTACT_39299]3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 
In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 2009). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer who had experienced recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.[ADDRESS_284759] ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012). The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 32 (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in 
improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment with letrozole and either everolimus or placebo. The primary endpoi nt of the trial, clinical response by 
[CONTACT_23302], was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K.

The randomized studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve breast cons ervation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012).  A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies comparing adjuvant with neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease progression, or disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005).  The concept of neoadjuvant therapy is now well established and a standard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2012).  The results of this meta-analysis confirmed an association of pathologic complete response [pCR] with favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnit ude of pCR improvement predictive of the 
long-term survival benefits could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations ( Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the aromatase-expressing

were also observed with letrozole and fulvestrant.  Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not 
grow as xenografts.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.[ADDRESS_284769] there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, were within the range predicted by [CONTACT_78013]. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that [ADDRESS_284770] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore,

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when

2.4 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES   
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular composition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-
weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited 
to somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN expression, pro-survival pathways 
(such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, hormone receptor expression 
levels, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with GDC-0032 results in changes in 
downstream markers in tumor tissue and to examine the relationship to anti-tumor 
activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline 
biopsy and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, 
enhancement, diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor 
response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole 
and GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032 drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or 
letrozole on pharmacokinetics and response (either efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in 
letrozole plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284779] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer

Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032

the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, 
and prior to surgery.

The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
of the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and final patient decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.

The IDMC will convene for an interim safety analysis to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics after the first [ADDRESS_284783] had 30 days of follow-up.  The IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safe ty analyses with the study team.  The study 
team will share interim safety results with study investigators as needed for the conduct 
of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections.

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284784] cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) and a Normal Breast-like group have been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000; Sørlie et al. 2001). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these groups of tumors have revealed critical differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast tumors are expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005), and the form er offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing the rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006), and since the response to therapy can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013; Cortazar et al. 2012). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284785] cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal AIs. In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce a 
pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011); therefore, it is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001; Smith et 
al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001). The primary endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each treatment arm with objective response as determined by [CONTACT_235313]. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by [CONTACT_235389], and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by [CONTACT_235315] a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was [ADDRESS_284786] trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284787] cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of 
anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. The tumor ORR was assessed by [CONTACT_235316]. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by [CONTACT_235390] (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by [CONTACT_235318] (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007; Baselga et al. 2009).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_284788] 
lesions in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). In addition, MRI has been shown to be more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammography for measuring residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY trial (Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_235391] a co-primary endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 51 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage 
has been observed, and some patients presented sustained partial responses. As pCR is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadjuvant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011).  In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with everolimus, by [CONTACT_235392] (Ki67)
 < [ADDRESS_284789] an antiproliferative response, 57% of everolimus-
treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p value 
of <  0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009). Furthermore, the mean reduction in the percentage of 
Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%
 ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; p  = 0.0002). In 
the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, 
p = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and the 
combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean percentage change in 
Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 
81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 52 (Eiermann et al. 2001). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003). With a median follow-up of 61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2
 − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 2 
weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in these hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n
 = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 trial (n
 = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n
 = 266). These results suggest that a biological superiority hypothesis 
generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008).  A PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratios, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_27809] 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_235259].

(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by [CONTACT_235321], 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by [CONTACT_235322] I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012). However, there are no established response criteria for volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011).  Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volume during the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by [CONTACT_235323] a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.[ADDRESS_284790] been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested.  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
In Study PMT4979g, as of the 5 July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87 safety 
evaluable patients treated with single-agent GDC-0032 (3

endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant (Cohort F) at either 6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose escalation in  either Cohorts E 
or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6-mg dose level were enrolled to obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the [ADDRESS_284793] one adverse event that was assessed as related to GDC-0032.

Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg.

3.3.[ADDRESS_284796] been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from [ADDRESS_284797] cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010), and stress the need to find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents (Saini et al. 2013). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>
 2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remained on therapy longer 
than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-[ADDRESS_284798] effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 
somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/[ADDRESS_284799] cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235219].  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 56 The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of 
great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76915] (Higgins et al. 2012).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_284800] m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009).  This Day [ADDRESS_284801] a tumor response for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012).  Assays to assess the expression of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008; Maheswaran et al. 2008).  Assays are available that can detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation

Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples  will be used for the evaluation of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006).  Preliminary results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-[ADDRESS_284803] that they are partially metabolized by [CONTACT_235402] I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C YP3A4.  
Although in vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284804] recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by [CONTACT_180277]-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessments   
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007).  PRO measures are able to contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often asymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23, were selected 
because they were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009).

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that [ADDRESS_284815] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 68 Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
[CONTACT_097]2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-[ADDRESS_284816] that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenobarbital ) with GDC-0032 should be 
avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 induce r is co-administered with GDC-0032, 
patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 15 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 70 4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or 
abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.[ADDRESS_284818] criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by [CONTACT_5292] (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, [ADDRESS_284819] tumor measurement by [CONTACT_4733] (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within [ADDRESS_284820] Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235224], then FNA or

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 71 core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the 
eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by [CONTACT_2207], or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within [ADDRESS_284821] site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI.

The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 72 • Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a  ≥ [ADDRESS_284822] 
• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a 
central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten 
unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required 
at surgery (Weeks 17
 − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 73 • Blood for NGS (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• PK assessment  
 
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2) .  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may b e used for e
xploratory biomarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as 
appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005).  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a tumor 
specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may not be evaluable for 
the PIK3CA assay. Samples will be run on  cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation 
status (mutant or WT) will be made using appr opriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by [CONTACT_235329] (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by [CONTACT_235330].   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by [CONTACT_4658], including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 74 of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, 
multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by [CONTACT_235333] a protocol that has been validated for specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 75 [IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by [CONTACT_17196], gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is  clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235225].  Further 
guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines  f
or pneumonitis (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Osteoporosis Assessment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in  bone loss due to estrogen deficiency.  
For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density wi ll be measured via 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235226].  When either the hip or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_235227] a valid skeletal 
site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be 
measured.  In some patients, measurement of the hip alone could be sufficient. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 76 Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of  patients who are at increa sed risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory  bowel disease) (Kanis et al., 2005).   
4.5.[ADDRESS_284823] Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993). Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, and six single items by [CONTACT_2329] a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − [ADDRESS_284824] cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by [CONTACT_235334].  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by [CONTACT_235335], validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 77 mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be 
performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by [CONTACT_2329] a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
[CONTACT_235403].  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by [CONTACT_121158], with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by [CONTACT_235336], storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to [ADDRESS_284825]/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_9535] (or separate authorization for 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 78 use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], unless 
permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
4.[ADDRESS_284826] the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient • Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.[ADDRESS_284827] discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
• Disease progression • Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 79 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the 
entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for [ADDRESS_284828] to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by [CONTACT_235337] (see Table 10).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 80 GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event 
eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_235228].

events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients who received GDC-[ADDRESS_284830] a 
fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL will be excluded from the study.  HbA 1c and 
fasting glucose levels will be monitored at baseline, and additional monitoring of fasting glucose levels during the study will be implemented, as outlined in the schedule of assessments.  Patients should be instructed to report symptoms associated with hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.   
Specific dose modification and management gui delines for hyperglycemia are provided 
in Table 2.

Patients who require any daily supplemental oxygen are not eligible for the study.  
Patients who have DLCO values  < 60% will be excluded from the study.  Patients will 
be assessed for pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study.   The DLCO test 
should be repeated if there is clinical susp icion of pneumonitis.  The DLCO test will 
also be repeated presurgery after completion of study treatment.   Management

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Management of Diarrhea 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade ≤  1.   
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea are provided in

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 85 [IP_ADDRESS].2 Management of Colitis 
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately [ADDRESS_284841] scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids. 
For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade ≥  3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work-up 
(e.g., abdominal/ pelvis CT scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_284842] of care should be considered.  It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol (for IV administration) are the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tapered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine (or other 5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives)  may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis.

• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at

•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 90 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and
 seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235340] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_284848] (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)   
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235273] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 91 • Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected tr ansmission

5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3 ), and 
causality (see Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_284849] dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures ( Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 9 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 10): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 93 Table 10 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_284851] dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_284852] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 94 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 95 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [ADDRESS_284853] associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 96 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section  5.4.2 
). This includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_284854] seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions CRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.

During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fa x. In addition the serious adverse event 
and non-serious adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system. If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.

To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure   
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN   
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization. Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by [CONTACT_17628]. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284863] of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary 
endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 
patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) 
for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, 
there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235342]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_284864] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power 
and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled 
patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA MT cohort at the 4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.

6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by [CONTACT_235405] (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_235344]3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_235406]3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
• These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235347]. 
• The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients 
and separated by [CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by [CONTACT_235401], mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) • Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (centrally assessed)

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 105 7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking 
of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_6624]. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by [CONTACT_235351]-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by [CONTACT_235408]. Consequently, no further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by [CONTACT_235353]. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections). Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by [CONTACT_1720] a designee: 
• misspellings/typi[INVESTIGATOR_235242] 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 106 • standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by [CONTACT_235394] a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284870] provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
7.[ADDRESS_284871] of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_284872] to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location.

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Therefore, RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_284901] imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.[ADDRESS_284902]; primary assessments by [CONTACT_9268]; 
also assessments by [CONTACT_2207], 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by [CONTACT_51010]/or 
ultrasound 
CT = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_284903] cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284904] lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to [ADDRESS_284905] may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2   126 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244] • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284906] diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2   128 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.

PR Any except PD No PR 
SD Any except PD No SD

PD Any Yes or no PD

Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; 
PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease.  
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table 1.

Correction of Predicted DLCO  for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DLCO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ATS/ERS) gu idelines (MacIntyre et al. 2005).  
The predicted DLCO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able 
to provide the value for DLCO, corrected for v a.  A single breath v a may be used to 
obtain DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DLCO, corrected for H
b and v a: 
Predicted DLCO, corrected for H b and v a = [DLCO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 × Hb / 
(9.38 + Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DLCO value (now corrected both for Hb and v
a):  
% of predicted DLCO (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DLCO / (predicted 
DLCO corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by [CONTACT_235307]-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235282]3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235283]3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
[CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 13 • Compare the centrally  assessed, preoperati ve endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score 
upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC- 0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
[CONTACT_235284]. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by [CONTACT_235285] (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole and GDC-
0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-[ADDRESS_284960] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors

assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and

to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:[ADDRESS_284963] us either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 
5 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A maximum of 
16 weeks of GDC-0
032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the 
investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_284964] ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235267] ( Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultra
sound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by [CONTACT_1697]-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by [CONTACT_235286] 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by [CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of 
the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, and 
prior to surgery. 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within [ADDRESS_284965] observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  
A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be 
continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+  1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat [ADDRESS_284968] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to 
randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis in patients who have been receivin g them at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks 
prior to randomization.  Patients who develop osteopenia or osteoporosis in the follow-up 
period may receive bone-targeted therapy as per the clinician’s discretion.  Primary use of 
bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone metastasis or as a prevention of bone loss is prohibited.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-[ADDRESS_284969] patient has her postsurgery visit.

Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 120 
patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235412]-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 20 PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_284971] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-
0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozol e-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and 
Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The 
minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by [CONTACT_235400]3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235295]. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by [CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by [CONTACT_235401], mammography and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to surgery 
(centrally assessed) 
• PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by [CONTACT_235292] 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR in cluding the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR). 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235297]: ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by [CONTACT_235299], 
adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All se condary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided 
type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every [ADDRESS_284972] patient has completed study treatment.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 21 Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first [ADDRESS_284973] either 1) finished the 30-day follow- up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study 
for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_284980] 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by [CONTACT_235300].  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007 [29]).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α 
subunit of PI3K are commonly found in solid and
 hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997 
[38]).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numerous types of cancer by 
[CONTACT_235413],  t
he loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), 
or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999 [ 58]; Cantley 2002 [ 11]; Massion et al. 2004 
[42]; Wu et al. 2005 [ 68]). 
1.[ADDRESS_284981] frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011 [ 34]).  As a large proportion of breast cancer 
cases, espe cially in developed coun
tries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are 
amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011 [15]).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary 
hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER 
expression, 
or upregulation of growth fact or signaling pathways, like the epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009 [ 35]). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to explore (Miller et al. 2010 [47]). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 27 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ s ubtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012 [ 10]).  
Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding th e alpha cata
lytic subunit of 
PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005 [ 52]; Wu et al. 2005 [68]); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by [CONTACT_235414] 
(PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235205] (García et al. 2004 [ 27]); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007 [ 9]); (4) 
AKT1 somatic gain of fu nction mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 
 2008 [ 61]) and AKT2 
amplifications (Bellacosa  et al. 1995 [ 7
]). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast 
cancers can have some form of mole cular aberra
tion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
(CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
[CONTACT_235271]3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and may be a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to 
hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007 [ 53]), and simultaneous blocking of the PI 3K/AKT/mTOR pathwa y
  with everolimus 
and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005 [8]). Importantly, a baseline protein signature [CONTACT_39299]3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after a djuvant endocrine thera

In the clinical  setting, 
impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 
2009 [6]). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients wit 
h ER+ advanced breast cancer who had 
experienced recurrence or progression while  receiving previous therapy with a 
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the everolimus group was 6.[ADDRESS_284982] ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the 
investigator’s assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase 
II TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012 [ 4]). 
The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 28 everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
(HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast 
cancer were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment with 
letrozole an 
d either everolimus or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical 
response by [CONTACT_23302], was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009 [ 62]). This finding suggests 
that alternative pharmacologic strate gies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream 
of AKT should be pursue 
d.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway at the level of PI3K.

al. 2004 [ 57]; Fisher et al. 2012 [ 26]; Wolff and Davidson 2000 [ 67]).  The randomized

shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve br e 
ast conservation rates, decreasing the 
number of women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007 [ 46]; Fisher et al.

neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer
 showed no difference in rates of death, 
disease progression, or disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 [ 43]).  The concept of neoadjuvant therapy is now well 
established and a stand ard treatment option for 
patients with early breast cancer.  The 
Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2012 [ 12]).  The results of this 
meta-analysis confirmed an association of pathologic comple te response

favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnitude of pCR improvement predictive of the long-term surv ival benefits could not be determined.  In

GDC-0032 and endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone 
caused growth inhibitio n (50% effective concen
tration [EC 50]  = 95 nM). Effects on growth 
were also observed with letrozole and fulvestrant.  Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.[ADDRESS_284992] there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008 [3]). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, w
ere within the 
range predicted by [CONTACT_78013]. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that [ADDRESS_284993] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore,

of a PK DDI.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by [CONTACT_26702]/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when

Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 in 
combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT breast cancer patients.

Due to the need to develop improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235216]2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/[COMPANY_002]

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 37 2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 EFFICACY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to eval uate the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo in women with ER+/HER2- early stage breast cancer, as 
measured by [CONTACT_235307]-primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by [CONTACT_235281] (MRI) via modified Respons e Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  MT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0) by [CONTACT_235308]3CA  MT patients  
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor ORR, assessed by [CONTACT_235387] (RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients

assessed ORR using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) • Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus 
GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo fr om baseline to Week 3; baseline to 
surgery; and Week 3 to surgery  
• Compare the centrally assessed, pr eoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) 
score upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as 
measured by [CONTACT_235284]. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR).

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 38 2.3 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME OBJECTIVES 
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, 
and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between treatment arms as measured by 
[CONTACT_223229] (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cance r Module 
(QLQ-BR23) 
2.4 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES   
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular composition as assessed by [CONTACT_35774]-
weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited 
to somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN expression, pro-survival pathways 
(such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, hormone receptor expression 
levels, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with GDC-0032 results in changes in 
downstream markers in tumor tissue and to examine the relationship to anti-tumor 
activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline 
biopsy and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, 
enhancement, diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor 
response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole 
and GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032 drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or 
letrozole on pharmacokinetics and response (either efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in 
letrozole plus GDC-[ADDRESS_285002] of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285003] of care assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed 
within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032
 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued 
up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.

Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by [CONTACT_235311][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
[CONTACT_100694], Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, 
and prior to surgery. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 43 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
of the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and final patient decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a

The IDMC will convene for an interim safety analysis to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics after the first [ADDRESS_285006] had 30 days of follow-up.  The IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safe ty analyses with the study team.  The study 
team will share interim safety results with study investigators as needed for the conduct 
of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285007] cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) and a Normal Breast-like group have been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000 [49]; Sørlie et al. 2001 [ 60]). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these 
groups of tumors have revealed critical diffe rences in inciden
ce, survival, and response 
to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further  sub-classifications of breast tumors are 
expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 [ 43]), and the former offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing t
he rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006 [ 13]), and since the response to therapy 
can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadju v
ant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, 
usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013 [ 64]; Cortazar et al. 2012 [ 12]). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285008] cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal AIs. In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 [6]). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of t he 
pAKT, resulting in feedb
ack PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009 
[62]). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to shut down the 
pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies 
is to inhibit the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011 [ 55]); therefore, it is 
hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadju
vant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]; 
Smith et al. 2005 [59]; Ellis et al. 2011 [ 23]). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]). The primary 
endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each trea tment arm with object
ive 
response as determined by [CONTACT_235313]. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by [CONTACT_235389], and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by [CONTACT_235315] a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was 66 
days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285009] trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. The tumor ORR was assessed by [CONTACT_235316]. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by [CONTACT_235390] (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by [CONTACT_235318] (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 [21]; Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_285010] 
lesions 
in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009 [ 19]). In addition, MRI has been shown to be 
more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammo
graphy for measuring 
residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006 [2]; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002 [ 5]; Yeh et al. 2005 [ 69]), including the I-SPY trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 47 (Hylton et al. 2012 [ 32]).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_235319] a co-primary endpoint for this trial.
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013 [ 64]).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is  an unlikely event.  For instance, in t
he 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage has been ob served, and some patients presented
 sustained partial responses. As pCR 
is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011 [17]). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadju v
ant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of 
endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis et al. 2011 [ 23]).  
In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with ever olimu s
, by [CONTACT_235415] (Ki67)  < [ADDRESS_285011] an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p  value of <
 0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]). Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in 
the everolimus-treated p
atients (90.7%  ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002). In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 48 The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the t amoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003 [ 20]). With a median follow-up of 
61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associat ed 
with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the 
Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2  − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 2 
weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in t
hese hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy 
outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n  = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011 [ 51]), similar to the neoadjuvant 
P024 trial (n  = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was 
better than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010 [14]), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial 
(n = 7,576) showed similar efficacy of anastr ozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013 
[30]), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n  = 266). These results suggest that a 
biological superiority hypothesis generat ed by a neoadjuvant study may help the design 
of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008 [22]).  A PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according 
to their associated hazard ratios, wa s developed and subseq
uently validated in an 
independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_27809] 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in 
the rare patient with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_235259].

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 49 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing O RR by [CONTACT_235320] 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by [CONTACT_235321], 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by [CONTACT_235322] I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012 [ 32]). However, there are no established response criteria for 
volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to  
volumetric data based o
n a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of 
tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011 [ 40]).  
Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular 
range in cha nge in tumor volume duri
ng the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these 
reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by [CONTACT_235323] a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.[ADDRESS_285012] been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested.  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
In Study PMT4979g, as of the 5 July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87 safety 
evaluable patients treated with single-agent GDC-0032 (3
 − 16 mg daily).  A total of 97%

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285013] one adverse event per the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  The most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in ≥
 10% safety-evaluable patients 
regardless of causality, were diarrhea (55%), fatigue (49%), nausea (47%), decreased appetite (39%), hyperglycemia (38%), vomiting (28%), dizziness (22%), rash (22%), dyspnea (18%), hypokalemia (18%), pyrexia (17%), cough (16%), anemia (13%), dehydration (13%), headache (13%), stomatitis (13%), AST increased (12%), mucosal inflammation (12%) and pruritis (10%).   
As of [ADDRESS_285014] been treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant (Cohort F) at either 6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose escalation in  either Cohorts E 
or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6-mg dose level were enrolled to obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the [ADDRESS_285015] one adverse event that was assessed as related to GDC-0032.  
Of the 54 patients, 17 patients were treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole. Adverse 
events that occurred in ≥
 10% of patients that were assessed as related to GDC-0032 
(6mg and 9mg) were diarrhea (67%), nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), rash (30%), hyperglycemia (26%), decreased appetite (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), vomiting (15%), pruritis (15%), muscle spasms (11%), dry skin (11%), and dry mouth (11%). 
Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg. 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time

PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/[ADDRESS_285017] cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 51 with similar efficacy for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as compared to daily 
continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor (Mayer et al. 2012 [ 45]). 
3.3.[ADDRESS_285018] been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from [ADDRESS_285019] cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010 [ 39]), and stress the need 
to find innovative and robust predictive biomarkers to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
inhibiting a
gents (Saini et al. 2013 [ 54]). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep gen
ome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>
 2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012 [ 33]).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated 
with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remai ned on therapy 
longer than t
hose with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p  = 0.004), suggesting that 
mTORC-[ADDRESS_285020] effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when 
analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/[ADDRESS_285021] cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235219].  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 52 The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of 
great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76915] (Higgins et al. 2012 [ 31]).  The neoadjuvant setting is 
ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_285022] m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).

for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012 [ 66]).  
Assays to assess the expression of 
soluble,  systemic cytokines and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008 [16]; Maheswaran et al. 2008 [ 41]).  Assays are available that can 
detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285024] cancer patients in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in early breast cancer patients is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples  will be used for the evaluation of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006 [ 48]).  Preliminary 
results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-[ADDRESS_285025] that they  are partially 
metabolized by [CONTACT_235402] I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C YP3A4.  
Although in 
vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of 
the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285026] recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by [CONTACT_180277]-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessments   
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007 [ 24]).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often a s 
ymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and 
compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011 [ 37]).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23 , were selected 
because the
y were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and 
experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009 [ 50]).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 60 4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on 
the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1-2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative). If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235223], then fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) or core biopsy is required to confirm nodal status. 
 
4.2.3 Blinding  
Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment of GDC-0032 or 
placebo. 
If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse 
event for which patient management might be affected by [CONTACT_120373]), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by [CONTACT_235416].  Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations where unblinding is needed for treatment decisions.  Effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_235417].  Patient treatment assignment may be unblinded at the time the patient discontinues from the blinded treatment phase at the request of the treating physician by [CONTACT_235418].  Unblinding during the study will result in the withdrawal of a patient from the study.  For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by [CONTACT_72952], the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions that are considered by [CONTACT_120374].  
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial.  The PK assay group will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate 
PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-[ADDRESS_285030] (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). 
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that [ADDRESS_285036] on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
[CONTACT_097]2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285037] that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topi[INVESTIGATOR_4575] (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis in patients who have been receiving them at a stable 
dose for at least 2 weeks prior to random ization.  Patients who develop osteopenia 
or osteoporosis in the follow-up period may receive bone-targeted therapy as per 
the clinician’s discretion.  Primary us e of bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone 
metastasis or as a prevention of bone loss is prohibited.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions.

nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 66 As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.[ADDRESS_285039] criteria (see Appendix 3).

also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within [ADDRESS_285041] Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235224], then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285042] MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by [CONTACT_2207], or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within [ADDRESS_285043] site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen – Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by [CONTACT_235328]. Guidelines regarding pathology specimen preparation, labeling and review are outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet 
count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 68 • Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a  ≥ [ADDRESS_285044] 
• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a 
central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for 
enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss 
with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a 
minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required 
at surgery (Weeks 17  − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by [CONTACT_31665]) 
• PK assessment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 69 Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2) .  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may b e used for e
xploratory biomarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as 
appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005 [52]).  Real-time polymerase chain reacti on (RT-PCR) assays tha 
t amplify exons that are commonly 
mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a 
tumor specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G /D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, 
H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may 
not be evaluable for the PIK3CA  assay. Samples will be run on cobas z480 analyzer, 
and PIK3CA  mutation status (mutant or WT) will be made using appropriate cutoffs and 
automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by 
[CONTACT_235329] (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by [CONTACT_235330].   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by [CONTACT_4658], including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 70 [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by [CONTACT_235333] a protocol that has been validated for 
specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 71 [IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by [CONTACT_17196], gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.[ADDRESS_285045] Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993 [ 1]). Scale scores can 
be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL 
scale, and six 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285046] validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − [ADDRESS_285047] cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by [CONTACT_235334].  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by [CONTACT_235335], validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by [CONTACT_2329] a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
[CONTACT_235403].  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by [CONTACT_121158], with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285048]/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_9535] (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
4.[ADDRESS_285049] the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient 
• Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.[ADDRESS_285050] discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 74 • Disease progression 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for [ADDRESS_285051] to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by [CONTACT_235337] (see Table 10).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 75 Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_235228].

events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients who received GDC-[ADDRESS_285053] a 
fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL will be excluded from the study.  HbA 1c and 
fasting glucose levels will be monitored at baseline, and additional monitoring of fasting glucose levels during the study will be implemented, as outlined in the schedule of assessments.  Patients should be instructed to report symptoms associated with hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]) can be used.  Extra caution should be used

etc.).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Management of Diarrhea 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade ≤  1.   
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea are provided in

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 80 [IP_ADDRESS].2 Management of Colitis 
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately [ADDRESS_285065] scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids. 
For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade ≥  3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work-up 
(e.g., abdominal/ pelvis CT scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_285066] of care should be considered.  It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol (for IV administration) are the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tapered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine (or other 5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives)  may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis.

• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 85 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and
 seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235340] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_285072] (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)   
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_235273] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 86 • Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected tr ansmission

5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se e 
Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_285073] dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures ( Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 9 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 10): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 88 Table 10 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_285075] dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_285076] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 89 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 90 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [ADDRESS_285077] associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 91 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section  5.4.2 
). This includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_285078] seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions CRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.

During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fa x. In addition the serious adverse event 
and non-serious adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system. If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.

To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure   
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
An IDMC will monitor the incidence of t he above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN   
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization. Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by [CONTACT_17628]. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285087] of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary 
endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 
patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) 
for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, 
there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by [CONTACT_235342]3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980 [ 63]). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-side d 
significance 
level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, 
respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately [ADDRESS_285088] an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 [ 21]) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 
80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for 
ORR is approximately 1
5%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 
[21]) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the  4% two-sided significan
 ce level.  The minimal 
detectable difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.

6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by [CONTACT_235405] (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_235344]3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_235406]3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235419]. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by [CONTACT_23587]3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by [CONTACT_235401], mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) • Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by [CONTACT_235407]-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 98 • Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_235349]:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_235345]; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by [CONTACT_235299], adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 100 7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking 
of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_6624]. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by [CONTACT_235351]-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by [CONTACT_235408]. Consequently, no further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by [CONTACT_235353]. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections). Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by [CONTACT_1720] a designee: 
• misspellings/typi[INVESTIGATOR_235242] 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 101 • standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by [CONTACT_235394] a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285094] provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
7.[ADDRESS_285095] of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_285096] to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location.

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Therefore, RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_285121] imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.[ADDRESS_285122]; primary assessments by [CONTACT_9268]; 
also assessments by [CONTACT_2207], 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by [CONTACT_51010]/or 
ultrasound 
CT = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_285123] cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285124] lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to [ADDRESS_285125] may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 121 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244] • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

Protocol GO28888, Version [ADDRESS_285126] diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 123 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.  
Table 1  Timepoint Response:  Patients with Target Lesions 
(with or without Non-Target Lesions) 
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response

CR Non-CR/non-PD No PR 
CR NE No PR 
PR Any except PD No PR 
SD Any except PD No SD 
NE (Any lesion) Any except PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or no PD 
Any PD Yes or no PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; 
PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease.  
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.  
Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table 1.

that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cut-o ff.  For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is r eported as 1 mm, or a 
size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2 cm.  Designation should be made wi th the subscript "c" or "p" modi fier to indicate whether the  T classification was

pre-therapy evaluation showed no metastases is considered progre ssion of disease.  If a patient was designated to have detectab le 
distant metastases (M1) before chemotherapy, the patient will be designated as M1 throughout.

Note: Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studi es reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided that  the studies are 
carried out within [ADDRESS_285162]-neoadjuvant therapy is designated with "y c" or "yp" prefix.  Of note, no stage group is assigned if there is a complete pa thologic response (CR) 
to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0cM0.   
a T1 includes T1mi.   
b T0 and T1 tumors with nodal micrometastases only are excluded from Stage IIA and are classified Stage IB.   
c M0 includes M0(i+); The designation pM0 is not valid; any M0 should be clinical.  If a patient presents with M1 prior to NAST,  the stage is 
considered Stage IV and remains Stage IV regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy.

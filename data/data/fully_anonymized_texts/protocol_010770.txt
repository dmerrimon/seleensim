2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent class of dementing illness, is a leading cause of death and affects 
over [ADDRESS_931718] dementing illnesses, AD cannot be effectively prevented and is 
incurable. Progressive memory loss and impairment of reasoning and judgment are its main symptoms.2 For this 
reason, people in the early stages of AD are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still competent to appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP discussions with the 
surrogate.
3,4 Yet only a minority (39%) of older adults with early cognitive impairment complete any form of ACP 
following the diagnosis.[ADDRESS_931719] common type o f ACP is completing a medical power of attorney or living will, which does not require 
the patient and/or the family to understand the complexity of the medical decision -making process faced by [CONTACT_687464]. The failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e., before loss of decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences with the greatest impact on the surrogate. As a matter of course in AD, family members are left to make dec isions 
regarding care transition, tube feeding, and other life -sustaining treatment without input from the patient and in 
the absence of a full understanding of the wishes, values and preferences of the patient.
6-[ADDRESS_931720] an 
efficacious ACP intervention, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]  (Sharing Patient’s Illness Representations to I ncrease Trust), with patients 
with mild AD and their surrogates (NIH Stage I behavioral intervention development
24 in PAS -17-027) to promote 
open, honest discussions while such discussions about end -of-life care are possible. SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644956] a brief, scalable 
patient - and family -centered ACP intervention based on the Representati onal Approach to Patient Education25,[ADDRESS_931721] decade, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687392] 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to establish feasibility, patient -surrogate acceptability, and efficacy in patient populations, including end -stage renal disease, 
advanced heart failure, and cardiac surgery.
27-32 Patients and surrogates who received SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687393] -of-life decision making : a) increase in patient and 
surrogate agreement on end -of-life care goals, b) reduction in patient’s conflict about benefits and burdens of life -
sustaining treatments, and c) increase in surrogate confidence about the surrogate role, which in turn resulte d in 
decreased post -bereavement psychological distress for surrogates. We designed SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687394] a testable model of 
how end -of-life care discussions could occur between patient and surrogate. The facilitated discussions are 
structured to address each individu al’s representations of (i.e., beliefs about) the illness and views of life -
sustaining measures at the end of life. The overall goal  of this project is to produce an effective and maximally 
implementable ACP intervention for patients with mild AD and their surrogates. Collaboration with researchers 
from NIH -funded AD research centers will set the stage for a future implementation study that could lead to 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14

 improvements in patient - and family -centered outcomes at end of life.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
At the end of life,  many patients with dementing illnesses receive burdensome interventions with no clear 
therapeutic benefits.  AD and related dementias (ADRD) are the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. with no 
effective treatment.2,[ADDRESS_931722] is high (median survival=1.3 years34-36); most die 
after acute illnesses, such as pneumonia or a febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_687395] “devastating ” complications such as 
stroke or heart attack.[ADDRESS_931723], intensive or burdensome end -of-life care is common. 
Nearly 41% undergo at least one intensive intervention (e.g., tube feeding, mechanical ventilation) in the last 3 months of life, which may prolong life but not address quality of life (or quality of dying).
34,35,37,[ADDRESS_931724] is a terminal disease.
37 Since 2000, the use of mecha nical ventilation for Medicare 
beneficiaries with advanced dementia has been doubled without any measurable survival benefit.39 The great 
challenge to the medical community is to prepare patients and families for very complicated end -of-life scenarios 
rife with medical decision making in the context of the patients’ progressive loss of cognitive fu nctioning and 
selfhood.  
 
Most patients with mild AD and their surrogates miss the window of opportunity for meaningful ACP. Merely completing legal documents to indicate one’s preferences for medical care does not adequately improve end -of-
life care because family members often do not know or agree with the content of the directive, or do not know how to translate vague preferences into specific treatments at end of life
40; and legally appointed surrogates lack 
knowledge of patients’ wishes and are poorly prepared for emotional turmoil during end -of-life decision 
mak ing.21,[ADDRESS_931725], a process of developi[INVESTIGATOR_687396] a patient’s wishes 
based on discussions about ones values and illness representations can result in high quality ACP that improves quality of life during the end of life and, importantly in AD, and reduce stress for surrogates and caregivers. The practice of ACP has evolved to focus on psychological and practical preparation of patients and surrogates for treatment decision -making at the end of life.
28,42-48 For example, for patients, ACP can involve exploring the 
personal meaning of illness and gaining knowledge about illness progression; for surrogates, ACP can involve gaining an understanding of the patient’s values and goals for end -of-life care and of the role and responsibilities 
of being a surrogate.
28,49 The objective of a patient- centered ACP process is to prepare a surrogate to execute the 
patient’s wishes rather than simply react based on the instructions in an advance directive.  
 
Per usual care , clinicians advise people with early cognitive impairment and their families to complete an adv ance 
directive at the time of diagnosis. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this involves providing the patient and family a brief information about how to prepare advance directives. Research has shown that only a minority of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild A D complete an advance directive after the initial diagnosis (39%), and if advance 
directives are not completed during the early stages of cognitive impairment, it is unlikely that this will happen as the patient progresses into an advanced stage.
5 There are numerous AD su pport groups around the nation. These 
support groups may be one location to focus attention on ACP and financial planning (and thus are often led by a lawyer rather than a clinician) and provide important legal and technical information and social support.  However, 
a meta -analysis of interventions with dementia caregivers suggests that those types of support groups do not 
effectively accomplish the goals of ACP described above.
50   
 
There are several reasons that patients with mild AD do not engage in ACP discussions or complete an advance directive. Remaining functional independence in patients with mild AD may mask troubling declines in cognitive symptoms (e.g., memory lapses, impaired ability to plan complex activities).
51 As a result, the patient and family 
members may not appreciate the need or urgency for preparing for future medical care, including end -of-life 
care.52 Patients and/or their families may be unwilling to believe that the patient will progress to an advanced 
stage, unaware of the progressive nature and terminality of AD, adopt a passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_687397] (e.g., future is fated 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020

 and cannot change), want to delay until a dire medical event presents itself (e.g., critical illness), or 
underappreciate the end -of-life decision making burden on family members.3,52-55 A typi[INVESTIGATOR_687398], invasive, and expensive medical interventions is left to unprepared surrogates and/or clinicians who are likely unaware of the patient’s preferences.
19,56,[ADDRESS_931726] shown that many s urrogates lack an understanding of 
the patient’s preferences (assessed by [CONTACT_687465]), yet report a high level of confidence in understanding patients’ wishes and high confidence that they  will be able to execute their role as a surrogate.
[ADDRESS_931727] brought on by [CONTACT_645142] (e.g., whether to withhold 
or withdraw mechanical ventilation, or other life -sustaining measures that are deemed futile); regrets over missed 
opportunities to benefit from palliative care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]; excessive distress for family members during decision making due to interfamily conflict and anguish, time pressure to make important decisions, lack of knowledge about options; and psychosocial sequelae for family members (e.g., depressio n, anxiety, and post -traumatic stress 
disorder) and complicated bereavement after the patient’s death.
11,17,21,59-68  
 
Numerous studies, including those of dementia patients, indicate that families experience greater difficulty in decision making when they are uncertain about the patient’s wishes , when they feel unprepare d for their role  
because they have never discussed it, and when they are called on to make decisions in a short period of time.12-19 
Dementia family members with a greater sense of burden for decision making are more likely to consent to life -
sustaining treatment .20 There is a high rate of psychiatric illness among family decision makers; in one study of ICU 
family members, nearly 40% of those who experienced a loved one’s death during the previous [ADDRESS_931728] one psychiatric illness meet ing DSM -IV criteria, such as anxiety disorder or major depression.
68 Even 
at 6-12 months after the patient’s death, studies show that family members experience intrusive thoughts of 
regret, guilt or search for evidence that they made the right decision.16,17,21-23 
 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192], a patient - and family -centered ACP, has documented beneficial effects on a range of psychosocial 
outcomes for patients and their surrogates. The goal of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644945] -of-life decision making for patients with a serious or life -threatening illness and their surrogates. SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687399].
25,26 This approach melds two theories: Leventhal’s 
common sense model [ADDRESS_931729] representations of their illness or health problems. Representations are based on an individual’s experiences, cultural traditions, or media, and may not be medically accurate. It is critical to  understand a 
patient’s representations because they filter new learning: representations serve as the cognitive framework that affects whether or not individuals accept or reject new information,
[ADDRESS_931730] to elicit the patient’s existing illness representations before providing new information.
25,[ADDRESS_931731], the patient, and his/her surrogate have an opportunity to recognize 
gaps or confusions, and the interventionist can give new information  that is specific and relevant, increasing the 
likelihood that it will be acted upon.  
 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644956] a two -session, [ADDRESS_931732] follows six steps: 1) assess illness presentation, 2) identify gaps and concerns, 3) create 
conditions for conceptual change, 4) introduce replacement information, 5) summarize, and 6) set goals and plan.
[ADDRESS_931733] establishes an understanding of the cognitive, emotional and spi[INVESTIGATOR_644957]’s 
representation of (ideas about) his/her illness. This understanding enables the interventionist to provide 
individualized  medical information and to assist the patient in examining his/her own values related to life -
sustaining treatment at the end of life. In this way, the patient can more readily express his/her treatment 
preferences to the surrogate. SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687400]’s illness experiences and values and to be prepared for the responsibility and emotional turmoil that can arise during decision making at the end of life. Each element of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687401] a uthenticity of exchanges 
between patient and surrogate about experiences surrounding illness and values. During the process, the patient discovers his/her own representations about illness and examines thresholds and/or conditions for withholding or (dis)continuing life support measures. The surrogate also validates similarities or differences with the patient in regard to life support measures and examines his/her own ability to follow the patient’s wishes. This process is critical to preparation for end-of- life decision making.
30,75 To deliver SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644968], interventionists are trained in 
communication skills and end -of-life planning.  
 
Preliminary data on the efficacy of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]:  Over a decade, we have iteratively tested SPI[INVESTIGATOR_645045] 5 RCTs to establish feasibility, patient -surrogate acceptability, and efficacy in: patients undergoing major cardiac surgery who were 
“otherwise healthy,” seri ously ill patients with end -stage renal disease (ESRD), and elderly patients with advanced 
heart failure who had a left ventricular assisted device implanted.
27-32 Over the course of these studies, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687402], to tailor content while maintaining theoretical core 
elements responsible for patient and surrogate outcomes, language complexity (current literacy level at Flesch -
Kincaid grade=7), and the number of sessions  (1-2 sessions). SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687403].75 All studies were in outpatient care settings (both academic and community 
settings). Importantly, in the study with patients undergoing major cardiac surgery, we demonstrated that a SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687404]’ anxiety in spi[INVESTIGATOR_687405]’ concerns and efforts to avoid such discussions.
[ADDRESS_931734] consistently been >80% with very low dropout (<4%) even in an RCT requiring long- term follow up (12 months).  
 
In a full-scale multicenter RCT of patients with ESRD and their surrogates (R01NR011464), we tested the efficacy of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687406] (wait -list control) in preparation for end -of-life decision -making. At 2, 6, and [ADDRESS_931735] , and surrogate decision -making confidence

[ADDRESS_931737] patient’s death). Dyads (N=210) of seriously ill dialysis patients and their surrogates from 20 free -standing dialysis facilities (mean age 62, 57% women, 67% African Americans) were randomized to 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644964]. ITT analysis showed that, adjusting for time and baseline values, dyad congruence on goals of 
care ( OR=1.89 [95% CI , 1.1 to 3.3]; p=.029) and surrogate decision- making confidence ( β=0.13 [ CI, 0.01 to 0.24]; 
p=.027) were significantly better in the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687407]. Patient decisional conflict was significantly lower in SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644965] 
12 months ( β=-0.19 [ CI, -0.33 to -0.04]; p=.011).  
 
Mortality rates between the groups were similar. Among 45 
bereaved surrogates, adjusting for time and baseline values, those in SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687408] ( β=-1.13 [ CI, -2.23 to -0.03]; 
p=.044), depression ( β=-2.54 [ CI, -4.34 to - 0.74]; p=.006), and 
post -traumatic distress ( β=-5.75 [ CI, -10.9 to -0.64]; p=.027)

bereavement interviews with surrogates ( Box 1 ) helps explain 
how SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644967]’ post -bereavement distress.

Protocol  7.15.[ADDRESS_931739] -bereavement distress for surrogates, because such efforts are not feasible in this 5 -year study due 
to the protracted nature of AD trajectories (i.e., death is not imminent). Instead, we will evaluate whether SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687409] s in an embodiment of the patient’s wishes (i.e., advance directives) by [ADDRESS_931740] shown the feasibility of consenting patients with mild AD 
(defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score 12 -17 or a Mini -Mental State Examination [MMSE] 
score 18 -23;) for research and the feasibility of survey completion.3,[ADDRESS_931741] step of the proposed study is to carefully modify SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687410], their surrogates, and clinicians while maintaining the integrity of the intervention to achieve the desired patient and surrogate outcomes (i.e., the theoretical core elements),

At this time our plan is to accomplish the goals of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687411] (as in the original version of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]) rather than two (which was used in recent RCTs) because patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_687412] f or their next 
medical visit before 6 months. The content of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192], such as likely situations requiring surrogate decision making and end -of-life treatment, will be tailored to the AD context. Also, we will modify the delivery of content to 
incorporate tec hniques such as reducing information load by [CONTACT_687466], 
offering repetition of material, opportunity for rehearsal, and using targeted questioning to verify adequate 
comprehension prior to eliciting preferences for goals of care.
90-92 The feasibility of using these so -called 
“enhanced consent techniques” for people with early cognitive impairment has been demonstrated83 and will be 
applied to the adapted intervention.  
 
Another important modification will be to develop and test SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote , a fa ce-to-face delivery of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687413] -based videoconferencing to facilitate wider future implementation. Videophone technology has 
been shown to capture critical, nonverbal communication necessary for psychoeducational interventions and is as 
effective  as in -person delivery, with an additional benefit of reaching people in urban and rural areas with 
transportation challenges.93-95 [CONTACT_48467] (Co -I) transformed an evidence -based intervention originally delivered

Role of and ethical consideration of a one- time intervention in ACP.   Hirschman et al.97 found  that as patients’ 
cognitive impairment progresses to an advanced stage, family members used the ‘best interest standard’ (decision making based on what a reasonable person would do) more often than ‘substituted judgement’ (decision making based on what my  loved one would have wanted), raising ethical questions about whose 
preferences are reflected in decisions. Furthermore, the primary reason for using the best interest standard was that there had been no previous discussion about the patient’s preferences .
98 This highlights the value of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687414].

 progresses to an adv anced stage. It can facilitate open discussion about the trajectory of dementia, offer a deeper 
understanding about the patient’s values, goals of care, and possible future treatment choices. It can help family 
members understand their role in decision making. While there are interventions (e.g., decision aids) targeting surrogates of nursing home residents with advanced dementia

2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644977]. The proposed trial involves very minimal or low risk. Patient and surrogate participants may experience an emotional reaction (e.g., anxiety) or fatigue during the intervention or data collection. However, in our previous studies,

Protocol  7.15.[ADDRESS_931748], not a care 
provider, in a private room at the clinic  (or another private location for the convenience of the dyad)  or via 
videoconferencing at home  (after the COVID -19 outbreak, all SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687424]) , and thus it is nearly impossible for care providers to obtain the knowledge and skill related to 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687425] p ractice. Furthermore, once diagnosed with early stage AD, follow -up visits typi[INVESTIGATOR_687426] a noticeable cognitive decline, and thus it is unlikely that participants in the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687427] . In fact, all 
of our previous studies used individual randomization and successfully demonstrated the efficacy of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]. We considered a clinic -level cluster RCT in which a care provider delivers SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192], but rejected this option because at 
Stage I intervention development it is important to determine if the intervention has been modified without compromised potency. In addition, a cluster RCT is too ambitious in the context of pi[INVESTIGATOR_687428]. We chose race (white vs non- white) as a stratification factor  to ensure equal allocation 
of race to each treatment condition to control for race as a confounding variable.14. 
 
The most challenging aspects of design ing this intervention trial are: a) determining an optimal follow -up time 
point and data collection mode to minimize the potential influence of patients’ cognitive impairment on the outcome assessment, and b) maintaining blinding of data collectors. The fi rst follow -up time point ( Ideally 2-[ADDRESS_931749] intervention  however, consideration is given to difficulty of scheduling dyads and extension may result ) 
is to evaluate the impact of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687429] o f the 
patient’s impaired ability to recall what was discussed during the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_645010] (i.e., the patient needs to recall what he/she clarified as goals -of-care preferences). We considered measuring the outcomes immediately 
following the intervention, but  this would preclude blinding the data collector because of the modality difference.  
The second follow -up time ([ADDRESS_931750] intervention)  was chosen to help maximize the number of patients 
whose conditions progress to an advanced stage within the study period so that we can explore how surrogates 
experience having or not having an in -depth ACP discussion before the window of opportunity has  closed. 
Although not ideal for people with mild AD, telephone -based data collection  was chosen to assure blinding of data 
collectors and to reduce participants’ travel burden. We have used phone -based data collection extensively in our 
previous studies wi th seriously ill patients and their surrogates using the procedures described above (see Post -
Intervention Assessment).  
 
As in our previous studies, we chose usual care as a comparison condition  rather than an attention placebo 
control. In addition to the fact that there is no methodological standard for attention placebo controls in trials of 
psychosocial interventions,116 in the context of preparing for future medical care and end -of-life decision making, 
an attention placebo (information and discussion irrelevant to the context) would not meet the pa rticipants’ 
expectations or motivation to participate in the study, and could cause a high refusal rate, dissatisfaction, and disproportional dropouts.
[ADDRESS_931751] control did not result in disproportional dropouts (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] [5.5%] vs usual 
care [2.0%]).30  
 Revised study design (V12) : 
In the effort to meet the target sample size, we expand study recruitment activities to 1) Georgia Memory Net 
sites (Augusta, Macon, Albany, and Columbus) in addition to Atlanta (Grady memory clinic serves as a memory assessment clinic for GA Memory Net), 2) Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC)/a federally designated Area Agency 
on Aging (AAA) serving older adults in 10 counties ( Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, 
Gwinnet, Henry, and Rockdale), and 3) Alzheimer’s Association’s e arly stage program (e.g., early stage support 
groups, monthly lunch groups/Carpe Diem, High Museum tour groups, early memory loss support group series) and referrals to GA Memory Net that covers 33 counties .

Revised study design (V14): Due to the corona virus pandemic and social distancing recommendations from CDC, it is necessary to eliminate 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_645045] -person modality to minimize in- person physical contacts with study participants. This makes the study a 
2-group (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote and usual care) RCT.  
 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
 The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687430] a one-time advance d care planning intervention that has been rigorously tested and has 
demonstrated its efficacy. The details about the intervention, including the rationale, are described above (2.2 Background).  
 
4.4 END OF S TUDY DEFINITION  
 Because the study includes two phase s, the end of the study for participants will be the completion of the one-
year follow -up.  
 
5 STUDY POPULATION  
 
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Patient eligibility criteria:   
a) Mild to moderate  dementia based on one of the followings:  
a. a MoCA  score ≥ 13, or MMSE score ≥ 18 (If other compatible cognitive tests are used at the 
clinic, the name [CONTACT_687500] );  
b) able to understand and speak English; and  
c) a UBACC score  ≥  11 or ( a score of 9 or 10  with consultation of PI ) 
For Stage 1B, a UBACC score  ≥  [ADDRESS_931752] is available to determine whether the patient has dementia, the  Short Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE)  score from 
the family caregiver interview must be 3.3 or highe r. Study staff will also ask caregivers about the comorbid 
conditions of the person with Dementia.  
 
Surrogate eligibility criteria:  
a) 18 years or older (to serve as a surrogate decision- maker, the individual must be an adult);  
b) be chosen by [CONTACT_102];  
c) have access to a computer and internet connectivity in a private setting, e.g., either the patient’s or the surrogate’s home and being able to use email (to receive URL links to a secure videoconferencing software, e.g., Zoom ); and  
d) able to understand and speak English.  
 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 Patient exclusion criteria:

  15 
 a) lack of an available surrogate  
b) speech impairment  
c) uncompensated hearing deficits, and  
 
Surrogate exclusion criterion:  
a) Those who cannot complete questionnaires due to physical  or cognitive limitations will be excluded.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_931753] with the assumption that his/her  surrogate would be willing to 
participate ( note that  patients cannot complete the baseline without willing surrogates), and then the surrogate 
actually declines to participate.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment and C onsent procedures: 
Stage 1A (pre -testing)  
 Potential patient participants will be those who are currently receiving care from  Emory’s Brain Health Center 
located at the Executive Park (2 miles from the School of Nursing). The Brain Health Center encompasses more than 20 clinics which serve a range of neurologic, psychiatric and cognitive conditions. The clinics are staffed by [CONTACT_65740], nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and clinical social workers. Patients who are appropriate for this study may interface with one or more of the clinics to receive services for a diagnosis of dementia. 
 
 A study invitation letter signed by [CONTACT_687468] , nurse practitioners,  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_687431] a recent MoCA score ≥ 13. This letter will explain briefly about the study and include the research 
staff contact [CONTACT_687469] -out postcard. After [ADDRESS_931754] to explain the study further and schedule a brief 
meeting at the clinic during their upcoming return clinic visit. On the day of the return clinic visit, the research 
staff will review the patient’s medical record to confirm the patient’s eligibility (a through c) and approach the patient to obtain verbal consent to administer the UBACC to screen the patient for decision -making capacity . With 
a patient whose UBACC score is equal to or higher than 1 1 (or score of 9 or 10 with consultation of PI) , the 
recruiter will determine whether the person accompanying the patient is an appropriate surrogate decision -
maker using the Surrogate Selection Guide. Written consent will be obtained from each member of the dyad.  
Location for consent meeting will typi[INVESTIGATOR_687432].  
 Stage 1B (form al pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124])  
Participants will be recruited from : Emory’s Brain Health Center,  Emory Geriatrics  Clinics  (Tucker,  St. Josephs, and 
Domiciliary program), Grady’s Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center, Grady Primary Care, Grady Geriatrics, Assisted Living facilities, Atlanta Adult Day Care facilities , GA Memory Net sites in Augusta, Albany, Macon, and 
Columbus, Alzheim er’s Association early stage program, and Atlanta Regional Commission.  Additionally, the 
current subcont ract sites,  Rush University and Northwestern University , will assist in recruitment by [CONTACT_687470][INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.[ADDRESS_931755]  agreed to be contact[CONTACT_687471] . Patients at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Rush and Northwestern Universities have already 
provided a blank consent at enrollment for being contact[CONTACT_687472].  
 
In addition to t he possible recruitment strategy listed under Stage 1A , another  strategy for recruitment will be to 
review the medical records of patients seen at the above clinics . Patient m edical records will be reviewed to 
determine eligibility (a through c of inclusion criteria). Study staff will identify patients deemed eligible, and at the patient’s next appointment, the patient’s care provider will gain permission for the study staff to  explain the 
study. As stated above, study staff will then obtain verbal consent to administer the UBACC to screen the patient 
for decision -making capacity. With a patient who has met the UBACC criterion, the recruiter will determine 
whether the person acc ompanying the patient is an appropriate surrogate decision -maker using the Surrogate 
Selection Guide. Written consent will be obtained from each member of the dyad. If the surrogate decision -maker 
is not present at the time of the visit, study staff will o ffer consent to the patient and then obtain the name [CONTACT_687501]. Study staff will then call the surrogate within 2 days of the consent visit to assess the surrogate’s willingness to participate.   
 We may also periodically receive lis ts of eligible patients from providers who have introduced the study to the 
patient at the time of a visit. In that case, we will follow up by [CONTACT_687473] a time to offer consent to the dyad at the clinic or over the phone . At the time of return clinic visit, study staff will review 
medical records to determine eligibility (a through c of inclusion criteria, and d of exclusion criteria).  If eligible, 
study staff will follow the above procedures regarding UBACC screening, confirm ing the surrogate decision maker, 
and consenting each member of the dyad.  
 To recruit participants through Emory’s domiciliary program , a study invitation letter signed by [CONTACT_687474] [INVESTIGATOR_687433]/family caregivers . As done in Stage 1A, t his letter will explain 
briefly about the study and include the research staff contact [CONTACT_687469] -out postcard. After 2 weeks, 
a research staff member will review the medical records of domiciliary program patients/families who have not returned the opt -out postcard to screen for eligibility (i.e., dementia diagnosis and MoCA score) . If they have met 
the criteria, the research staff member will call potential patient and/or family caregiver participants to explain 
the stu dy further and schedule a screening and informed consent  meeting at the assisted living facility.  
 To recruit participants at the assisted living and independent living facilities who are not currently enrolled in the domiciliary program , study staff members may receive recommendations from facility employees. In these 
cases, study staff will follow the same procedure listed for Emory domiciliary patients ( i.e. mailing a letter with an 
opt- out card and contact[CONTACT_687475]). We may also receive direct referrals from 
facility staff who will introduc e the study and gain permission from residents and their families to be contact[CONTACT_426] 
a study team member.  Study staff members will additionally advertise the study in facility  newsletters and /or 
attend family events at the community to introduce  the study  to residents and their family members . Study 
brochures will be made available at these events. Individuals  who express interest at these events will be asked  to 
provide contact  [CONTACT_3031]. A study staff member will  follow up with the interested party and determine 
eligibility  for the study  through a screening and informed consent meeting. 
 To recruit participants from GA Memory Net sites, the Community Services Educator (CSE) at the site will first 
identify patients who have been diagnosed with dementia and meet the MoCA criterion. When the potentially eligible patient and caregiver make a second visit to the memory assessment center (per GA Memory Net 
protocol), the CSE will briefly introduce the study to the patient and caregiver (using a script) and ask permission 
to release their names and contact [CONTACT_3031]  (including mailing address)  if they are interested in learning more 
about the s tudy from the research staff. Study brochures will also be made available at the site. Upon the receipt 
of names and contact [CONTACT_3031], the research staff will mail a copy of consent form before contact[CONTACT_30697].  A 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020 
  17 
 research staff member will call the dyad to explain the study further, determine the remaining eligibility criteria 
(e.g., UBACC) and proceed informed consent if eligible.  
 To recruit participants from Northwestern University and Rush University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center , 
the co -investigat ors, [CONTACT_30616] at Rush and [CONTACT_687504] rhardt at Northwestern, will identify patients who are deemed 
eligible for the study. Their research staff will phone the potential patient participants (and their family caregivers/potential surrogate participants)  to intro duce the study and gain permission to share contact 
[CONTACT_687476]. Upon receiving referrals, Emory research staff will contact [CONTACT_687477], explain the study in detail and obtain verbal 
consent using Verbal Informed Consent/HIPAA authorization format .  
 To recruit participants from other recruitment avenues (adult day care programs , Alzheimer’s Association early 
stage program) , study staff may send an invitation letter with the program’s permission. This invitation letter will 
follow the same procedures listed for Emory domiciliary patients (i.e. mailing a letter with an opt -out card and 
contact[CONTACT_687478] -out card). Direct referrals may also be received from facility staff 
members as appropriate. Study staff may additionally coordinate IRB approved study advertisements to be placed in the facility (including newsletters) .  If appropriate and with permission from the program , study staff will 
introduce the study at the program’s  events. Individuals who express interest through these methods will be 
asked to provide contact [CONTACT_3031], and study staff members will subsequently follow -up with those i ndividuals.  
We will also disseminate advertisements through program newsletters (in paper or electronic form).  
 In the case of Atlanta Regional Commission/AAA),  the county case manager, who typi[INVESTIGATOR_687434]’s 
dementia severity  and availability of family caregiver, will identify patients/caregivers who are likely to meet the 
study eligibility criteria. When the case manager is in contact [CONTACT_90381], he/she will briefly introduce the study to the patient and caregiver (using a script) and ask permission to release their names and contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (including mailing address) if they are interested in learning more about the study from the research 
staff. Study brochures will also be made available at the site. Upon the receipt of names and contact [CONTACT_3031], the research staff will mail a copy of consent form before contact[CONTACT_30697].  A research staff member will call the dyad to explain the study fu rther, determine the remaining eligibility criteria (e.g., UBACC) and proceed informed 
consent if eligible.  
 Because adult day care programs  and other community organizations  are social services, they  typi[INVESTIGATOR_687435]. In the cases whe re a dementia diagnosis cannot be confirmed from reliable sources, study 
staff will administer screening questions and a valid questionnaire, “Short Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE)” ), to the family caregiver to determine whether a patient’s 
cognitive impairment is likely dementia or due to other neurodegenerative condition. The initial screening questions will consist of the following questions:  
• Has your loved one been evaluated for memory problems at t he doctor’s office?  
o If yes, what was the formal diagnosis at that time?  
o Do you have any test results related to the diagnosis?  
• Does your loved one take any cognition - enhancing drugs, such as Aricept, Exelon, Reminyl, Namenda, or 
Provigil?  
• Has your loved one had a stroke before this memory problem?  
If a caregiver reports their loved one as having d ementia based on the screening question and IQCODE (a score 
3.3 or higher) , study staff will schedule a meeting to determine full eligibility  of their loved one and consent .

 For all recruitment sites, the location for consent meeting can be flexible to meet the demands of participants.  
 
Retention strategies:  
Stage 1A (pre -testing)  
Subject participat ion will last about three week s. Each member of the dyad will receive a $[ADDRESS_931756] -intervention follow -up (Ideally 2-3 days after the intervention session).  
 Stage 1B (formal pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124])  
To Maximize Participant Retention, strategies found effective in retaining dyads over 12 months (dropouts,  3.8%) in our efficacy trial
30 will be used: (a) obtain backup contact [CONTACT_3031], (b) make confirmation phone calls 
2 days prior to each appointment, (c) make scripted monthly check -in calls, (d) send holiday and special occasion 
cards, (e) assign the same data collector whenever possible, (f) compensate each member of the dyad as a token of appreciation ($20  at baseline, $[ADDRESS_931757] -intervention assessment) and surrogates who complete the 1 -year 
follow -up interview ($30 at 12 months); and (g) use a cell phone matched to the participant’s wireless network 
provider whenever possible (so that their minutes do no t run out).

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687436]:  
In its current form, all sessions of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687437] a private room in a clinic and follow the structured 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_645053] . The goals of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687438] -of-life preferences and to help 
surrogates understand the patient’s wishes and prepare for the surrogate role. Currently SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687439] -to-
face sessions with patient and surrogate together. During the first session (~45 min.) , an interventionist assesses 
the patient’s and surrogate’s cognitive, emotional, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]/religious representations of the patient’s illness, progression, and end -of-life care. This allows the interventionist to provide individualized information about 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as the effectiveness of life -sustaining treatment for p eople with progressive chronic illness (to be 
adapted for AD), and assist the patient to examine his/her values about life -sustaining treatment at the end of 
life. The interventionist also helps the surrogate prepare for end -of-life decision -making and for  the emotional 
burden of decision -making by [CONTACT_645158]. If the surrogate is someone out of 
the order of the hierarchical compensatory model
105 (e.g., a sibling is chosen instead of a spouse or child), the 
interventionist explores potential family conflicts and encourages the dyad to talk with other family members and complete a medical power of attorney. A Goals -of-Care tool is completed at the end of the session to indicate the 
patient’s preferences.  A brief second session (~15 min.)  is conducted about [ADDRESS_931758] session. The patient’s Goals -of-Care tool is reviewed and 
assessed for the need for clarification or correction. The interventionist documents the patient’s end -of-life 
preferences and the surrogate’s name [CONTACT_687502].  
 
Planned adaptations of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687440]/modality  • Virtual face -to-face via web -based videoconferencing for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote  
Setting  • Home for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote  
Content  • Condensing two sessions to one (combining Steps 5 & 6)

Guided by [CONTACT_552518]’s framework for adaptations of evidence -based interventions,[ADDRESS_931759] and instructions for participants. The equipment needed for videoconferencing includes a computer, a webcam, a headset, a microphone (if not already built in the computer), and the Internet. We will use Zoom
®, a videoconferencing platform supported in Window, Mac, Linux, and other virtual desktop environments. 
Zoom  also includes a recording module that is consistent with HIPAA security requirements. A videoconferencing 
workstation will be set up in a private room in the School of Nursing, where the interventionist will conduct sessions.  
 
If a dyad is assigned to the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote  group, a research assistant trained to handle technical aspects of Zoom  
will schedule a phone call to take the surrogate through the steps of using email to follow URL links that open 
Zoom . He/she will also guide the surrogate through practice in using basic videoconference operations, e.g., 
accepting an incoming conference invitation, viewing shared documents, muting/unmuting the microphone or 
camera, and ending the call. For dyads with a computer without video capabilities, a loaner web cam (and headset and microphone as needed) will be shipped as soon as the group assignment is known. This research assistant will initiate the Zoom  call for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote sessions and silently observe sessions to troubleshoot  difficulties the dyad 
or interventionist might encounter. These procedures have been used effectively in the Tele- Savvy pi[INVESTIGATOR_687441] R01 project. The interventionist will confirm a follow -up call for outcome assessment to occur in the next 
2-3 days  ideally . 
 Usual Care at the Emory ADC. At the time of the diagnosis of a dementing illness, an advanced practice nurse 
provides written information on advance directives to a patient and his/her family caregiver and reviews this 
information and encourages them to complete an advanced directive. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_241095] [ADDRESS_931760] and 
a copy of the advance directive is scanned to the electronic chart. Patients and families may be referred to a support group program organized by a social worker in which legal and financial issues are discussed in a group setting (by a lawyer). We will review the patient’s medical records at the clinic at baseline and quarterly to track activities associated with usual care. To capture any changes in usual care, policy and procedures related to ACP at the clinic will be reviewed every 6 months by a research assistant.  
 
Usual Care in Emory Geriatrics, Grady’s Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center, Grady Geriatrics and Grady

 Usual care at Georgia Memory Net by [CONTACT_687479] (CSE). During the second visit of a patient 
and caregiver at the memory assessment clinic, the CSE asks if the patient has an advance directive, provide 
written information about advance directives if the patient does not have one, and encourage the patient and 
caregiver to complete one. This procedure is standardized across the GA Memory Net sites.  
 
Usual care at Rush University ’s Memory Clinic. Inquiry of  completion of legal forms including a living will, POA 
health care and POA property  is done . If incomplete, patients are  provide d with the forms and  may be  
encourage d to complete before competency comes into question. DNR discu ssions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_687442], not in our clinic. If someone is truly advanced or at end- stage dementia, discussions about end 
of life may occur. If a patient or family has more questions, Rush often refer s to a social worker for further 
discussion. A management plan is provided and completion of legal forms is recommended as a part of the 
management plan.  
 
Usual care at Northwestern University’s Memory Clinic.  
 
As applicable (i.e., patients recruited from a clinical care setting) , we will review the patient’s medical records at 
the clinic at baseline and quarterly to track activities associated with usual care.  For patients without accessible 
medical records (such as patients receiving care outside of Emory or Grady health systems) , study staff will collect 
medical history  from the surrogate decision maker about the patient with dementia.  To capture any changes in 
usual care, policy and procedures related to ACP at the clinic will be reviewed every 6 months by a research 
assistant.

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 For Stage 1B pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], [CONTACT_115280] (statistician/Co -I) will generate a randomization scheme using stratified (by 
[CONTACT_545] , white vs non -white  study site, Emory vs Grady ), permuted block randomization with block size 6, using a 
random -number generator. Dyads will be randomized with equal allocation (1:1:1) to SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -
remote, or usual care.  
 With Revision 14 , randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (white vs non -white) within recruitment site (Emory, 
Rush, and Northwestern), with equal allocation to SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person or usual care.  
 Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding dyads to th eir group allocation is impossible, but the research staff 
assessing outcomes will be blind. Immediately after the completion of the baseline assessment by [CONTACT_648], the data collector will open a sealed envelope to identify group assignment and schedule an i ntervention session to take 
place ~2 weeks hence for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]- in person or – remote  (with revision 14, all SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote) , as well as a follow -up 
data collection session in the next [ADDRESS_931761] 2 
years of clinical experience in caring for people with AD as a nurse (RN or APRN) or social worker. Interventionist 
training  (led by [CONTACT_6283]. Song and Hepburn) will consist of a 3½ -day competency -based program used in our previous 
trials using training manuals. Module 1 (1 day) focuses on understanding AD and end -of-life care issues, 
communication as key to improving end -of-life care, and the Representational Approach (theoretical 
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_645033]); Module 2 (1 day) is a skill -based session on delivery of the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644947] (e.g., 
communication behaviors and enhanced consent techniques), including role plays; Module 3 (1/2 day) focuses on 
videoconferencing procedures and etiquette, features of Zoom , and handling technical problems (adapted from 
the Tele- Savvy Training manual). A 2 -week practice period is then scheduled for integration of skills. Module 4 (1 
day) involves skill-demonstration and certification.

intervention sessions will be audio -recorded. Every 2 months, 50% of sessions randomly selected from SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]-
remote will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] (approximately 2 sessions from each group). Using the modified Treatment Fidelity Assessment Tool , the interventionist’s adherence to intervention content, process, and duration will be 
evaluated on a 3 -point scale (1=appropriate, 3=skipped). Problems detected including drift from protocol will be 
discussed with the interventionist and re- training will be provided if adherence is <80% based on the Fidelity 
Assessment Tool.

In Stage 1A,  
 Feasibility  of recruiting and retaining patients with mild AD and surrogates for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_687482], and the reasons 
for refusal and withdrawals. Feasibility  of conducting SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_687483], the number of incomplete or interrupted sessions, and 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020 
  23 
 the minutes required to complete SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]- in person and SPI [INVESTIGATOR_61192]-remote. We will also explore whether these 
variables are associated with patients’ MoCA or MMSE scores.   
 
Acceptability. After the outcome assessment, the research assistant will conduct a brief semi- structured interview 
(10-15 min utes) with each memb er of the d yad to ask about: the overall experience with SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]; any facets of the 
intervention that the participant found helpful/not helpful and the reasons; pacing, length, and modality; and suggestions for improvement. This interview will be audio -reco rded and transcribed for analysis.  
 Outcomes  
Preparedness for end- of-life decision making (measured at baseline and 2 -3 days after the intervention or 
randomization) Note flexibility may be necessary due to challenges of the population and demands of 
scheduling both patients and surrogates:    
• Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals -of-Care Tool,
28,[ADDRESS_931764], the patient has progressed to advanced dementia 
and develops a severe i nfection and is admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; the medical team believes recovery unlikely 
and continuing life -sustaining treatment would no longer be beneficial. There are three response options: 
“The goals of care should focus on delaying my death no matter wha t, and thus I want to continue life -
sustaining treatment”, “The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment”, and “I am not sure”. In the second scenario, the patient has progressed to 
advanced dementia and develops a severe infection. The nursing home staff is asking whether the patient should be taken to an ED, which will lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687447] -sustaining treatments. Patients and 
surrogates complete this tool independently and their respo nses are then compared to determine dyad 
congruence -- either congruent in both scenarios or incongruent. If both members of the dyad endorse “I 
am not sure”, they are considered incongruent.  
• Patient decisional conflict  will be measured using the [ADDRESS_931765] Scale (DCS), a validated 
measure in the context of end -of-life decision making
27; higher scores indicate greater difficulty in 
weighing benefits and burdens of life -sustaining treatments and decision making (range 1 -5; Cronbach’s α 
= 0.8 – .9327,28,30,121). 
• Surrogate decision- making confidence will be measured using the 5 -item Decision Making Confidence 
(DMC) scale (Cronbach’s α  = 0.81- 0.9028,58); higher scores reflect greater comfort in performing as a 
surrogate (0=“not confident at all” to 4=“very confident”). DMC assesses a surrogate’s confidence in: knowing the patient’s wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful s ituation, 
ability to seek information about risks and benefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient’s wishes.   
• We will also assess the overall preparedness for end- of-life decision making using the 26 -item 
investigator- developed measure. The measure assesses the level of preparedness for end -of-life decision 
making in the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions on a 4 -point scale (4=strongly agree to 
1=strong ly disagree) with higher scores indicating higher levels of preparedness. Patient and surrogate 
each will complete this measure separately.    
 
In Stage 1B,  
 
Acceptability.   Patient and surrogate acceptability  will be assessed using the 10 -item ACP Acceptability   
Questionnaire developed from our previous trial.24  Participants are asked how strongly they agree or disagree  (4 
to 1) with statements about their experience with SPI[INVESTIGATOR_644968], including duration, interactions with the 
interventionist, level of comfort and satisfaction. Higher scores indicate greater acceptability. Each patient and 
surrogate will complete this surve y following the preparedness outcome measures after the intervention.

 Preparedness for end- of-life decision making (measured at baseline and ideally 2-3 days after the intervention 
or randomization):   
• Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals -of-Care Tool,28,[ADDRESS_931766], the patient has progressed to advanced dementia 
and develops a severe infection and is admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; the medical team believes recovery unlikely 
and continuing life -sustaining treatment would no longer be beneficial. There are three response options: 
“The goals of care should focus on delaying my  death no matter what, and thus I want to continue life -
sustaining treatment”, “The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want 
life-sustaining treatment”, and “I am not sure”. In the second scenario, the patient has progress ed to 
advanced dementia and develops a severe infection. The nursing home staff is asking whether the patient should be taken to an ED, which will lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687447] -sustaining treatments. Patients and 
surrogates complete this tool independe ntly and their responses are then compared to determine dyad 
congruence -- either congruent in both scenarios or incongruent. If both members of the dyad endorse “I 
am not sure”, they are considered incongruent.  
• Surrogate decision- making confidence  will be measured using the 5 -item Decision Making Confidence 
(DMC) scale (Cronbach’s α  = 0.81- 0.90
28,58); higher scores reflect greater comfort in performing as a 
surrogate (0=“not confident at all” to 4=“very confident”). DMC assesses a surrogate’s confidence in: knowing the patient’s wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful situation, ability to seek information about risks and be nefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted 
pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient’s wishes.  
• We will also assess the overall preparedness for end- of-life decision making using the investigator -
developed  measure. The measure assesses the level of preparedness for end -of-life decision making in 
the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions on a 4 -point scale (4=strongly agree to 1=strongly 
disagree) with higher scores indicating higher levels of prep aredness. Patient and surrogate each will 
complete this measure separately.    
 
Completion of Advance Directives (at 12 months).   A research assistant will review the patient’s medical record 
to determine if the patient has completed an advance directive (a medical power of attorney or living will) by 12 
months. If there is no documentation, the research assistant will call the sur rogate to confirm.  
 Surrogates’ Perceived Impact of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]  (intervention group only) . At 12 months , 44-46 surrogates will participate 
in a semi-structured  interview by [CONTACT_648]: approximately [ADDRESS_931767] progressed to an 
advanced stage  (CDR score > 1; 22% progression rate
33,113- 115) and 20% randomly selected surrogates of patients 
who have not progressed (~18 -20 surrogates). A research assistant will review medical records to identify if a 
patient’s dementia  has progressed. A trained interviewer/research assistant will conduct the interview using the 
Perceived Impact Interview Guide, which includes questions about surrogates’ experiences with the treatment 
condition, the perceived impact of the treatment condition on their loved ones and themselves, and what they found most and least  helpful and why. This 15 -30 minute interview will be audio -recorded and transcribed. 
 
Descriptors and Potential Covariates (collected at baseline). Patients and surrogates will each complete a 
Sociodemographic Profile  which includes demographic information and previous end -of-life decision -making 
experience. Patients’ clinical characteristics , (date of dementia  diagnosis, CDR score, MoCA or MMSE scores, and 
comorbid conditions) will be abstracted from the patient’s medical records.  For patients whom we do not have 
access to their medical records, study staff will gather a patient’s clinical characteristics from the surrogate.  The 
Medical Profile at Enrollment and the Quarterly Medical Record Review will both require surrogate report when 
medical records are  unavailable.

DMC, a sizable treatment effect was observed at [ADDRESS_931775] intervention,30 but at short -term (2 weeks ), the 
effect size was negligible (Cohen’s d=.02).[ADDRESS_931776] size for the AD population instead of solely focusing on hypothesis testing.  
 
Revised sample size calculations  (with V12) : Due to changes in the study design, we revised our sample size 
calculation. In particular, the new study design will use 2 parallel RCTs:  (1) A 3 -arm ( SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -
remote and usual care)  RCT for dyads residing in Atlanta and vicinities (within ~40 miles from Emory), and (2) a 2 -
arm (SPIR IT-remote and usual care) RCT if the dyad resides in an area outside of the perimeter. E ffect sizes 
estimates, corresponding to the preparedness outcomes from PI’s  previous studies , formed the basis for power 
calculation .27-30,[ADDRESS_931777] sizes (OR =4.4 -8.7) at [ADDRESS_931778] intervention,28,32 which would require only 10 -20 dyads/group to achieve over 80% power . For surrogate 
DMC, a sizable treatment effect was observed at [ADDRESS_931779] intervention,30 but at short -term (2 weeks ), the 
effect size was negligible (Cohen’s d=.02).32  
 
Based on the updated design, we are targeting n=[ADDRESS_931780] and n=[ADDRESS_931781] to 
meet our overall target of N=[ADDRESS_931782] differences in dyad congruence in the standalone RCTs; Ho wever, for the surrogate DMC outcome, our goal will be to estimate the 
population parameters or effect sizes and investigate trends. In addition, effect sizes from both RCTs will be pooled, whenever appropriate, to improve power.  
 Revised sample size calculation with V14: In light of the changes in study design, we revised our sample size 
calcu lation. Moving forward , the new study design will only use a 2 -arm (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote and usual care)  RCT for all 
dyads included in the study bas ed on [ADDRESS_931783] sizes ( OR=4.4 -8.7) at [ADDRESS_931784] intervention28,32. We found that a  total sample size of 72  obtained by [CONTACT_687484] 3 sites  with an 
average of 12  dyads per group (24  total from each site) will achieve adequate ( >80%) power to detect the 
smallest effect size  (odds ratio  of 4.3). Because the effect size was neg ligible for surrogate DMC (Cohen’s 
d=.02).32, our goal will be to establish the population parameters.  Considering attrition, the target sample size of 
120 dyads will achieve sufficient power.

Patient -surrogate dyads will be the primary unit of analysis; all analyses will be intent to treat with all available 
data from all participants.

among them.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRI MARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_645092] : For dyad congruence, a binary outcome (congruent or not 
congruent),  a generalized mixed effects logistic regression model will be used. Specifically, a random intercept 
model will be used to account for dyad level variation over time while treatment group, time (baseline and post -
intervention), and treatment x time interaction will treated as fixed effects. If there is a significant treatment x time interaction (α<0.05) (an overall treatment eff ect), then two contrasts will be tested for individual treatment 
effectiveness (usual care vs SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person and usual care vs SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote). Adjustments for multiple pairwise 
comparisons will be made using Tukey’s test . Surrogate  DMC and preparedness scores, we will use linear mixed 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.[ADDRESS_931786], SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -in person vs SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] -remote, cannot be tested. However, if superiority of the two modalities to 
usual care is determined, the estimated group differences could be used for selecting a non -inferiority margin or 
equivalence range124, 125 for future studies.  
 In light of the changes in study design  (V12) , we will update the statistical analysis plan. In particular, the 
preparedness outcomes from the [ADDRESS_931787] pooled analysis 
by [CONTACT_687485] (ANOVA) and incorporating an indicator variable for study and evaluate the 
(study x intervention group) interaction effect. We will also explore a meta -analysis approach to obtain a common 
intervention effect of SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]- remote vs usual -care, from the two studies. If the effect sizes obtained from the 
individual studies are relatively homogeneous, their individual results may be combined to produce an estimate of the intervention effect. A weighted pooled estimate of effect size can be obtained, using the inverse of each 
study’s variance as the weight. Because the studies are almost identical, we anticipate the variance to be fairly 
similar in both cases; a fixed effects approac h will be used to estimate the variance.  
 With revision V14: The revised statistical analysis plan will be  similar to that described in V12. Our primary aim will 
be to evaluate the effect of the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]- remote intervention  group  versu s usual care on the outcomes of interest. 
We will use generalized linear mixed effect modeling and compare changes in treatment group means or 
proportions over time u sing contrasts. Because we only have 3 clusters (sites), fitting a multilevel model would 
not be feasible. We will instead adjust for site as a fixed effect in our mixed effects model.  We will also c ompare 
our findings  to those from  Stage 1A to assess any substantial difference  in effect sizes . 
 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687452] (secondary aim) : This analysis will be limited to patients who did 
not have an advance directive at the time of enrollment. For this binary outcome (completed or not completed) measured post intervention, the probability of completion will be estimated for the three groups  using logistic 
regression. Baseline characteristics that differ across groups will be adjusted. Adjusted group mean proportions of completion will be compared between the groups; adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made using Tukey’s test.   
 
Surrogates’ perceived impact (secondary aim) : As in our previous work,126 qualitative analysis will use content 
and thematic techniques.127 Initial coding involves line by [CONTACT_687486], labeling, and organizing of data into 
segments, preserving detail in participants’ words.128 To optimize validity, codes and definitions will be reviewed 
and refined by [CONTACT_687487].129 Related codes will be grouped into 
categories representing aspects of the surrogates’ experiences. Similarities, differences, and trends across cases will be examined.
[ADDRESS_931788] director; discrepancies will be resolved by [CONTACT_21128]. To explore differences in themes by [CONTACT_687488], we will count the occurrence of themes (“quantitizing”)131, 132; the 
occurrence of each theme will be counted only once for a participant even if it is mentioned more than once. The data will be graphed to facilitate pattern interpretation.

10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study intervention. Prior to going th rough the informed consent process with a potential participant, a study team 
member must receive permission to approach the potential participant. This permission may occur as a verbal consent given to a third party (e.g. medical provider or facility staff member) or as a refrain from returning a pre -
paid opt -out post card (after receiving an introductory letter). Study staff will then approach potential participants 
who have consented to being approached (either in person at the clinic or via telephone). Potential participants 
who agree to be approached by a study staff member will receive the opportunity to screen and consent to the study (if eligible). Once potential participants have demonstrated that they meet all eligibility criteria through the scree ning process, they may enroll in the study. The following consent materials a re submitted with this protocol.

[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Stage 1A (pre -testing)  
Potential patient participants will be those who are currently receiving care from  Emory’s Brain Health Center 
located at the Executive Park (2 miles from the School of Nursing). The Brain Health Center encompasses  more 
than 20 clinics  which serve a range of neurologic, psychiatric  and cognitive conditions. The clinics  are staffed by 
[CONTACT_65740], nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and clinical social workers. Patients who are appropriate for this study may interface with one or more of  the clinics  to receive services for a  diagnosis of dementia.  
 Study invitation letter s signed by [CONTACT_687490], nurse practitioners,  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_687431] a recent MoCA score ≥ 13. This letter will explain briefly about the  study and include the research 
staff contact [CONTACT_687469] -out postcard. After [ADDRESS_931789] to explain the study further and schedule a brief meeting at the clinic  or a convenient location for the dyad . On the day of the meeting , the research staff will 
review the patient’s medical record to confirm the patient’s eligibility (a through c) and approach the patient to 
obtain verbal consent to administer the UBACC to screen the patient for decision -making capacity. With a patient 
whose UBACC score is  equal to or  higher than 1 1 (or 9 or 10  with consultation of PI) , the recruiter will determine 
whether the person accompanying the patient is an appropriate surrogate decision -maker using the Surrogate 
Selection Guide. Written or verbal consent will be obtained from each member of the dyad.  
 
Stage 1B (formal pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124])  
Participants will be recruited from: Emory’s Brain Health Center, Emory Geriatrics Clinics (Tucker, St. Josephs, and Domiciliary program), Grady’s Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center, Grady Primary Care, Grady Geriatrics, Assisted Living facilit ies, Atlanta Adult Day Care facilities, GA Memory Net sites in Augusta, Albany, Macon, and 
Columbus, Alzheimer’s Association early stage program, Atlanta Regional Commission , Northwestern Univer sity 
and Rush University .  
 In addition to the possible recrui tment strategy listed under Stage 1A , another strategy for recruitment will be to 
review the medical records of patients seen at the above clinics . Patient medical records will be reviewed to 
determine eligibility (a through c of inclusion criteria). Study  staff will identify patients deemed eligible, and at the 
patient’s next appointment, the patient’s care provider will gain permission for the study staff to explain the study. As stated above, study staff will then obtain verbal consent to administer the UBACC to screen the patient 
for decision -making capacity. With a patient who has met the UBACC criterion, the recruiter will determine 
whether the person accompanying the patient is an appropriate surrogate decision -maker using the Surrog ate 
Selection Guide. Written consent will be obtained from each member of the dyad. If the surrogate decision -maker 
is not present at the time of the visit, study staff will offer consent to the patient and then obtain the name [CONTACT_687503]. Study staff will then call the surrogate within 2 days of the consent visit to assess 
the surrogate’s willingness to participate.   
 We may also periodically receive lists of eligible patients from providers who have introduced the study to the 
patie nt at the time of a visit. In that case, we will follow up by [CONTACT_687473] a time to 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020 
  32 
 offer consent to the dyad at the clinic or over the phone . At the time of return clinic visit, study staff will review 
medical records to determine eligibility (a through c of inclusion criteria, and d of exclusion criteria).  If this is not 
possible due to SARS -COV2, eligibility will be determined using screening methods over the phone.  If eligible, 
study staff will follow the above procedures regarding UBACC screening, confirming the surrogate decision maker, 
and consenting each member of the dyad.  
 To recruit participants through Emory’s domiciliary program , a study invitation letter signed by [CONTACT_687474] [INVESTIGATOR_687453] t o patients /family caregivers . As done in Stage 1A, t his letter will explain 
briefly about the study and include the research staff contact [CONTACT_687469] -out postcard. After 2 weeks, 
a research staff member will review the medical records of domiciliary program patients/families who have not returned the opt -out postcard to screen for eligibility (i.e., dementia diagnosis and MoCA score). If they have met 
the criteria, the research staff member will call potential patient and/or family caregiver participants to explain the study further and schedule a screening and informed consent meeting at the assisted living facility.  
 To recruit participants at the assisted living and independent living facilities who are not currently enrolled in 
the domicilia ry program, study staff members may receive recommendations from facility employees. In these 
cases, study staff will follow the same procedure listed for Emory domiciliary patients (i.e. mailing a letter with an 
opt- out card and contact[CONTACT_687491] n ot return the opt out card). We may also receive direct referrals from 
facility staff who will introduce the study and gain permission from residents and their families to be contact[CONTACT_426] a study team member.  Study staff members will additionally advertis e the study in facility newsletters and/or 
attend family events at the community to introduce the study to residents and their family members. Study brochures will be made available at these events. Individuals who express interest at these events will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_3031]. A study staff member will follow up with the interested party and determine eligibility for the study through a screening and informed consent meeting.  
 
To recruit participants from GA Memory Net sites , the Community S ervices Educator (CSE) at the site will first 
identify patients who have been diagnosed with dementia and meet the MoCA criterion. When the potentially 
eligible patient and caregiver make a second visit to the memory assessment center (per GA Memory Net protocol), the CSE will briefly introduce the study to the patient and caregiver (using a script) and ask permission 
to release their names and contact [CONTACT_3031] (including mailing address) if they are interested in learning more about the study from the r esearch staff. Study brochures will also be made available at the site. Upon the receipt 
of names and contact [CONTACT_3031], the research staff will mail a copy of consent form before contact[CONTACT_30697].  A research staff member will call the dyad to explain the study further, determine the remaining eligibility criteria (e.g., UBACC) and proceed informed consent if eligible.  
 
To recruit participants from other recruitment avenues (adult day care programs, Alzheimer’s Association early 
stage program) , study staff may  send an invitation letter with the program’s permission. This invitation letter will 
follow the same procedures listed for Emory domiciliary patients (i.e. mailing a letter with an opt -out card and 
contact[CONTACT_687492] -out card). Dire ct referrals may also be received from facility staff 
members as appropriate. Study staff may additionally coordinate IRB approved study advertisements to be placed in the facility (including newsletters) .  If appropriate and with permission from the program , study staff will 
introduce the study at the program’s  events. Individuals who express interest through these methods will be 
asked to provide contact [CONTACT_3031], and study staff members will subsequently follow -up with those individuals. 
We will also disseminate advertisements through program newsletters (in paper or electronic form).  
 
In the case of Atlanta Regional Commission/AAA), the county case manager, who typi[INVESTIGATOR_687434]’s 
dementia severity  and availability of family caregiver, will identify patients/caregivers who are likely to meet the 
study eligibility criteria. When the case manager is in contact [CONTACT_90381], he/she will briefly introduce the study to the patient and caregiver (using a script) and ask permission to release their names and contact 
[CONTACT_645143][INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020

 information (including mailing address) if they are interested in learning more about the study from the research 
staff. Study brochures will also be made available at the site. Upon the receipt of names and contact [CONTACT_3031] , 
the research staff will mail a copy of consent form before contact[CONTACT_30697].  A research staff member will call the dyad to explain the study further, determine the remaining eligibility criteria (e.g., UBACC) and proceed informed consent if eligible.  
 Because adult day care programs and other community organizations are social services, they typi[INVESTIGATOR_687435]. In the cases where a dementia diagnosis cannot be confirmed from reliable sources, study staff will administer screening questions and a valid questionnaire, “Short Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE)”), to the family caregiver to determine whether a patient’s cognitive impairment is likely dementia or due to other neurodegenerative condition. The initial screening questions will consist of the following questions:  
• Has your loved one been evaluated for memory problems at the doctor’s office?  
o If yes, what was the formal diagnosis at that time?  
o Do you have any test results related to the  diagnosis?  
• Does your loved one take any cognition - enhancing drugs, such as Aricept, Exelon, Reminyl, Namenda, or 
Provigil?  
• Has your loved one had a stroke before this memory problem?  
If a caregiver reports their loved one as having d ementia based on the screening question and IQCODE (a score 
3.3 or higher) , study staff will schedule a meeting to determine full eligibility  of their loved one and consent .   
 To recruit participants from Northwestern University and Rush University Alzheimer’s Disease Researc h Center, 
the co -investigators, [CONTACT_30616] at Rush and [CONTACT_513779] at Northwestern, will identify patients who are deemed 
eligible for the study. Their research staff will phone the potential patient participants (and their family caregivers/potential surrogate participants)  to introduce the study and gain permission to share contact 
[CONTACT_687476]. Upon receiving referrals, Emory research staff will contact [CONTACT_687493], explain the study in detail and obtain verbal 
consent using Verbal Informed Consent/HIPAA authorization format.  
 For all recruitment sites, the location for consent meeting can be flexible to meet the demands of participants.

sessions before actual performance . After demonstrating satisfactory performance of consenting sessions, the 
recruiters will be authorized to recruit and enroll participants.  
 Training for data collection will include scripted data collection techniques with special attention to assessing participant fatigue or discomfort during the data collection session. Data collectors will conduct a series of three practice baseline and follow -up data collections using volunteers. After demonstrating satisfactory performance 
on data collection, they will be aut horized to perform data collection activities  with enrolled participants. They 
will also need to demonstrate completeness of data collection activities using REDCap.  
 The following strategies will be employed for internal quality management of study conduct, data collection,

10.1.11  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
 
This study will  be conducted in accordance with the following  publication and data sharing policies and 
regulations:  
National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the published 
results of NIH funded research. It requir es scientists to submit final peer -reviewed journal manuscripts that arise 
from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central  upon acceptance for publication.  
This study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Policy on the Dissemination of NIH -Funded Clinical 
Trial Information and the Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information Submission rule . As such,  this trial has 
been  registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and results information from this  trial will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov. 
In addition, every attempt will be made to publish results in peer -reviewed journals.   
 
Authorship determination: Authorship confers credit and has important academic, social, and financial 
implications. Authorship also implies respons ibility and accountability for published work. We will follow the 
recommendations by [CONTACT_4717] (ICMJE) to determine authorship (vs. 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_687387]  V14 
Protocol  7.15.2020 
  38 
 non-author contributors).  http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles -and-responsibilities/defining-
the-role-of-authors -and-contributors.html    
Authorship will be based on the following 4 criteria:  
1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work or the acquisition, analysis, or 
interpretation of data for the work; AND  
2. Drafting the work or revision it critically for important intellectual content  (simply participating in writing 
or technical editing of the manuscript is insufficient for authorship); AND  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  
Those who do not meet all 4 of the above criteria will be acknowledged as non -autho r contributors.  
 Data sharing:  
We will make the final data from the study, including a codebook, available to researchers after acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset. The final data will be a complete and cleaned data set  free 
of identifiers. We will make the research data available to users with a data- sharing agreement that includes: (1) a 
commitment to using the data only for research purposes, (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology,  (3) a commitment to destroying the data after analyses are completed and not 
redistributing to third parties, and (4) IRB approval and clear research questions. Data request and sharing procedures, data request forms, and a data -sharing agreement will be accessible through the website of Center 
for Nursing Excellence in Palliative Care, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. The requester will be able to download final dataset and codebook. Also, care providers or administrators who wish to use the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_166770] T

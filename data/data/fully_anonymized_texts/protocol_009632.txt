 Page 4 of 15   2.0 Objectives* 
 
2.1 Specific Aims. 
 Specific Aim 1: Examine intervention feasibility in 3 areas: 
1) patient and oncologist acceptability, 2) participant 
recruitment and retention, and 3) intervention dosage and 
fidelity. 
 Specific Aim 2: Evaluate intervention effects on 
comprehension and treatment preferences.  
 Specific Aim 3: Assess potential intervention mechanisms on 
comprehension, preferences, and satisfaction. 
2.2 Hypotheses/Research questions. 
 Aim 2 Hypothesis: Participants will demonstrate significant 
increases in comprehension about their disease and its 
treatments from pre- to post-QPL. Participants will be more 
likely to report Score-concordant preferences from pre to 
post-QPL.  
 Aim 3 Hypothesis: Patient comprehension and satisfaction 
will be higher following encounters with greater shared 
decision making, greater perceived communication quality, 
and more frequent discussion of risks/benefits of treatments. 
Patient preferences will likely be more Score-concordant 
following encounters with greater shared decision making, 
greater perceived communication quality, and more frequent 
discussion of risks/benefits of treatments. 
 
3.0 Background* 
 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among US women, with more than 230,000 new 
diagnoses and 40,000 deaths each year,1 along with decrements in quality of life.2 Half of all 
newly-diagnosed patients are affected with estrogen-receptor positive, early-stage disease. 
Clinical guidelines for these women integrate genomic tumor profiling tests such as the 
Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score to refine recurrence estimates and systemic therapy 
selection when combined with existing markers. Thousands of women receive testing each 
year.3–[ADDRESS_829737] that the 
25% with a high Score benefit from additional chemotherapy and the 50% with a low Score 
can safely avoid chemotherapy.6 Appropriate treatment for the 25% of women with 
intermediate Recurrence Scores remains unclear until clinical trial (TAILORx) results are 
released in the next year.[ADDRESS_829738] a poor understanding of their 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
Making Treatment Decisions Using Genomic Testing 
 Page [ADDRESS_829739] that 
patients’ pretesting preferences do not shift following the receipt of their Recurrence Score, 
even following discussion of test results that should guide treatment selection. These 
preferences are a powerful driver of treatment utilization, predicting treatment received over 
and above the effect of the Recurrence Score and other clinical variables. Indeed, many 
patients do not receive Score-concordant care.4,9–[ADDRESS_829740] et al.’s model of patient-centered communication13 suggests pathways through which 
clinical communication has indirect effects on morbidity and mortality. Communication can 
influence more proximal outcomes, including patient comprehension of their disease and its 
treatments, treatment preferences and satisfaction, involvement in care decisions as well as 
longer-term outcomes of treatment adherence and quality of life.[ADDRESS_829741] (QPL) can impact proximal outcomes of 
preferences, comprehension, satisfaction and involvement.15–[ADDRESS_829742]’s treatment recommendation 
and its impact on the management of their disease, as well as encourage alignment of 
treatment preferences, the Recurrence Score and treatment selection. In this trial, we will 
recruit newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients to a single-arm trial to demonstrate feasibility 
and preliminarily assess the impact of the QPL on key outcomes.

 Page [ADDRESS_829743] in how they communicate 
with their physician and make decisions regarding treatment options. 
 
6.4  Measures will include: 
Sociodemographics. We will assess age, race/ethnicity, education, marital, employment, 
income, insurance status, comorbidity, and family cancer history.  
 
Disease variables and treatments. We will assess diagnosis date, pathology (staging, 
grade, ER/PR/HER2), treatments, and dates.   
 
Oncotype DX Recurrence Score. We will assess the Recurrence Score and the related 
category. 
Chemotherapy Selection. In our work, 95% of women make definitive treatment 
decisions by T2. If not, this will be noted and the interview will continue. Data 
will be confirmed in the medical record .

Chemotherapy Preferences.  We will assess preferences for chemotherapy by 
[CONTACT_623117] (8 items) and cons (8 items) of treatment as we do in 
our ongoing work. Women rate the importance of each item on a scale from 1 
(Not at all important ) to 4 (Very important ). Ratings are averaged to create scales, 
with higher scores indicating greater importance of profs and cons. Internal 
relatability is high for pros-cons, with scores above zero indicating a preference 
for chemotherapy. Preference concordance will be determined through a match 
between post-Score preference and treatment received. 
Comprehension.  We will assess comprehension of adjuvant treatment, 
Recurrence Score and category, and treatment implications ( The Test helps 
women decide about chemotherapy (Y/N)).  We will apply existing comprehension 
items, in which patients average 70% correct.14 
Satisfaction.  We will assess Decisional Satisfaction with the valid and reliable 6-
item Satisfaction with Decision Scale, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ( Strongly 
agree/ disagree ), with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. The measure 
has been used to assess satisfaction with breast cancer adjuvant treatment 
decisions.19 
Perceived communication quality.  We will assess patients’ perceptions of 
quality of patient-physician communication using a 7-item scale from 1 ( Very 
strongly disagree)  to 6 (Very strongly agree ). This scale has good reliability and 
validity and we have used this measure in our current observational study. Items 
are relevant to chemotherapy decisions ( The doctor fully explained the risks of 
treatment recommended ). Patients will respond to these regarding their primary 
Medical Oncologist.[ADDRESS_829744] race, ethnicity, and gender of the patient’s 
primary medical oncologist for our measurement of concordance. 
Coding of Oncology Encounters.  We will audio record, transcribe, and code 
clinical encounters to inform potential intervention mechanisms. Broadly 
speaking, coding systems capture an encounter’s content and process. No single 
coding system has emerged as definitive or captures our specific encounter 
content and communication processes. We will code encounters for RS- and 
treatment related information, shared decision making, patient active participation 
and patient-centered communication.21,22 Dr. O’Neill will merge these data with 
patient self-report using study ID.

17.2 Data collected in this study will be used exclusively for research purposes; it 
will be managed and stored according to our sites’ security standards for data that require 
the highest possible security to ensure there will be no inadvertent disclosure. Any 
computers storing or accessing data collected for the study will be required to comply with 
these standards. 
 
During the trial, all study data downloaded from REDCap or gathered from other sources 
will reside in a HIPAA-compliant study folder. Access to the study folder is provided based

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a research tool developed at Vanderbilt 
University as a secure web application to allow users to build and manage online surveys 
and databases, and to support data capture for research studies. It is a secure, IRB-
approved, web-based application designed for managing online surveys and for 
communication between study sites. A locally hosted instance of REDCap will be used to 
store study data (Surveys, selected clinical data and tracking information such as 
participant names, phone numbers, address, etc). Questionnaires or other paper forms 
collected from each participant will be identified solely by [CONTACT_4317]’ confidential study 
identification number and stored in a locked filing cabinet in study offices.  
 
All study staff members will be trained to use these procedures, which will be detailed in 
a study manual of operating procedures. We have found that using these procedures 
provides a high degree of protection with respect to the privacy of individuals and the 
confidentiality of data.

24.0 Setting 
24.1 We anticipate recruiting from across the LCCC/MedStar clinical 
research (surgery and medical oncology) network. This network 
includes the main academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623116]-DC area. 
Eligible breast cancer patients will also be recruited from Moffitt 
Cancer Center. The Clinical Research Department at MCC utilized 
several means to screen patients to ascertain their potential eligibility 
for clinical trials. This site has a central Research Department to assist 
and facilitate with participant recruitment as follows. This includes 
screening of the electronic scheduling system, review of schedules 
posted within clinical care areas, attendance at tumor boards, and 
regular interaction with physicians and nurses.  
1) Access is sough solely to review PHI as necessary to prepare a 
research protocol for similar purposes preparatory research (i.e. 
screening), 
2) No PHI will be removed, and    
3) The PHI access and review is necessary for the research purposes. 
25.0 Resources Available 
 
25.1 The study will be conducted within the context of a funded research 
program and supported by [CONTACT_7628]. All staff will be 
trained to support this protocol and methods. We will collaborate 
with existing shared resources within the cancer center for 
recruitment. 
 
26.0 Multi-Site Research* 
 
26.1 Study-Wide Number of Subjects*  
We very conservatively project 60 eligible participants per year from 
LCCC/WHC and [ADDRESS_829760] bi-monthly meetings to discuss strategies and any issues 
as they arise.

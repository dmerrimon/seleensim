transporter -2 (SGLT2) lowers the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration but causes a 
“paradoxical”  
increase in endogenous glucose production (EGP). Although the increase in EGP can be viewed as a  
compensatory mecha nism that opposes urinary glucose loss and prevents the development of 
hypoglycemia in NGT individuals, in T2DM individuals it occurs while the plasma glucose concentration 
is still in the hyperglycemic range. Moreover, it offsets by ~50% the urinary gluco se loss produced by 
[CONTACT_23265]2 inhibitors and attenuates their glucose lowering ability. The increase in EGP following SGLT2 
inhibition is associated with an increase in plasma glucagon concentration and decrease in plasma 
insulin concentration. Because renal glucose production is stated to be unresponsive to an increase in 
the plasma glucagon concentration, it is likely that the liver contributes, at least in part, to the 
increase in EGP [which is triggered by [CONTACT_547897]]. However, an increase in glucose produc tion by [CONTACT_724985]. We hypothesize that there is a previously unrecognized, [completely 
novel] “reno -hepatic” interaction that participates in the regulation of plasma glucose concentration. 
This “reno -hepatic axis” is [activated by [CONTACT_547897]] and stimulates hepatic, as well as renal, glucose 
production. The aim of the present study is to: (i) determine the source of increase in EGP, liver versus 
kidney [or both]; and (ii) examine the signal activated by [CONTACT_724986] r the increase 
in EGP.

Purpose and rationale  
Insert purpose, objectives 
and research 
questions/hypotheses 
here.  
 If you cut and paste from 
another document, make 
sure the excerpted 
material answers the 
question  Insert purpose: Understanding the fac tors that regulate EGP is key to understanding normal glucose 
homeostasis and development of hyperglycemia in T2DM. We and others have shown that glucosuria 
produced by [CONTACT_23265]2 inhibition (SGLT2i) stimulates EGP, indicating the presence of an interaction 
between the kidney and liver, i.e. “a renohepatic axis” that coordinates the regulation of EGP and 
plasma glucose conc . The present study will provide evidence for the existence of this previously 
unrecognized reno -hepatic axis and define the mechanisms resp onsible for the interaction between 
the kidney and liver. In addition to providing novel insights about the regulation of glucose 
homeostasis, the present study has important clinical implications. Although SGLT2i are effective in 
producing glucosuria, the y cause only a modest decrease in HbA1c (0.6 -0.8%). On one hand, the 
presence of a “reno -hepatic axis” that leads to a compensatory increase in EGP in response to 
glucosuria maintains the FPG in NGT individuals and prevents hypoglycemia. On the other hand,  the 
increase in EGP in T2DM individuals is “paradoxical” in that it occurs while plasma glucose conc is in 
the hyperglycemic range and offsets by ~50% urinary glucose loss (10) (see results below) produced by 
[CONTACT_23265]2 inhibitors and attenuates their glucose lowering effect. Thus, determining the mechanisms that 
mediate the rise in EGP in response to glucosuria will allow the development of strategies that prevent 
the rise in EGP and  increase the efficacy of SGLT2.

Research Plan / Description of the Research Methods  a.  Provide a comprehensive narrative  describing the research methods .   
Provide the plan for data analysis  (include as applicable the sample size calculation).  
 Step -by-Step Methods:  
After screening, eligible subjects will receive a measurement of endogenous glucose production (EGP) with a prime -
continuous infusion of [ADDRESS_989635] 8 .5 hours (from 6 AM to 2 :30 PM). After a 3 .5-hour tracer equilibration period, subjects (20 
per group) will receive one of the following medications: (i) placebo;  (ii) exenatide 5 ug subcutaneously; (iii) 
dapagliflozin (10 mg); and (iv) dapagliflozin 10 mg plus exenatide 5 ug (see flow sheet for EGP ). Following the test 
medication at 9 :30 AM, blood samples will be drawn every 15 minutes for an additional 5 hours and plasma glucose, 
insulin, C -peptide, glucagon,  and glucose specific activity will be measured.  
 
Visit 1: Screening . Medical history will be obtained and physical exam will be performed. Blood will be drawn for FPG, 
routine blood chemistries, CBC, lipid profile, HbA1c, and thyroid function. Urinalysis, EKG, albumin/creatinine ratio and 
pregnancy test will be performed.  
 
Visit 2:  Endogenous Glucose Production Measurement:  The rate of endogenous glucose production will be measured 
with 3 -3H-glucose i nfusion.    [3 -3H]-glucose infusion will be started at 6 AM and continued until 2 :30 PM (5 hours 
after drug administration). At 6 AM a catheter will be placed into an anticubital vein and a prime (40 uCi x FPG/100) - 
continuous (0.4 uCi) infusion of  [ 3-3H]- glucose will be started and continued until 2:30 PM.   (5 hours after drug 
administration). Participant’s hand will be placed in a box heated to 50 -60°C (122 -140°F). Baseline blood samples will be 
obtained  at-210, -60, -50, -45, -40, -35, -30, -20, -10, a nd 0. After 3.5 hours of tracer equilibration blood samples will be 
obtained every 10 -20 minutes from 9 :30 AM to 2 :30 PM. Plasma glucose, insulin, C -peptide, glucagon, and [3 -3H]-
glucose specific activity will be measured. Urine will be collected from 6 to  9:30 AM and from 9 :30 AM to 2 :30 PM. 
Urinary volume and glucose concentration will be measured and urinary glucose excretion rate calculated. The study 
will end at 2:30  PM. The total amount of blood taken during this time is 164 ml or 12 tablespoons.  
 
Visit 3:  Double Tracer Oral Glucose Tolerance Test  (DT-OGTT) :  Within one to two  week s after  the measurement of 
EGP, all subjects will have a 5- hour DT-OGTT with measurement of plasma glucose, insulin (I), C -peptide (CP), and 
glucagon concentrations at - 180, -6, -5, -45, -40, -35, -30, -20, -10, 0 and every 15- 30 minutes thereafter to obtain a 
measure of overall glucose tolerance, insulin secretion ( CP0-120/G0-120), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index [MI]), 
beta cell function, ( CP0-120/G0-120 x MI), and suppression of plasma glucagon concentration (64).  At 7 AM a 
catheter will be placed into an anticubital vein and a prime (25 uCi x FPG/100) - continuous (0.25 uCi) infusion of  [ 3-3H]- 
glucose will be started and continued until 3 PM.  Urinary volume and glucose concentration will be measured and 
urinary glucose excretion rate calculated.  The total amount of blood taken during the OGTT is 226 ml about 15 
tablespoons.  HbA1c will be measured twice, once on the day of the DT-OGTT and once on the day of the EGP 
measurement.  
 
Note: The repeated double tracer listed in the grant application will not be performed as part of this protocol. The 
grant will be amended to remove at continuing review of the grant application.  
 
 
Data Analysis Plan: The primary end point is the change in EGP. The difference in rate of EGP during the last hour of the 
study (from 240 -300 minutes) between drug -treatment and placebo treatment studies represents the effect of drug 
treatment on EGP, which will be compared a mong the 3 drug treatments (exenatide; dapagliflozin; exenatide plus 
dapagliflozin) with ANOVA. Post hoc testing will be performed with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The 
following primary comparison will be performed: (i) change in EGP ab ove baseline following dapagliflozin alone versus 
dapagliflozin/exenatide.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_767057]:    CHEC  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_767058], PhD   
Study Description:   The goal of this project is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_767059] (Col laborative 
Healthcare Encounters with Caregivers) in primary c are. CHEC is 
brief intervention with two components: 1) a checkl ist to identify the 
needs and concerns of unpaid/family caregivers who accompany 
older patients (aged 65+) to their primary care vis its and 2) 
accompanying Tip Sheet for clinicians.    
Sample Size:  N = 60 caregivers* 
  N = 60 patients* 
  N = 10 primary care clinicians 
  *Participants will be a part of a patient-caregiv er dyad and will be 
recruited together.  
   
Enrollment:  This study will enroll 60 patient-caregiver dyads a nd 10 primary 
care clinicians. It will screen up to 200 patients,  up to 200 
caregivers, and up to 15 clinicians.   
Study Population:  Patient participants will include individuals who h ave upcoming 
appointments at the Center on Aging (COA) and are i dentified by 
[CONTACT_767065][INVESTIGATOR_767060] a family 
caregiver. Patient participants will vary in age, g ender, 
race/ethnicity, and health conditions. Family careg iver participants 
will include caregivers of patients receiving care at the COA. They 
will also vary in age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The clinician 
sample will include individuals who provide care at  the COA. 
Clinicians will vary in age, be enrolled regardless  of gender, and 
include those who have patient visits scheduled for  June 2021 – 
August 2022.

1.1 Study Objectives 
 
1.1.1 Objectives  
 
Objective 1: To demonstrate the feasibility and acc eptability of CHEC in primary care 
practice.  
 
Objective 2: To test the preliminary impact of CHEC  on primary care visit 
communication (discussion of family caregivers’ nee ds). 
 
1.1.2 Hypotheses / Research Questions 
   
Hypothesis 1 : Greater than 70% of caregivers will perceive the ch ecklist to be an 
acceptable length and easy to use. 
 
Hypothesis 2: Greater than 70% of caregivers will r eport that the checklist is helpful in 
identifying their unmet needs and starting a discus sion with providers.  
 
Hypothesis 3: Greater than 70% of caregivers and pr oviders will report that they desire 
to continue using the checklist in the future.  
 
Hypothesis 4: The checklist will not significantly impact primary care workflow or visit 
duration.  
 
Hypothesis 5: Discussion of caregivers’ needs and c oncerns will occur more often in the 
intervention group than in the usual care group. 
 
Hypothesis 6: Caregiver perceptions of visit commun ication will be more positive in the 
intervention group than in the usual care group.

 2. Background and Significance 
 
In the [LOCATION_002], nearly 8 million older adults  rely on family and other unpaid caregivers 
(neighbors; friends) for assistance with their heal th care. These caregivers collectively provide 
75-80% of the total care hours to community-dwellin g older adults and fill multiple roles in the 
health care system: attending doctor’s visits, coor dinating care, and assisting with treatment 
regimens. The availability and adequacy of assistan ce provided by [CONTACT_767069]. Yet, caregivers 
are not systematically identified in care delivery systems, and their abilities and needs are not 
routinely assessed. Caregivers receive inadequate p reparation for the tasks they must assume. 
They report high levels of stress and are at risk f or physical illness, depression and anxiety, and 
sleep disturbance. If these impairments and unmet n eeds are not assessed and addressed, they 
can impede the caregiver’s ability to provide effec tive assistance to the older adult, ultimately 
leading to costly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_767062]. These caregiver factors (health 
impairments; unmet needs) are particularly influent ial in the context of dementia where patients 
require substantial caregiving assistance.  
 
Primary care practices are well positioned to aid i n identifying and addressing the needs of at-risk 
family caregivers – in particular, persons who suff er from caregiving-related stress or have unmet 
needs for training or support – through systematic screening and referral. Nearly 40% of patients 
over the age of [ADDRESS_1051862] is critical as the caregiver’s needs change in 
response to the patient’s physical health and cogni tive function.  
 
The objective of this project is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a no vel screening-referral system for family caregivers  
who accompany older adults to their primary care vi sits, The long-term goal of this research is to 
develop a clinically feasible and scalable caregive r screening system that is acceptable to 
providers and caregivers. This system will set the stage for a sustained line of intervention work 
that connects at-risk caregivers with appropriate r esources, services, and supports. From a 
clinical perspective, broad implementation of this system has the potential to reduce demands on 
primary care providers by [CONTACT_767070] s ervices designed to support their well-being 
and caregiving capacity. 
 
 
3. Study Design and Methods 
 
3.1 Overall Design 
 
Clinicians who see patients at the Center on Aging (COA) will be made aware of the study via 
individual meetings with co-investigators. These me etings will be by [CONTACT_648], Zoom, or in-
person if/when feasible.  Patients and caregivers will be identified through referrals from 
physicians practicing at the Center on Aging. They will be sent a recruitment letter in the mail 
one month prior to a co-investigator calling them t o go over the screening and consent forms. 
Any study data collected for potential participants  that do not meet eligibility will be 
immediately deleted. Informed Consent and HIPAA aut horization for caregivers and patients, 
and informed consent for clinicians will occur oral ly over the phone or in-person at the COA 
just prior to in-person health visits when feasible  as outlined in the Informed Consent section.

Patient-caregiver dyads will be randomized into eit her the CHEC (n=60; 30 caregivers and 
30 patients) or control (usual care) condition (n=6 0; 30 caregivers and 30 patients). 
Randomization will occur through block randomizatio n with alternative block sizes of [ADDRESS_1051863] follow ing the guidelines on the accompanying 
Tip Sheet.  
 
Control Condition . Caregivers in the control condition will receive their usual care from the 
participating clinician during the health visit.  
 
Baseline (pre-visit). Caregivers in both conditions will be asked to comp lete identical pre-visit 
surveys. The survey will be scheduled to be complet ed over the phone, digitally on REDCap, 
or in-person depending on the participant’s prefere nce and COVID-19-related guidelines. We 
will ask about the participant’s background, caregi ving role, communication with providers, 
and feelings of caregiver preparedness. It will tak e approximately [ADDRESS_1051864] p atient’s background characteristics, 
medications, diseases, and health events (e.g., hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Clinicians will complete a pre-
intervention survey over the phone or in-person dep ending on the participant’s preference and 
COVID-19-related guidelines. We will ask for the cl inicians’ personal characteristics and 
preparedness to assess and address caregivers’ need s and concerns.  
 
Visit. All participants will have their medical visit audi o recorded.  
 
Post-visit. All caregiver participants will complete a post-v isit survey within [ADDRESS_1051865]-intervention survey and interview. The clini cian surveys and interview will take no more 
than 30 minutes total and will be conducted within 1 month of the conclusion of the intervention 
period.  
 
3.2 Interviews, Focus Groups, Surveys, and/or Obser vations  
 
A.  Administration 
§ Timing and Frequency 
o Caregiver baseline (pre-visit) surveys will take n o more than 20 minutes 
and will be conducted prior to the visit; caregiver  post-visit surveys will take 
no more than 25 minutes and will be conducted withi n one week of the visit, 
either in-clinic or remotely (via telephone and sec ure web survey or mail), 
based on the participant’s preference. Separate pos t-visit, follow-up 
surveys will take no more than [ADDRESS_1051866]-intervention 
surveys and interviews will take no more than 30 to tal minutes and will be

Page # [ADDRESS_1051867]-intervention interviews will occur in-person o r over the phone (based 
on the participant’s preference) and will be audio- recorded.  
o Medical chart abstraction will be conducted follow ing enrollment/consent 
but prior to the visit. The medical visit will be a udio-recorded.  
 
§ Procedures For Audio And Visual Recording  
o Medical visits and interviews will be recorded (ph one, video, or in-person 
encrypted recording) and stored on secure WCM serve rs via password 
protected tagged WCM computers.  
o Audio-recordings will be transcribed by [CONTACT_389930]-i nvestigators and will not 
leave the institution. The transcripts will also be  stored on secure WCM 
servers via password protected tagged WCM computers .  
 
§ Person Identifiers 
o Personal identifiers (e.g. names, email address, p hone number, and 
address) will be collected for recruitment and comp ensation purposes. 
Voice and video recordings, as well as compensation  identifiers, will be 
made on a voluntary basis.  
o Patient data will be abstracted from the medical c hart. Information obtained 
will include name, address, phone number, age, gend er, race/ethnicity, 
provider, MRNs, electronic mail addresses and healt h diagnosis 
information including primary visit diagnosis code and clinic location (from 
defined time window), and health events (e.g. hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], visit from 
home health aide). A partial HIPAA waiver will be r equested for access to 
this information. All participants will be provided  with a participant ID and 
their survey responses will be de-identified. Recor ds will be maintained and 
kept in secure locations for a minimum of 3 years; the length of time 
specified according to WCM and HIPAA policies.  
 
  B. Study Instruments 
The primary instruments for this study are validate d, widely-used patient- and 
caregiver-reported outcomes (PCRO) assessments that  are commonly used in health 
services research and clinical practice. These vali dated and reliable self-report 
measures include: Preparedness for Caregiving scale  (Zwicker, 2010), CAPACITY 
measure (Van Houtven et al., 2019), Perceptions of Visit Communication (Talen et al., 
2011), Caregiver Satisfaction with Primary Care Int eractions (Clair et al., 2014; Haley 
et al, 1992), Perceived Self Efficacy in Primary Ca re Interactions (Maly et al., 1998), 
knowledge and use of resources (Thomas et al., 2017 ), caregiver anxiety and 
depressive symptoms (Mauer, 2012; Wild et al., 2014 ), and burden (Zarit, Reever & 
Bach-Peterson, 1980). We will use short forms when possible in order to reduce 
participant burden.  We also developed several spec ific questions about caregivers’ 
perception of the screening tool and knowledge of r esources.  All study instruments are 
attached to the IRB application in the WRG-HS syste m.

4.[ADDRESS_1051870] for their participation in the study and 
the plan to send recruitment letters (postal mail o r email) to their patients and their family 
caregivers. An IRB-approved, informative study flye r will be sent with the recruitment letters 
(via postal mail or email). These meetings will be by [CONTACT_648], Zoom, or in-person if/when 
feasible. Co-investigators will review the consent form with each clinician , allowing for 
questions and reminding him or her that participati on is voluntary.  The co-investigator will 
subsequently ask each clinician who agrees to a) co mplete the pre-intervention survey (which 
will be administered orally by [CONTACT_767071]-inves tigator) and b) review his or her patient list 
and identify individuals who typi[INVESTIGATOR_767064] a caregiver (family or friend). 
When meeting with these clinicians, co-investigator s will verify that the caregiver lives with the 
patient and/or obtain the caregiver contact [CONTACT_767072]. A study team 
member will then query EPIC to determine the dates of upcoming appointments for those 
patients. Pre-notification recruitment letters will  then be sent by [CONTACT_2319], email (when available), 
or Weill/EPIC Connect to the patients and caregiver s of the identified patients one month prior 
to his or her next scheduled appointment. Recruitme nt letters may also be sent to potential 
participants via EPIC Pool of WCM/NYP Consent to be  Contact[CONTACT_57405] (CCR) 
patients and chart review to determine potential el igibility. When possible, letters will be sent 
to the emergency contact (i.e., caregiver) if their  telephone matches that of the patient, or by 
[CONTACT_6968]. The recruitment letter will describe the stu dy and advise potential participants that they 
may decline participation by [CONTACT_767073] a telephone call to the study team. 
Approximately two weeks after the initial letter (p ostal mail or email) is sent, patients and 
caregivers who have not opted-out will be telephone d or emailed by [CONTACT_767071]-investigator 
to confirm their interest. Participants complete th e consent form and pre-visit survey over the

 phone, for both their convenience and safety during  the COVID-19 pandemic. COA waiting 
rooms are presently closed and patients/caregivers are met at the door and brought 
immediately to an exam room. Once these restriction s are lifted, patient/caregiver participants 
will be given the option to complete their informed  consent process and study pre-visit survey 
in the waiting room prior to the patient’s next vis it. Participants who elect to do so in person 
will be asked to arrive 30 minutes prior to their s cheduled visit to ensure sufficient time to 
review the consent form and complete the survey. 
 
Trained co-investigators will use the caregivers’ p referred method of contact [CONTACT_767074] (phone or email) after sending the pre-notification letter. If it is safe to do so 
and if time allows, co-investigators may choose to have participants consent in-person at The 
Center on Aging, and in that case, they will also b e given the first survey at this time prior to 
their health visit.  
 
Caregivers in both the intervention and control gro up will be voluntarily compensated $[ADDRESS_1051871]-visit survey. They will receive an 
additional $10 via ClinCards for their participatio n in each of the follow up surveys (at 2 months 
and 6 months). In total, caregivers may be compensa ted up to $45.

7. Data Reporting / Regulatory Considerations  
 
7.1 Data Collection 
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utili ze REDCap to capture all data for all 
enrolled subjects.  
 
7.1.1 REDCap 
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free  data management software 
system that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421]-Cornell  Medical Center CTSC.  It is a 
tool for the creation of customized, secure data ma nagement systems that include 
Web-based data-entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features 
including user and group-based privileges, authenti cation using institution LDAP 
system, with a full audit trail of data manipulatio n and export procedures.  REDCap 
is maintained on CTSC-owned servers that are backed  up nightly and support 
encrypted (SSL-based) connections.  Nationally, the  software is developed, 
enhanced and supported through a multi-institutiona l consortium led by [CONTACT_767075]. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1051876]/Ethics Committee A pproval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are 
covered, and approval of the appropriate regulatory  bodies obtained, before study 
initiation.  
Before initiation of the study at each study center , the protocol, the ICF, other 
written material given to the patients, and any oth er relevant study documentation 
will be submitted to the appropriate Ethics Committ ee. Written approval of the 
study and all relevant study information must be ob tained before the study center 
can be initiated or the IP is released to the Inves tigator. Any necessary extensions 
or renewals of IEC/IRB approval must be obtained fo r changes to the study, such 
as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other st udy documentation. The written 
approval of the IEC/IRB together with the approved ICF must be filed in the study 
files.  
The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IR B any new information that may 
adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. The 
Protocol # 21-04023513 
Version Date: May 2, 2024 
 
Page # 10 
 Investigator will submit written summaries of the s tudy status to the IEC/IRB as 
required. On completion of the study, the IEC/IRB w ill be notified that the study 
has ended.  
 
All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly reco rded on a protocol amendment 
form and will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_392878] p rotocol approving signatories. 
All protocol amendments will be submitted to the re levant institutional IEC/IRB for 
approval before implementation, as required by [CONTACT_19566] l regulations. The only 
exception will be when the amendment is necessary t o eliminate an immediate 
hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the  necessary action will be taken first, 
with the relevant protocol amendment following shor tly thereafter.  
Once protocol amendments or consent form modificati ons are implemented at the 
lead site, Weill Cornell Medicine, updated document s will be provided to 
participating sites. Weill Cornell Medicine must ap prove all consent form changes 
prior to local IRB submission.  
Relevant study documentation will be submitted to t he regulatory authorities of the 
participating countries, according to local/nationa l requirements, for review and 
approval before the beginning of the study. On comp letion of the study, the 
regulatory authorities will be notified that the st udy has ended.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1051877] been reviewed by [CONTACT_767076], Protocol Review and 
Monitoring Committee, and the Data Safety and Monit oring Committee (WCM 
DSMC), prior to conducting any human subjects resea rch activities. The WCM 
Data Safety and Monitoring Committee has determined  that their oversight & 
monitoring is not required for this low-risk study.  Only surveys and chart 
abstraction are involved and it does not involve th e evaluation of intervention on 
health outcomes of human subjects. 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1051878]’s legally authorized representative prior t o participating in the research 
study.  Subjects who agree to participate will rece ive an oral consent document prior to 
speaking to a co-investigator. 
 
Informed Consent will occur prior to administration  of the pre-visit survey (for caregivers) 
and pre-intervention survey (for clinicians), by [CONTACT_767077]-person

 consent measures are safely feasible.  For oral con sent, a member of the study team will 
review the ICF in-full (see Oral Consent Script att achment) by [CONTACT_648], allowing for 
questions and reminding the potential subject that participation is voluntary. Oral 
confirmation of consent to participate will be docu mented by [CONTACT_118734].   
 
Older adults – who are the focus of this study – ar e at higher risk of severe illness from 
COVID-19. To minimize exposure of this vulnerable g roup, we are requesting a waiver of 
documentation of written consent. We have two point s of justification. First, administering 
oral, rather than written consent would reduce the time participants spend in the waiting 
room prior to the study and unnecessary contact (i. e. with study co-investigators). Second, 
given that the Center on Aging is conducting a comb ination of video and in-person visits, 
oral consent is needed in order to accommodate thos e participants who cannot leave their 
homes at this time.  
 
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised written ICF  and any written information provided 
to the subject must be approved by [CONTACT_57425] . The ICF will adhere to IRB/IEC 
requirements, applicable laws, and regulations.

8. Statistical Considerations 
 
Feasibility and acceptability will be examined by c onducting frequency and descriptive statistics 
(i.e. mean, median, standard deviation, range) for enrollment rates and Likert-scale items 
assessing satisfaction with CHEC and perceived help fulness.  
 
Effectiveness will be measured by [CONTACT_767079] a 
conversation with providers about caregiver needs a nd the receipt of relevant support. The effect 
of CHEC on the primary outcome variable, discussion  of caregivers’ needs, will be examined in a 
general linear mixed model with intervention group and time (pre-posttest) as fixed classification

 factors, and individuals as levels of a random clas sification factor. The model will account for pre-
intervention measures and will include a group x ti me interaction. Additional covariates (e.g., 
caregiver and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039]) and fixed classif ication factors (e.g., caregiver gender, race) will  
also be examined. Prior to model fitting, the distr ibution of all study variables will be assessed. 
 
9. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a ro utine part of clinical research.  Safety is 
monitored by [CONTACT_767080], as well as by [CONTACT_57432], x-rays, 
electrocardiographs, etc. 
 
9.1. Adverse Event Definition 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse ex perience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory findi ng), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, and does not imp ly any judgment about causality. An 
adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e .g., off-label use, use in combination 
with another drug) and with any route of administra tion, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose.  
 
 9.1.1 Adverse Event Characteristics and Related Attributi ons 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descrip tions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporti ng.  A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
• Attribution of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

SYNOPSIS
 
Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_506851] (ESETT)
 
A multicenter, randomized, blinded, comparative effectiveness study of fosphenytoin, valproic
 
acid, or levetiracetam in the emergency department treatment of patients with
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].
 
Objectives:  
​
The 
​
primary 
​
objective is to determine the most effective and/or the least effective
 
treatment of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE) among patients older than 2
 
years.  There are three active treatment arms being compared:  fosphenytoin (FOS),
 
levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA).  The 
​
second 
​
objective is comparison of three drugs
 
with respect to secondary outcomes.  The final objective is to ensure that the trial is
 
informative for treatment of established SE in children by [CONTACT_883136], safety,
 
and rate of adverse reactions of these drugs in children.
 
Primary outcome:  
​
The  primary outcome is clinical cessation of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], determined
 
by [CONTACT_883137], at 60 minutes
 
after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of additional anti-seizure medication. The
 
following
​
 
​
are 
​
secondary outcomes
​
: occurrence of life threatening hypotension or cardiac
 
arrhythmia, time to termination of seizures, intubation, admission to ICU, seizure recurrence,
 
length of stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], mortality, and Richmond agitation and sedation score at
 
60 minutes, will be compared between treatment groups.
 
 
Methods:
​
 This is a randomized, multicenter,  Bayesian response adaptive comparative
 
effectiveness trial of three active treatments in patients with status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883033].  Each subject will be followed until discharge or [ADDRESS_1235498]. This trial will be monitored for early success and futility.
 
 
Inclusion:
​
 Patients greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1235499] an adequate
 
dose of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883034], tonic-clonic convulsion(s).  Adequate doses of
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883035]:  diazepam 10 mg IV, lorazepam 4 mg IV, or
 
midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for all adults and those children greater than or equal to 32 kg, and
 
diazepam 0.3mg/kg IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV for
 
those children less than [ADDRESS_1235500] been administered in two or more
 
divided doses, including in the out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].
 
Interventions and Duration:
​
 The required concentrations of the study drugs (FOS 16.66 mg/ml,
 
VPA 33.33 mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml) will be produced, packaged and labeled by [CONTACT_883138] (GMP) facility and shipped to the study sites.
 
The study drugs are identical in appearance, formulation, packaging, and administration
 
 
 
13
 
 
(including volume and rate of infusion).
​
  
​
The assigned treatment dose (FOS 20 mg/kg, LEV 60
 
mg/kg or VPA 40 mg/kg) will be infused over 10 minutes.  The
​
 
​
study participants will be
 
observed for 20 minutes, while the duration of clinical seizures and response to verbal or
 
painful stimuli is recorded.  At 60 minutes from start of study drug infusion, the primary
 
outcome is determined.
 
Randomization:
​
 Any patient witnessed to have seizures in the emergency department (ED) will
 
be evaluated for enrollment based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Enrollment will occur
 
under exception from informed consent rules (EFIC) due to the emergent and life-threatening
 
nature of SE.  This is an intent-to-treat study so all subjects randomized will be included in the
 
primary analysis.  Time of randomization is the time when the infusion pump, connected to
 
study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is switched on. The randomization scheme will be
 
equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300 subjects are randomized,
 
response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of maximizing the
 
likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.
 
 
Interim  Analyses: 
​
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after [ADDRESS_1235501] 97.5% probability.
 
Sample Size: 
​
This study will  randomize a maximum target of 795 subjects over 4 years, at an
 
accrual rate of approximately 16.5 subjects per month.  This sample size provides
 
approximately  90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15% ).  A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference
 
sufficient to change clinical practice. The trial operating characteristics for this adaptive design
 
were determined via an extensive simulation study, which ensures the type I error probability is
 
less than 0.05 under a variety of scenarios.
​

Participating Sites:
​
 Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_883139]:
 
Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network and Pediatric Emergency Care
 
Applied Research Network (PECARN).  Each network has successfully participated in SE
 
treatment trials in compliance with EFIC regulations.

(between fosphenytoin, levetiracetam and valproic acid) of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-refractory SE
 
among patients greater than or equal to 2 years.  
​
 
​
The  primary outcome is clinical cessation of
 
status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], determined by [CONTACT_883140], at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of

1.2 Secondary Objectives
 
Secondary objectives include: determination of the relative safety of the treatment arms on
 
defined safety outcomes and all adverse events, analysis of secondary efficacy outcomes, and
 
evaluation of both effectiveness and safety in the pediatric subpopulation.

2. BACKGROUND
 
2.1 Rationale
 
SE is defined as a prolonged self-sustaining seizure or recurrent seizures without recovery of
 
consciousness between seizures (Lowenstein 1999).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_883036], VA, found an annual incidence of SE ranging from 41/100,000-61/100,000
 
(DeLorenzo 1996).  Based on these studies, there are approximately 120,000-180,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_883037].  SE affects individuals of all ages from the very young to
 
the elderly.  It complicates many neurological and systemic illnesses.  The mortality associated
 
with SE is estimated as 17%.  SE also leads to morbidity including cognitive defects and
 
neurological injury.  The morbidity and mortality of SE is determined by [CONTACT_883141] (Neligan 2010; Towne 1994). The Febrile status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883038] (FEBSTAT) suggests that SE, but not individual seizures, injures the hippocampus (Nordli,
 
2012; Shinnar 2012).  Early termination of SE can limit development of refractory SE,
 
neurological injury and mortality in experimental animals (Fujikawa 2005; Kapur 1997).  SE is
 
particularly common in children (Shinnar . 1997).  Although multiple different etiologies such as
 
infection, tumors, fever, preexisting neurological injury or brain malformation cause SE, the
 
primary goal of treatment is prompt termination of seizures because adverse consequences of
 
SE increase with seizure duration (Chen 2007; Lothman 1990; Meldrum 1973; Meldrum 1986).
 
 
SE is initially treated with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. This selection is based on three double-blind,
 
randomized, controlled clinical trials (Alldredge 2001; Treiman 1998, SIlbergleit 2012).  In the
 
VA Cooperative Study (Treiman 1998), intravenous lorazepam was found to be superior to
 
phenytoin.  In the Pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883039] (PHTSE) study (Alldredge 2001),
 
lorazepam and diazepam were found to be superior to placebo.  In these studies, lorazepam
 
was effective in terminating SE in 55-65% of patients. The recently published RAMPART study
 
compared intramuscular midazolam to intravenous lorazepam for the initial treatment of SE
 
(Silbergleit 2012).  It concluded that intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as
 
intravenous lorazepam for patients in convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (Silbergleit 2012).
 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883040] (Loddenkemper 2011).  The
 
recently published Pediatric Seizure Study found that lorazepam was not superior to diazepam
 
for pediatric SE (Chamberlain 2014).  Unfortunately, approximately 35-45% of patients are
 
refractory to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-refractory SE is also called established SE.
 
ESETT is a clinical trial testing the relative efficacy and safety of three treatments in patients
 
who do not respond to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_99646] (Cock 2011; Prasad 2005).  The need for such
 
a trial has been emphasized in review articles, guidelines and by [CONTACT_210319] (Lowenstein
 
2005;Meierkord 2010; Wheless 2008).
 
For the purpose of this trial, “established SE (ESE)” is defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_883041]
 
 
 
16
 
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883042]-sustaining (Lothman 1990; Lothman 1989; Treiman
 
1990; VanLandingham 1991a; VanLandingham 1991b).  Ongoing seizures rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883043] (Chen 2007; Macdonald 1999).  This rapid neuronal
 
plasticity is manifested in changes in seizure behavior, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and
 
evolution of neuronal injury and death.  EEGs recorded from patients soon after onset of
 
generalized convulsive SE demonstrate discrete seizures interspersed with normal activity,
 
which evolves to continuous waxing and waning spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]–wave discharges (Treiman 1990).
 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883044] 60-72% of patients.  As time passes,  these drugs become far
 
less effective, terminating seizures in less than 25% of patients (Treiman 1998).
 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883045]-A receptors and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission
 
(Goodkin 2009).  In experimental animals, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883046]--when EEG demonstrates recurrent seizures and
 
behavioral seizures are mild.  Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883047],
 
especially after electrographic seizures have merged and [ADDRESS_1235503] generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Jones 2002; Kapur 1997; Walton 1988; Wang 2009).
 
Studies further reveal that inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by [CONTACT_59716]-A receptors is
 
reduced in the hippocampi [INVESTIGATOR_883048] (Goodkin 2008; Kapur 1995; Kapur 1997; Naylor
 
2005; Terunuma 2008). Biochemical studies reveal a decrease in the number of functional
 
receptors on the post-synaptic membrane in the hippocampi [INVESTIGATOR_883049]
 
(Goodkin 2005; Goodkin 2008; Naylor 2005; Terunuma 2008).  This rapid receptor plasticity is
 
believed to be mediated by [CONTACT_883142], which activate many second messenger
 
pathways (Brunig 2001; Pal 2001).  In summary, prolonged seizures modify GABA-A receptors
 
and lead to ESE.
 
 
Further treatment should ideally focus on mechanisms other than GABA-A receptors, such as
 
sodium channels, calcium channels, or glutamatergic transmission. Currently, there are several
 
drugs available in the intravenous formulation that can modify these systems.  Lacosamide and
 
FOS modify sodium channels.  LEV modifies glutamatergic synaptic transmission by [CONTACT_883143].  VPA  has multiple actions on several neurotransmitter systems
 
and ion channels.  These mechanisms are described in the respective package inserts.
 
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1235504] enter the
 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], access its target and stop ESE. Three drugs were selected for this study based on
 
 
 
17
 
 
current recommendations of professional groups, current clinical practice, and safety and
 
efficacy data.
 
Recently, the Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_883050]
 
(NCS) reviewed current evidence and classified it according to American Heart
 
Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for evidence rating (Brophy 2012).  The
 
Neurocritical Care Society rated common anticonvulsants for the treatment of SE as follows:
 
VPA
​
:  Class IIa, level A—weight of evidence/opi[INVESTIGATOR_883051]/efficacy based on
 
data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials.
 
FOS
​
:  Class IIa, level B--weight of evidence/opi[INVESTIGATOR_883051]/efficacy based on
 
data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized trials.
 
LEV
​
:  Class IIb, level C--weight of evidence/opi[INVESTIGATOR_883051]/efficacy based on
 
consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_449903].
 
These three medications are sometimes referred to by [CONTACT_883144].  Fosphenytoin may
 
referred to as Cerebyx or, inaccurately, as Dilantin, the brand name [CONTACT_883190]-drug.  Levetiracetam may be referred to as Keppra.  Valproic acid may be referred to as
 
Depacon or Depakote.
 
The NCS guidelines recommended use of either FOS or VPA for the treatment of established SE
 
(Brophy 2012).
 
To identify current practice, a critical care pharmacy group studied the patterns of
 
anticonvulsant use for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883052].  This survey analyzed the medical records of 10-[ADDRESS_1235505] agent (75%) for treatment of SE.  FOS was the most
 
commonly used second anticonvulsant (33%).  LEV was less commonly used (10%) and VPA was
 
rarely used (<2 %) (Cook 2012).  The NCS Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_883053] 50 identified experts among neurointensivists, neurologists and
 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_883054].  Among the respondents for this survey, 80% chose
 
FOS (or phenytoin), 6% chose LEV and 2% chose VPA (Riviello 2006).  In a survey of 21 pediatric
 
ED directors from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied  Research Network (PECARN), FOS was
 
the most commonly used treatment for ESE in pediatric patients followed by [CONTACT_883145],
 
phenobarbital, and VPA.
 
Intravenous formulations are available for FOS, LEV, VPA, lacosamide and  phenobarbital. Of
 
these drugs, phenobarbital causes sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], especially in those who
 
have been treated with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. This side effect limits the popularity of phenobarbital
 
 
 
18
 
 
as a second line agent for SE.  The safety of rapid intravenous administration of lacosamide has
 
been established in adults but not in children (Fountain 2012).  Children constitute a large
 
fraction of patients with SE.  Three hundred thirty-six of approximately 795 of subjects to be
 
randomized into this study will be children.  There are limited data on the efficacy of
 
lacosamide in established SE, especially in children.  For these reasons, lacosamide and
 
phenobarbital were not included in the study.
 
2.3  FOS (fosphenytoin)
 
FOS is the most commonly recommended treatment for ESE in many current treatment
 
guidelines (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010) and is generally considered the
 
standard of care.  In a survey of critical care neurologists published in 2003, 95% of responders
 
(n= 106) used FOS or phenytoin for the treatment of ESE (Claassen 2003).  Two more recent
 
surveys suggest that it is currently the most commonly used drug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the US (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012). A survey of pediatric ED physicians belonging to the Pediatric
 
Emergency Care Action Research Network (PECARN) reported that the majority of physicians
 
treating children use FOS for the treatment of ESE.
 
Pharmacokinetics, dose and rate of administration:  By [CONTACT_559], FOS is dosed in phenytoin
 
equivalents (PE). In this protocol, all FOS doses given in mg indicate mg PE whether explicitly
 
stated or not.  In order to achieve rapid termination of seizures, drugs need to be administered
 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  Drugs are delivered over a 10 minute infusion period in ESETT.  FOS can  be
 
administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg/min in order to avoid hypotension and cardiac
 
arrhythmias (see boxed warning, package insert).  This limits the maximum dose of the drug
 
that can be administered safely over 10 minutes to 1500 mg.  The recommended loading dose
 
of FOS is 18-20 mg/kg.  Therefore, patients weighing less than 75 kg will receive a loading dose
 
20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 1500 mg
 
over 10 minutes.  Because more than 65% of adult men and 45% of adult women weigh more
 
than 75 kg, weight-based dosing will typi[INVESTIGATOR_883055].  This
 
dosing regimen is consistent with current recommendation for the use of anticonvulsants,
 
where children are dosed on a mg/kg basis while adults are given fixed doses (see package
 
insert phenytoin, LEV, and VPA).  In general, children are given larger doses of anticonvulsants
 
because of differences in the pharmacokinetics.

Figure 1.  (Fischer 2003)
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of FOS (1200 mg) administered at the rate of 150 mg phenytoin
 
equivalents (PE)/min is illustrated in Figure 1 (Fischer 2003). Most clinically relevant is panel d
 
showing unbound (free) phenytoin plasma concentrations following administration.  These
 
remain in 2.0- 3.0 mg/L range 90 minutes after administration.  The accepted therapeutic range
 
of unbound plasma concentration is 1 to 2 mg/L.  Patients receiving a single dose of FOS (1500
 
mg) are expected to maintain a free phenytoin concentration above 2 mg/L for [ADDRESS_1235506] be converted to phenytoin (PHT) to exert its action (Walton 1990).
 
FOS has to undergo dephosphorylation before it can enter the brain. Figure 2 illustrates the
 
rate of accumulation of PHT in rat plasma and brain after single intraperitoneal injection of FOS
 
(called ACC 9653 at the time of publication) or PHT (Walton 1990). Note that peak plasma PHT
 
concentration was achieved [ADDRESS_1235507] partial onset seizures and
 
secondarily generalized seizures, but its efficacy in primary generalized seizures is not
 
established.  It exerts its anticonvulsant action by [CONTACT_883146] (Macdonald 1994). FOS gets converted into phenytoin and enters the brain. FOS can
 
be administered faster than phenytoin.

       Figure 2.  (Walton 1990)
 
Safety:  According to the package insert, the dose of IV FOS (15 to 20 mg PE/kg) that is used to
 
treat status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883056] a maximum rate of 150 mg PE/min to avoid
 
cardiovascular side effects.  Hypotension may occur, especially after IV administration at high
 
doses and high rates of administration.  Severe cardiovascular reactions and fatalities, such as
 
atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation, have been reported
 
following PHT administration, especially in elderly or gravely ill patients. These complications
 
are less frequent with FOS, but careful cardiac monitoring is still needed when administering IV
 
loading doses of FOS. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be
 
necessary. This ESETT protocol calls for these reductions if needed while administering the
 
study drug.
 
 
Rash: Exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous, rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_883057].
 
 
Hepatotoxicity: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic
 
failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These incidents have been associated with a
 
hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_411], skin eruptions, and lymphadenopathy, and
 
usually occur within the first 2 months of treatment. Other common manifestations include
 
jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.
 
The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal
 
outcomes.
 
Hemopoietic system:  thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235508] additional significant clinical risk in a
 
recent Cochrane meta-analysis (Bromley 2014).  Theoretical risks are related to prolonged
 
exposures rather than single dose exposures as in this trial.  Theoretical risks include  congenital
 
malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Increased frequencies of major
 
malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial
 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and mental
 
deficiency have been reported among children born to epi[INVESTIGATOR_883058]. Patients known to be
 
pregnant will be excluded from this trial anyway as per the secretarial waiver allowing studies
 
with EFIC.
 
Efficacy in animal studies:  Fosphenytoin and PHT are not effective in termination of
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883059].  In an electrical stimulation model where
 
excitatory inputs to the hippocampus were stimulated (perforant path) for 60 minutes, the
 
resulting in-animal model ESE was not terminated by [CONTACT_639600] ( 50 mg/kg) given intravenously
 
(Mazarati 1998).  In another animal model of ESE based on electrical stimulation of the
 
hippocampus for 90 minutes, phenytoin did not suppress seizures (Prasad 2002).  Finally, in a
 
cholinergic stimulation (nerve agent-induced) animal model ESE, FOS had little or no
 
therapeutic effect either administered alone or in combination with diazepam (McDonough
 
2004).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  In open-label studies for initial treatment of SE, the reported efficacy
 
of PHT in terminating SE ranges from 44-88%  (Trinka 2009).  In the VA Cooperative study
 
(Treiman 1998), PHT was effective in initial treatment of convulsive SE in 42% of patients, but in
 
only 7.7 % patients with subtle SE.  Effectiveness in ESE was not studied.   A systematic,
 
retrospective analysis concluded that phenytoin was effective in 58.6% of patients with SE who
 
did not respond to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (Alvarez 2011).
 
 
2.4  LEV (levetiracetam)
 
Recently published guidelines for  the treatment of ESE in adults and children recommend LEV
 
as an alternative to FOS (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010).  In surveys of
 
experts and pediatric ED physicians, LEV is the second most commonly used drug for the
 
treatment of ESE in neurological intensive care units (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  It is used for
 
the treatment of partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures and seizures
 
associated with juvenile myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  It binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2)  and
 
modulates neurotransmission.  An intravenous formulation of the drug has been available for
 
several years and it is labelled for use when patients cannot swallow or for initiating therapy for
 
 
 
22
 
 
seizure.
 
 
Pharmacokinetics & safety:  Doheny et al investigated the plasma and brain concentrations of
 
LEV after bolus intraperitoneal injection of 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg of the drug to rats. Serum LEV
 
concentration increases and peaks rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375],  but brain accumulation is slow and peaks 90-100
 
minutes after administration (Doheny 1999).
 
 
Dose and rate of administration:  The recommended LEV dose in children up to 40 kg is 20-60
 
mg/kg per day (package insert).  In adults, the recommended dose range is 1-[ADDRESS_1235509] been given over 15 minutes safely in
 
adults (Ramael 2006a).  The common adverse effects in these patients were dizziness,
 
somnolence, irritability and headache (Ramael 2006a). Based on these considerations, subjects
 
weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose 60 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75
 
kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 4500 mg over 10 minutes.
 
  Figure 3.  (Ramael 2006b)
 
Figure 3 demonstrates the pharmacokinetics of LEV following injection of 2000, 3000 or 4000
 
mg of the drug (Ramael 2006b).  It is noteworthy that within 15 minutes of injection the plasma
 
concentration of LEV peaks and remains above 40 µg /ml for 9 hours. The therapeutic
 
concentration of LEV is considered to be 12 to 46 µg /ml.  Therefore, patients treated with LEV
 
are likely to have therapeutic concentrations of the drug for 8 to 10 hours after the start of
 
infusion.
 
Safety: Suicidal ideation: Chronic administration of LEV increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or
 
behavior. Patients treated with LEV for should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of
 
depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.
 
 
 
23
 
 
Risk of suicidal ideation associated with a single dose of LEV is unknown.
 
 
CNS:  CNS effects include somnolence and fatigue, coordination difficulties, and behavioral
 
abnormalities observed in pediatric and adult population.
 
Hematopoietic:  Minor, but statistically significant, decreases in total mean RBC count (0.03 x
 
106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in
 
LEV-treated adult and pediatric patients in placebo-controlled trials.
 
Pregnancy Risks:  The best available evidence is that there are no risks related to pregnancy
 
from the administration of levetiracetam in humans.  Current data suggests that the overall risk
 
of major malformation after first trimester exposure to levetiracetam is within the population
 
baseline risk of 1-3%, with no apparent adverse effects on long term child development. The
 
effect of a single dose of LEV has not been studied, but would be of lower risk than repeated
 
dosing (Chaudhry SA, 2014, Bromley 2014).
 
 
Efficacy in animal model ESE:  LEV administered alone reduced the duration of  perforant path
 
stimulation–induced animal ESE (Mazarati 2004).  When used in combination with diazepam,
 
low doses of LEV rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883060] (Mazarati 2004).  In the
 
cholinergic stimulation animal model of ESE, LEV administered alone suppressed behavioral
 
seizures, but EEG seizures continued unabated (Zheng 2010).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  Although no randomized controlled clinical trial for this agent has
 
been performed, a large number of open case series and reports have been published.  An
 
analysis of publications until 2009 reported that 707 patients with various forms of SE had been
 
treated with LEV.  The success rate was about 70% (Trinka 2011).  In ESE, the efficacy of LEV is
 
reported as 51.7 % in one study (Alvarez 2011) and 73.2% in another study (Tripathi 2010).
 
 
2.5  VPA (valproic acid)
 
VPA was recommended for the treatment of ESE in recent guidelines (Brophy 2012; Meierkord
 
2010). In surveys, VPA is the third or 4
​
th
​
 most commonly used drug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the U.S. (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  VPA is an anticonvulsant commonly used for the treatment
 
of primary generalized seizures, myoclonic seizures and focal seizures. The drug has multiple
 
actions on the GABA neurotransmitter system and calcium channels (Macdonald 1995).
 
Valproate sodium is the salt of the valproate ion which is synonymous with VPA.
 
 
 
24
 
 
  Figure 4.  (Limdi 2007)
 
Pharmacokinetics:  Subjects weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over
 
10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 3000 mg over 10
 
minutes. Based on published pharmacokinetic data (Limdi 2007), serum VPA levels will peak
 
between 150-200 mg/L within minutes of administration and then remain in the 50-150 mg/L
 
range for the next 4 hours (see Figure 4).  Pharmacokinetics of IV VPA has been studied in
 
children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Birnbaum 2003; Panomvana Na 2006; Ramsay 2003; Visudtibhan 2011;
 
Williams 2012).  Recent studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of rapid intravenously
 
administered  VPA conforms to models developed using oral VPA in children and oral and
 
intravenous VPA in adults (Williams 2012).  Intravenous VPA is safe in acutely ill children with
 
recurrent seizures and in those with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Birnbaum 2003; Ramsay 2003).
 
Dose and rate of administration: Recommended VPA dose ranges from 15-45 mg/kg/day.  VPA
 
has been administered rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883061].  In one study it was administered at
 
the rate of up to 10 mg/kg/minute for doses up to 30 mg/kg (Limdi 2005).  In another study in
 
children it was given at rates up to 11 mg/kg/min for dose up to 40 mg/kg (Venkataraman 1999;
 
Wheless 2004). The most common adverse events were injection site pain, pain with infusion,
 
dizziness, and somnolence. Based on these considerations, subjects weighing up to 75 kg will
 
receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over [ADDRESS_1235510] a higher than expected  incidence of reduced  cognitive
 
performance at ages 3 and 4.5 (McVearry 2009; Meador 2009; Werler 2011).  These risks  are
 
dose dependent and vary across studies.  They have only been found to be are associated with
 
chronic administration of VPA (Bromley 2014).  There is no evidence that a single dose of VPA
 
 
 
25
 
 
given during pregnancy can cause birth defects.
 
In a series of reviews of hepatotoxicity associated with VPA, Dreifuss and colleagues concluded
 
that the
​
 
​
 primary risk of fatal hepatic dysfunction (1/500) was found in children 0 to 2 years old
 
receiving VPA as polytherapy. The risk declined with age and was low in patients receiving VPA
 
as monotherapy (1/37,000). No hepatic fatalities occurred in patients above the age of 10 years
 
receiving VPA as monotherapy (Bryant 1996; Dreifuss 1987; Dreifuss 1989).  There are reports
 
that polymerase c gene (POLG) determines the risk of VPA -induced hepatotoxicity (Stewart
 
2010).   However, the POLG polymorphisms were discovered in patients who had been
 
chronically treated with VPA and had elevated hepatic enzymes.  The authors concluded that
 
the genetic variants reduced the regenerative capacity of the hepatocytes following injury.
 
Patients with mutations in POLG have metabolic encephalopathy. There is no report of
 
hepatotoxicity associated with a single dose of VPA.  Patients below age 2, and those with
 
known or suspected metabolic encephalopathy are excluded from  ESETT.
 
 
Exclusion of patients known to be pregnant, younger than [ADDRESS_1235511] the known
 
morbidity and mortality of ESE and compared to the risk of administering FOS.
 
Clinical studies:  VPA has been used for the treatment of SE in prospective or retrospective
 
series and two randomized open trials (Trinka 2009). An analysis of these trials reported that
 
[ADDRESS_1235512] been treated with VPA and the response rate ranging from 60-
 
83% of patients.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_883062] a trend towards
 
superiority of VPA to phenytoin in treatment of SE (Misra 2006).  Another study reported that
 
VPA controlled SE refractory to PHT (Agarwal 2007).
 
2.6  Systematic comparison of FOS, VPA, and LEV for the treatment of ESE
 
There is one systematic study of treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  In a retrospective analysis of
 
protocol-driven treatment of ESE,  279 adult epi[INVESTIGATOR_883063] a non-randomized un-blinded fashion after
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883064] (labeled Alvarez in figure 5 below). VPA failed to control SE in 25.4%,
 
PHT in 41.4% and LEV in 48.3% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Because patients were not balanced with regards
 
to etiology and severity of SE, a post-hoc adjustment for severity and etiology was performed.
 
After this adjustment the authors reported that LEV failed more often than VPA (Odds ratio
 
(OR) 2.69: 95% confidence interval 1.16-6.08)).  PHT was not significantly different from the
 
other two compounds. The authors concluded that LEV is less effective than VPA for control of
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235513] study
 
(labeled Agarwal on figure 5), one hundred patients aged two or older who had failed IV
 
diazepam were randomized to either 20 mg/kg of VPA or 20 mg/kg of PHT.  SE was controlled in
 
44 (88%) patients treated with VPA and 42 (81%) patients treated with PHT (Agarwal 2007).  No
 
significant difference was found between VPA and PHT in this open-labeled study.  In the
 
second study (Tripathi 2010)  patients were randomized  to IV LEV or IV VPA after failing
 
diazepam treatment of SE.  Status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883065] 30 patients and by [CONTACT_883147] 28 patients.  In this study as well, there was no significant difference between LEV and
 
VPA.  In summary, one large head-to-head comparison of these three agents raised the
 
possibility that VPA is superior to LEV for the treatment of ESE.  The other studies were
 
inconclusive.  Expert evaluation of the published data suggests that VPA (Class IIa level A) may
 
be superior to  FOS (Class IIa level B), which may be superior to LEV (class IIb level C).
 
 
 
Figure 5.  (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011, Tripathi 2010)
 
In summary, current practice is to treat ESE with FOS or LEV.  However no randomized
 
controlled trials have demonstrated their efficacy in terminating ESE.  Non-randomized and
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_883066].  Most expert ED physicians,
 
neurologists, neuro-intensivists and pediatric neurologists believe that the next logical step is a
 
randomized, blinded comparative efficacy study to decide the best treatment for ESE (Brophy
 
2012; Cock 2011; Loddenkemper 2011; Shorvon 2011; Trinka 2009).
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235514] failed treatment with
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Subjects will initially be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Once 300 subjects are
 
randomized, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.  Interim analyses are
 
planned after 400, 500, 600, and [ADDRESS_1235515] occurred prior to arrival in the ED.
 
Adequate doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883067]: diazepam 10 mg IV,
 
lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for all adults and those children greater than
 
or equal to 32 kg.  For children less than 32 kg adequate doses are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV,
 
lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV and midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV.  These drugs may have
 
been administered in two or more divided doses.  The last dose of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883068] [ADDRESS_1235516] practice
 
(subject to local standards of care) is to administer [ADDRESS_1235517] of treatment:
 
 
For all adults and those children 
≥
 32
 
kg adequate doses are:
 
diazepam 10 mg IV or PR, or
 
 
lorazepam 4 mg IV, or

For children <32 kg adequate doses
 
are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV or PR, or
 
lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV, or
 
 
midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM - 0.2 mg/kg IV
 
For purposes of this study, IO is
 
considered equivalent to IV.  For
 
midazolam, IN or PB are considered
 
equivalent to IM.

5. Informed Consent and Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC)
 
Respect for human subjects and their safety are paramount in this trial.  Research involving
 
subjects who have SE, however, presents an ethical challenge.  Protecting patient autonomy
 
through the informed consent process is typi[INVESTIGATOR_883070], but because patients in generalized SE are unconscious, an informed consent process
 
is not possible and patients cannot say whether or not they would want to participate in the
 
research.  Furthermore the alternative process of identifying and obtaining surrogate informed
 
consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR) is not practicable in SE, because the
 
emergency treatment being studied must be initiated as quickly as possible to safely care for
 
the patient.  Identification of the optimal emergency care for those in SE in this trial can
 
therefore only be conducted with exception from informed consent (EFIC) for emergency
 
research.  This section will explain the processes used in this trial and the detailed rationale for
 
compliance with the FDA regulations for EFIC found at [ADDRESS_1235519] be unconscious from generalized SE, so no one can consent for themselves, and
 
the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883071] (LAR) even if they are present.  Emergency
 
treatment must be given quickly because every minute of delay decreases the likelihood that an
 
anticonvulsant medication will be effective at terminating seizures, and patient morbidity and
 
mortality increase with increasing seizure duration.  Therefore, the delay related to any
 
meaningful and compliant informed consent process is unsafe, impracticable, and would not be
 
ethical.  It is also not practicable to identify and consent patients prior to developi[INVESTIGATOR_883072]
 
35-50% of patients who have SE are new onset, and even in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], SE is a
 
relatively uncommon and unpredictable manifestation.  It is not possible to predict who will
 
have SE.
 
 
A more detailed EFIC Plan document for the trial can be found in the Manual of Procedures
 
(MoP).  The investigational new drug application for this trial is identified as using EFIC.
 
Investigators at each site will perform community consultation and public disclosure as
 
discussed below, and these will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_883150].
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1235520]’s medical record through
 
the shorter of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] [ADDRESS_1235521]’s family or LAR will
 
be obtained.  After allowing a two to four week period of grieving, the site study team will send
 
a letter with basic information about the clinical investigation, the subject’s inclusion, and
 
contact [CONTACT_883151].
 
5.3  Assessment of Notification and Consent Processes
 
 
Notification and informed consent logs are incorporated in the study case report forms and will
 
allow tracking and reporting of the timeliness of these processes.  In addition, subjects and
 
LAR’s participating in notification and consent processes may be offered an opportunity to
 
share their experience and attitudes by [CONTACT_49419] a standardized survey up to day following an
 
informed consent or withdrawal.  This information will be used for process improvement and to
 
better understand the subject or LAR perspective on emergency research.
 
5.4  Compliance with Criteria and Processes Required for EFIC
 
FDA regulations identify the specific circumstances in which EFIC is appropriate.  ESETT fulfills
 
these requirements for emergency research.  In the following section, the components of the
 
regulation are reproduced, along with an explanation of how ESETT will comply with each
 
requirement.
 
 
SE is life-threatening and available treatments are unsatisfactory or unproven.
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are
 
 
 
34
 
 
unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include
 
evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine
 
the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.
 
Population studies of the incidence of SE report an incidence of between 41-61/100,000.  The
 
mortality rate is estimated to be greater than 17% (Neligan 2010).
 
The Cochrane review of anticonvulsant therapy for SE found eleven studies with [ADDRESS_1235522] effective agent and will terminate SE in
 
only 60-70% of patients with this life-threatening condition.  Because 30-40% of patients do not
 
respond to first-line therapy for SE, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883073].  The three
 
anticonvulsant medications studied in this trial are often used as second-line therapy to treat
 
these patients but are unproven.  There are no randomized, prospective, adequately controlled
 
trials to confirm whether one or more of these medications are either effective or safe in these
 
patients.
 
 
Clinical trials are clearly needed.  No blinded, sufficiently powered prospective, randomized
 
controlled trial has compared treatments for seizures refractory to initial benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883074]. Currently published treatment guidelines recommend intravenous FOS as
 
second-line treatment, with LEV and VPA as alternatives (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011;
 
Meierkord 2010).  However, there are small, open-label randomized studies that suggest the
 
potential efficacy of VPA over LEV in treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  A series of clinical
 
observations suggest that LEV and VPA are safe and effective in the treatment of ESE (Trinka
 
2009; Trinka 2011).
 
Obtaining prospective informed consent is not feasible.
 
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: (i) the subjects will not be
 
able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition; (ii) the intervention under
 
investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized
 
representatives is feasible; and (iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the
 
individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.
 
Subjects in generalized status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883075]. The care of patients in status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883076], which, in the Emergency Department care of patients with
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883077].
 
 
Complications of prolonged seizures include impaired ventilation and subsequent pulmonary
 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], cardiac dysrhythmias, derangements of metabolic and autonomic function, and
 
direct injury to the nervous system.  Seizures of short duration may be clinically benign, but
 
longer durations are associated with increasingly severe morbidity and mortality. There is no
 
specific identifiable threshold for seizure duration that predicts the onset of morbidity, and
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235523] demonstrated the duration of SE is associated with death and unfavorable
 
neurologic outcomes (Maegaki 2005, Holtkamp 2005). While many of these data concern long
 
durations of SE lasting hours or days, data also suggest that differences of as little as a few
 
minutes in seizure duration are also associated with differences in outcome. Patients found in
 
SE by [CONTACT_883152] 32% as compared to 73% in patients whose seizures
 
persisted on arrival to the ED. In a randomized trial, patients with SE treated with lorazepam or
 
diazepam in the field by [CONTACT_883153][INVESTIGATOR_883078] 7.7% and 4.5%
 
respectively, which was less than half the mortality of 15.7% for patients in whom
 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_883079] (Alldredge 2001).
 
The benefits of emergent treatment and termination of SE likely result from minimizing the
 
consequences of impaired ventilation, pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], hemodynamic instability, or
 
metabolic derangements associated with prolonged convulsions. Rapid termination of seizures
 
may also prevent kindling effects demonstrated in animal models in which seizures become
 
more refractory to subsequent treatment as the duration of seizure increases (Morimoto 2004).
 
Rapid treatment may also prevent the neuronal cell injury and loss that occurs with increasing
 
duration of seizures due to duration dependent cytokine mediated effects (Ravizza 2005).
 
Since status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883080] a variety of acute and unpredictable etiologies, there
 
is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for
 
participation in the research. Furthermore, status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883081], precluding prospective identification. This was confirmed in data from
 
Baren et al that found prospective identification of subjects for the PECARN Pediatric Seizure
 
Study to be infeasible (Baren 2006).
 
Participation holds prospect of direct benefit to subjects
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the
 
subjects because: (i) subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;
 
(ii) appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information
 
derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide
 
a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and (iii) risks associated with the investigation are
 
reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of
 
subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and
 
benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.
 
Participation in ESETT holds out the prospect of direct benefit to subjects. Subjects may directly
 
benefit from participation because status epi[INVESTIGATOR_128004] a life-threatening condition and some of
 
the interventions used in this study may be more effective than others.   Studies in
 
experimental SE in animals suggest that LEV may terminate established SE but that FOS, the
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235524] commonly used, fails to do so (Mazarati 1998; McDonough 2004; Prasad 2002).
 
Some observational clinical data also suggests that FOS or its active metabolite PHT are not the
 
most effective second-line agents (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011).  The use of response adaptive
 
randomization in this trial increases the probability that those enrolled later in the trial will be
 
more likely to be randomized to the more effective arm if there is a more effective arm.
 
The trial can not be practicably carried out without exception from informed consent
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.
 
This research could not be carried out without EFIC because treatment for SE needs to begin
 
immediately upon ED arrival.  Since SE patients are unable to consent for themselves and there
 
is not time to obtain consent from an LAR, all patients must be enrolled under EFIC.  A
 
meaningful informed consent process requires that the LAR have time to understand the
 
material presented, be able to ask questions and have time to think about what the patient
 
would want.  This is not possible in the brief period in which the study drug is obtained and
 
initiated.  In ESE, time to treatment is especially critical.  Inability to obtain informed consent
 
can limit the ability to discover better treatments for this critical and life-threatening condition.
 
 
Need for immediate treatment of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883082]
 
21 CFR 50.24 (a)(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic
 
window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a
 
legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to
 
asking the legally authorized representative contact[CONTACT_883154]. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_883155].
 
The narrow therapeutic window described above, the inability of patients with SE to
 
communicate, and the inherent delay in delivery of standard therapy in attempts to contact
 
[CONTACT_883156] a surrogate decision maker preclude the possibility of obtaining
 
informed consent for any potential subject in ESETT.  Attempts to contact [CONTACT_883157].
 
Provision of an informed consent document
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an
 
informed consent document consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent
 
document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations
 
where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved
 
procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to
 
object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of
 
this section.
 
A written informed consent document prepared at each site for this study must be reviewed

and approved by [CONTACT_883158]’s approving this clinical investigation. Subjects enrolled in
 
ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are informed of the subject’s
 
inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible opportunity. The study team is
 
immediately notified of the arrival of treated subjects in the emergency department (ED). An on
 
call study team member quickly responds to the ED to complete the subject enrollment. The
 
subject (or LAR or family) is approached, and an informed consent process initiated as soon as
 
possible. The study team notifies the subject or LAR/family about the subject’s enrollment,
 
provides information about the study and about the subject’s rights and the responsibilities of
 
the investigators, and answers any questions about the study and further participation. A
 
written informed consent document is used to reinforce the information provided verbally and
 
to document a decision to either continue in the study or to not participate any further. A copy
 
of this form is provided to the subject and another copy is placed in the research record.
 
 
Community Consultation
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: (i) consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_264964]) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted
 
and from which the subjects will be drawn
 
The community will be consulted prior to the initiation of research.  With guidance from the
 
each site’s IRB, the community will be asked to give their opi[INVESTIGATOR_883083].  A menu of
 
options is included in the detailed EFIC plan in the MoP and includes mechanisms such as
 
community meetings, town hall meetings, focus groups, meetings with established community
 
advisory boards, in-person surveys, and random-digit dialing surveys.  The specific type of
 
community consultation will be determined by [CONTACT_25733]’s IRB.  Reporting of community
 
consultation results will be standardized across the ESETT sites.
 
Public Disclosure
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
.(ii) Public disclosure to the communities in which  the clinical investigation will
 
be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical
 
investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; (iii) Public disclosure
 
of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community
 
and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population,
 
and its results
 
Public disclosure is the primary element in making certain that ESETT is conducted in an entirely
 
transparent manner. Methods of announcing information about the trial, and the development
 
of advertising and other materials about the trial, will take place both locally and nationally.
 
Public disclosure will be initiated prior to approval of the trial, may continue during enrollment,
 
and will conclude with dissemination of study results after the trial is completed. A menu and
 
discussion of many public disclosure methods and procedures is detailed in the EFIC plan in the
 
 
 
38
 
 
MoP.  Each site IRB will determine the type and form of local public disclosure.  Reporting of
 
public disclosure efforts will be standardized. Summaries of public disclosure will be reported to
 
each IRB, and composite reports of local and national public disclosure at the trial-level will be
 
provided to the FDA docket.
 
Data Monitoring Committee
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least:

oversight of the clinical investigation;
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is appointed by [CONTACT_883159], per institute guidelines. The
 
members will have a meeting with the study team prior to study commencement to discuss the
 
protocol as well as content and format of the DSMB reports. The SDMC will prepare requested
 
reports at specified time intervals. Data and safety monitoring will be performed consistent
 
with the guidance provided by [CONTACT_883160] 98-084 “Policy for data and safety monitoring”
 
and OD-00-038 “Further guidance on data and safety monitoring for phase I and phase II trials”,

representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting
 
to contact [CONTACT_861041]'s family member who is not a legally
 
authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the
 
clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_883163].
 
It will not be ethically possible in ESETT, for the reasons described above, to delay treatment of
 
the seizing subject long enough to contact [CONTACT_883164]. A provision
 
of the protocol has been made to allow subjects that learn of the trial through public disclosure
 
efforts or other means, and who would not want to participate if treated in the ED for status
 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], to communicate that decision to the ED without causing any delay in treatment. As
 
part of the primary assessment of a seizing patient, ED providers already check for medical alert
 
jewelry to ascertain emergent medical information about the patient. If the words “ESETT
 
declined,” or alternative designation as defined in the MoP, are listed on the medical alert tag,
 
the patient will not be enrolled in the clinical investigation. Medical alert tags are commonly
 
used by [CONTACT_219691][INVESTIGATOR_883084], and provide a means of communication that does not
 
require such patients to wear any extra marker. Since they are already worn daily, they do not
 
require additional effort to use once information is added to the tag. The tags are common and
 
effective for communicating information to medics while still being inconspi[INVESTIGATOR_157419]. Use of this
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235525] Enrollment Notification and Consent to Continue
 
21 CFR 50.24(b) The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the
 
earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally
 
authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a
 
family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the investigation
 
and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that
 
there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally
 
authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a
 
family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time without
 
penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a legally authorized
 
representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition
 
improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is entered into a clinical
 
investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or
 
family member can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], information about the clinical investigation is to be provided to
 
the subject's legally authorized representative or family member, if feasible.
 
Subjects enrolled in ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are
 
informed of the subject’s inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible
 
opportunity as detailed above and in the MoP. It is anticipated that the notification of subjects,
 
or their families or LAR, will most commonly take place in the ED within hours of subject
 
enrollment. Attempts to notify the subject or an LAR are repeated until successful. All
 
notification attempts are logged and recorded in the subjects online case report form in
 
WebDCU
™
. Reports of these logs will be available for inclusion in annual reports to the
 
respective IRBs.
 
Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
 
21 CFR 50.24(c) Like other IRB records, records of the determinations above must be kept for a
 
minimum of three years after the completion of the clinical investigation. Again, like other IRB
 
records, these are subject to inspection and copying by [CONTACT_8415].
 
Records documenting the enrollment of patients using EFIC, procedures for notification of
 
enrollment, and informed consent forms will be kept for a minimum of three years after
 
completion of the clinical investigation.
 
IND Requirement
 
21 CFR 50.24(d) Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this
 
section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or
 
investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may
 
include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE
 
is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists.
 
Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under Secs.

appropriate for the proposed trial.
 
Communication of IRB Determinations
 
21 CFR 50.24(e) If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the
 
investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under paragraph (a) of this
 
section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and
 
provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the
 
clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this
 
information to FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked to
 
participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to other
 
IRBs that have been, or are, asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by [CONTACT_883165].
 
If an application for ESETT is disapproved by a local IRB at any site, the Hub principal

6. STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE
 
6.1  Screening
 
The goal is to include all eligible patients who present to participating EDs.  All patients
 
presenting with a diagnosis of seizures or convulsions will be evaluated for participation in the
 
study.  A screen failure log will include patients with a diagnosis of seizures or status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883086].
 
 
6.2  Enrollment
 
Study processes will not delay clinical treatment.  When an eligible patient presents to the
 
emergency department, the clinical team will access the age appropriate ESETT “use next” box.
 
To ensure treatment is not delayed, the “use next” box must be easily accessible and
 
maintained in proximity to patient care in the ED.  Most often, this will be in the secured ED
 
medication dispensing system or the ED pharmacy.
 
 
The clinical team opens the “use next” box.  The protocol assist device is activated.  The weight
 
based infusion rate is determined from the dose administration chart.  If the patient is a child,
 
the length based weight estimation tool is used to determine dose unless an accurate weight is
 
known.  An infusion pump is programmed with the determined rate and the infusion line is
 
primed.  The infusion is then started and the timer is started on the protocol assist device.
 
 
The study team should be alerted at this time, if not already done.
 
Study drug is administered by [CONTACT_883167] (except as noted in section 7.3).  The
 
infusion is then discontinued and discarded.  The patient should then be observed for [ADDRESS_1235527]’s participation and to determine
 
consent to continue.  The study team maintains a log of attempts to locate an LAR, of
 
notifications, and of consent decisions.
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235528] the
 
spent “use next” box and protocol assist device, and will process, reload, and place a new “use
 
next” box.
 
6.4  Blood Draw
 
Up to 2 tubes of blood, approximately 5 mL total (2.5 mL each), may be drawn from a subset of
 
subjects after the study drug infusion to confirm drug levels and accurate assignment as needed
 
to ensure study performance.
 
6.[ADDRESS_1235529]’s weight may
 
be obtained from reliable caregivers or records.  In children, if an accurate weight is not known,
 
dose will be determined using the length-based weight/dose estimation tool included in the
 
“use next” box, (akin to the Broselow tape).  In adults and the elderly, weight will be estimated
 
in the manner as in standard care for weight-based dosing of other resuscitation/critical care
 
drugs.  A measured weight may also be used if available, but it is expected that the clinical
 
scenario will usually preclude weighing the subject.
 
 
7.2  Study drug administration
 
Study drugs will be administered intravenously.  For purposes of this study, intraosseous (IO)
 
access will always be considered equivalent to IV access.  Infusion pumps will be used to ensure
 
that study drug is administered over 10 minutes.
 
 
The infusion pump will be programmed to deliver the volume/rate indicated on the dose
 
administration chart (table 3).  The volume and rate will be confirmed by a second nurse.

If hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia occur during study drug infusion, the infusion rate will be
 
reduced by 50% (increasing the infusion time and maintaining the planned volume).
 
In this context, hypotension is defined as sustained systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg in
 
subjects 13 years and older, <80 mm Hg for 7 years to <13 years, and <70 mm Hg for 2 years to
 
<[ADDRESS_1235532] not delay treatment.   To complete
 
the randomization quickly, the study drug will be preassigned using a central randomization
 
process via WebDCU.  The mortality associated with SE and etiology of SE varies with age. In
 
addition, certain adverse effects of drugs such as hypotension are more common in the elderly
 
compared to the pediatric age group. For these reasons, randomization assignments will be
 
stratified by [CONTACT_551] (less than 18 years, 18-65 years, and greater than 65 years).
 
 
Prior to enrollment at each site, the randomization assignment is made [for each of the three
 
age strata]. The assigned study drug is installed in the “use next” box.  When the next eligible
 
subject at the clinical site is identified, the ED nurse or physician, selects the “use next” box [for
 
that stratum].
 
 
Once the infusion pump, connected to study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is turned on,
 
the patient is considered to have been randomized into the study.  After a patient is
 
randomized and the study team member enters the randomization form into WebDCU, the
 
next treatment assignment is made, and a new “use next” box can be prepared.  Hence, after
 
each subject is randomized, the treatment assignment is made for the subsequent subject
 
(within that stratum) once the current subject’s randomization data are entered into WebDCU.
 
Sites may also be contact[CONTACT_883168] “use
 
next” box when randomization in the trial is updated.
 
 
7.5  Study Drug
 
Study drug will be produced at the central pharmacy, a GMP facility at University of [LOCATION_004],
 
Davis.  Diluted formulations are expected to remain stable for months when stored at 2-8 °C.
 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_883087].
 
All three formulations will be pale yellow solutions.  None are reported to consistently cause
 
infusion-site adverse effects.  The method of drug administration, including volume and rate of
 
infusion is identical for all three drugs.  These factors ensure that drug administration will be
 
 
 
46
 
 
blinded.
 
The drugs will be formulated in the following concentrations:  FOS 16.66 mg PE/ml, VPA 33.33
 
mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml.  The dose will be FOS 20 mg PE/kg, VPA 40 mg/kg, and LEV 60 mg/kg,
 
increasing up to a weight of 75 kg.  At this weight the maximum safe dose for a 10 minute
 
infusion period for adults is reached.  A 10 kg patient would receive drug infusion at the rate of
 
1.2 ml/min and those weighing 75 kg or more will receive drugs at an infusion rate of 9 ml/min.
 
 
7.6  Study Drug Packaging
 
 
Study drug will be prepared in 100 mL glass vials, labeled as investigational, and coded with
 
unique human readable ID numbers and barcodes.  Because this is a blinded study, nobody at
 
the site (local pharmacy, clinical team, and study team) will know whether the next assignment
 
is FOS, VPA, or LEV.
 
 
“Use next” boxes will be prepared at the site and contain:  1) a 100 ml glass vial containing
 
either FOS, VPA, or LEV, 2) a dose administration chart, 3) a protocol assist device, and 4) a
 
length based weight/dose estimation tape (similar to Broselow tape).
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1235533] the clinical and study team in performing the
 
study protocol.  The app will be started by [CONTACT_883169]. The device is intended to serve several functions
 
including: confirmation of correct randomization code, time keepi[INVESTIGATOR_883088], supplemental data logging, and support of rapid emergency unblinding.
 
 
The protocol assist device should be kept at subject’s bedside until retrieved by [CONTACT_3476].
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235534] is performed at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of
 
study drug infusion.
 
 
“Start of study drug infusion” is considered the time of randomization.  It is the time when the
 
study drug infusion is begun by [CONTACT_883170].
 
Absence of clinically apparent seizure at 20 and 60 minutes is determined clinically.  Clinically
 
apparent seizure is defined as obvious focal or generalized tonic clonic movements, nystagmoid
 
or rhythmic eye movements, or generalized or segmental myoclonus at the time of assessment.
 
 
Patient’s responsiveness to verbal command or noxious stimuli is observed at [ADDRESS_1235535] at 60 minutes as defined above, and the use of additional
 
anti-seizure medications.  Ongoing seizures at the time of determination of the primary
 
outcome, whether persistently or recurringly, indicates a failure to meet the primary outcome.
 
Transient seizure recurrence followed by [CONTACT_183721], however, is consistent with meeting the
 
primary outcome.

primary outcome are detailed in the study Manual of Procedures.  The administration of the
 
these anticonvulsant or sedative medications for recurrent seizures or any other reason, by [CONTACT_883171], within [ADDRESS_1235536] level of
 
source document in the established hierarchy will be considered the primary source document
 
for the primary outcome.  The hierarchy of source documents that will be used to confirm the
 
primary outcome outcome is:
 
1.
Contemporaneous observation and documentation.  The primary outcome is observed
 
by [CONTACT_883172].  Direct data entry in WebDCU is preferred but not required.
 
 
2.
Direct communication with the clinical team.  The study obtains the primary outcome
 
data by [CONTACT_883173].
 
Communication should occur and be documented as close to the time of assessment as
 
possible.
 
3.
Protocol Assist Device.  The primary outcome explicitly recorded on the protocol assist
 
device will be treated as a source document and may be used to complete the CRF if
 
contemporaneous recording or direct communication with the study team are not
 
available.
 
4.
Medical Record - explicit study specific documentation.  If the medical record is used as
 
a source document, the adjudicators will determine the primary outcome from an
 
explicit study specific template note if available in precedence among available
 
documentation.
 
5.
Medical Record - implicit review.  If the medical record is used as a source document,
 
and no explicit study specific template note is available, the adjudicators will determine
 
the primary outcome from their interpretation of provided documentation.
 
8.[ADDRESS_1235537] 10 minutes apart and remaining
 
below the age-specified thresholds for more than 10 minutes after reduction of the rate of
 
study drug infusion rate (or its termination) and a fluid challenge.  The “age-specified
 
thresholds” for systolic blood pressure are [ADDRESS_1235538] end-of-study (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] [ADDRESS_1235539]).  All causes of mortality are included.
 
Need for endotracheal intubation within [ADDRESS_1235540] (orotracheal, nasotracheal,
 
cricothyroidotomy, or tracheostomy) for support of respi[INVESTIGATOR_883089].  The
 
use of non-definitive and/or non-tracheal airways (oral or nasal airways, laryngeal mask
 
airways, or esophageal obturator airways) is not included if the patient is not subsequently
 
intubated unless specifically deemed to have been used in lieu of tracheal intubation.
 
The RASS may be determined by [CONTACT_883174].  The RASS scoring system is
 
fully described in the manual of procedures.
 
Acute recurrent seizure is defined as definitive convulsive or electroencephalographic seizure
 
activity triggering further anticonvulsant therapy occurring between 60 minutes and 12 hours
 
after the start of study drug infusion. This definition does not include those given further
 
anticonvulsants as secondary prophylaxis or as treatment for vague or uncertain exam findings
 
or nondiagnostic electroencephalography.
 
 
Acute anaphylaxis is defined as a clinical presentation consistent with life threatening allergic
 
reaction occurring within 6 hours of the start of study drug infusions and manifested as
 
urticaria in combination with either (1) a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg sustained for
 
greater than 5 minutes, or (2) objective evidence of airway obstruction, and for which the
 
patient was treated with antihistamines and/or steroids.
 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_883090].  It is distinct from intubations
 
performed only for airway protection in those with decreased levels of consciousness.   It does
 
not include those getting only supraglottic airways or transient bag-valve-mask support.
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes include time to termination of seizures, admission to ICU, and the
 
length of ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].
 
 
The time to termination of seizures is the interval from the start of infusion of study drug to
 
cessation of clinically apparent seizure in those who meet the primary outcome.
 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883091], and length of stay, is abstracted from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883092]. ICU admission is recorded as occurring only if the ICU is the initial inpatient
 
unit for the patient.  Length of stay is determined by [CONTACT_883175]
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235541] end-of-study.
 
8.4  Endotracheal intubation
 
Elective or semi-elective endotracheal intubation (e.g. for imaging studies, etc.) should be
 
delayed until after determination of primary outcome if possible.  Emergency endotracheal
 
intubation should not be delayed.  The need for emergency intubation is determined by [CONTACT_883176].  It is generally not necessary to perform emergency endotracheal intubation for
 
prolonged unresponsiveness alone in this patient population.  Emergent or elective
 
endotracheal intubation and its indication should be carefully documented, including all
 
medications administered.
 
 
8.5  Rescue anticonvulsants
 
Subjects who do not respond to the study drug and continue to seize >20 minutes after the
 
start of study drug infusion (>10 minutes after the completion of study drug infusion) will need
 
additional anticonvulsant therapy for SE at the discretion of the treating team. The treating
 
physician will follow local practice guidelines in choice of a third line agent for the treatment of
 
SE.  Appropriate third line choices include phenobarbital or a general anesthetic such as
 
propofol, midazolam or pentobarbital when a second-line agent has failed.  Finally, some
 
centers may choose to use another second line agent.  If the care team feels that another
 
second line agent is indicated and that knowledge of the study drug given is needed to guide
 
this selection, emergency unblinding should proceed as described below in section 10.2.
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1235542] supportive care
 
Other than as indicated in this protocol, subjects will receive the usual care and evaluation
 
provided at each site.  Sites may wish to reference the practice parameter recommendations
 
for status epi[INVESTIGATOR_883093] (Riviello 2006).

9. ADVERSE EVENTS
 
9.1 Definitions of Adverse Events:
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical
 
treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or
 
procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical
 
documentation and scientific analyses.
 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is
 
permanently or substantially disabling, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in a
 
congenital anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. For
 
the purposes of this study, we specifically exclude hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883094] a patient after SE as a Serious Adverse Event.
 
9.2 Grading of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events (AEs) occurring within 24 hours of treatment and all serious adverse events
 
occurring during study participation will be documented on the AE case report form. The
 
severity of adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
 
Adverse Events (Version 4.03, June 2010, CTCAE). The CTCAE provides a grading (severity) scale
 
for each AE term and AEs are listed alphabetically within categories based on anatomy or
 
pathophysiology. The CTCAE (v 4.03) displays Grades 1-5 with unique clinical descriptions of
 
severity for each AE based on this general guidance:
 
Table 4.
 
 
Grades
 
Descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline
 
Grade 1 Mild
 
Asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic
 
observations only; intervention not indicated
 
Grade 2 Moderate
 
minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate
 
instrumental activities of daily living.
 
 
Grade 3 Severe
 
medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883095]; disabling; limiting self care ADL
 
Grade 4 Life-threatening
 
 
urgent intervention indicated
 
Grade 5 Fatal
 
Death related to AE
 
 
Severity is not equivalent to seriousness. A serious adverse event (SAE) would be any event in
 
category 4 or 5, and any event in category 3 that required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Not all
 
 
 
52
 
 
grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options
 
for Grade Selection i.e., Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an
 
option.
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1235543] important components of AE reporting is determining the cause of the AE. It is
 
imperative that the investigator assess AE causality in terms of overall study participation and
 
make an independent determination as to whether the AE was thought to be related to any
 
study-related activity (i.e., study intervention,). Determination may be particularly challenging
 
in ESETT since typi[INVESTIGATOR_883096]-challenge and re-challenge are not possible within the scope of this protocol in which study
 
interventions are isolated single exposures of short acting medications. In addition the
 
underlying cause of SE: stroke, infection, inflammation  etc.  cause adverse events. Finally,
 
prolonged seizures of SE cause adverse events.  For each adverse event, the relationship to the
 
study treatment must be recorded as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, not related.  The
 
NETT modified “Algorithm to Determine Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Agent” will be
 
used for all relatedness determinations in ESETT, and is found in the Manual of Procedures.
 
9.4  Adverse Event Reporting
 
All AEs occurring within 24 hours of study treatment and all serious adverse events (SAEs)
 
occurring until participation in study has ended (discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], death, or 30 days
 
since enrollment)  are recorded on the online AE case report form (CRF) through the
 
WebDCU
™
. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_883097] (e.g., date of resolution, action taken) in a timely manner.
 
All non-serious AEs must be recorded on the electronic AE CRF within [ADDRESS_1235544] within 24
 
hours of discovery of the event.
 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_503728]-up of AEs until resolution (or end of
 
study for that subject) and appropriate documentation in the subject research record. In
 
addition to performing protocol-specified follow up, the participating PI [INVESTIGATOR_883098]. If an AE that was previously
 
reported on the Adverse Event CRF fully resolves and then recurs at a later date, the second
 
occurrence is considered a new AE and a new Adverse Event CRF must be completed. Likewise,
 
if an SAE that was previously reported and subsequently fully resolved later recurs at a level
 
requiring expedited reporting, the SAE must be reported as a new SAE on the Adverse Event
 
CRF.
 
 
 
 
53
 
 
9.5 Expected Adverse Events
 
Expected adverse events include side effects known to be potentially associated with the study
 
medications as listed in the study drug package inserts, and complications that commonly occur
 
as a result of the underlying condition or as a result of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  The outcomes and events
 
defined below are likely and anticipated and will be closely tracked.
 
These include the secondary safety outcomes previously defined in section 8.3:
 
●
Life-threatening hypotension
 
●
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia
 
●
Mortality
 
●
Need for endotracheal intubation
 
●
Acute recurrent seizure
 
 
●
Acute anaphylaxis
 
●
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_883099].
 
Other defined expected adverse events include:
 
Hepatic transaminase or ammonia elevations, defined as those levels determined by [CONTACT_883177] 3 times the upper limit of normal or otherwise clinically
 
significant.
 
Purple glove syndrome, defined as the presence of all three of the findings of objective edema,
 
discoloration, and pain in the distal extremity in which study drug was administered, with or
 
without known extravasation, and for which there is no other evident etiology.
 
9.6  Clinical Management of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events will be managed according to local institution guidelines and treating
 
physician’s judgment. Specific recommendations for managing acute adverse events during
 
drug infusion are included above in Section 7.3.
 
 
 
 
 
54
 
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
10.1 Randomization
 
The randomization scheme will be equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300
 
subjects are enrolled, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm (Connor 2013). The
 
target allocation ratio will be updated every 100 patients. We will use a “Step Forward”
 
centralized randomization procedure developed for emergency treatment trials. (Zhao 2010)
 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654].
 
10.2 Blinding and unblinding:
 
Patients and emergency department study team members are blinded to the treatment
 
assignment, as are the PIs and clinical coordinating center (CCC). Blinding is provided by [CONTACT_883178], same drug packaging, and same method of drug
 
administration in every subject.
 
 
Emergency unblinding may be required if the treating team feels that subjects’ care after the
 
study intervention requires knowledge of what study drug was given.  Emergency unblinding
 
will not be performed within [ADDRESS_1235545] effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment.
 
Each of the three treatment arms is modeled independently.  We assume the probability of
 
response has a uniform Beta(1,1) prior distribution.  We assume the number of responses on
 
each treatment arm follows a binomial distribution.  We update the prior distribution with the
 
observed data and use the resulting posterior distribution to calculate the probability that each
 
treatment is the most effective and the probability that each treatment is the least effective.
 
The posterior distribution for each treatment arm will therefore be Beta(1+ # of Successes, 1+ #
 
of Failures).
 
At the conclusion of the trial, we will report the response rates for each treatment group with
 
95% credible intervals and the pairwise differences in responses rates and corresponding 95%
 
credible intervals of those differences.
 
10.[ADDRESS_1235546] of difference in proportions (Z - test). Although the
 
Frequentist tests will only occur once, we will use Pocock boundaries to control the overall
 
alpha.
 
10.[ADDRESS_1235547] 97.5%
 
probability.
 
There are two early futility criteria.  The first futility rule will stop the trial early if all treatment
 
arms have a clinically unacceptable response rate.  The second futility rule will stop the trial
 
early if all treatments are performing similarly and we will be unable to identify a most effective
 
or least effective treatment.
 
Following review of both the interim analysis results and safety data, the DSMB will make a
 
recommendation regarding the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].
 
 
10.8  Estimated accrual
 
Estimates of accrual for purposes of statistical planning assume 40 enrollment sites averaging 5
 
subjects per year over a 4 year enrollment period.
 
 
 
 
56
 
 
10.9  Sample size considerations
 
This study will enroll a maximum total sample size of approximately 795 patients over 4 years,
 
at an accrual rate of approximately 16.5 patients per month. A sample size of 795 provides
 
approximately 90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15%). The trial operating characteristics were determined via an
 
extensive simulation study. The statistical and full simulation details as well as the operating
 
characteristics of the design have been published (Connor 2013).
 
The expected response rates for FOS, LEV and VPA are based on the retrospective analysis of
 
279 epi[INVESTIGATOR_883100], who were treated with PHT, LEV or VPA (Alvarez
 
2011).  The study reported 59.6% of patient epi[INVESTIGATOR_883101], 51.7% to LEV and
 
74.6% to VPA. Based on this study and expert evaluation of all currently published data on the
 
treatment of established SE, we expect that the worst drug will be effective in 50% of the
 
patients. A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference sufficient to change
 
clinical practice.
 
The total sample size for this trial corresponds to the sample size that would be needed for a
 
frequentist analysis. A sample size of 209/group (627 total) is needed for a chi-squared
​
 
​
test with
 
[ADDRESS_1235548] of equality of the three proportions with 90% power
 
(assuming the smallest proportion is 0.[ADDRESS_1235549] proportion is 0.65 and the average
 
proportion is 0.55, two-sided alpha 0.05). For a two-sample test of proportions (all pairwise
 
comparisons of treatment groups), with equal allocation into each treatment group, when one
 
treatment proportion is 0.[ADDRESS_1235550] an absolute treatment difference as small as 0.15 with 90%
 
power (assuming two-sided alpha 0.05 and interim looks). Thus, a total sample size of 240*3
 
groups=720 (uninflated for re-enrollers, missing data). Given the possibility of re-enrollers,
 
protocol violations, and missing data, the maximum sample size was inflated from 720 up to
 
795  by N`=720*R where R=(1/(1-.025)^2)*1.05. The sample size was inflated in two ways. First,
 
for the re-enrollers (expected to be 5%) who will be excluded from the analysis. Secondly, to
 
account for the impact of treatment cross-overs, protocol violations, and missing data on the
 
ITT analysis (expected to occur 2.5% of the time). In order to determine the operating
 
characteristics for this Bayesian adaptive design, simulations were performed assuming a
 
maximum sample size of 720 (the uninflated maximum) and considering different response rate
 
scenarios.
 
10.10  Missing Data and Non-compliance
 
The primary analysis will be analyzed under the intent-to-treat principle (ITT).  The ITT
 
evaluable sample will include all subjects who are randomized. Subjects that are enrolled more
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1235551] enrollment included in the primary
 
analysis. It is anticipated that a maximum of 5% of subjects will be re-enrolled. In an ITT
 
analysis, missing data and treatment cross-overs can be problematic. Due to the short term
 
endpoint, minimal missing data is expected for the primary outcome.  However the inability to
 
administer the full dose of the study drug, or other protocol violations may occur and attenuate
 
the treatment effect. It is anticipated that a maximum of 2.5% of data will be missing or involve
 
treatment cross-overs. Any missing values will be considered a treatment failure.
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1235552] due to sex/gender, racial, or ethnic differences are not expected, but will be
 
explored. Secondary and exploratory  analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons.
 
10.[ADDRESS_1235553] the null hypothesis that all three treatment groups are equal,
 
followed by [CONTACT_164609] t-tests. Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be used to compare
 
time to event outcomes by [CONTACT_1570].
 
10.13  Pediatric Subgroup Analysis
 
The interaction of age group and treatment group will be tested at each interim analysis. If
 
there is sufficient evidence of an interaction, then the response-adaptive randomization will be
 
stopped and randomization will revert to equal allocation until the end of the trial.
 
Regardless of whether an interaction between age group and treatment is detected, the
 
primary analysis will be redone by [CONTACT_551] (children age 2-18, adult 19-65, and Seniors, >65).

11. DATA COLLECTION
 
11.1  Study activity and data collection
 
Follow up data collection: Very limited clinical data will be collected during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
 
beyond that available and collected in the ED.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883102].   At the end of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], subjects should again be
 
evaluated for serious adverse events.  Seizure etiology and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ICU length of stay are also
 
determined at discharge.

 . In brief summary, Hub investigators will provide quality assurance
 
within their Hub spoke complex  in a process that, in this network, will be called Verification.
 
This is independent of Monitoring, which, in this network, is used to mean only independent
 
external monitoring by [CONTACT_883179] (CCC).
 
Data quality monitoring is performed continuously.  Out of range and logical errors are
 
identified at the time of data entry.
 
 
Site visits will be conducted periodically by [CONTACT_883180](s).  Details of the content of site
 
visits are found in the monitoring plan in the MoP.  In brief, the primary purpose of the site visit
 
is to confirm that local regulatory documents are being properly maintained, and to compare
 
data reported on case report forms with source documents, including documentation of
 
informed consent and proper reporting of adverse events.
 
 
Some combination of risk based allocation of site and remote source document verification will
 
be used over the course of the trial.
 
11.4  Data management
 
The NETT Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) will provide data management for
 
the ESETT study. The SDMC is housed in the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical
 
University of South Carolina (MUSC). Data entry will occur at the enrolling sites using a
 
web-based data entry system, WebDCU
™
.  A central reader form will be entered into WebDCU
 
at the NETT CCC at the University of Michigan.
 
11.[ADDRESS_1235557] (IRB) Review
 
This protocol and the informed consent document (see template) and any subsequent
 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_883181].
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1235558] (DSMB)
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by [CONTACT_883182].  The DSMB will be formed by
 
[CONTACT_883183]. The SDMC statisticians will generate Data and Safety
 
Monitoring (DSMB) Reports semi-annually or more frequently as needed. This review will aid in
 
identifying any safety issues that may need to be addressed.
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1235559] Confidentiality
 
All data (case report forms, recordings, laboratory specimens, and other records) kept at the
 
site will be  physically and electronically secured to maintain subject confidentiality.  Paper
 
records and computers with subject data will be stored in locked office or cabinet.  Computer
 
records will always be password protected, and encrypted when possible.  The study database
 
is maintained behind a secure firewall, access is password protected and uses SSL encryption
 
for all data entry and access.  Clinical information will not be released without written
 
permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_456], the CCC, the
 
SDMC. the IRB, the FDA, the NINDS, or the OHRP.
 
 
12.4 Study Modification/Discontinuation
 
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NINDS, the sponsor, the
 
OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research
 
subjects are protected.

14. INTEGRATED SUB-STUDIES
 
Consistent with pre-existing scientific aims of the research team, and with recommendations of
 
peer review and trial oversight groups prior to initiation of the trial, the study leadership will,
 
contingent on funding, fully integrate additional study procedures into the clinical trial protocol
 
in support of specific supplemental aims.  As requested, the leadership has pursued ancillary
 
grant support of these aims.  These supplemental procedures relate directly to providing a
 
more complete and nuanced explanation of the trial’s outcomes, and a better understanding of
 
the underlying mechanisms of treatment response.  These integrated sub-study procedures
 
were created to ensure that they not interfere with other study procedures, and have been
 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_883185].  Sub-study aims and
 
procedures are detailed in the 
​
MoP
​
.
 
14.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)
 
Blood sampling as previously described at section 6.4, is used to determine the plasma levels of
 
study drugs in subjects at a fixed interval after administration.  It is anticipated that all sites
 
participate, and that samples are collected from all subjects whenever possible.  This sub-study
 
is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lisa Coles, with the advice and assistance of [CONTACT_883191].
 
14.2 Emergent Electroencephalography (eEEG)
 
 
To characterize the electrographic outcomes of subjects with both clinical treatment success
 
and clinical treatment failure after study drug administration, novel application of simplified
 
EEG technology and procedures  is performed and evaluated in a subset of ESETT subjects at a
 
selected number of performance sites.  The goal is for eEEG to be acquired as early after
 
enrollment as possible and prior to the primary outcome.  Participation of sites is determined
 
by [CONTACT_883186], site accrual rates to date, and site ability to complete the testing.
 
This sub-study is led by [CONTACT_6283]. John Betjemann and Brian Litt.

([PHONE_9500]  IRB #:   Version #: 1.0  Initial Document Approval Date:   Research Sites:  National University of Natural Medicine  Helfgott Research Institute  [ADDRESS_577736]  Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are debilitating conditions of the connective tissue that manifest in musculoskeletal complaints, joint dislocations or instability, skin and soft tissue anomalies, chronic pain, fatigue, GI disorders, headaches, blood pressure dysregulation, and have a negative impact on the psychosocial lives of many patients that suffer from the disorders. No unique genetic origin for HSD has been identified. However, among Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS),  the most common form of hypermobility, are 13 subtypes that are identifiable by [CONTACT_453031].1 Individuals afflicted with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) frequently remain undiagnosed for a significant length of time due to the variable symptoms of the disorder that overlap with other medical conditions. Treatments for HSD and EDS are inconsistent and lack a solid evidence base; in particular, the literature does not support the efficacy of physical rehabilitation.2 While HSD and EDS are not curable, current strategies for managing the disorders commonly include a combination of physical, supportive, and behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as education and copi[INVESTIGATOR_453026]) in addition to pain killers.[ADDRESS_577737] on the disorder.  The overall purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a 9-week integrative medicine program that is comprised of a prescribed anti-inflammatory (Mediterranean) diet, as well as general behavioral and psychosocial support among patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), in order to determine the recruitment potential in this population and to measure the ability of individuals to complete the program. Participants will be prescribed a food plan, and adherence to and feasibility of the food plan will be measured through participant food tracking and a subjective assessment of the food plan in a brief satisfaction survey. This study aims to recruit 20 patients with HSD or EDS and make preliminary observations regarding the effects of integrative medical care on pain reduction and improved quality of life. Participants will be given a 1-week lead-in to track their general diet prior to starting their prescribed food plan, and associations will be recorded between symptom severity and diet as an exploratory analysis. Patient assessment of chronic illness care and living with a chronic illness will also be captured; to assess the experiences of patients with HSD or EDS, as well as their perceptions of previous medical care and patient-centered medicine, and any changes in these attitudes over the course of 9 weeks. Available studies assessing treatments for HSD or EDS provide insufficient evidence for treatment options; this project studies a novel intervention focused on nutrition and self-management counseling, developed in conjunction with a qualified physician, and would allow us to gain valuable information regarding the feasibility of employing the intervention as well as preliminary data on its effect on health outcomes.  B. SPECIFIC AIMS   B.1 Primary Aim: To investigate the feasibility of a 9-week integrative medicine intervention, as assessed by [CONTACT_453032] (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS).  • Outcome Measures 1: The recruitment rate will be assessed as the number of participants enrolled per month, over the duration of open recruitment. Our goal is to recruit 20 participants within a span of 4 months. Retention rate will be determined as the proportion of participants completing the mid-study or end-of-study visits, with a goal of 75% retention for each study visit.    B.2 Secondary Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of and adherence to a prescribed food plan as well as the feasibility of food tracking as a part of a 9-week integrative medicine intervention in patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). • Outcome Measures 2: To assess the feasibility of the dietary recommendations, adherence will be assessed using estimated daily dietary intake recorded in MyFitnessPal, a food tracker app for mobile devices and computers. The participant’s reported macronutrient breakdown will be compared to the prescribed food plan to calculate an adherence score. Participants will also complete a food plan satisfaction survey at baseline, 5, and 9 weeks that will examine any physical side-effects, support needed, and any barriers to adherence, including food costs. The feasibility of food tracking will be measured by [CONTACT_453033]. A threshold of 3 days of reporting per week (including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) for the 9-week duration of the study will be considered adherent and should provide sufficient data to assess the observance of the recommended food tracking.

B.3 Tertiary Aim: To examine the effect of a 9-week integrative medicine intervention on overall perceived pain and quality of life in patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS).  • Outcome Measures 3: Participants will complete a Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain) and a 29-Item profile HRQoL Survey (PROMIS-29) at baseline, 5, and 9 weeks.   In order to better understand the needs of the patient population, we will also address the following exploratory aims, as far as we are able.  These aims can be considered to be independent of the effects of treatment.  B.4 Exploratory Aim 1: To evaluate any associations between symptom severity, perceived pain, quality of life, and diet among patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). • Participants will be given a 1-week lead-in to establish baseline food patterns before starting the prescribed food plan. Associations of dietary composition, patient-reported symptoms, as well as overall perceived pain and quality of life scores will be examined, both cross-sectionally at intake and longitudinally over the 9 weeks of the intervention.  B.5 Exploratory Aim 2: To assess the experiences of chronic illness care and living with chronic illness among patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS).  • Outcome Measure 5: Participants will complete a 26-item survey, Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC+), that evaluates areas of patient self-management within the chronic care model of healthcare. The PACIC+ ascertains attitudes regarding patient-centered care, living with chronic illness, and chronic illness care; it will be completed by [CONTACT_453034] 9 weeks.  C. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   C.1. History and Prevalence  Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a categorically distinctive set of connective tissue disorders with a varied range of symptoms characterized by [CONTACT_453035], loose ligaments, and joint pain.4 Initially, the prevalence of EDS was thought to be 1 in 5,000 individuals; however, these figures have been disputed more recently, and it is proposed that there is a lack of screening and early detection for the disorder due to the misconception that it is rare, which may contribute to underreporting.5,6 There are 13 subtypes of EDS recognized by [CONTACT_453036]; however, Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (hEDS) are heterogeneous, meaning the exact gene responsible for the disorder is unknown.4 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has identified faulty collagen production as a potential genetic cause, however, not all EDS subtypes possess this mutation.7

Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) is the umbrella term for joint hypermobility in 4 or more joints in the body for which a genetic mutation for the disorder is unknown. A diagnosis of HSD usually occurs after Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS), which can be tested both genetically and clinically, have been ruled out.

For every motion for which hyperextension of the joint is present, a score of 1 point is documented.14 A score of 4/9 or more indicates the presence of generalized joint hypermobility. The term “joint hypermobility” represents laxity in the joint, and it is important to emphasize that HSD and EDS are not diseases, but are instead, the presentation of a connective tissue disorder.1   A Beighton score may be negative after the age of 33, even in individuals with a previous EDS or HSD diagnosis, as joint laxity decreases with age, even when pain and other manifestations of the disorder remain from previous hypermobility.3 In a systematic review of the Beighton score, it was found to be a reliable but not a valid instrument; meaning it has demonstrated uniform measurement (carried out clinically), however, as a diagnostic tool for measuring hypermobility, it may not be conclusive.[ADDRESS_577743] mild pain associated with these occurrences. Chronic pain unrelated to these frequent dislocations is strongly associated with HSD and EDS, however, and it is both physically and psychologically disabling.16 In a study among Dutch patients with ESD, 90% were reported to suffer from pain, with Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (hEDS) patients having the most elevated pain severity scores among the cohort.17 In a study of pressure pain thresholds, it was found that 50% of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (hEDS) experienced neuropathic pain when compared to healthy individuals.18 Another reported feature of HSD and EDS is hyperalgesia, or pain hypersensitivity, which may be an additional indication of central nervous system damage as a result of the disorder.18 Taking into consideration that chronic pain can be neuropathic; or related to a potentially damaged nervous system or nociceptive, where the pain is linked to inflammation from a tissue injury, pain medications may be entirely ineffective.[ADDRESS_577744] concluded that the social environment is essential for pain management, and by [CONTACT_453037], patients may gain the necessary copi[INVESTIGATOR_453027] a new ‘normal’ life.19 A mixed-methods study of 38 patients with HSD and EDS receiving physical therapy found that patients had lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than the average American adult and a perceived a need for a “whole-

C5. Anti-inflammatory (Mediterranean) diet  Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (hEDS) are shown to be associated with rheumatological diagnoses, some of which are inflammatory, and cells with hEDS and HSD specificity appear to have inflammatory cytokines in vitro even though they are genetically distinct disorders.21, [ADDRESS_577745] food, or any other processed foods and meats. Anti-inflammatory diets encourage increasing whole fruits, vegetables, and grains as well as balancing macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fat) for every meal. The most researched anti-inflammatory diet, the Mediterranean diet, was shown in a systematic review of 46 observational studies to be associated with a reduction of inflammatory biomarkers.23 An anti-inflammatory food plan may provide some support for chronic pain that is associated with HSD and EDS.  C6. Integrative Medicine Approach  The complex nature of both HSD and EDS and the various comorbidities that arise may necessitate an intervention that incorporates more than pain management. Psychosocial support that is incorporated into copi[INVESTIGATOR_453028], building social awareness, and education about joint hypermobility as well as physical modifications that could be made.11 Patient-based care may mitigate some of the complications that accompany chronic illnesses, and by [CONTACT_453038][INVESTIGATOR_453029], a patient can feel supported by a comprehensive care management team.11 In a narrative review of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), the four common psychosocial conditions that were found to be consistent in the literature were “cognitive problems (and attention to body sensations), negative emotions, and unhealthy patterns of activity (hypoactivity/hyperactivity).”24 The authors concluded that because chronic pain can be so invalidating, incorporating psychosocial support is essential to rehabilitation, especially when the patient is not responsive to conventional treatment.24  Integrative medicine may provide some support for chronic illnesses, as it relies upon a patient-centered model of healthcare, one defined by [CONTACT_453039] (AHIM) as “an approach that rather than a disease-focused model, is instead a wellness and prevention model.  Integrative health must also include not only our individual selves, but our community, our environment and our planet.”25 As can be seen in Figure 1., in the Integrative Care Model, the patient is in control over their own illness, and the therapeutic relationship they establish with their healthcare providers promotes autonomy, decision-making, and being treated as a whole person.

Overview   This feasibility study will investigate the recruitment potential and retention rate among patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) participating in a 9-week integrative medicine intervention that involves a prescribed anti-inflammatory (Mediterranean) diet, as well as general behavioral and psychosocial support. The feasibility of the food plan will also be examined through participant food tracking as well as through a food plan assessment in a brief satisfaction survey. Up to 20 patients with HSD or EDS will be enrolled from the Portland Oregon area, and the in-person screening study visit and the 2 virtual follow-up visits will be conducted at or from the Healthy Living Community clinic. We will also obtain preliminary data on any effects that the 9-week integrative medicine intervention has on pain and health-related quality of life. Outcome measures will be collected at 5 and 9 weeks, with the exception of the patient assessment of care for chronic conditions (PACIC+), that will be collected at baseline and the close-out visit during week 9.

In the event that the baseline visit is conducted virtually, all procedures will be the same, except that the participant will provide medical documentation of a Beighton score of 4 or more, in lieu of a Beighton measurement being obtained at the visit. We will require informed consent prior to capturing this documentation.  The participant will be asked to report their own height and weight.  All other data will be captured electronically.  Any participant who completes the baseline visit remotely will be invited to complete the Week 5 visit in person, if possible; if the Week 5 visit is completed in person, then weight, height, and Beighton score will be confirmed at that visit.  E.4.4.1 Food Plan Satisfaction Survey We will distribute food plan satisfaction surveys via REDCap to be completed by [CONTACT_453042]’s next visit (5 weeks).

relationship with a holistic healthcare provider team consisting of a medical doctor and a student researcher to support comprehensive care. Participants will attend a total of 3 visits with a medical doctor over the 9-week integrative medicine intervention.   The Clinical Investigator has created a 9-week program that is composed of a prescribed anti-inflammatory (Mediterranean) food plan as well as general behavioral and psychosocial support.  During the 3 consultations with the participant, the CI will: 1)   Capture a complete and detailed medical history and  background, 2)  Discuss familial and social support, 3)  Provide psychosocial support,  4) Assess the patient’s current self-management strategies for self-care, and 5) Assess the patient’s current self-management strategies for mental health. Study personnel will also follow provide psychosocial and nutritional support to address any additional concerns and promote adherence to the food plan.  Prescribing an anti-inflammatory food plan and assessment of current diet  The Clinical Investigator will prescribe an anti-inflammatory food plan that consists of a high intake of fruits and vegetables (4-5 serving of each per day).30 The specific dietary requirements for adherence to the anti-inflammatory food plan incorporated in this 9-week integrative medicine intervention will include macronutrient levels similar to those of a Mediterranean diet, which breaks down to 40-50% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein, and 35-40 % fat.[ADDRESS_577755] foods. They will discuss removing trans fats and hydrogenated oils and replacing them with cold-pressed and unrefined oils. For simplicity and accuracy, participants will be advised to follow a “Mediterranean-style eating pattern,” which is very searchable among recipe databases and websites, and more specific than the term “anti-inflammatory.”  Participants will be provided an anti-inflammatory food plan that includes recipes, a guide for adding and reducing certain foods, and obtaining targeted macronutrient levels (see above) if modification of their current diet seems infeasible, or if they so desire. The student researcher will assess the cooking skills of participants and provide resources, as needed (i.e. YouTube channels, websites). They will discuss meal-planning, meal-preppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and making a grocery list on a budget as needed. Additionally, participants will be contact[CONTACT_453044], answer any questions, and facilitate adherence.  Capturing a complete and detailed medical history and background  The Clinical Investigator will comprehensively intake the patient’s full medical history and listen to their entire background. Because HSD and ESD can be a frustrating and invalidating prognosis, extreme sensitivity and empathy will be used to build trust and develop a therapeutic relationship with the participants.

Motivational interviewing will be utilized and “include engaging with patients to help build rapport, focusing patients on the changes they want to make while offering advice and support, evoking the tools, and desires they possess within them to effect change, and planning to implement the goals and next steps patients identified through the encounter.”[ADDRESS_577757], such as grocery store and transportation access, and practical needs like having a kitchen, tools to cook, or time to prepare fresh food. Potential solutions to these barriers like community food pantries and cooking classes will be recommended depending on the location of the participant. The CI will also assess the social network of the participant for supportive relationships that are necessary to create healthy behavior changes. Recommendations will be made in accordance with the needs of the participant and may include referrals to the Portland area EDS support group, or Oregon Area Ehlers-Danlos Society if they require more assistance.  Providing psychosocial support  Psychosocial support will be provided by [CONTACT_453045], the student researcher, and MyFitnessPal throughout the 9-week program. Participants will receive behavioral, lifestyle, and dietary counseling all through a total of 3 office visits with the medical doctor, and 2 phone calls or e-mail check-in correspondences with the student researcher.  The student researcher has personal experience with both hEDS and Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), and similar to another EDS study, this will be disclosed to participants at the beginning of the interview in an effort to mitigate the power imbalance that often accompanies research.11 This may also help “instill greater confidence in participants” to share their experiences with a researcher and EDS individual who is also in their “in-group.”11 It will also be “emphasized that it [is] their stories that matter” for the purpose of the study.11  MyFitnessPal

Individuals with previous disordered eating patterns, or discomfort with food tracking, will be able to opt-out; however, they will still be shown how to use MyFitnessPal to analyze dietary composition for adherence. A 1-week lead-in prior to introducing the food plan will be utilized to provide a baseline record of the participant’s general diet. MyFitnessPal data will allow us to track general adherence to dietary changes, the overall quality of the participant’s diet, and average macronutrient proportions. By [CONTACT_453046]’s reported macronutrient percentage scores and comparing them with the prescribed food plan, we will be able to calculate an adherence score.  MyFitnessPal usage has been shown to have positive results for behavioral and health changes, and for meeting nutrition-related goals, and was found to be associated with higher levels of reported self-efficacy among users that reported more frequent use.[ADDRESS_577759] better usability when compared to other apps; however, one disadvantage that the review cited for all diet-tracking apps was that users lack the ability to track their emotions.33  Assessing the patient’s current self-management strategies for self-care  The Clinical Investigator will assess each participant’s self-care regime and make recommendations. They will make the following mindfulness, sleep, and movement recommendations listed below.  Practice mindfulness: Have some quiet time to yourself once a day. Listen to a guided meditation or grab a journal. Write down your thoughts. Let go of stress and try to relax. Try chanting, prayer, or using a mantra.

Mindful eating: Take some time to slow down and eat your food. This will help you tune in with your body. It might take time to listen to your body’s natural satiety cues to know when you are hungry or full at first. Try cooking, meal-preppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and eating with others. Incorporate their support with the food plan to help you keep on track.  Try to focus on having non-distracted eating during meals. This means silencing your cellphone, turning off your TV or computer, and savoring your food.  Mindful eating Eat/drink with intention • How did the food make you feel? • Are you enjoying it?  Listen to your hunger/thirst • Is your stomach growling?  • Are you parched?  Slow down • Slow down for a moment and enjoy your food. This will help you listen to your hunger and get pleasure out of eating. Take your time.   Sleep: Try to sleep 7-8 hours at night. Practice good sleep hygiene by [CONTACT_7661] a wind-down time at night without electronics (at least 2 hours before bedtime). Avoid eating a heavy meal or drinking alcohol before bed.  Movement (light physical activity): Try to take your lunch break outside or go on a walk after work. It might take some time to build up the energy, so start slowly, maybe [ADDRESS_577760].  Assessing the patient’s current self-management strategies for mental health  The Clinical Investigator will determine the mental health needs of participants and make mental health provider referrals as needed. If additional support is required and a referral is made, the Clinical Investigator will revisit these needs and check on progress in follow-up visits.  Patients will also be referred to mental health resources found at the Ehlers-Danlos Society website.  E.6 Measures  Primary Outcome measures:  Feasibility • Retention rate (proportions of participants completing 5 and 9-week visits)

Protocol  Study Title: Integrative Medicine for Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) and Ehlers-Danlos (EDS) syndromes: A mixed-methods feasibility study (IMforHSDandEDS)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_453025], PhD IRB #: DH10320/PRAF Approval Date: 03.03.21 Version: 3.0 20 
• Recruitment rate (average number of participants enrolled per month) • Dropout rate (proportions of participants failing to complete 5 or 9-week visits)  Secondary Outcome measures:  Dietary Adherence/Food Tracking Feasibility (MyFitnessPal food tracking): • Dietary adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_6270]-reported food tracking through Daily Nutrition Goals in the MyFitnessPal app and will be documented at 5 and 9 weeks through the Friends feature. Daily macronutrient contributions will be obtained as percentages of total intake. The suggested macronutrient breakdown for the food plan is 40-50% calories from a carbohydrate source, 35-40 % calories from fat, and 15-20% calories from protein. Weekly recorded consumption of the participant will be compared to this standard for an adherence score. For each of the three macronutrient categories, we will give 2 points if the percentage is within the required range and 1 point if the percentage is within 5% of the required range (maximum 6 points total).  A score of 4 and above will be considered adherent to the food plan. • The feasibility of food tracking will be measured by [CONTACT_453033]. A threshold of 3 days of reporting per week (including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) for the 9-week duration of the study will be considered adherent and should provide sufficient data to assess the observance of the recommended food tracking.  Food Plan Feasibility (food plan satisfaction survey collection):  • Any negative outcomes, overall cost-prohibitiveness, support needed, and barriers encountered will be assessed with a food plan satisfaction survey at 5 and 9 weeks that will examine the feasibility of the food plan. Qualitative data will be thematically summarized for representative quotes.  Tertiary Outcome measures:  Pain Visual Analog scale (VAS) collection: • We will collect subjective pain levels from participants over 9 weeks on a 10-point scale. A pain visual analog scale will give a numeric measurement of pain between “worst pain” and “no pain.” The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29): • We will collect general perception of health status as well as quality of life scores over 9 weeks from participants. The PROMIS-29 is a survey that will give a numeric measurement of physical and mental health status on a scale of 0 to 10 that has been validated in adults with multiple chronic conditions.38  Exploratory measures:  Pain Visual Analog scale (VAS), The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29), and Dietary Adherence associations:

• We will evaluate any associations between symptom severity, perceived pain, health-related quality of life, and dietary composition cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of the 9-week intervention.  Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care+ scores (PACIC+) collection: • We will collect general perceptions and attitudes regarding the experiences of chronic illness care and living with chronic illness among patients with HSD and EDS at baseline and 9 weeks. • The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC+) is a validated survey shown to have good reliability, internal consistency, and better psychometric characteristics than other surveys on patient satisfaction.39, [ADDRESS_577761] 6 months.  Health history and anthropometric measurements:  • Biological information will be captured regarding the patients’ previous medical health history, age, sex, and gender at the baseline screening. We will also document BMI, weight, height, and estimated energy requirement measurements at baseline. We will record patient self-reported weight at 5 and 9 weeks and track any changes that occur. Any abnormal BMI values will be monitored appropriately for safety, and any changes in these measures will be analyzed in accordance with the overall effectiveness of the diet. • We will also document any other patient-reported symptoms that are experienced in addition to HSD or EDS throughout the 9 weeks and document any changes that occur. • Any current pain medications or supplements that the participants are taking for pain will also be recorded.  Beighton score: range of motion measurements • A set of measurements that assess joint hypermobility through a 9-point scale will be documented during the in-office screening. For every joint that can be extended past a specified angle, 1 point is added to the patient’s Beighton score. A score of 4 or more indicates that generalized joint hypermobility is present.14 • The Beighton score will be obtained during the baseline screening.  NUNM Multi-system Adverse Event questionnaire: • A multi-system AE questionnaire will be administered at each visit. As HSD and EDS are associated with a considerable list of comorbidities, we will obtain a baseline measure of the AE questionnaire for each participant so that we have documented any pre-existing conditions. We will check on these conditions throughout the [ADDRESS_577762] been exacerbated.

• Participants will also be assessed for any adverse events during check-in calls with the following question, “Are you experiencing any new symptoms or side-effects that you may have noticed?” We will recommend cessation of the food plan if a patient feels that any of their symptoms have been exacerbated, or if they are experiencing any new symptoms. • Dietary alterations involving increased fats, protein, fruits, and vegetables may cause gastrointestinal distress. HSD and EDS are associated with motility issues that may result in constipation; however, adherence to a Mediterranean-style food pattern has been associated with improved gastrointestinal symptoms.[ADDRESS_577763]. All study personnel will be instructed not to discuss any participants with persons other than study personnel.   Each participant will be assigned a unique alpha-numeric ID upon screening. All data resulting from study visits will be collected on standardized case report forms (CRFs). Data will be transferred from CRFs to a secure REDCap database for data management. Outcome data from MyFitnessPal will be entered into the REDCap database by [CONTACT_453047]. Data will be downloaded only onto a password protected computer; upon download, data will be immediately entered into REDCap and deleted from the hard drive. Food VAS, Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC+), and PROMIS-29 surveys will all be recorded utilizing the REDCap database. REDCap is a secure, web-based application that supports electronic data capture for research studies. REDCap features include: 1) intuitive data entry features; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export; 3) user-based privileges that support HIPAA compliance; 4) seamless data export to common statistical packages; and 5) procedures for importing data from external sources. The REDCap database will be accessible only by [CONTACT_3476]. The link between study IDs and protected health information will be kept as a single electronic file stored on a limited-access electronic folder on a secure server with select access limited to the study team. Data will be destroyed 3 years after completion of the study. Computer files will be deleted from the server, and paper files will be destroyed using a professional document shredding service.

E.8 Risks and Benefits   In the USDA 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the Mediterranean diet was listed among the Healthy Style Eating Pattern for its association with positive health outcomes.30 “The Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) set by [CONTACT_453049]. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by [CONTACT_453050], for other nutrients or food components and nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met.”42 The anti-inflammatory food plan that will be recommended in this 9-week integrative medicine intervention reflects macronutrient levels that are similar to those of a Mediterranean diet, which breaks down to 40-50% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein, and 25-30 % fat.[ADDRESS_577765] studied diets and has amassed a large evidence base for the treatment and prevention of many chronic diseases. In a meta-analysis of 50 studies, the diet was associated with improved outcomes for reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as preventing metabolic syndrome, reducing blood pressure, lipid levels, and endothelial dysfunction; through both the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of foods found in the Mediterranean dietary pattern.44 Adherence to a Mediterranean diet has also been shown to be beneficial for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been shown to improve both survival rates and renal function.45 In a holistic study of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, it was found to be associated with a 17-25% increase in overall survival rates as well as increased mortality rates for cancer, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular disease.46   Alteration of fats, protein, fruits, and vegetables may increase the risk of gastrointestinal distress that may result in gas, bloating, or constipation. Participants will be advised to discontinue the food plan if the patient is experiencing significant digestive distress.  While the safety of integrative medicine is dependent on individual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24228], mind-body practices and light movement exercises are generally considered to be safe.47 The Clinical Investigator will evaluate the participant’s current supplements and medications before making food plan recommendations to prevent any drug interactions that could occur.47

E.9 Statistical Analysis   All measures collected in the study, including baseline characteristics and outcome measures, will be summarized using mean and SD (biomarkers, anthropometrics), median and IQR (Beighton score), or percentage within each level, for categorical variables. All statistical analyses will be performed at the National University of Natural Medicine.  For Specific Aim 1,   Feasibility of the 9-week integrative medicine intervention will be measured through recruitment and retention at each follow-up visit. Recruitment rate will be presented as the mean number of participants enrolled per month, with enrolment ceasing either after 4 months, or when n=[ADDRESS_577767] been enrolled. Retention will be calculated as the percentage of enrolled participants from whom follow-up data is obtained, at either the 5-week or 9-week visit.  For Specific Aim 2,   Adherence to the recommended diet will be assessed in different ways and tracked by [CONTACT_453051]. In particular, we will assess: • Percentage of days on which the diet recommendations were met; in order to satisfy this requirement, macronutrient distribution must meet all of the following: o Carbohydrates between 40-50% o Protein between 15-20%  o Fat between 25-30 % • Number of weeks in which recommendations were met at least 5 days; • Whether recommendations were met on at least 75% of total days (Y/N) • Mean of weekly adherence scores calculated over the 9-week study period.  Percentage of days and weeks adherent will be summarized across participants as median/IQR/range.  We will also present the percentage of participants who met the threshold of 75% days adherent.  Feasibility of the 9-week integrative medicine intervention will also be measured through self-reported food plan satisfaction surveys that assess any negative outcomes, overall cost-prohibitiveness or

burden, support needed, and any barriers that are encountered with the recommended dietary modifications.   • Because these measures are reported as open responses, they will be thematically summarized for representative quotes, at each time point measured.    Adherence with dietary tracking will be assessed by: • Percentage of total days on which dietary intake was documented. Self-reporting of daily dietary intake on at least 50% of total days will be considered adherent. • Number of weeks on which intake was self-reported at least [ADDRESS_577768] whether the integrative medicine education intervention reduced pain and improved health-related quality of life in patients with HSD or EDS. VAS pain scores and PROMIS-29 domain scores will be summarized across participants and time points as mean (SD).  Analysis of pain and HRQoL outcomes for Aim 2 will use paired t-tests to assess mean changes unless investigation of distributions indicates a need for nonparametric testing, in which case changes will be analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.  For Exploratory Aim 1,   Any associations between pain, HRQoL, and diet will be assessed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of treatment. Cross-sectional associations of VAS pain score, PROMIS-29 domain scores, and dietary composition measures will be analyzed using Pearson correlations (or Spearman correlations for badly non-normal data). To assess associations of longitudinal changes, we will compute changes in each measure both from baseline to 5 weeks, and from baseline to 9 weeks, and we will similarly evaluate correlations between the changes over each time period.  Cross-sectional correlations assess the association of participants’ ordinary diet with pain and health-related quality of life, while correlations of changes assess the association of dietary changes, in response to the treatment recommendations, with changes in pain and HRQoL over the same time frame.  We will also assess associations between age, race, sex, baseline symptoms, and changes in outcomes at follow-up, using Pearson correlations and independent t-tests, as appropriate.  For Exploratory Aim 2,   We will summarize Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC+) scores in the sample, at both baseline and study end, and mean (SD). We will also test whether the scoring changed after participating in integrative medicine intervention, using a paired t-test.

 F. Conclusion, Summary and/or Benefits of the Knowledge Gained   Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are debilitating conditions of the connective tissue that can be both physically and psychologically disabling. For chronic care conditions, there is a need beyond the current healthcare model for patient-centered pain prevention and management programs. There are no current published scientific studies on holistic care among patients living with HSD or EDS, nor is there any research on dietary intake and its impact on the disorder. In order to better support rehabilitation, healthcare professionals should not only become more aware of both HSD and EDS and their related comorbidities, but they should also be educated in an effort to support the psychosocial needs that accompany chronic pain conditions. This project would allow us to study a novel integrative medicine intervention that is comprehensive, holistic, and patient-centered.  This study will allow us to capture the recruitment potential and retention rate among patients with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) participating in a 9-week integrative medicine intervention that is comprised of a prescribed anti-inflammatory (Mediterranean) food plan as well as general behavioral and psychosocial support. Both quantitative and qualitative measures obtained by [CONTACT_453052], as well as the feasibility of mobile device food tracking. This study aims to recruit 20 patients with HSD or EDS and make preliminary observations regarding the effects of integrative medical care on pain reduction and improved quality of life. We will capture current patient assessments of chronic illness care and living with a chronic illness among patients with HSD or EDS as well any associations between pain, quality of life, and diet. If the 9-week integrative medicine intervention shows the potential to be an appropriate program for patients with HSD or EDS, results from this study could be used to inform the healthcare community around ways to better support this unique population, and those same methods could be translated into a larger study and may contribute to further scientific research.

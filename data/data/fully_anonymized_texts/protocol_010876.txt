1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
Hypothesis:  Surface Electrical Stimulation (SES) contracts pel vic floor muscles.  It is not clear 
which muscles and how much contraction is produced.   
1.[ADDRESS_167530] ion with SES 
Key Endpoints: Displacement of bladder base during contraction.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objective is to understand which muscles are movi ng. 
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Fo cus 
Urinary incontinence (UI) is a widely prevalent condition affec ting approximately 1 in 3 women 
over the age of 30, and 1 in 2 women over the age of 50, and is  a major problem after 
prostatectomy.1,2,3   Although a very private concer n, it has far-reaching physical , psychological, 
social, and economic implications.  For example: UI has been fo und to reduce health-related 
quality of life measures, with a strong correlation with depres sion,[ADDRESS_167531] to Medicare h as been estimated at $10 billion, 
and at $20 billion for the entirety of the US healthcare system .  75% of these women are 
specifically affected with Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), w hich is the loss of continence due 
to weakened pelvic floor muscles, resulting from a variety of f actors including child-bearing, 
athletic pursuits, trauma, and aging.5,6,7  Their urine leakage occurs when physical exertion (e.g. 
sneezing, lifting, running) increases intra-abdominal pressure.   There are no medications that 
[ADDRESS_167532] imulation (EMS).  However, sub jects routinely struggle to perform 
Kegel exercises correctly or with sufficient frequency (3x/day for 3-6 months) which leads to low 
compliance. Introducing intravaginal devices or an intravaginal  probe necessitates a private 
location and dedicated treatment time (often at a treatment cen ter), further challenging the 
likelihood of adoption.5,8,9,[ADDRESS_167533] intensified and persisted for numerous years (6.5  years on average), and others 
fail to consult a specialist (i.e. urologist) because they have  no intent of having surgery.[ADDRESS_167534] often ul timately fail treatment due to 
adoption and compliance issues, it is equally important to cons ider whether the psychological or 
physiological barriers associated with intravaginal EMS offset any benefit from the treatment’s 
intimate electrode placement.    
Several recent clinical reports suggest that a pattern of surfa ce electrodes placed in the 
suprapubic and ischial tuberosity regions are as effective as i ntravaginal electrodes at retraining 
the pelvic floor muscles.
[ADDRESS_167535] and for use outside the clinic, allowing treatment at home and 
potentially accelerating the rate and efficacy of muscle retrai ning.  This surface EMS device (SES) 
has been used clinically, with subject’s confirmation of pelvic  floor contractions. However, a more 
objective proof that the pelvic floor is actually contracting w as requested, and subsequently an 
identification of which pelvic floor muscles would allow insigh t into the mechanism of SES.

4.[ADDRESS_167541]/ Exclusion Crit eria. 
4.[ADDRESS_167542]  
Subjects will be instructed to follow a standardized bladder-fi lling protocol, consisting of voiding, 
drinking 500 ml of water and waiting 45-60min (ideally 60 min b efore US pi[INVESTIGATOR_146280], but set 
up may start earlier)13. 
4.[ADDRESS_167543] 
feels there is not much of a contraction, the electrode can be repositioned (usually one inch 
posteriorly). 
Subjects should be placed in a comfortable supi[INVESTIGATOR_146281] 60°, with 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_146282]. (Subjects may have  underwear/clothes on over 
electrode.) Subjects should not see the US image.   
With transabdominal ultrasound imaging (ex. GE Voluson E6 ultra sound with a 5-9D curved linear 
array GE RIC probe), the probe should be placed supra-pubically , on the lower abdomen, in the 
mid-sagittal plane.  The transducer should be angled to obtain a clear image of the inferior-
posterior aspect of the bladder.  A marker should be placed at the bladder base on the junction 
of the hyper- and hypo-echoic areas in the region at rest.  A m arker should be placed, marking 
the maximal displacement of the bladder base from resting posit ion14,15: 
1) while doing a PFM Kegel contraction (Instructions should be the same to all: to draw in and 
lift the PFM.) 
2) with the generator on, slowly incrementing, counting the cli cks and making note of when they 
first feel a contraction, until a maximum comfortable intensity  level.  
 3) at the maximum comfortable intensity level while  doing a PFM Kegel contraction combined. 
5 4) (Optional) with a second generator (Waveform B) on at maximu m comfortable intensity level 
 After the three images and max displacement recorded, the test should be repeated and 
potentially the intensity increased  to a new maximum level (the  skin may get numb after which 
intensity increased.)  There should be a minimum of 7 ultrasoun d images (1 baseline, 2 with 
Kegels, 2 with generator, 2 with Kegels and generator.) Any evidence of prolapse visualized using ultrasound should be recorded on Case Report Form. 
While the generator is on the ultrasound probe can be manipulat ed to see if there is any evidence 
or indication which muscles are being contracted.  We want to u nderstand which muscles in terms 
of depth (pelvic diaphragm with levantor ani, or perineal pouch  with sphincter uretrhovaginalis, or 
more shallow perineal membrane) which may also help determine i f localized around urethra or 
entire pelvic floor, and if there is a difference between Kegel s and electrical stimulation. 
5. ELIDAH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION  
5.1 Description of Device 
The Elidah Elitone is an incontinence specific device that help s deliver electrical stimulation to the 
pelvic floor muscles transcutaneous. The design allows for home -use and wearable, ideally 
increasing compliance and thereby [CONTACT_146289].  The device 
is comprised of two components: a disposable electrode and a cu rrent generator.  
5.[ADDRESS_167544]. Benchtop testing has 
been completed to ensure that the resulting current passing thr ough the Elidah electrode is similar 
to currently marketed 2” square patch electrodes.   
Packaging: Foil pouch 
Reusability: The electrode is designed to be used for one hour or less. This is an acute study and 
it is not expected for electrodes to be reused. A new electrode  should be used for each subject.    
Storage: Unused electrodes should be stored in sealable storage  bag so that the gels does not 
dry out.  
5.2.1 Device Name [CONTACT_146302] (electrode) 
Identifier: EE-[ADDRESS_167545], rechargeable battery, and user inter face, all 
housed within a plastic housing approximately 2” x 1.5” x 0.5”.   The 
device is programmed to deliver a variety of waveforms intended  for 
electrical muscle stimulation.  Output characteristics of the d evice into 
a 500Ω load are 0-100 volts (peak-to-peak) and 0-150mA (peak 
instantaneous), which is similar to numerous commercially avail able 
electrical muscle stimulation devices.  The treatment intensity  (i.e. 
voltage) is controlled by [CONTACT_146290] a pair of increment and 

[ADDRESS_167546] cuitry.  In addition to the 
increment/decrement buttons, which also serve to turn on and pa use/stop the device, the user 
interface includes a series of colored LEDs that indicate power  state, and treatment intensity.  The 
generator includes a belt-clip to facilitate wearing the device  on one’s underwear or pants.  The 
generator connects to the electrode through a custom 2-conducto r cable .   The device has passed 
all the necessary IEC testing, including for home-use.  
5.3.1 Device Name [CONTACT_146303] (generator) 
Identifier: EC-1003 
5.3.2 Generator Settings 
 Freq: 2000Hz modulated at 50 Hz (sinewave), Waveform B (same but square wave)  
 Timing: 6 sec on, 6s off  
 Intensity: Current (mA) should be at max tolerable level, idea lly to be increased, must 
record. 
5b. Phase II:   
In the event of successful implementation of the ultrasound pro tocol on women, a Phase II 
includes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146283].  The protocol are identical with  the exception of: 
 Screening: Male instead of Female, pregnancy question removed 
 Electrode: Is configured for male anatomy as seen in this prot otype. 
 
6. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Adverse events are the primary means for assessing safety of th e device and the study subjects. 
All adverse events whether obs erved or volunteered will be reco rded at every visit or during any 
contact [CONTACT_146291] .  
For all adverse events, sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) 
an adequate determination of the outcome of the events (i.e., w hether the effect should be 
classified as a serious adverse effect) and; 2) an assessment o f the casual relationship between 
the adverse event and the inv estigational device or, if applica ble, the other study treatment or 
diagnostic product(s).    
 
Adverse event or abnormal test findings felt to be associated w ith the investigational device or, if 
applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will  be followed until the event or the 
abnormal finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable t o the investigator and sponsor. 

7 6.1 Risks and Side Effects 
The risks to those in the study will be similar to other transc utaneous electrical nerve stimulation 
(TENS) patches. Much of the known warnings and cautions of elec trical stimulation with electrodes 
will be avoided due to the location-specific nature of the SUI device.  However possible side effects 
may be: 
• Electrical shock or pain 
o The generator is powered by a 3.[ADDRESS_167547] 
the research staff and investigator immediately.  
• Pain on surface if the gel to skin contact [CONTACT_146292]. 
o If the device is not properly attached to the treatment site, the electrode may contact [CONTACT_146293]. This may present as an uncomfortable burning or tingling sensation for the 
subject. In this event, a subject should turn off the device, r emove the electrode and 
inspect the electrode for disconnections between the gel and el ectrode. If no issues are 
found, the subject should reapply the electrode and ensure that  it securely contact[CONTACT_146294].  
• Skin irritation (redness, sensitivity, etc.)  
o The electrodes used in this study are very similar to the elec trodes currently on the market 
for TENS and other electrical devices. The gel which contacts d irectly with the skin may 
cause sensitivity or irritation to some subjects due to unique skin sensitivity.  
o With any adhesive that contacts the skin, redness or sensitivi ty may be present after 
removal of the electrode. This is a normal activity; such as re dness experienced after 
removing a bandage. If recurring redness or sensitivity occurs,  the subject should contact 
[CONTACT_5984].  
 
To minimize the risk, emphasis in the Instructions for Use will  be placed on good skin 
contact/adherence. This risk is reasonable and similar to stand ard TENS electrode patches.  The 
FDA considers similar de vice to have low risk: “ Nonimplantable Electrical Incontinence Devices are 
a Non-significant risk device, no IDE needed”.  We do not foresee any psychological, financial, 
legal or other risk to subject associated with the study, excep t confidentiality which we address in 
other sections. 
The intensity of the current/voltage of the device is modulated  by [CONTACT_146295].  
The intensity will also start from [ADDRESS_167548] urinates.  
Loss of confidentiality represents an adverse event, however, w e will take several steps to minimize 
the risk of breaching participant confidentiality/privacy, as d escribed above. 
 Other Safety Considerations: The device turns off automatically after [ADDRESS_167549] generators due to a 
non-typi[INVESTIGATOR_146284].  
8 6.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE)  is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended symptom  or sign 
which either occurs during the study, having been absent at bas eline, or if present at baseline, 
appears to worsen. Adverse events are to be recorded regardless  of their relationship to the study 
intervention.   A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
results in death, is life threatening, requires insubject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly. 
Solicited adverse events will be collected at the office visits .   
6.3 Reporting Procedures 
Adverse events will be reported from the clinical site to the s ponsor within 24 hours.   
The sponsor will use the following 0 to 4 scale to grade advers e events (AE): 0 = none or event is 
not clinically significant, 1 = mild AE that does not require t reatment, 2 = moderate AE that does 
require treatment, but resolves completely and 3 = severe AE, e .g., results in temporary inability to 
conduct one or more everyday activities and requires ongoing me dical attention, and 4 = life 
threatening or results in permanent inability to conduct one or  more everyday activities.  
 In the event of an adverse event to a subject in the proposed s tudy, the site investigator will discuss 
the available medical treatment options with the subject.  If a n AE occurs, the Sponsor will assist the 
subject in obtaining appropriate medical attention if unable to  be performed by [CONTACT_737].  If 
treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146285] a result of partici pation in this study, the subject and their 
insurance carrier are responsible for the cost of medical care.   The subject will not lose any of their 
legal rights and they do not release the Sponsor, investigators , the study staff, or study site from 
liability for mistakes or intentional misconduct by [CONTACT_146296]. 
6.4 Followup for Adverse Events 
The Investigator will follow up moderate and severe adverse eve nts until it is resolved/stable. The 
study sponsor will be notified when the issue has been resolved . 
7. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
A participant in the trial has the right to discontinue treatme nt at any point within the trial for any 
reason. If the subject does choose to discontinue, a reason for  discontinuation will be recorded 
and every effort will be made to collect end of study informati on. Every effort w ill be made by [CONTACT_146297].  Due to the exploratory nature of this intervention, a possible pause on enrollment and 
discontinuation of active subjects may occur if the sponsor dis covers a serious issue with the use 
of the device. This could include events such as a subject hosp italization resulting from the direct 
use of the device. The study will not continue to enroll additi onal subjects until the root cause has 
been identified and corrected.  A study contract will be issued from the sponsor company to the  investigator. Inability of the study 
investigator to meet expectations such as enrollment, documenta tion, or communication to the 
sponsor, may result in the study sponsor discontinuation of the  study. The study sponsor has the 
ability to discontinue the entir e study at any point and even b etween both phases for any reason 
necessary. The intervention is not a lifesaving device therefor e it will not pose a risk to subjects.

9. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
Information and/or Specimen Management  
Each device may be reused for different subject, with a wipe do wn with alcohol in between uses.  
Each subject will use a new electrode(s). 
 The label for the Elidah electrode will bear the following info rmation: 
• Name [CONTACT_146304] 
• Investigational Trial Application statement 
• Study number • Storage instructions • Contents • Lot number 
 
At the conclusion of the study, all unused Elidah electrodes an d generators will be counted, 
reconciled with dispensing records, documented, and returned to  Elidah or their designee.  The 
Clinical Monitor will assure tha t a final report of electrode a ccountability is prepared and placed in 
both the Investigator’s Study File and the Sponsor’s Study File . 
 
After completing the trial, all unused Elidah electrodes and re turned generators will be shipped to 
Elidah at: 
Elidah, Inc, [ADDRESS_167552] subjec t participation (based on HIPAA pr ivacy). The study sponsor may 
decide to transfer all paper data to electronic data which will  follow the same regulations.  
9.[ADDRESS_167553] any issues.   
Currently, electrical stimulation, such as TENS units, are sold  over the counter and are used at home, 
11 so we believe this level of monitoring is considered appropriat e and the overall likelihood of harm is 
low.  
 To ensure that the rights and well-being of human subjects are  protected; the reported trial data are 
accurate and complete, and verifiable from source documents; an d the conduct of the trial is in 
compliance with the currently approved protocol, with GCP, and with the applicable regulatory 
requirements, an experienced Clinical Director will monitor the  conduct of the study halfway through 
enrollment of both Phases of the study.  In the plan, the clini cal director will throughout the trial period: 
o Act as the main line of communication between the Sponsor and the investigator 
o Verify that facility, laborator ies, equipment and staff are ad equate to safely and properly conduct 
the trial 
o Verify that the investigator  
 is adequately informed about the trial, as well as investigato rs’ staff 
 has adequate qualifications and resources 
 follows the approved protocol and any amendments 
 receives all documents and supplies necessary 
 is enrolling only eligible subjects  
 provides all the required reports, notifications, applications  and submissions 
o Verify, for the investigational product: 
 That the storage times and conditions are acceptable, and that  supplies are sufficient 
throughout the trial 
 That the SUI product is supplied only to subjects who are elig ible to receive it and with 
the correct quantity 
 That the subjects are provided with necessary instruction on p roper use, handling, 
storage, and return of the product 
 That the receipt, use, and return of the product are controlle d, documented, and complies 
with regulations 
o Verify that written informed consent was obtained before each subject’s participation in the trial 
o Report subject recruitment rate 
o Verify that source documents and trial records are accurate, c omplete, and up to date 
o Determine whether all adverse events are appropriately reporte d within time periods required 
o Communicate deviations from the protocol and make appropriate actions. 
 
In addition, a Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be establi shed for this project and will review the 
study design, IRB protocol, adverse events and findings of the study.

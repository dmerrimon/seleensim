Clinical Phase:     NIH Stage 1 of Behavioral Intervention Development  
Principal Investigator:    [INVESTIGATOR_214459], MD, MSc  
Study Description:   We will determine whether N -of-[ADDRESS_1148649]  confidence regarding the decision to continue or discontinue beta -
blockers in older adults with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction  (HFpEF) .  
Sample Size:   N=16  
Enrollment:   This study will enroll 16 subjects.   
Study Population:   Subjects will be recruited from the HFpEF Program, as well as from the Cardiology, Heart 
Failure, Geriatrics and/or Internal Medicine clinics at Weill Cornell Medicine.  
Enrollment Period:   30 Months  
Study Design:   This is a n unblinded NIH Stage I of Behavioral Intervention Development trial, using a 
Crossover  intervention model.  We will  enroll [ADDRESS_1148650] s each. We will use a tw o-arm crossover titration /revers al 
design (On [A] vs. Off [B]) with  up to  4 periods. Subjects  will be randomized to either ABAB 
or BABA (see Figure 1 below).  Each period will last up to [ADDRESS_1148651] the option to participate in less ( 2-3) or more  periods ( 5-6) depending 
on whether they need additional information to make an informed decision about 
continuing or discontinuing their beta -blocker at the end of this  trial.  The intervention  
drug  will be beta -blockers,  previously  prescribed to the subject s by [CONTACT_9682] . We 
have developed a titration algorithm, where we will reduce the dose of each beta -blocker 
by 50% every week.

 6 Intervention Description:  The intervention is a two -arm crossover withdrawal/reversal design (On [A] vs. Off [B]) 
with up to 4 periods, each period lasting up to 6 weeks. During the On period ( A), subject s 
will be on their beta -blocker. During the Off period (B), their beta -blocker s will be down -
titrated and subsequently discontinued ; we will decrease the dose of beta -blocker by 50% 
every week regardless of which beta -blocker they are on, similar to an algorithm used in 
a prior deprescribing trial.   Subjects will be randomized to either ABAB or BABA (see Figure 
1 below) .

 10 2. Background  
 
2.1 Disease  
 
Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFpEF ) affects >3 million people across the US and is 
a prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_214460] —it disproportionately affects older adults (mean age ~76 years);  
age-related changes to the cardiovascular system and common age -related comorbid conditions are 
implicated in its pathogenesis; a nd multiple comorbid conditions and polypharma cy are nearly 
univer sal. While beta -blockers are the most commonly used  medication for HFpEF  (~80% in a recent 
Randomized Controlled  Trial), there is substantial uncertainty regarding their benefits in HFpEF . 
Although the benefits of beta -blockers in H eart Failure  with reduced ejection fraction are well -
documented,  Randomized Clinical Trials ( RCTs ) of beta -blockers in HFpEF  have been neutral to date, 
failing to consistently improve or worsen long -term outcomes including mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214461];  and short -term effects on patient -reported outcomes like function and quality of life are not 
well-described, with a signal of harm in some.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_1148658] the health and 
wellbeing of older adults. Deprescribing (or medication discon tinuation) has emerged as a strategy to 
improve outcomes in older adults with multiple chronic conditions and high medication burden but  is 
underutilized. With this project, we will refine an innovative pragmatic subject -centered approach (N -
of-1 trials) t o medication optimization in older adults, thereby [CONTACT_214502].  
 
In [CONTACT_214532]’s clinical experience as Director of the HFpEF  Program for the Aging, he has found that 
some patients feel  better with beta -blocker s while others feel worse. This idea  is supported by 
[CONTACT_214503] —on the one hand, beta -blockers 
can slow down heart rate, improve left ventricular filling, and thus improve cardiac output and overall 
functioning. On the other hand, beta -bloc kers can exacerbate chronotropic incompetence, worsen 
cardiac output, and reduce exercise tolerance. Beta -blockers are also a common cause of adverse 
drug reactions and can worsen function in some older adults.  There is no readily discernable way to 
determ ine which patients will feel better and which will feel worse . Although the benefits of beta -
blockers in HF with reduced ejection fraction are well documented , RCTs of beta -blockers in HFpEF  
have been neutral to date, failin g to consistently improve or worsen long -term outcomes including 
mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103] . Thus, beta -blocker use in HFpEF  is a well -suited and clinically 
relevant model for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a subject -centered approach to medication optimization.

 11 2.3  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
The risks and benefits of N-of-[ADDRESS_1148660] s: 
i) Risks associated with down -titration/discontinuation of beta -blocker: Adverse drug 
withdrawal events including tachycardia, worsened hypertension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
diaphoresis, shortness of breath , heart failure exacerbation, angina, myocardial 
infarction,  cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death (shown to 
occur with abrupt cessation of beta -blocker )  
ii) Risks associated with beta -blocker use (and re -initiation/up -titration):  Adverse drug 
events or adverse drug reactions including bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, 
dizziness, fatigue, depression, confusion, heart failure exacerbation, cerebrovascular 
accident, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death  
iii) Risks associated w ith wearing the Garmin  wearable device :  Local skin irritation, wrist 
pain  
iv) Risks associated with subject  interviews: Emotional distress related to answering 
interview questions, and breach of confidentiality  
v) Risks associated with Cardiopulmonary Ex ercise Test and Short Physical Performance 
Battery: musculoskeletal injury , arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, hemodynamic 
instability, cardiovascular collapse, death . 
vi) Risks associated with Short physical performance battery: falling, musculoskeletal 
injury . 
vii) Risks associated with the 6-minute  walk test: fatigue, dizziness.  
viii) Risks associated with blood draws : pain or bruising, dizziness, infection at the site of 
the blood draw  
 
2.3.2 Known Potential Benefits   
 
For some, continuing beta -blockers may be beneficial:  Beta -blockers slow down hear t 
rate, improve left ventricular filling and thus improve cardiac output and overall 
functioning. They can function as anti -hypertensive and may suppress arrhythmias.   
 
For others, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_214462] -blockers may be  beneficial : Beta -blockers can exacerbate 
chronotropic incompetence, worsen cardiac output, and reduce exercise tolerance. Beta -
blockers are also a commo n cause of adverse drug reactions and can worsen function in 
some older adults. Beta -blockers can also contribute to undesirable symptoms like fatigue 
and sexual dysfunction.  
 
Subject s may specifically benefit from this study by [CONTACT_214504] -level 
short -term effects of beta -blockers . This information could then help subject s determine 
whether they wish to continue or discontinue beta blockers, potentially contributing to 
increased de cision confidence an d subject  activation , and possibly improving quality of 
life. 
  
Protocol # 12.0  
Version Date : 27Dec2022  
 [ADDRESS_1148661] s to risk  
1.) Exposure to beta -blocker: Subject s are already on beta -blocker at the time of 
recruitment; thus, being on beta -blocker does not explicitly add additional risk beyond 
usual clinical care  
2.) Down -titration/discontinuation: Subject s will have their beta -blocker dose decreased 
and/or discont inued. There is limited data to support the benefits of beta -blocker in 
HFpEF , despi[INVESTIGATOR_214463]. Moreover, beta -blocker  use pose s several harms in older 
adults including bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, depression, 
confus ion, heart failure exacerbation, cerebrovascular accident, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88475]. Accordingly, down -titration/discontinuation of beta -blocker may actually be safer 
than continuing beta -blocker, at least in some.   
 
To mitigate the risks of down -titration /discontinuation, we will incorporate the following: 
1.) remote monitoring protocol that includes assessments of resting heart rate  and blood 
pressure   
2.) telephone calls made by [CONTACT_214505] a dose 
modification is planned, to instruct about the next day ’s dose change; the day a dose 
modification is planned, to confirm the dose change was made and the assess health 
status; and the day following dose modification, to reassess health status , where we will 
ascertain whether the subject  is experiencing any withdrawal effects such as chest pain, 
tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], diaphoresis, and shortness of br eath, as well as any adverse 
events, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or adverse cardiovascular events, including HF 
exacerbation, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident and death ; 
based off of subject feedback,  telephone calls may be elim inated during the last 2 weeks 
of each period  
3.) We will also provide a 24 hour/[ADDRESS_1148662] a clear  benefit 
in this condition (and are a Class I indication) . 
 
We hypothesize that there will be benefits to dose reduction ( down -titration / 
discontinuation). Beta -blockers can exacerbate chronotropic incompetence, worsen 
cardiac output, and reduce exercise tolerance, as well as possibly worsen physical 
function, and be a major cause of adverse drug reactions.  [CONTACT_214532] (as a board -certified 
heart failure physician and HFpEF  specialist) has already observed this in his clinical 
practice —among nine  subject s in whom he has discontinued beta -blocker s, [ADDRESS_1148663] s.

[CONTACT_133239] a broadly applic able approach (N -of-1) that can b ypass the inherent limitations of 
randomized controlled trials which provide average treatment effects and limited data on the effects 
of medication for a single individual;  and thereby [CONTACT_827814], drug  
metabolism,  responsiveness to therapy, and health priorities.  
 
This study  will also formalize a process that can increase subject  involvement and incorporate shared 
decision making into medication management, an important priority in cardiovascular medicine.  
 
We will conduct N -of-1 trials using a two -arm crossover  withdrawal/ reversal  design (On [A] vs Off [B]) 
with  up to  [ADDRESS_1148665] s will be randomized to either  Arm1/ ABAB or Arm2/ BABA (see Figure 1 
above). After the initial period ( Period 1), each subject  will crossover to the other arm and continue 
in that arm for up to 6 weeks ( Period 2). This may be  repeated for two more periods for a total of 4 
periods; each  period will last up to [ADDRESS_1148666] and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_214465] a final 
decision to discontinue or continue the beta -blocker at the end of a period , the end of intervention 
phase will begin at the end of that period visit. For the remainder of the protocol, we refer to “end of 
intervention” as period 4, but this can be changed based on when a final decision is made about the 
beta -blocker.  The end of i ntervention visits can occur at any of the periods. The minimum number of 
periods will be 2 (AB or BA).  If the subject wishes to collect more data, then additional periods may 
be added in an alternating fashion (ABAB or BABA).  Accordingly, the number of periods will be an 
adaptive component of the protocol.  
 
For dose reduction, we will follow a schedule that was safe in a prior deprescribing trial —50% 
reduction every week until Off1. This reduction schedule will follow up -titrations and down -titrations 
outlined in section 7.4, but will also be adaptive based on subject clinical profiles and symptoms while 
on and off beta -blockers.  
 
Subjects randomized to Arm 1/ ABAB ( starting with On [A]), will continue their home dose during 
Period 1. They will then crossover to Period 2, where we will begin dose reduction . The dose will be 
reduced by 50% each week until the subject is off of beta -blockers. At the end of period 2 visit, 
subjects will be given the opportunity to decide if they would like to remain on or off their beta -
blocker, or if they would like to continue into period 3. If they chose to continue to period 3, they will 
restart  beta -blocker by  [CONTACT_214507] a low dose and then  doubling th is dose every week until reaching their

by 50% for a week, until the subject is off of beta -blockers.   
 
For patients in Arm 1, t he number of periods a 
subject will complete is dependent on their 
decision about continuing or discontinuing their 
beta -blocker at their end of period [ADDRESS_1148667] the following physical assessments 
associated with it: Cardiopulmonary Exercise

intervention visit at period 2 and enter follow -up. 
 
Subjects randomized into Arm 2/BABA will start  with Off[B]. Instead of abruptly stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_214462] -blocker, 
these subjects will have their previously prescribed home beta -blocker dose reduced by 50% each 
week, until the subject  is completely off beta -blocker. During Period 2, they will restart beta -blocker  
by [CONTACT_214508] a low dose and then doubling this dose every week until reaching their home dose. During 
Period 3, we will again conduct a dose reduction, reducing each dose by 50% for a week, until the 
subject is off of beta -blockers. Finally, they will rest art beta -blocker by [CONTACT_214508] a low dose and then

The interventions in this study will be used for either exploratory purposes or integrated with study 
visits to help subjects  make decisions on whether they would like to continue or discontinue their 
beta -blocker medications. CPET and the respective results, RPM vitals ( including blood pressure and 
heart rate), collected blood biomarker levels, step count analysis, and 6-minute walk test results and 
analysis will serve as exploratory measurements. Therefore, these results and values will not be 
explicitly shared with the subjects  throughout the study to minimize bias. This way, subjects  can base 
their decision -making on how they truly felt (measured by [CONTACT_214511] -making 
questionnaires) and their ability to make an informed decision with their provider. PROs, or subject  
reported outcomes will be included in the consenting process and study visits. These PROs incl ude 
answers to their questionnaires and data visualizations analyzing how their answers differed 
between periods. The PROs will be explicitly discussed with the subjects  to further motivate them to 
make an informed decision on how they feel. These expectat ions on what will be provided 
throughout the study will be clearly outlined during the consent process and baseline visit. If subjects  
specifically request to see these values, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_214466].   
 
We will also conduct brief qualitative interviews to assess the understandability and usability of 
materials at each of the following time points: 1) completion of informed consent, 2) completion of 
each period of the intervention arms , 3) completion of the full intervention phase  for each subject , 
and 4) at 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_1148673]

Names and all other PHI that appear in the transcription will be replaced with a generic participant 
ID or redacted . Additional interviews may be conducted to elicit additional information related to 
themes previously discussed during interviews and/or feedback provided to the study team during 
the course of the study.  
 
Per subject  feedback, w e may eliminate the use of wearable devices  or modify  subject reported 
outcome questionnaires.  We may also give caregivers  the opportunity to share any feedback they 
may have.  We will ask the subjects for permission to discuss the study with their caregivers.  We will 
also ask the subjects for permission to contact [CONTACT_214512].   
 
At the conclusion of the in tervention phase, and possibly at the end of each intervention period, we 
will provide subjects with visual analogies of their physical function and subject reported outcomes 
data. These data will be discussed with them to help them determine if they would  like to continue 
or discontinue their beta -blockers for the foreseeable future.   
 
       3.[ADDRESS_1148674]. Goyal’s clinical experience as Director of the HFpEF  Program for the Aging, he has found that 
some subject s feel better with beta -blockers while others feel worse. This idea is supported by 
[CONTACT_214503] —on the one hand, beta -blockers 
can slow down heart rate, improve left ventricular filling, and thus improve cardiac output and overall 
functioning. On the other hand, beta -blockers can exacerbate chronotropic incompetence, worsen 
cardiac output, and reduce exercise tolerance. Beta -blockers are also a commo n cause of adverse 
drug reactions and can worsen physical function in some older adults. There is no readily discernable 
way to determine which subject s will feel better and which will feel worse . Thus,  beta -blocker use in 
HFpEF  is a well -suited and clinic ally relevant model for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a subject -centered approach to 
medication optimization.

7. Study Intervention  
 
7.1 Study Intervention /Device  Description    
 
Beta -blockers, also known as beta -adrenergic blocking agents, work by [CONTACT_214518][INVESTIGATOR_238]. Although the benefits of beta -blockers in HF with reduced ejection fraction are well 
documented , RCTs of beta -blockers in HFpEF have been neutral to date, failing to consistently improve 
or worsen long -term outcomes  including mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103]. Beta -blockers do not 
provide symptomatic improvement in all subject s; some may feel better while other may feel worse 
after initiating this drug class. This is supported by [CONTACT_214519] —on the one hand, beta -blockers can slow down heart rate, improve left ventricular 
filling, and thus improve cardiac output and overall functioning. On the other hand, beta -blockers can 
exacerbate ch ronotropic incompetence, worsen cardiac output, and reduce exercise tolerance. Beta -
blockers are also a common cause of adverse drug reactions and can worsen function in some older 
adults. There is no readily discernable way to determine which patients wil l feel better and which will 
feel worse . 
 
All subjects will have been taking beta -blockers prescribed by [CONTACT_214520]. The 
study team will provide the subjects dosage instructions based on the down -titration/up -titration 
schedule out lined in this protocol.  
 
The study team will not provide study drug  to the subjects.  Subject s will continue to obtain their beta -
blockers  in the same manner as prior to  study enrollment.  
 
Beta -blockers  may be contraindicated in the following subject s: 
 
Relative contraindications : 
• Asthma; COPD (use cardio -selective β blockers/β -1 selective)  
• Psoriasis  
• Symptomatic bradycardia  
• Sick sinus syndrome (without a pacemaker); heart block greater than first degree  
• Peripheral artery occlusive disease, Raynaud phenomenon  
• Pregnancy  
• Atenolol is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy  
 
Absolute contraindications : 
• Allergy  
• Cardiogenic shock and hypotension  
• Pheochromocytoma

 [ADDRESS_1148691] s; all subject s enrolled will have already be pr escribed  beta -
blocker at the time of enrollment into the study .   
 
7.[ADDRESS_1148692]’s pharmacy.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1148693] created a down -titration  schedule , where we will reduce the dose of each beta -blocker by 
50% every week, a schedule used  in a prior deprescribing study of antihypertensives , that included 
beta -blockers. This schedule accounts for a sufficient number of half -lives to ensure drug clearance 
and accounts for  changes in receptor density and related adrenergic hypersensitivity linked to 
withdrawal symptoms and ADWEs observed after abrupt beta -blocker cessation. Re -initiation/up -
titration will be done in reverse order.  Subjects will never go on a dosage higher t han their usual home 
dose. All drugs will be administered orally.  To assist subjects with dose reduction, each subject will 
receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_214469].  
 
 
 7.4.1 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
 
We do not anticipate any dosing delays or dose modifications outside of the aforementioned 
down -titration  and up -titration schedule.  However, dosing changes and other adaptations to the 
dosing schedule will be up to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_214470].  
 
7.5 General Medication Inventory and  Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
All concomitant medications will be recorded and/or updated on subject medication log throughout 
the course of the study . Table 4: Examples of drug down -titration schedule for selected β -blockers

7.6 Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
We do not anticipate treatment delays. In the setting of a treatment delay due to an adverse event, 
continued study p articipation will depend on:  
o Disease progression  
o Inter vening  illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
o Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
o Subject  decision to withdraw from the study,  
o General or specific changes in the subject ’s condition render the subject  ineligible for further 
treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

This study will not be blinded. The study team will conduct randomization  using a WCM -approved 
randomization tool . 
 
7.9 Study Intervention/Follow -up Compliance  
 
Study team will ensure the protocol is followed as written. Protocol can be modified per subject 
feedback.  
 
Remote monitoring will occur on a daily basis. Subjects will be provided with a tablet  computer  and 
blood pressure cuff free-of-charge . These data w ill be automatically uploaded to an  online portal,

Telephone calls will occur on a weekly basis, during each call we will request information regarding 
drug compliance.  Telephone calls may be eliminated during the last [ADDRESS_1148695] them , 
in a 4-week  time frame,  via telephone  and/or email . We will also inquire about their status from their 
physician , as well as through their electronic health  records.  
 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if we are unable to contact [CONTACT_214521] [ADDRESS_1148696] a blood specimen that is

to follow them through the course of the study (if subject is will ing). R emaining study procedures will 
be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified 
(including, but not limited to changes from  baseline) afte r enrollment, the investigator  will determine 
if any change in subject management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported 
as an adverse event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• Concomitant Medications  
• Decision making outcomes questionnaire  
• Short Physical Performance Battery  
• Adverse Events/SAE  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1148699] Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time if they wish . 
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a subject from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Pregnancy  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse  event (AE), or other medical condition or situation occurs such that 
continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject  (this will be 
decided on conjunction with their own physician and/or the DSMB ). 
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention  
• If the subject meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) 
that precludes further study participation  
• Subject  lost to follow -up after several attempts to contac t subject to schedule study visit.  
 
The reason for subject discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case  
Report Form (CRF)  in REDCap . Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but 
do not receive the study intervention may be replaced. Subjects who sign the informed consent form, 
and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are

11.1.1  REDCap  
 
REDCap  (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software system that is 
fully supported by [CONTACT_57421] -Cornell Medical Center CTSC. It is a tool for the creation of 
customized, secure data management systems that include Web -based data -entry fo rms, 
reporting tools, and a full array of security features including user and group -based  privileges, 
authentication using institution LDAP system, with a full audit trail of data manipulation and 
export procedures. REDCap  is maintained on CTSC -owned serv ers that are backed up nightly and 
support encrypted (SSL -based) connections. Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced,  and 
supported through a multi -institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422].

Protocol # 12.0  
Version Date : 27Dec2022  
 [ADDRESS_1148703]/Ethics Committee Approval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained before  study initiation.  
Before initiation of the study, the protocol, the ICF, other written material  given to the subject s, 
and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the appropriate Ethics 
Committee. Written approval of the study and all relevant study information must be obtained 
before the study center can be initiated. Any necess ary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB approval 
must be obtained for changes to the study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other 
study documentation. The written approval of the IEC/IRB together with the approved ICF must 
be filed in the stu dy files. The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new information 
that may adversely affect the safety of the subject s or the conduct of the study. The Investigator 
will submit written summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as requir ed. On completion of 
the study, the IEC/IRB will be notified that the study has ended.  
 
All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly recorded on a protocol amendment form and will 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_86317]. All p rotocol amendments will 
be submitted to the relevant institutional IEC/IRB for approval before implementation, as 
required by [CONTACT_427]. The only exception will be when the amendment is necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the trial subjec ts. In this case, the necessary action will be taken 
first, with the relevant protocol amendment following shortly thereafter. Weill Cornell Medicine 
must approve all consent form changes prior to local IRB submission. Relevant study 
documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the participating countries, 
according to local/national requirements, for review an d approval before the beginning of the 
study. On completion of the study, the regulatory authorities will be notified that the study has 
ended.

Protocol # 12.0  
Version Date : 27Dec2022  
 [ADDRESS_1148705] approved by [CONTACT_57425]. The ICF will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, a pplicable 
laws and regulations.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1148706] (FDAMA) and t he Food 
and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the Spo nsor -Investigator of the trial is solely 
responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for 
submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Information posted will allow subjects to identify 
potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by [CONTACT_3379] a 
central contact [CONTACT_214522].  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1148707] s when sharing key outcomes, we will compare PROs between Periods 
A (On) and Periods B (Off) using a linear or generalized linear mixed effects model that will include the 
fixed effects of beta -blocker, treatment effect (A vs B), period effect (1 , 2, 3, 4  etc.) and a patient -level 
random inte rcept to account for within -patient repeated measurements. The period fixed effect will 
estimate the effects of down -titration/up -titration and the time -dependent treatment effect will estimate 
On vs. Off effect. We will also explore period -specific fixed effects for treatment and compare the models 
using Akaike Information Criterion. As an exploratory analysis, we will also test the pattern of activity as a 
function of time in specialized statistical models called functional data model.   
 
 Power: The study team will have 80% power to detect a within -patient difference of 1.[ADDRESS_1148708] 
deviations in the four outcomes at an α=1.67% (after controlling for Type I error inflation due to three 
outcomes). While power for these analyses will be modest, they  will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_214471] a 
future proposal to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and/or Patient -Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute (PCORI) to conduct a larger multi -center randomized controlled trial to determine whether 
discontinuation  of BB in HFpEF can improve outcomes relevant to older adults including function and 
quality of life.  
 
Power:  The co-primary objective is to determine features of a feasible and pragmatic protocol for 
deprescribing N -of-1 trials, which will be done through  an iterative stakeholder -engaged process (C.1.2). 
The goal is not to establish safety and/or efficacy here. Thus, power calculations for this Aim are less 
relevant.  
 
Protocol # 12.0

 32        12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
We will collect data on physical function, patient -reported outcomes, decision parameters, patient 
activation, and attitudes toward deprescribing.  
 
12.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
 We plan to enroll one subject/month for [ADDRESS_1148709] —
vitals collected via remote monitoring, step -count, peak oxygenation uptake, short physical 
performance battery score, and patient -reported outcome domains. To achieve this, analys is 
will use a general linear mixed effects model, where fixed effects of BB, period effect (Period 
1 or Period 2) and carry -over effect will be included. In addition, a patient -level random 
intercept will be added to the model to account for within -patient  repeated measurements. 
To control for inflation of Type I error due to testing multiple outcomes, the Holm’s stepdown 
procedure   will be used. The overall Type I erro r will be set at 5% and all statistical analyses 
will be two -sided.  
 
1. Vitals collected via Remote Monitoring . A general linear mixed effects model will be used,  
comparing daily pulse and blood pressure averages of the On and Off arms. The study team 
will an alyze data from the timeframe during which BB is completely stopped (“Off” when 
participating in the Off -arm) and at usual dose (“Full dose” when participating in the On -arm); 
this will occur during the last 2 weeks each Period (see Figure 1). The study team will utilize a 
general analytic framework to analyze average blood pressure  and pulse during each period.  
 
2. Physical activity (via step -count).  A general linear mixed effects model will be used, comparing 
daily step -count averages of the On and Off arms.  The study team will analyze data from the 
timeframe during which BB is completely stopped (“Off” when participating in the Off -arm) and 
at usual  dose (“Full dose” when participating in the On -arm); this will occur during the last 2 
weeks of each Period (see Figure 1).  The study team will utilize a general analytic framework to 
analyze average daily step -count during each period. As an exploratory  analysis, the study team 
will also perform analysis that will visualize and test the pattern of activity as a function of time in 
specialized statistical models called functional data model developed for this purpose. The study 
team will then test the dif ferences in the properties of these curves between the two treatment 
groups.  
 
3. Function (via short physical performance battery).   A general linear mixed effects model will be 
used, comparing the short physical performance battery score of the On and Off a rms.  
Protocol # 12.0  
Version Date : 27Dec2022

4. Exercise capacity (via peak oxygen consumption during exercise).   A general linear mixed effects 
model will be used, comparing VO2 of the On and Off arms.  
 
5. Patient -reported outcomes (PROs).   A general linear mixed effects model will be used, comparing 
each patient -reported outcome domain (HF -specific quality of life, fatigue, depression, 
anxiety, sleep, physical function, social role, and pain) of the On and Off arms.  The study 
team will an alyze data from the timeframe during which BB is completely stopped (“Off” when 
participating in the Off -arm) and at usual dose (“Full dose” when participating in the On -arm); 
this will occur during weeks [ADDRESS_1148710] two weeks of th e period.  (see 
Figure 1).   
 
6. Subject Qualitative Interviews . Directed content analysis methods will be used to develop 
relevant categories and themes from interview transcript data. Coding will be conducted 
through the coding platform Dedoose. Transcripts  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_214523], 
consulting additional members to establish consensus where needed. Inter -rater reliability 
between coders will be established using a Cohen's Kappa score.  
 
To provide statistics to the subject s when sharing key outcomes, we will compare PROs between 
Periods A (On) and Periods B (Off) using a linear or generalized linear mixed effects model that 
will include the fixed effects of beta -blocker, treatment effect (A vs B), period effect (1 , 2, 3, 4  
etc.) and a patient -level random intercept to account for within -patient repeated measurements. 
The period fixed effect will estimate the effects of down -titration/up -titration and the time -
dependent treatment effect will estimate On vs. off effect. We wil l also explore period -specific 
fixed effects for treatment and compare the models using Akaike Information Criterion.  As an 
exploratory analysis, we will also test the pattern of activity as a function of time in specialized 
statistical models called func tional data model.

Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The investigator will 
be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings that suggest significant hazards, 
contraindications, side effects, or precau tions pertinent to the safe use of the drug or device under 
investigation. Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_214524] s or observed 
by [CONTACT_147157] . 
 
13.1 Adverse Event Definition  
 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug and  does not imply any judgment about causality . An adverse 
event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) 
and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.

Not applicable.  
  
13.3 AE/SAE Follow Up  
 
In addition to reporting all adverse events, the study team will take all appropriate measures to 
ensure that subjects will have access to necessary medical care. Any acute change in medical 
condition will be re ported to the subject ’s physician for follow -up care. All information about the 
study will be provided to the caring physician. As this study is not blinded, there will be no masking 
issue with regard to providing optimal medical care. All study procedures will be discontinued at 
the treating physician’ s request, the subject’s  request, and/or as judged appropriate by [CONTACT_28824].  In the case of any emergency situation, the study physicians will institute 
any emergency aid needed and then make arrangements for transportation to the Emergen cy 
Department. All research subjects will have access to medical care if an adverse event occurs. The 
subject  and/or the insurance carrier will be billed for this care. Subjects will not receive special 
compensation for injury solely because they are subje cts in the study. All subjects are fully 
informed about this policy as part of the informed consent process.  
 
For SAEs that are determined to be “possibly related” or “related”, the subject will be assessed, 
evaluated, and treated for any potential recurr ence and according to the seriousness of the 
symptoms. Based on the information gathered, it will then be determined whether the subject 
should be removed from the study or continue their participation.

13.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monit or. 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, rel ationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_214527] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All 
AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AE s 
will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during t he study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the 
event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset an d duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The study coordinator or the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_214477] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for 
SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire abou t 
the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information unt il 
resolution or stabilization.  The following table provides exa mples of actions that may be taken 
following selected adverse events.  
 
 
Adverse Event  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_214478] -blocker management as recommended by [CONTACT_35425]. If 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214479], subject  will continue to follow protocol while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
Worse or new arrhythmia  Emergent care if indicated including admission and necessary medications/interventions.  Subject  
withdrawal from the study.  
Cerebrovascular accident  Emergent care if indicated including admission and necessary medications/interventions.  Subject  
withdrawa l from the study.  
Myocardial infarction  Emergent care if indicated including admission and necessary medications/interventions.  Subject  
withdrawal from the study.  
Angina  Emergent care if indicated including admission and necessary medications/interventi ons.  Subject  
withdrawal from the study.  
Heart failure exacerbation  Emergent care if indicated including admission and IV diuretics. For non -emergent issues, standard 
review and adjustment of medications.  Medical management including beta -blocker managem ent as 
recommended by [CONTACT_35425].  If exacerbation unrelated to the study and not contraindicated 
following discussion between investigators and treating physician, subject  will continue to follow 
protocol.  
Shortness of breath  Evaluation of volume  status, adjustment of medications.  Medical management including beta -blocker 
management as recommended by [CONTACT_35425].  If exacerbation unrelated to the study and not 
contraindicated following discussion between investigators and treating physicia n, subject  will 
continue to follow protocol.  
Worsened hypertension  Emergent care if indicated including admission and IV antihypertensive agents. For non -emergent 
issues, standard review and management of oral medications. If unrelated to the study and not 
contraindicated following discussion between investigators and tre ating physician, subject  will 
continue to follow protocol.

14.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
 
[The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks 
to subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the  characteristics of 
the subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_214528]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

15. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP ) 
 
We plan to use the WCM DSMB for this trial, as this a resource provided to the WCM scientific community,  
and they have the necessary expertise and infrastructure to act as a DSMB for this trial. All AEs and SAEs 
will be reported to the DSMB.  AEs where the harm is unexpected, the harm is “related” or “possibly

Significance  
Chronic pain is a public health concern, affecting 11 -38% of youth worldwide [1]. The impact of pediatric 
chronic pain on children, families, healthcare systems, and societies is immense. Youth with chronic pain 
experience considerable functional impairment, including poor school attendance, increased anxiety and 
depression, reduced p articipation in social and extracurricular activities, and lower quality of life [2,3]. 
Treatment for pediatric chronic pain is most effective when completed through an interdi sciplinary team 
including a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, physical and occupational therapy, integrative 
medicine (biofeedback, yoga, massage), and/or medications. There has been an increase in outpatient 
interdisciplinary pain treatment pro grams and several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this 
treatment, with findings suggesting improvements in functioning and reductions in distress for youth with 
chronic pain [4]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245288] , there has been a lack of 
research focused on the role of yoga in the treatment of chronic pain.  
Yoga is an ancient Indian practice, which means  “union”. The National Center for Complementary and 
Integrative Health  classifies yoga as a mind -body medicine modality [5]. The practice of yoga involves 
breathing and body postures that unite the mind and body and help reduce stress and pain [5]. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends yoga as a safe, effective method to help children cope with 
emotional, mental, and physical conditions [6]. Yoga helps the person focus on connecting the breath and 
movement, to be in the moment , and handle problems with greater ease [7].  
As a complementary therapy , yoga  has shown positive effects in children copi[INVESTIGATOR_245289] -
related conditions [5]. Learning mind -body skills, such as yoga, can help children increase their confidence and 
resiliency during painful or difficult experiences [5]. Other studies have shown yoga to improve anxiety, 
concentration, emotional balance, and stress levels [7]. Yoga’s postures and breathing can help balance the 
physiological (frequency and intensity) and psychological (anxiety) states of  pain [8]. Breathing patterns during 
yoga have health benefits related to  strengthe ning respi[INVESTIGATOR_245290] [9]. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_245291], reduce anxiety, and headache 
pain in youth, and most participants reported yoga was pleasant and helped with their sleep [10]. 
Breathing taught  during yoga, or pranayama, has been shown to improve pulmonary function in yoga groups 
compared to no changes in control groups after 12 weeks of yoga practice [11]. In a 2017 national survey, 
about 1 out of 12 U.S. children practiced yoga in the previous year [6]. When practiced regularly, yoga has 
been shown to improve balance, increase strength, and relieve tension [6]. The postures and breathing 
techniques in yoga have been shown to reduce levels of anxiety and decreased heart and breat h rates [12]. 
Yoga is a holistic approach that can help children address not only physical, but also emotional and mental 
health concerns  [12].   
Biofeedback is a useful tool in enhancing the mind -body connection. Biofeedback utilizes electronic sensors to 
measure physiological signals associated with activation of the autonomic and voluntary nervous system, such 
as breathing rate, heart rate, and temperature. During biofeedback, patients are provided with physiological 
feedback supporting the evidence of the connection between the mind (e.g., cognitive,  and emotional 
processes) and the body (e.g., physical symptoms) [13]. In turn, the patient is better able to utilize techniques 
outside of the biofeedback session to navigate activation of the nervous system.   
Research using biofeedback for the treatment of chronic pain suggests biofeedback is an efficacious treatment 
modality for migraine, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and back pain [14]. Breath training is highlighted 
as the primary mechanism surrounding the success of these treatments. Specifically, when examining the 
pathophysiology of pain, disrupted breathing patterns lead to pH imbalance and metabolism contributing to 
vasoconstriction and lack of oxygen  delivery  to organs [14], resulting in pain . Diaphragmatic breathing leads to 
activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which can lead to a reduction  in pain. Thus, b iofeedback 
plays a crucial role in ensuring that patients are utilizing adequate breathing techniques.  
While the role of breathing is highlighted in yoga interventions, to date, there have been no studies specifically 
quantifying  breathing in yoga through an objective measure. Providing the direct feedback to patients during 
yoga could enhance their understanding of how the poses are helpful and give corrective guidance to ensure 
that the breathing is optimal. However, the biofeedback devices in use today are not suitable for assessing 
breathing during yoga.  
We propose the use of a novel , non-invasive , real-time breathing sensor to show the beneficial effects of 
asana (posture) and pranayama (breathing) in the use of yoga for youth with chronic pain. The sensor consists 
of two inductive bands worn around the chest and abdomen that differentiate and measure diaphragmatic and 
chest breathing through Respi[INVESTIGATOR_234417] (RIP). Readings are wirelessly transmitted 
to an iPad . Measures include the phase angle between the chest and abdomen; percenta ge breathing through 
the ribcage; respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; and labored breathing index. This sensor takes little time to set up and readings 
are provided in real time .  
Apps related to mindfulness and breathing for mobile phones are ubiquitous. Christmann et al [15] evaluated 
[ADDRESS_298429] frequently used in these Apps. A similar study [16] evaluated 
[ADDRESS_298430] common were mindfulness and 
meditation (73%) and diaphragmatic breathing (25%). Chittaro et al [17] considered breathing apps through the 
Apple store and classified the m into either audio or visual instruction format. They found that the visual format 
was superior. A recent study [ 18] used the phone placed on the abdomen to record abdominal breathing as 
biofeedback. It showed that abdominal breathing biof eedback improved instructed breathing, however, this did 
not carry over to self -reported relaxation due to the increased cognitive load.  
 
Biofeedback video games are an attractive new stress therapy in which players use their physiological signals 
to implicitly control gameplay. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback [1 9] games account for a large portion 
of all biofeedback games. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_245292] [ 20] are another important variant. What sets 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_245293], including HRV, is that respi[INVESTIGATOR_148450] a parameter that the 
player can directly control to improve game performance. One study [21] used a  modified Pac-Man game with 
breathing feedback and results showed that onetime training with the biofeedback version of the game was not 
only more effective, but also led to improved performance in a later stressful task, both in terms of lowered 
breathing and improved tes t scores, compared to the non -biofeedback version. Similar stress reduction video 
games with paced breathing biofeedback have been developed and show positive results [22,23]. Although 
there are many breath pacing apps , none use synchronous breathing betwe en the belly and chest.  
 
The patented  Pneu RIP sensor is being used in research studies for premature babies, neuromuscular disease, 
cerebral palsy in four academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] . The app is available in the app store. This proposal would expand 
the use of the Pneu RIP for yogic breathing for youth with chronic pain with software modifications.  
Innovation    
Pneu RIP sensor  
The Pneu RIP (Fig 1, 2) includes  a circuit board  enclosed in the  
5cm x 3cm casing that is connected to the chest  band fastened 
around the rib cage . A wire connects the chest band to the 
abdominal band.  The bands measure change in volume 
(plethysmography) in the rib cage and abdomen as the person 
breathes , through changes i n inductance.  The rib cage and 
abdominal excursions are measured and transmitted wirelessly to 
a tablet. The data are then converted to Work of Breathing (WOB) 
indices  and plotted and displayed in real time on the tablet  (fig 3). 
Readings are collected [ADDRESS_298431] processing.  The 
software that records and di splays the breathing data is controlled 
through an App readily downloaded through the App  store. The 
Pneu RIP is jointly developed by [CONTACT_245306]’s 
Health System. It measures WOB parameters non -invasively without requiring 
voluntary effort by [CONTACT_423]. It has been used as a research tool in monitoring Figure [ADDRESS_298432]

children with neuromuscular disease, premature babies, cerebral palsy, Morquio syndrome and animal studies 
[24,25,26,28,29]. Other comparable devices using Respi[INVESTIGATOR_234417] (RIP) are used in 
sleep studies [27] but they are much larger and do not provide real -time feedback.  
We will develop  a modified version of the PneuRIP sensor to monitor yogic  breathing. The innovation  of 
the project is the ability of the sensor to record  established  measures of breathing 
during yoga and provide feedback to the user on how they are performing. The 
salient measurement in the pneuRIP is phase angle between chest and belly 
breathing. For optimal breathing both these compartments should be moving 
synchronously.  The phase angle can be measured during yoga to indicate 
efficiency of breathing and with the aid of  biofeedback can be optimized. Another 
variable measured is the percentage 
ribcage, which is a measure of how 
much the belly and chest are 
individually contributing to breathing. 
Yoga emphasizes deep breathing which 
would involve both compartment s 
which can be measured and used in a 
feedback loop to improve breathing.   
 
Diverse Team  
The team combines academic and commercial investigators and 
brings expertise in engineering and clinical domains. Drs. Rahman 
and Shaffer have a track record of NIH funding and publications in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_245294]  a combined [ADDRESS_298433] 
specializing in  pediatric pain management. Christina Russell is a 
registered nurse, a certified yoga  instructor, and a certified healing 
touch practitioner and the program coordinator for the yoga program  at the Nemours Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - 
Delaware . 
 
Approach  
Utilizing biofeedback will create two important changes. First, the yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245295]. Objective data on breathing technique would allow correction in the moment so that a 
patient does not practice suboptimal brea thing outside of the sessions and allow the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245296]. In turn, adequate practice at home could lead to a stronger treatment response. Secondly, 
the use of the biofeedback monitor would also allow for better introspection i nto the mind -body connection and 
improved adherence to practicing the skill.  
Subjects : We will follow 20 subjects from the Integrated P ain and Wellness  Program at Nemours Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – Delaware. The program is embedded across multiple departments within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245297] . Salamon  (Behavioral Health Department)  and Christina Russell  (Integrative Medicine 
Department) . All subjects will be recruited in the latter [ADDRESS_298434]. Inclusion criteria: a) youth 
presenting for an initial evaluation within the Integrated Pain and Wellness Program, b) between 10 and 18 
years old, c) prescribed yoga therapy as part of the treatment plan. Exclusion criteria include any medical 
condition precluding the use of yoga therapy.  
The feasibility  of the modified pneu RIP will be tested in this phase I proposal. The goals are to modify the 
existing pneu RIP software in the first [ADDRESS_298435] while their breathing is recorded. 
The other half will additionally be provided biofeedback while they perform the same therapy.  
Specific aim 1: Development of a Biofeedback App 
The current pneu RIP app was developed primarily as a clinical tool to provide real -time monitoring of patient’s 
breathing. The mobile application makes it very easy to quickly connect and provide the clinician with real -time, 
quantitative  metrics. To be a successful tool in yoga therapy, we believe that the feedback mechanism is 
critical and must align with the Zen tenet of yoga. Rather than providing  heavily numerical measurements and 
plots  as the current App is set up to be , the application’s interface will provide subtle visual cues to guide the 
subject. Visualizations of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_245298] (users’ 
preferences and perceived effectiveness) improve the effectiveness of breathing training [17]. Additional 
studies have shown the utility  of using auditory and haptic feedback to help aid the user’s breathing [30]. 
However, for phase I , we will only provide visual feedback on an i Pad to keep the interface simple and gauge 
the efficacy of biofeedback.   
The visualizations will be used to represent both the phases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_245299]. Existing studies and mobile applications typi[INVESTIGATOR_245300] [17]. The first common approach utilizes a circle -
based visualization that depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039] a circle expanding and contracting with the 
breathing cycle. This is often supplemented with colors or sounds to mark the 
different phases of breathing: inhalation, h olding, and exhalation. In our case to 
keep the presentation simple we will have two moving bars that correspond to 
the chest and belly (Fig. 4). In addition to capturing the respi[INVESTIGATOR_62398], the 
bars will help depi[INVESTIGATOR_245301] . The goal of the participant will be to 
keep the height of the bars the same as they go up and down. This ensures that 
the belly and chest are both exerting equally AND that they are working in ph ase 
for most efficient breathing. The phase angle and the percentage rib cage as 
measured from the existing algorithm will be used to calculate the interactive 
bars.  These metrics are computed directly on the pneuRIP hardware and are transmitted wireless to the 
application via Bluetooth Smart as BLE characteristics. On the front -end, the application will leverage modern 
web technologies including React framework and D 3.js to render and animate the visuals.  
Specific aim 2: Determine the immediate and cumulative impact of biofeedback  on breathing by [CONTACT_245307] - and post - individual , and multiple yoga 
sessions.  
The Rationale  for aim 2 is to determine the feasibility and utility of providing biofeedback on belly/chest 
breathing synchrony to participants in a clinical yoga setting for youth with pain. Subjects will be randomized 
into two groups: One will receive instruction on correct  (synchronous)  breathing technique , and the other will 
receive instruction and biofeedback. Youth enrolled within the Integrated Pain and Wellness Program at 
Nemours Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - Delaware  are referred to Integrative Medicine for yoga Therapy. As part of the 
program, youth are offered eight integrative therapy sessions  at 30-[ADDRESS_298436] measures of pain will be measured before and after the entire yoga regimen.  
Each session will begin and end with the individual sitting and breathing normally without manipulation for 5 
minutes. This does not include the square breathing technique listed in the protocol. The protocol for an 
individual session is as follows: Seated crossed legged  connecting to breath by [CONTACT_245308] 
(inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exhale 4 seconds), seated spi[INVESTIGATOR_245302], seated side stretches, table top with cat/cow, thread needle, bird -dog, 
down dog, mountain side stretches, mountain raising arms overhead and out to side, forward fold, chair, 
warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, extended side angle, wide leg standing fold, tree, warrior 3, forward fold , 
plank, cobra, sphinx, pi[INVESTIGATOR_42849], bridge, reclining spi[INVESTIGATOR_245302], happy baby, reclining butterfly, Seated crossed 
legged —connecting to breath by [CONTACT_245308] (inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 
seconds).  Instructor reminds individual to  breathe while holding postures. Postures that are not flowing into 
other poses are held for at least one minute.  
Outcome Measurements  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_245303]  
• Phase angle : This is a measure of the synchronicity between the belly and chest while breathing. Ideally the 
phase should be 30 degrees or less for efficient breathing.  
• Labored breathing index  (LBI): The LBI is an indication of the additional work of breathing when breathing is 
asynchronous. Ideally, LBI is 1 when breathing is perfectly synchronous, and this index goes up as breathing 
gets more asynchronous.  
• Percentage ribcage  (%RC): %RC is a measure of how much effort the chest is putting out relative the belly.  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] : Breaths per minute  
• Oxygen saturation  and heart rate : Blood oxygen level and pulse rate, measured by a finger clip -on device.  
Pain Measures  
Demographic information  will be  assessed through a brief self -report questionnaire regarding the youth’s age, 
ethnicity/race, gender /biological sex , typi[INVESTIGATOR_245304] (rated on a 0 -10 numeric rating scale), and pain 
location(s). Medical diagnoses to be  obtained through review of the electronic medical record (EMR).  
• The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Adolescent Version (CPAQ -A) [31] is a 20 -item self -report 
measure for youth with two subscales: 1) Pain Willingness (i.e., willingness to experience pain without 
attempting to control, reduce, or avoid it) and 2) Activity Engagement (i.e., participation in valued life 
activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_187468]). Questions are rated on a 5 -point Likert scale from 0 (never true) to 4 (always true). 
Higher scores indicate greater pain acceptance.  Prior research suggests the CPAQ -A has adequate 
psychometric properties [31,32,33]. 
• The PROMIS Pediatric Pain Interference Scale [34] is an 8 -item self -report questionnaire assessing the 
extent to which pain interferes with functioning (e.g., emotional, academic, physical) over the past 7 days. Figure 5 Data collection timeline

Items are rated from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Normative data are available, and raw scores are 
transformed to T -scores. Higher scores indicate greater levels of pain interference.  
• The PROMIS Youth Anxiety Short Form [35] is an 8 -item form derived from the item bank for Pediatric 
Anxiety developed by [CONTACT_3718] -sponsored PROMIS. This measure assesses fear (e.g., fearfulness), 
anxious misery (e.g., worry), and hyperarousal (e.g., nervousness) over the past week. Adolescents and 
parents/guardians rate how often  they experienced feelings in a variety of contexts, including home, school, 
and social activities on a scale from 0 ( never)  to 4 ( always ). Normative data are available, and raw scores 
are transformed to T -scores. Higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety.  
Data analysis : Numeric data will be  summarized using mean (SD) or  median (Interquartile range)  as 
appropriate,  and categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Baseline and 
demographic  characteristics will be compared using  t-test, Mann -Whitney U test  or Fisher exact tests as 
appropriate.  A mixed effects repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare the 
mean changes in  breath ing phase angle (degrees),  labored  breathing index (unit),  blood oxygen level 
(%), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (unit),  pain acceptance scale,  PROMIS pediatric pain interference scale,  and PROMIS 
youth anxiety short form  over time.  Likert scale measures  will be used a s both numeric  and 
categorical  forms,  thereby, a generalized mixed effects model will  also be used to compare the  changes in 
Likert scale  over time.  Model assumptions will be checked  before analysis. All tests will be two -tailed at  the 
level of significanc e of 0.05. Statistical software SAS, version  9.4, or R (version  4.05)  will be used  for the 
analysis.   
Sample size  and power:  The primary goal is the change in  breathing  phase angle from baseline to  after the 
yoga therapy regimen.  In accordance with data from a previous study  [29], the baseline mean (SD)  phase 
angle  is 40 (12)  degrees,  and after [ADDRESS_298437] the phase angle to be  15 (9) 
and 30 (9) in the instructional + biofeedback group,  and instructional alone group,  respectively.  A sample size 
of [ADDRESS_298438] the above  changes  in phase angle  with a power more than 80% at the 
level of the significance of 0.05. Assuming 25% attrition rate  a sample size  of 20 (10+10)  subjects  is planned 
for this study.  
 
Potential problems, alternate strategies, benchmarks for success  
Yoga is one of a few other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (cognitive behavioral therapy, physical and occupational therapy,  
massage, and/or medications ) participants in this study  may simultaneously be receiving. This  makes it  difficult 
to determine  whether the breathing with biofeedback is the cause of improvement. However, this will be further 
examined in phase II with a controlled trial with a larger sample size.  
Success of this feasibility study will be measured by [CONTACT_245309] a whole. Improvement in respi[INVESTIGATOR_245305] a cumulative measure. Longer term retention of gains made will not 
be measured due to time constraints but will be implemented in phase II.

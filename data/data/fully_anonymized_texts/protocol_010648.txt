4. Overview  
Although exercise is known to delay cognitive decline and decrease our risk of Alzheimer’s 
disease , there is a lack of understanding of how exercise protects the aging brain. The overall 
goal of this study is to determine the effects of moderate intensity physical exercise training  on 
relational learning processes and functional brain connectivity in healthy older adults. We 
examine the effect of moderate intensity exercise training on learning and connectivity with a 6 -
month randomized controlled trial (RC T) that compares moderate intensity stationary cycling to 
very light intensity cycling. We further test the mechanisms involved by [CONTACT_813846][INVESTIGATOR_813814], and by [CONTACT_813847][INVESTIGATOR_813815] a key factor for benefits on function al connectivity and learning.  
 
 
5. Background and Specific Aims  
Animal models robustly support that endurance exercise protects brain areas vulnerable to aging 
such as the hippocampus (1) and that these benefits are directly related to bette r learning  (1-3). 
In contrast, human studies have shown mixed findings on the cognitive benefits of exercise with 
healthy older adults (4-9), even when the studies are well -powered and exercise benefits brain 
regions that deteriorate with aging including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (10-15). 
Given the importance of cognition for independence in dail y life, this presents a critical need to 
determine how exercise works against the mechanisms driving cognitive  aging   (16, 17) . Our 
objective  with the EXTEND  trial is to fill this translational gap by [CONTACT_813848]. Our overall hypothesis is that 
exercise improves learning when it increases functional hippoc ampal -cortical communication 
that otherwise declines with aging.  We test this hypothesis with 3 aims:     
1. Determine the relationship between chronic training -related  effects of moderate 
intensity exercise on hippocampal -cortical functional connectivity ( FC) and changes in 
learning from exercise. Although we have shown that long -term moderate intensity exercise 
training improves hippocampal -cortical FC, it is unclear h ow these changes from exercise 
counteract cognitive aging. Our hypothesis  is that training -related changes in hippocampal -
cortical FC with the Default Network ( DN) will improve learning in an array of tasks that 
require the hippocampus for acquisition of n ew relational memories, but not in tasks that do 
not require the hippocampus to learn such as motor or response learning. We test this with a 
6-month RCT  that compares the effects of moderate vs very light intensity exercise of the 
same modality (stationar y cycling) on learning.  
 
2. Determine the relationship between rapid  transient  effects of a single session of 
moderate intensity exercise on hippocampal -cortical FC and training -related  changes in 
hippocampal FC and learning from exercise. Animal studies have shown that exercise 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_813816] a single exercise session, that effects last up 
to 1 hour, and occur in the same pathways that benefit from long -term training. These effe cts

by [CONTACT_813849] -cortical FC that ar e specific to 
moderate intensity exercise, and determining if this response predicts improvements in 
hippocampal FC and learning from 6 months of exercise training.  
 
3. Determine how moderate intensity exercise changes hippocampal -cortical FC and 
learning. Our data indicate that cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF) is a critical factor in cross -
sectional differences of hippocampal -cortical FC and learning. CRF reflects complex 
improvements in vascular, cardiac, and metabolic health from moderate intensity exercise. 
Given the observed rapid effects, our working hypothesis  is that the physiological processes 
leading to improved CRF from moderate  intensity exercise are critical to the benefits on 
hippocampal FC and learning. We test this by [CONTACT_813850] -related changes hippocampal -cortical FC and learning are predicted by [CONTACT_45437] -
related changes in CRF.   
 
Data from this trial will be significant  by [CONTACT_813851]-related cognitive decline in learning that depends on the hippocampus. There currently are 
no treatments that reliably reverse the course of cognitive agin g associated with hippocampal 
deterioration. Exercise has shown promise in animal studies, but this promise has not been 
successfully translated to human studies of healthy aging. Data from this study  could help bridge 
this gap. Given the hippocampus is ce ntral to Alzheimer’s and related dementias, results could 
also lead to an understanding of the mechanisms by [CONTACT_813852]  (18-20). 
 
 
6. General Study Design  
 
The study is a  standard randomized, controlled trial, single -blind design of relatively inactive but 
healthy older adults. A target N of  120 participants will participate and be randomized to either  
an experimental (moderate intensity) treatment group  (N=60) or an activ e control (light -intensity  
+ stretching ) group  (N=60) . Since we are interested in the effects of exercise training on 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_813817], we will ask participants to complete 
assessments of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_813818]  (CRF)  and cognition before and after the training 
program.  Following completion of pre -training screening, fitness, and cognition assessments, 
participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups indicating order of acute exercise 
conditions and will again be randomized to determine their chronic training group  (see Figure 1). 
Including pre - and post -training testing, participants who complete the study will be enrolled for 
approximately 28-30 weeks ( ~4 weeks pre -testing, 24 weeks training, and ~[ADDRESS_1126946] -
testing).

8. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  No history of neurological incident or disease, no chronic metabolic or 
psychiatric disease, not currently taking steroid -based medications except for topi[INVESTIGATOR_813819], eligible to participate in an aerobic exercise intervention based on the Physical 
Activity Readiness Questionnaire, currently exercising with their heart rate into a moderate 
intensity zone (self -reported breathing hard, sweating)  less than [ADDRESS_1126949] 
six months , and corrected vision of 20/40. Because our ol der adult sample is over the age of 40, 
further eligibility for the exercise intervention will be determined following approval from a 
physician that monitor s electrocardiography (ECG) response during a maximal aerobic exercise  
test that is part of the second study visit described below.   
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Score < 20 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)   
• Inability to comply with experimental instructions   
• Inability to complete an MRI (e.g., due to magnetic implants th at would preclude MRI 
scanning such as an aneurysm clip or metallic stent, metallic fragments in the body, or 
cardiac pacemaker or other electronic implant or device)   
• Qualify as “high risk” for acute cardiovascular event by [CONTACT_813853] #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 9 of 54 
 • Diagnosed with any of the following: Major Depression, ADD or ADHD, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
Meningitis, Parkinson’s disease, Stroke, Brain surgery, Heart condition or other 
cardiovascular event, COPD, Uncontrolled Asthma (this includ es anyone who has asthma 
and is not on medication), Cystic fibrosis, Unregulated Thyroid disorder (this includes 
anyone with thyroid disease that is not on medication), Renal or liver disease, Heart 
murmur. Smoking or living with someone who smokes in the past 3 months   
 
Once participants are deemed eligible and do not qualify for exclusionary criteria, subjects are 
still allowed to withdraw at any point from the study if they are uncomfortable or simply no 
longer want to participate.   
 
In this study, fetus es, neonates, pregnant women, children (unde r the age of 18), prisoners,  
institutionalized individuals , and other vulnerable populations  will not be included.  
 
 
9. Recruitment  
 
The following materials/method will be used in recruiting subjects:  
• Advertisements  
• Posters  
• Brochures  
• Email  
• Letters   
• University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813820]  
• Lab w ebsite - http://psychology.uiowa.edu/health -brain -cognition -lab/p articipate  
• Existing Registry/database - We will contact [CONTACT_813854].  
• An example of the recruitment flyer and post-card can be found in Appendix I  
 
Over email or telephone, the study coordinator will ask preliminary screening questions to rule 
out initial eligibility criteria .   
 
 
10. Description of Informed Consent  Process  
 
The consent process will take place in the mock MRI room in the Iowa Institute of Biomedical 
Imaging in  a private room  within the Magnetic Resonance Research Facility . Only the 
experimenter and participant will be present during the consent, so all informa tion will be 
collected in privacy.  
 
Since a portion of our participants will be elderly adults, we will assess their decision -making 
capacity before signing the consent through two means. First, the experimenter  will assess their 
ability to accurately comm unicate and respond to questions on the phone  or via email  as they are 
explaining the study and initial eligibility requirements. This will be done by [CONTACT_813855],  
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 10 of 54 
 'Do you have any questions?'   Secondly, once the participant has read the consent form, but 
before they sign it, the experimenter will complete the "Evaluation to sign informed consent 
document for research" that is provided by [CONTACT_813856].  
 
Consent will be obtained using an informed consent document.  The study coordinator  or a 
trained research assistant will conduct the session. It will include the following:   
• Consent and discussion of participant questions.   
• To minimize the potential for coercion or undue influence during the consent process, 
after the participant has rea d the consent form an experimenter will ask them whether 
they have any questions or would like to take more time to consider their decision. 
During this time, the experimenter will remind the participant that participation is 
completely voluntary and will encourage the participant to take as much time as they 
need to decide.   
• After any questions are answered, the experimenter will ask if they consent to participate 
in the study. If they do indicate their agreement to participate, they will be asked to sign 
the consent document. They will be given a copy of the consent document for their 
records. After the consent is signed, the subjects will begin the study procedures.   
• Potential subjects have the chance to opt out of further contact [CONTACT_813857] n 
about the study at any time during the recruitment steps described above.  
 
A sample informed consent document can be found in Appendix II . 
 
 
11. Screening Procedures  
 
Before consent for the study, we will ask screening questions pertaining to our exclusionary 
criteria. This includes the following questions that will be asked on the phone or via email:  
 
What is your date of birth? Exclu de if NOT between the ages of 55  and 80 years old.  
• Are you fluent in the English language? Exclude if no.  
• Do you have visual acuity or corrected visual acuity of at least 20/40? Exclude if no.  
• What medications are you currently taking? Exclude if taking hormone replacement 
therapy or other steroid -based medications (except for topi[INVESTIGATOR_813821]).  
• Have you ever been told by a medical doctor that you cannot have an MRI? Exclude if 
yes. 
• Do you have a cardiac pacemaker or other electronic device? Exclude if yes.  
 
I am going to read a list of conditions. When I am through, please answer “yes” if you have had 
any of the conditions, and “no” if none of the conditions have applied to you. I do not want to 
know which condition you may have experienced, just if you have had any of them.  
Depression  
Anxiety disorder  
ADD or ADHD

 Parkinson’s disease  
Stroke  
Brain surgery  
COPD  
Uncontrolled Asthma (not on medication or in haler for the past three months or more)  
Cystic fibrosis  
Unregulated Thyroid disorder (not on medication for the past 3 months or more)  
Renal or liver disease  
Heart murmur  
Smoking or living with someone who smokes in the past [ADDRESS_1126950] you ever had any of those conditions? Exclude if yes.  
 
Have you been physically active enough to work up a sweat more than 60 minutes per 
week in the previous six months? If yes, ask for more details. Exclude if they exercise 
(brisk walk, bike rides) regularly. If unsure and are not referring to moderate intensity 
exercise —invite them for a screening visit.  
 
If they are not eligible, they will be told this but asked if they would be interested in 
being contact[CONTACT_7678].  
 
Additional s creenin g procedures will take place during their screening and  orientation visit  
which includes c onsent, cognitive s creening  with the MoCA , and o rientation  to the MRI 
environment . Several self -report questionnaires will also be completed. This visit is to screen out 
individuals that may have preclinical dementia, who are “high risk” for an acute cardiovascular 
event by [CONTACT_813858] (2010), or cannot 
comply with instructions on our neuropsychological and cogn itive tasks. This visit will also 
introduce participants to the mock MRI and screen out those who would not be comfortable in 
the MRI machine due to claustrophobia or discomfort lying on their back for one hour. 
Following cognitive screening, the experimen ter wil l conduct the following tests:   
• Participant demographic and Health history questionnaire   
• Physical Ac tivity Readiness Questionnaire   
• Godin Leisure -Time Exercise Questionnaire  
• Weekly Questionnaire addressing diet , medication, and sleep habits   
• Pfeffer FAQ  
• Generalized Depression Scale (GDS)  
• ACSM Questionnaire (ACSM) – determines whether participants are low risk for a 
cardiovascular event based on the American College of Sports Medicine standards 
(2010).   
• IPAQ  
• RAVLT  
• Oral trail making  
• FAS word fluency

[CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_1126951] they did with memory and attenti on questions (Mo CA), and the results of the basic health 
assessment. They will be asked verbally whether they agree to have u s make these test scores 
available as eligibility criteria for future studies. The experimenter will mark their decision on 
the health assessment form in addition to the consent form.  
 
Eligible participants will then return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a vascular h ealth and fitness 
assessment  in the Translational Vascular Physiology Lab. Participants will report to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813823] [ADDRESS_1126952]. Gary Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813824] r data sheet:  
• Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and blood pressure . Carotid -femoral, carotid -brachial, and 
carotid -radial PWV will be measured non -invasively by [CONTACT_651893], femoral, 
brachial and radial artery pressure waveforms sequentially with an applana tion tonometer 
(Non -invasive Hemodynamics Workstation, Cardiovascular Engineering, Inc.). Pressure 
waveforms are gated to the ECG R wave in order to calculate the transit time (t) between 
the foot of the carotid and the respective peripheral (femoral, brac hial, radial) waveforms. 
The carotid -femoral transit distance (CFTD) is estimated between the 2 anatomical sites 
as the difference between the suprasternal notch (SSN) to carotid (SSN -C) and femoral 
(SSN -F) sites. Thus, the CFTD is calculated as CFTD= (SSN -F)-(SSN -C) and PWV 
calculated as CFTD/t. This approach accounts for parallel transmission of the pulse wave 
up the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries, and simultaneously along the aortic arch 
using the SSN as a fiducial point where parallel transmission  begins (e.g., bifurcation site 
of aortic arch and brachiocephalic artery).  
• Carotid artery compliance/stiffness . Carotid artery compliance and Beta -stiffness index 
will be determined noninvasively by [CONTACT_5019] -resolution ultrasonography (Logiq 7, GE 
Healthcare ) of the right common carotid artery and contralateral assessment of carotid 
artery blood pressure via non -invasive carotid artery applanation tonometry, respectively. 
Carotid artery diameters are measured ~2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb with the 
transd ucer placed at a 90° angle to the vessel by [CONTACT_78150] -line analysis of DICOM images with 
image analysis software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC). Maximal diameters (i.e., 
systolic expansion) and minimal diameters (e.g., diastolic relaxation) are measured in 
sync with carotid artery blood pressure waveforms. Carotid blood pressure waveforms 
are calibrated using diastolic and mean brachial artery blood pressure obtained from 
standard brachial artery cuff blood pressure.  
• Blood sample.  A blood sample will be taken at this session to measure serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
glucose, and insulin levels. We will collect three 2.0 teaspoon (10 mL) blood samples at 
the health assessment visit at pre -testing and at post -testing (12.0 teaspoons or 60 mL in

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835]’s lab.  
 
The following will take place in the Exercise Testing laboratory by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gary Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813825]:  
• Maximal [ADDRESS_1126953] with oxygen uptake (VO 2) analys is: Participants 
will un dergo a  maximal exercise test with 12 -lead ECG and cardiopulmonary gas 
analysis (for determining VO 2max) in the E [ADDRESS_1126954] and licensed practitioner ( cardiologist ). Participants with evidence of 
cardiovascular disease at baseline (e.g., evidence of myocardial infarction, abnormal 
cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, conductio n delays) or during the exercise test 
(>1mm ST segment depression or elevation; >3 beat ventricular tachycardia; atrial 
fibrillation , chest pain suggestive of angina ) will be excluded from the  study .  
• The goal of this maximal exercise test is to identify e ach participant’s true VO 2max. 
In order to be a true maximum test, three of the following four criteria has to be met:  
o RER value of greater than 1.10  
o A plateau in VO 2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_813826]  
o RPE of 18 or greater  
o Maximal heart rate within 10 bpm based on predicted HR max (220-age) (or 
attainment of 90% of predicted HR max or greater)  
• When these criteria are not met, we will document the test as a VO 2peak 
measurement, and this information will be evaluated for its potential usefulness as a 
covariate in data analyses.   
 
During the vascular and maximum exercise test  screening  each participant will be given an 
Actigraph accelerometer and an exercise log sheet and asked to log the information required for 
7-[ADDRESS_1126955] -training  and tasks are counter -balanced for order as needed . Example session 
lists:  
 
Neuropsychological session  1: 
• Spatial Navigation Task (version A) - [ADDRESS_1126956] an "X" at all landmark 
locations ([ADDRESS_1126957]). This test -sequence will be repeated 5 times.  
• Task switching task (versi on A) - ~12 minutes. Participants will initially be led through 
two learning phase s to learn two different tas ks. 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 14 of 54 
 • Associative learning task (version A) (~ 30 minutes). This requires participants to learn a 
response to the specific pair of faces presented rather than to learn responses to individual 
faces. For example, instead of responding to faces A and B when giv en the pair A -B, this 
task requires participants to respond to A -B with a unique response than what would be 
given for another pair including A such as A -C. This type of associative processing 
places more demand on relational memory than the configural mot or learning task.  
• Spatial Navigation Task - delay phase - 10 minutes. Following a delay (during which the 
task-switching task and associative learning tasks are completed), participants will be 
shown a pi[INVESTIGATOR_813827] l andmark using the shortest 
path possible.  
• WRAT (Wide Range Achievement Test) Reading Subtest ~ [ADDRESS_1126958] of words, one at a time, in a clear 
voice. Will be audio recorded and the participant will be informed of this.  
 
 
Neuropsychological session 2:  
• Spatial navigation task (version B) - 50 minutes. Participants will be required to explore 
routes within a virtual environment. Participants will be asked to follow arrows along the 
same route in the virtual environment for 5 minutes. The route will take a bout 90 seconds 
to successfully navigate. After a 30 -minute delay, participants will then be tested by 
[CONTACT_813860] a 2 -D map of the environment.  
• Task switching task (version B) - ~12 minutes. Participants will initially be l ed through 
two learning phases to learn two different tasks.  
• Associative learning task (~ 30 minutes). This is a configural response learning task. 
Participants first learn the stimulus -response mappi[INVESTIGATOR_813828] a set of faces for each finger of 
the left and ri ght hands. Then faces are shown  in pairs with pair frequency manipulated. 
Configural response learning measures the extent to which participants get faster at 
responding to frequently practiced pairs compared to infrequently practiced pairs, despi[INVESTIGATOR_813829]. This task matches the 
associative learning task in stimuli and response features, but requires less demand on the 
hippocampus for relational learning processes.  
• Spatial Navigation Task (versio n B) - delay phase - 10 minutes. Following a 30 -minute 
delay (during which the task -switching and associative learning tasks are c ompleted), 
participants will be  asked to re -trace their route to a given landmark.  
• Processing speed measures (Digit symbol su bstitution, pattern comparison, letter 
comparison)  
 
 
 
13. Randomization  
 
Randomization will occur  once to determine the order of exercise conditions for the acute cross -
over design, and again to determine the training groups (see Figure 1).  Eligible participants will 
be randomized to one of two randomization groups that indicates the order of their acute exercise 
conditions, a separate randomization will occur to determine their exercise training group  (see 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 15 of 54 
 Figure 1). Therefore, all enrolled participants complete an acute exercise assessment with both 
light and moderate intensity sessions (21). Following the acute exercise session, participants will 
continue in one of two training gro ups (moderate, light intensity) .  
 
When participants express interest to participate in their exercises as a couple (dyad), co -
enrollment will be allowed on a limited basis. Co -enrollme nt means that only one of the dyad 
will be randomized and the partner will be automatically assigned to the same intervention 
group. The data for the partner then qualifies as “missing” for all analyses that depend on 
assumptions of random assignment. Our power analysis accounted for losing up to 15% of data 
due to drop out (10%) and scanner motion (5%), which would leave the sample at about 100 
participants and still at strong power (~90%, two -tailed) with allowance for covariates. Based on 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_813830], we predict to lose less data from drop -out and motion than 
we initially predicted. Therefore, we will consider  non-randomized partners as another source of 
"missing data" and set our limit for non -randomized dyads to N=6 (5%) .   
 
For participants who drop -out after randomization, we will take the following approach to 
determine the best type of post -testing to be done at the time of drop -out:  
• First, ask them if they are still willing to do their post -test MRI and full cognitive testing 
sessions.  
• If they cannot do all the testing, we will ask if they could do one [ADDRESS_1126959] our learning and memory behavioral 
measures that tap into hippocampal function and our abbreviated battery including the 
RAVLT in -person.  
• However, if the drop -out participant is not willing to return to the lab for post -testing, then 
we will ask them if they are willing to do a brief phone survey which includes the tasks in the 
short battery above.  
 
14.  Neuroimaging measures  
This s tudy will utilize the 3T GE Discovery 750W MRI  scanner to collect images that allow us 
to measure brain structure ( T1, T2, diffusion), functional connectivity of brain networks sensitive 
to aging (resting state BOLD),  neuronal metabolism (quantitative susc eptibility mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] 
T1ρ) , and cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD response  during a breath hold paradigm) . We expect 
to scan for one hour before each acute exercise session and 30 minutes following each acute 
exercise session , and for 1 hour following completion of the 6-month exercise training 
intervention  (see outline below) . In the event that a participant is uncomfortable in the scanner 
(e.g., wide shoulders or large head size), but would like to participate in scanning, w e will 
prioritize T1 structural images and resting state fMRI scans which are central to testing our 
specific aims. Following each MRI session, i mages will be downloaded directly from XNAT 
into BIDS  format.  Qual ity control procedures will be conducted follo wing data collection each 
week using mriqc .

15. Research Interventions  
  
There are two phases of exercise interventions, including an acute exercise assessment and a 
long-term training assessment. Following completion of a neuropsychological session, we will 
provide a brief orientation to our recumbent bicycles and self -report surveys administered during 
exercise. The purpose of this is to calibrate the exercise protocol for the experimental acute 
exercise sessions and to minimize novelty effects on acute testing days. The exercise orientation 
includes the following:  
• Learn and p ractice the scale measurement that will be used during the exercise testing 
sessions (5 -min)  
o Scale Measurements:  
 Rating of Perceived Exertion ( scale 6 -20), Feeling Scale, Felt Arousal Scale   
o Learn heart -rate monito r and exercise bike procedures   
 Teach participants the proper strap placement  and what their target heart rate 
is for different exercise intensities . Introduce the exercise bicycle and fit 
participants to the bike.  Finally, we will indicate to the partici pant that the 
experimenters will be refraining from engaging in social conversation during 
the exercise, but that any questions should be welcomed by [CONTACT_2299].  
 During this interactive practice session, the research assistant will be engaging 
with t he participant until their ideal speed  and resistance  is identified (i.e. RPE 
of 12 – 14, or perceived moderate exertion).  
 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 17 of 54 
 All participants will then complete both conditions (moderate, very light intensity) of the acute 
exercise interven tion (within -subjects)  with MRI scans before and after each exercise session :  
• Acute exercise assessments will be a minimum of 48-hours  apart and counter -balanced 
for order of exercise intensity.  
• Order of conditions will be counter -balanced based on randomization.  
• We will compare 20 minutes of supervised (a) light intensity cycling (< 40% HRR, 
“light” intensity, ACSM) on a stationary motorized cycle ergometer, and (b) volitional 
cycling at a moderate intensity (50 to 60% HRR)  which will be at the same pedaling 
speed as the light cycling (i.e., pedaling resistance will increase to obtain desired heart 
rate) (22).  
• Resting state functional MRI  scans will be acquired immediately before and after 
exercise ( see Figure 1 ). Blood pressure and HR will be measured throughout exercise and 
scanning. Self-reported affect, arousal, and RPE will be measured during exercise at 5 -
minute intervals.   
 
Following the acute exercise session, participants will continue to the second phase by [CONTACT_813861], as determined by [CONTACT_813862]:  
 
• Moderate intensity exercise training will be a 24 -week supervised cycling program, 
with supervision directly from our research team . Participants will start in waves of ~[ADDRESS_1126960]. Gary Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813831]. Since participants will initially be relatively inactive, 
the exercise group  will start with a 5 minute -warm -up, 20 -minutes moderate intensity 
cycling at 50-60% Heart Rate Reserve (HHR)  and 20 minutes passive cycling, and 5 
minute cool -down per session, for 3 sessions/week. In each additional week, we will 
replace  5 minutes of passive cycling with 5 minutes of moderate intensity cycling per 
session, until the total time for moderate intensity is 40 minutes per session by [CONTACT_813863] 5 (with additional 5 minute warm -up and 5 minute cool -down). Starting at week 6 
the exercise g roup will increase their moderate intensity cycling  to 60-70% HHR  with a 
similar build up to the first 5 weeks. Starting at week 13 the exercise group will increase 
their moderate intensity cycling  to 70-80% HHR  with a similar build up to the first 5 
weeks . This program allows for a gradual build -up of endurance while including training 
for approximately 135 minutes of moderate -to-vigorous  intensity exercise per week.  
 
• Functional fitness training will be a [ADDRESS_1126961]. Gary Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813832]. Training will start with a 15 minute -warm -up of stretching, 20 
minutes of light intensity cycling and 15 minutes of dynamic stretching to increase range 
of motion and functional fitness, for 3 sessions/wee k. In each additional week, additional 
stretches will be added to maintain variety and improve flexibility of all major muscle 
groups.  Our goal is to maintain HR at or below 40% HRR during training sessions for 
this group.  
 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 18 of 54 
 Both groups will wear a Heart R ate Monitor (Polar wrist watch and chest -band) during their 
exercise sessions. We will download HR monitor data following each session and this data will 
be used to give feedback on their target HR for the following session. Target HR for each 
condition wi ll be based on the baseline maximal exercise test . Ratings of perceived exertion 
(RPE) will also be collected during the baseline max test, and in cases where there was a 
discrepancy between expected RPE and HR during this test, RPE will be used in conjunc tion 
with HR in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a target HR for moderate and passive cycling sessions.   
 
All training sessions in the  first two week s are scheduled to  be in  our lab. After the first two 
week s, participants can do up to two sessions  per week  outside the lab. At the conclusion of each 
training session in the lab, participants are given instructions on how to complete their training at 
home  including use of the HR monitor . In order to maintain blinding to intensity prescriptions, 
participants are guided to mimic the heart rate zones they are targeting in their lab sessions. For 
participants that live outside of a [ADDRESS_1126962] an additional option for more frequent 
home training sessions, provided that participants demonstrate they can charge and u pload their 
HR data to Polar Flow (online) for trainer review and feedback at least once per week.  
 
16. General D ata Management/ Quality Assurance  
 
Paper/hard copy records (hard copy surveys, questionnaires, case report forms, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], 
etc.)  
• Standardized procedures will be used to collect and maintain basic demographic and 
health data on all participants, including: (1) collecting names, email addre sses, and 
phone numbers; (2) contact[CONTACT_813864];

• The master electronic database will be within a secure electronic data capture system 
(RedCap).  
The follo wing is a list of study participant confidentiality safeguards:  
• Electronic files  – data identifying participants that are stored electronically will be 
maintained in an encrypted form or in a separate file.

Security Number, or other unique identifiers will not be included in any published data 
listing.  
• Data distribution  - data listings that contain participant name, name [CONTACT_104846], or other 
identifiers easily associated with a specific participant will not be distributed.  
• Data disposal  - computer listings that contain participan t-identifying information will be 
disposed of in an appropriate manner.  
• Access  - participant records will not be accessible to persons outside the site without the 
express written consent of the participant.  
• Storage  - study forms and related documents retained both during and after study 
completion will be stored in a secure location.  
• Blood samples – blood samples will be processed and stored in dedicated freezer space 
within [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_835]’s lab with study ID and sessio n labels .  
 
Computers will be used to store and analyze clinical data and we will address elements of computer

 17. Overall Data Analysis Approach  
The primary analysis concerns the difference in functional connectivity among the chronic 
treatment groups of moderate intensity (M) and light intensity (L) at the single terminus (last 
visit) of the [ADDRESS_1126964]. Multiple regression will be used to regress functional connectivity 
(FC) on dummy coded group membership, and the stratification variables of age and sex. 
Suppose that FC for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ participant at the end of the study is denoted as 𝑦𝑖 (𝑖=1,…,𝑁) and 
group is coded as 𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑖 = 1 if M and 𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑖 = 0 if L. Then the multiple regression model for the 
primary analysis is  
𝑦𝑖=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑖+𝛽2𝑠𝑒𝑥𝑖+𝛽3𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖+𝑒𝑖. 
Under the typi[INVESTIGATOR_813833] 𝑒𝑖 is normally distributed, the coefficients can be estimated 
using ordinary least squares. The null hypothesis of interest is that the re is no group difference, 
𝐻0: 𝛽1=0, which can be evaluated with a t-test. In order to account for missing data, multiple 
imputation will be used, and the null hypothesis of interest will be evaluated based on pooled 
estimates using Rubin’s rules (23). In order to ensure maximal statistical power for the primary 
aim, the first analysis will have a single outcome, which is the average FC between the posterior 
hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Additional 
exploratory analysis will be performed on individual connections with adjustment for multiple 
testin g (i.e., adjustment for false discovery rate within a region of interest).  
We will use a similar approach to examine intervention effects on learning rate in  the 
hippocampal -dependent learning tasks compared to the non -hippocampal tasks . The final 
analysis of Aim [ADDRESS_1126965] in the chronic M group. 
Acute increases will be computed for each participant based on a fitted linear mixed model 
(LMM) from the acute phase. The  LMM models change from M to L accounting for the cross -
over in conditions. A type of difference score will be computed for each participant based on the 
fixed and random effects estimates representing the acute M − L difference (24). Positive values 
indicate an increase in FC for M compared  to L (and negative values indicate a decrease; 0 
indicates no change).  A multiple regression model will be used to regress FC on chronic group, 
the acute M − L difference, and their interaction. Suppose that the acute M − L difference for the 
𝑖𝑡ℎ partic ipant is denoted as 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 𝑖. Then the regression model for the second aim is  
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 21 of 54 
    𝑦𝑖=𝛾0+𝛾1𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑖+𝛾2𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑖+𝛾3(𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑖)(𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑖)+𝑒𝑖.  
The interaction term allows the effect of the acute M − L difference to vary by [CONTACT_813867]. 
When 𝛾3≠0, the acute difference has a different effect for the chronic M group. Therefore, the 
null hypothesis of interest for the second aim is 𝐻0:𝛾3=0. Missing data will again be handled 
with multiple imputation. The first test will consist of the same hippocampal -cortical outcome 
described above, and additional exploratory analysis will be performed adjusting for multiple 
testing.   
The main analysis  for all three aims  will be conducted under the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle.  A 
participant will be counted as a member of their group at the time of re-randomization in the 
chronic phase . Participants will be analyzed in their initial group assignments  in a blinded 
manner , regardless of dropout or adherence. Fidelity will be assessed by [CONTACT_813868] a 
sufficient difference in CRF. A small number of participants wi ll be allowed to enroll as a couple 
with the couple being the unit for random assignment. One member of the couple will be 
randomly assigned for analysis and the other member’s data will not be considered for analysis 
in the primary aim (data might be insp ected for exploratory purposes).   
Due to its importance in achieving our objectives, the power analysis  is based on preliminary 
data for the relationship between aerobic exercise training change in learning rate on one of the 
learning tasks. Based on the effect size observed from a multiple linear regression of training 
group and additional covariates as predictors, our power analysis maintains an allowance of 10 
predictor variables including training group. Based on these considerations, a sample size of 120 
older adults, randomized to one of two training groups (N=60 per group), would ensure 95% 
power. If we further account for up to ~15 % (N=18)  missing data  due to factors such as (a) 
motion or drop -out during scanning, (b) missing post -test due to drop-out during training, or (c) 
co-enrollment with spouse , we would still have a final sample size of ~N=100, which would 
achieve ~90% two-tailed  power and still result in larger group sizes than our published results of 
hippocampal -cortical FC following exercise training.  We do not have plans for formal interim 
analyses and there is no predefined interim statistical analysis or result that would cause 
termination of the trial.  
 
Dealing with missing data : The primary analysis will be conducted according t o the ITT 
principle, in which participants are analyzed in their assigned group at randomization. Multiple 
imputation  will be used for pooled estimation, which provide s unbiased estimates under the 
ignorable mechanism. It is not possible to determine if a missing data mechanism is ignorable or 
non-ignorable. In order to address the possibility of a non -ignorable mechanism, a sensitivity 
analysis using pattern mixture modeling with multiple imputation will be conducted under the 
framework discussed by  [CONTACT_813869] (25).   
 
Assessing effects of adherence  and training context : ITT analysis is recognized as the best 
approach for making sound inferences regarding the treatment effect (26). However, ITT focuses 
on the effect of treatment assignment rather than on the effect of the treatment for participants 
who experienced the treatment as defined in the protocol. For example, ITT analysis does not 
adjust for potential non -adherence (variations in session attendance) or treatment cross -over 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 22 of 54 
 (exposure to the  treatment intended for another group). In exercise trials both of these issues are 
theoretically important to examine because (a) mechanistically exercise effects are expected to 
be strongest in a dose -response manner relative to the prescribed exercise p rogram, and (b) there 
is significant variability in the extent to which participants achieve the prescribed exercise 
intensity during their training. For example, the latter issue can occur if participants in the M 
group have difficulty consistently gettin g their heart rate up to higher intensities due to physical 
or motivational constraints; or, in contrast, if participants in the L group enrolled in the study 
with expectations to work harder and in turn get their heart rate up above the prescribed lighter  
intensity zone when they are exercising at their home sessions.  
 
Therefore, in a series of un -blinded exploratory per -protocol analyses (27), we will test the extent 
to which adherence and training context affec ts training -induced change in primary outcomes of 
hippocampal -cortical FC and learning. Based on the issues outlined above, analyses will initially 
be based on pre -planned definitions of context and adherence. First, we will test the extent to 
which traini ng heart rate (HR) differed in the lab compared to home sessions as a function of 
intervention group. Based on preliminary descriptive data, we predict that HR will be higher 
during home sessions for both groups, but there will be no average group differen ces in this 
context effect. Second, we will test all training group effects described above with an additional 
continuous interaction term for %sessions completed. We predict that greater sessions attended 
will have a weak to moderate effect on the benefit  of M compared to L intensity training. Third, 
we will test the same group interactions with a continuous interaction term for %sessions in the 
prescribed HR zone. We predict this will have a moderate to strong effect on primary outcomes, 
as adhering to th e intensity prescription is predicted to have a stronger effect than attendance 
alone. A final analysis will further unpack the direction of intensity adherence, with negative 
values indicating the percent of sessions below the prescribed HR zone and posit ive values 
indicating the percent of sessions above the prescribed HR zone. This final intensity adherence 
analysis will test both whether  and how gains in benefits were associated with variations in 
adherence to prescribed HR intensity.  
 
 
18. Safety  
 
There are no known risks to participating in the questionnaire ass essments  or cognitive tests. 
There may be risks involved in exercising on a motorized bicycle: participants may become 
fatigued or uncomfortable while exerc ising. Additionally, t here may be a small risk of loss of 
confidentiality associated with study participation. Listed below are potential risks associated 
with assessments to be completed throughout the trial:  
 
• Maximal ECG Stress Test with oxygen (VO2) monitoring: Potential risks of a stre ss test 
are fatigue, dry mouth, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], muscle strain, shortness of breath and chest 
pain. There is a small risk of heart attack (0.04%) and death (0.01%) in middle -aged and 
older adults. The risk of heart attack or death in young healthy adult s is significantly 
lower.   A physician will be present to monitor the subject's 12 lead ECG, blood pressure, 
and any symptoms. American Heart Association/American College of Sports Medicine 
guidelines for contraindications to begin the test, and indication s to stop the test will be

 followed. After the ECG Stress/VO2 test, the subjects will be monitored for 15 minutes, 
will be symptom free, and the ECG will be back  to baseline before released.  
• Subjects may feel uncomfortable answering questions.  
• Pulse wave velocity: There are no known or foreseeable risks associated with the use of 
applanation tonometry for pulse wave analysis. ECG electrodes may cause minor 
irritation to the skin.  
• Fasting for 8 hours: The most common risk when fasting is dehydration, t herefore 
subjects will be encouraged to drink plenty of water. Subjects may experience hunger and 
irritability and if they experience fainting, nausea, or vomiting they will be instructed to 
stop fasting.  
• Some participants feel anxiety in the MRI scanner d ue to feelings associated with 
claustrophobia  
• Some participants experience discomfort from lying down for an extended period of time  
• The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in 
a very small number of patients.  
• A meta l object flying through the air toward the magnet and hitting the participant 
presents the greatest risk associated with MRI  
• Potential risks associated with obtaining blood samples are minimal but include slight 
bruising, pain, a temporary feeling of faintness, and/or a small risk of infection.  
 
What have we done to minimize risks?  
 
ECG ergometer stress test with VO2 monitoring: A physician with training in cardiology will be 
present for all pre - and post -intervention maximal exercise tests that are co nducted at the 
Exercise Physiology Lab a t the Field House. The physician will monitor the subject's 12 lead 
ECG, blood pressure, and any symptoms. American Heart Association/American College of 
Sports Medicine guidelines for contraindications to begin the test, and indications to stop the test 
will be followed. Our trained exercise specialist administers the exercise test, with supervision 
by a physician. [CONTACT_813896] or [CONTACT_813897]  will supervise our pre - and post -intervention 
maximal exercise tests .  
 
After the ECG Stress/VO2 test, participants will be monitored for [ADDRESS_1126966] serves as a 
baseline measure of cardiorespir atory fitness as well as a screening tool to ensure no 
cardiovascular abnormalities are present during moderate -to-vigorous aerobic exercise. 
Following this screening session, the physician's role is to indicate whether the participant is now 
eligible to c ontinue with participation in an exercise training program with minimal risk of an 
adverse event. Participants with evidence of cardiovascular disease at baseline (e.g., evidence of 
myocardial infarction, abnormal cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, c onduction delays) or 
during the exercise test (>1mm ST segment depression or elevation; >3 beat ventricular 
tachycardia; atrial fibrillation , chest pain suggestive of angina ) will be excluded from the study 
because of the associated increase in risk for an  adverse event during training.

[CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_1126967] Aid. Lead exercise trainers will be Clinical Exercise Physiology Master’s students recruited 
from the Health and Human Physiology Department at the University of Iowa. In addition, we 
require  that trainers have had previous experience in training older adults.   
To protect against potential adverse events during exercise training, the exercise training lab is 
equipped with an AED, a phone to call 911, and during all exercise sessions we monitor  heart 
rate, blood pressure, and perceived exertion to ensure we are aware of any discomfort that would 
be a warning sign for an adverse event. All training sessions include a cool -down that is designed 
to ensure participants’ heart rate and blood pressure  are back to near resting levels before leaving 
our training site.  In the event that a participant expresses symptoms of a potential adverse event 
to exercise (e.g., light headed or an unusually high spi[INVESTIGATOR_813834]), exercise 
trainer s will immediately stop exercise and have the participants rest with the opportunity to 
drink water. If there is any sign that the symptoms are not resolving from a break in exercise, the 
trainer will call [ADDRESS_1126968] participant safety. The level of feedback necessary 
will be dic tated by [CONTACT_813870] (Schmid and Muellerleile). If 
the event is potentially serious, the post -mortem will be sent to the PI, [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_835], our local 
supervising doctors, the IRB, our safety officer [CONTACT_56777], and [CONTACT_813898] er within [ADDRESS_1126969] a "Mock MRI" before 
the actual MRI. This session allows the participant to experience what it is like to lie in the 
magnet but without the pressure and time -constraints of the actual scanner session. Importantly, 
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 25 of 54 
 this allows us to anticipate and preve nt participant anxiety as much as possible during the real 
MRI.  
 
To address the potential for discomfort during the MRI session, we will work with the participant 
during the Mock MRI to arrive at a comfortable lying position (e.g., with or without a pi[INVESTIGATOR_99265] w 
under their legs and how much cushioning they prefer if they would like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356]). We will also 
utilize the Mock MRI session to screen out anyone who does not fit comfortably in the bore of 
the scanner, such as their shoulders or stomach pressing against  the walls of the bore. During the 
MRI itself, we will regularly check in with the participant about their comfort, so that we can 
make adjustments in their positioning when needed. Participants who are uncomfortable  with the 
MRI scan do not have to comple te the MRI visit if they fit all other criteria to participate in the 
rest of the study.  
 
To address any potential for hearing loss, participants will wear earplugs during all scanning.  
 
To address the risk of flying metal objects, we require that all peo ple involved with the study 
remove all metal from their clothing and pockets. No metal objects will be brought into the 
magnet room while participants are inside the room. In addition, the door to the room remains 
closed throughout the study so that no one  can accidentally bring a metal object into the room.  
 
To address potential risks associated with the blood sample, all blood draws will be performed by 
a research team member trained and certified in drawing blood, or a nurse. To reduce anxiety 
associated with lab draws, the lab draw will be done by [CONTACT_813871] a blood sample.  
 
 
To address potential for loss of confidentiality, we will:  
• Store paper/pencil data in secure, locked file cabinets, accessible only to lab personnel  
• Computer data will be stored on lab testing PCs that are password protected and only 
accessible to lab pe rsonnel  
• All data will be stored with only subject ID's attached, in a separate location from the 
consent and demographic forms  
• Subject ID's will be assigned following informed consent  
• Subject ID's will be linked to a unique lab ID that will coexist with id entifying 
information in our secure database  
• Any lists linking study ID with the unique lab ID will be made by [CONTACT_813872] -up server in the psychology department  
• All personnel involved in the study will be required to complete the training courses 
available for education on the protection of human research subjects provided by [CONTACT_813873]  
• All study staff will b e trained in confidentiality procedures and will receive the required 
University of Iowa data security training.  
 
Research procedures will collect only the minimum private information necessary to conduct the 
study. Measures will be taken to protect privac y throughout the study, including:

[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 26 of 54 
 • Consent, demographic, and fitness assessment will be done in a private room  
• All computerized testing will occur in either a private room or a room with computers 
separated by [CONTACT_514497]  
• There is no risk of loss of privacy in computerized sessions when more than one person 
are in the room at once, no data or performance scores are read out verbally or appear on 
the screen to the participant or for others to see  
 
 
19. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Reporting all adverse events is an integral part of  conducting  this clinical trial.  This will allow 
the researchers to track any occurrences of serious events and ensure they can be reviewed by [CONTACT_5030] (IRB), the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ), and the National 
Institute on Aging (NIA). The purpose of reporting adverse events is the protection and safety of 
the study participants. Additionally, it will provide a description and contrast of the major side 
effects associated with both the interv ention and control groups.  
 
Defining Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be classified as either an adverse (AE) or a serious adverse event (SAE). 
They may occur during screening, testing, or during the administration of the intervention. 
Furthermore, a n adverse event may or may not be related to the testing or intervention 
procedures.  
 
All adverse events shall be defined as any occurrence of an adverse effect (undesirable and 
unintended, although not necessarily unexpected, result of the intervention); any adverse finding 
including a sign, symptom, or abnormal assessment or any other unfavorable outcome affects a 
human subject detrimentally, or that worsens, as a result of their participation in the study.  
 
 
Defining Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events are defined as events that may be harmful to the participant and/or may 
be serious enough to warrant either temporary or permanent discontinuation of the study 
intervention because they are either intolerable or they are judged to be potenti ally harmful to the 
study participant.  
 
Criteria and Definitions for Serious Adverse Events  
Any adverse event will be classified as a serious adverse event when it satisfies any one of the 
following criteria (standard criteria as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, 21CFR 
312.32):  
 
• It results in death  
• It is life threatening. Life threatening events are those that pose the immediate risk of 
death from the event.  
• It results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813835] a 24 -hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813836] #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 27 of 54 
 prolongation on an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In general, all other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813837]. Examples include outpatient and less than 24 -hour 
hosp italizations. However, an outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813838] 24 hours could 
be considered a serious adverse event if it were life threatening or an important medical 
event.  
• It results in a persistent or significant disability. Significant disabil ity is one that results in 
a permanent or severe disruption of the participant’s ability to conduct normal life 
activities. If the disability is related to the normal progression of an already present 
disease or condition, it will not be considered a serio us adverse event. The decision to 
classify a disability as permanent or significant will be based on the clinical judgment of 
the study’s medical director.  
• It is a pregnancy resulting in a congenital abnormality or birth defect. A congenital 
anomaly is an  adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a participant who has participated in  
the testing and/or the intervention prior to conception or during pregnancy.  
• It is an important medical event. An important medical event is one that may jeopardize 
the study pa rticipant and may require medical and/or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the above listed outcomes. The decision to classify a medical event as a serious 
adverse event will be based on the clinical judgment of the study’s medical director.  
 
 
Advers e and Serious Adverse Events  
The most likely way in which an adverse event is identified would be when the participant 
reports an event to the exercise interventionists, research assistants, or research coordinator 
during contact [CONTACT_5586] (i.e. during interven tion sessions or at testing appointments).  
  
Reporting of Adverse Events  
When an adverse event is identified, the staff member identifying the adverse event will report it 
to the study coordinator and the principal investigator. The study coordinator will then contact 
[CONTACT_813874] ( Appendix III ) will be completed. All adverse 
events that are unexpected, serious, or could affect our protocol will be  electronically reported to 
the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board within [ADDRESS_1126970] coor dinator.

 20. Anticipated Problems  
 
Based on our strong preliminary data and by [CONTACT_978]’s own recent research we believe the 
hypotheses will be supported. However, should this not be the case, examination of moderators 
and additional brain networks  that interact with hippocampal -cortical systems  will provide 
alternative approaches to testing our aims . 
 
Recruitment : 
 
Recruitment of older healthy adults can be a challenge. However, we are confident we can 
accomplish our recruitment goals by 1) adverti sing through out the community with mass 
mailings , 2) contact[CONTACT_813875] -relevant individuals through the University of Iowa mass email 
system, and advertisements in the 3) daily Noon News distributed to UIHC employees, and 4) 
the UIHC Epic Database.  
 
Subject Retention : 
 
A related potential barrier is participant dropout. We will minimize dropout through careful 
screening, by [CONTACT_813876] , providing 
personable and professional personal exercise training , and m onetary compensation.  
 
Injuries:  
 
Extreme care will be taken to avoid any exercise -related injuries. Participants will be provided 
proper demonstration and instruction for the bike exercise intervention and educated about any 
risks and benefits prior to th e intervention. Five minute warm -up periods will be included and 
followed by [CONTACT_813877]. Five minute cool 
down periods will also be included. If the participant is not feeling well the day of their 
intervention session, they will be instructed to reschedule so as to not invoke any potential 
injuries related to illness. If the participant does report an injury or injury occurrence to the staff, 
they will be referred to their primary care physician for trea tment and be instructed not to 
participate in the intervention until they receive consent from their physician.  
 
 
21. DSMB Meetings and Membership  
 
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet twice a year to review all active 
protocols. For all monitoring activities, the DSMB will follow the guidelines established by [CONTACT_813878]:  
• Monitor the progress of the intervention trial (e.g., review subject recruitment, attrition, 
and minority involvement), and the safety of research participants (e.g., reviewing un -
blinded data for safety)  
• Assure compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events  
Bike Extend Trial  
NIH #  1R01AG055500  
[CONTACT_813893], PI  
[CONTACT_3490] 30 of 54 
 • Assure that any action that results in the temporary or permanent suspension of the 
protoco l is reported to all the appropriate monitoring bodies  
• Assure data accuracy, confidentiality, and protocol compliance  
  
The DSMB is comprised of individuals without a stake in the study outcomes, who will oversee 
subject safety. The DSMB consists of:  
• A person with expertise in clinical trials and has experience in exercise in cognitive 
aging: [CONTACT_813899]  from the University of [LOCATION_012] ( Chair )  
• An expert who reviews any adverse events or serious AEs and who has DSMB 
experience: [CONTACT_56778]  from the University of Kansas  
• A biostatistician or someone who has skills in  that area and who has DSMB experience: 
[CONTACT_813900]  from the Alber t Einstein College of Medicine   
 
Although the NIH Institute/Center appointed Program Officer (PO) ([CONTACT_411995]) is not 
formally engaged within the monitoring process, the PO and designated University of Iowa 
Institutional Review Board representative will be kept abreast of any and all issues which arise 
and will receive all required and requested informatio n as required by [CONTACT_160572], regulation, and/or 
law.

session, we will introduce you to the study and ask you to complete a number of 
tests and surveys to asses s whether you qualify to continue in the study. The 
questionnaires will ask about your demographic information (such as date of 
birth, race/ethnicity, sex, native language, educational background, occupation),

 questions about physical characteristics (hand edness, hearing, color blindness), 
your medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], medical conditions or medical diagnosis, and 
about your history of falls.  
We will also ask for your contact [CONTACT_813881] y information stored in a database in order to 
contact [CONTACT_813882].  
You will then be asked to complete some tests by [CONTACT_813883] a lab 
researcher to test your cognitive processing (how you think about informat ion) 
and your ability to follow instructions. You will also answer surveys about your 
health, your feelings, and your activities over the past month. We will collect 
some basic health information, such as height, weight, resting heart rate, resting 
blood p ressure, waist -to-hip assessment, and neck circumference.  
Your participation is completely voluntary and you are free to skip questions in 
the surveys or tests that you do not wish to answer. Based on the information we 
collect from you, your participatio n in the study may be complete after this 
session.  
The last part of this session will be a brief “Mock MRI.”  Since a later session of 
this experiment includes a scan of your brain in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
scanner, we would like to take some time in  your first visit to make sure you will 
be comfortable in an MRI scanner.  The Mock MRI will give you a chance to 
experience what an actual MRI will be like, and to ask any questions you have 
before deciding whether you are comfortable participating in the  MRI part of the 
study. We will also introduce you to a breath holding task.    
 
Health assessment - The maximal aerobic exercise test will take place in E137 
in the Field House on a separate day from your vascular measurements. 
Since the vascular assessmen t involves a blood draw, we will ask you to 
complete this session on a separate day from that session in order to 
minimize the likelihood you may experience dizziness/light -headedness for 
the exercise test. During the exercise test, you will have electrode s placed on 
your chest for monitoring the electric activity of your heart. To assess your 
aerobic fitness, you will be asked to cycle on a stationary bike with chest 
electrodes and a face mask that analyzes the gas in your breath. This procedure 
will be pe rformed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813840]. The amount of time you will be on 
the bicycle will vary but most people cycle between [ADDRESS_1126980] you to describe the specific 
concern and provide guidance on whether to seek additional medical advice. If 
this occurs, and for your safety, yo u will not be elig ible to continue in the study.*  
*Aerobic fitness tests will not be completed without a phy sician or cardiologist 
present.

[CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_1126981] three 2.0 
teaspoon (10 mL) blood samples at the health assessment visit at pre -testing and 
at post -testing (12.0 teaspoons or 60 mL in total).  All samples will be collected by 
[CONTACT_813859]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835]’s lab.  
If blood values come back outside of the reference ranges that are given by [CONTACT_813884] (UIDL), the project coordinator will 
present these values to a licensed practitioner (physician) to determine if values 
are statistically significant. If values are significant, the project coordinator will 
inform the participant ab out the value. The participant would still be eligible to 
continue with their participation.   
 
Neuropsychological assessment - You will be asked to complete two 
neuropsychological testing sessions before the intervention and two after the 
intervention. You will be asked to perform a variety of computerized tasks and 
paper/pencil tasks that measure learning and motor skills. For example, you will 
be asked to learn specific responses on a keyboard to stimuli such as faces on the 
computer screen. Another exampl e of these tasks is remembering the placement 
of different objects on a screen. You will be given breaks between tests. 
Following the completion of your first neuropsychological assessment day, we 
will introduce you to the exercise bike you will ride at th e MRI 
sessions/intervention sessions and introduce you to some scales that assess how 
you are feeling while you ride the bike during the MRI sessions/intervention 
sessions.  
 
Actigraph accelerometer use - We will show you how to use a wrist -worn 
motion sens or to wear on your non -dominant arm until you return to our lab, for 
at least [ADDRESS_1126982], but not for batte ry charging.  The accelerometer should be worn at all 
times, including sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. We would like you to keep the device on at all times to 
minimize the risk of losing it or forgetting to put it back on. You will also be 
asked to fill out an activity log to i ndicate what hours of the day were generally 
active or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. We will ask you to do this once during the pre -testing phase

exercise intervention.  
 
MRI Scan - For each acute exercise session, you will complete a baseline MRI 
session that includes scans for high -resolution anatomy and resting cerebral blood 
flow, resting state scans to assess functional neural synchrony and vasoreactivity.  
Directly following initial scans, you  will begin a 20 -minute exercise session on a 
recumbent (laying back rather than sitting), stationary motorized bicycle. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be measured before, during, and after exercise. 
Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured  throughout exercise at [ADDRESS_1126984] it.  
Details: Upon arrival, you w ill be greeted by [CONTACT_813885]. They will 
escort you to the waiting room and guide you through the MRI screening 
procedures and familiarization with the tasks you will do in the MRI scanner. 
Once ready to start the experiment, you will be asked to  remove all metal objects.  
If your clothes have zippers or metal buttons (or similar) that would interfere with 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_138379], we may ask you to change into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813841] t 
does not contain any metal.   
An MRI scanner takes images of y our brain by [CONTACT_813886] a magnetic field and 
radio waves.  Because the MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet, you may 
not be able to have the MRI if you have certain kinds of metal in your body (for 
example, a heart pacemaker, a metal plate, and certa in types of heart valves or 
brain aneurysm clips).  Someone will ask you questions about this before you 
have the MRI. Let us know if yo u have had surgery of any kind.  
In particular, you should not participate in this study if you have any of the 
following in your body:  
 Pacemaker  
 Coronary Stent  
 Defibrillator  
 Neurostimulator  
There are a number of conditions that will prevent you from having the MRI, we 
will review these with you t o see if you can have the MRI.

be replaced with a unique ID code.  The images and information about how they 
were taken will be stored in a central database so that other researchers can use 
them to evaluate how MR imaging could be used for their research projects 
(whether they are located at the University of Iowa or at another site).  These 
investigators must submit a formal written request to the r esearch team for 
approval to have access to the data.  The data may then be copi[INVESTIGATOR_813842]'s computers. Your name [CONTACT_813890] a

 report how you feel physically and mentally. This data will be used to 
individualize your trainin g throughout the intervention.  
For participants who will receive gas compensation (participants who live 30+ 
miles away from Spence Labs), we will require that you come in to Spence Labs 
for two of the three sessions for the first week of the exercise intervention. For the 
second week, we will require that participants come into our lab for [ADDRESS_1126989] to check in (M -F between 9 am - 5 pm), make sure that all of the 
sessions have been running smoothly, answer any questions, and to check your 
watch (online via Polar Flow**) to hold you accountable for completing the 
sessi ons. 
We will give you instructions on how to download Polar FlowSync** to your own 
personal computers. We will give you the charging/connecting cable so that you 
can connect your watch to the computer. Participants will be required to download 
the watch af ter each session they complete at home. Usernames and Passwords 
will not be given out to the participants. All you will have to do is download the 
watch. The exercise specialist will then log in to their account on Polar Flow** to 
see your heart rate data.  
**Polar Flow and Polar FlowSync are online workout log that stores heart rate 
data from the watches that  we use for exercise sessions.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In 
addition to these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, 
associ ated with being in this study.  
Fitness Assessment : Potential risks are fatigue, dry mouth, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
muscle strain, shortness of breath and chest pain. There is a small risk of heart 
attack (0.04%) and death (0.01%) in middle -aged and older adults. The risk of 
heart attack or death in young hea lthy adults is signi ficantly lower.  
Vascular health assessment: There are no known or foreseeable risks associated 
with this assessment. ECG electrodes may caus e minor irritation to the skin.  
Blood sample: Potential risks associated with obtaining blood sa mples are 
minimal but include slight bruising, pain, a temporary feeling of faintness, and/or 
a small risk of infection. To reduce the risks associated with blood draws, all 
blood draws will be performed by a research team member trained and certified in 
drawing blood, or a nurse. To reduce anxiety associated with lab draws, the lab 
draw will be done by [CONTACT_813887] a blood sample.

 You may be uncomfortab le inside the MRI scanner if you do not like to be in closed spaces 
(“claustrophobia”).  During the procedure, you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a 
speaker system.  You can tell the m to stop the scan at any time.  
The MRI scanner produces a  loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very 
small number of patients.  You will be given noise cancelling headphones to reduce this risk.  
A metal object flying through the air toward the magnet and hitting you presents the greatest ris k 
associated with MRI.  To reduce this risk, we require that all people involved with the study 
remove all metal from their clothing and pockets.  No metal objects will be brought into the 
magnet room while you are inside the room.  In addition, the door t o the room remains closed 
throughout the study so that no one can accidentally brin g a metal object into the room.  
There are no known risks associated with limited exposure to magnetic fields.  Magnets of this 
strength have been in use for medical imaging for over [ADDRESS_1126993] a break at an y time.   
Fasting for 8 hours: The most common risk when fasting is dehydration, therefore 
you are encouraged to drink plenty of water. You may experience hunger and 
irritability and if you experience fainting, nausea, or vomiting you are instructed 
to sto p fasting.  
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality.  Measures in place to protect 
confidentiality are indicated in the ‘What About Confidentiality’ s ection later in 
this document.  
Less Likely / Less Common (10% - 35%)  
Mild

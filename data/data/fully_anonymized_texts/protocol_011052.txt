1. WHY  IS THIS  RESEARCH  BEING  DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are to 1) learn  what kinds  of support will  help women  meet their  goals  for 
breastfeeding  and weight management after their baby  [CONTACT_546167] 2) to test mom’s  urine  and blood for 
nutrition  factors that may help  us understand  how breastfeeding  and weight  loss after a baby [CONTACT_546168].   You are being  asked  to take part in  this research  study  because  you 
are an African  American  woman  in the later months  of your pregnancy and  you said you were  interested  in 
breastfeeding  your baby.  We will enroll  about  [ADDRESS_714711] Health   
System  (HFHS).  This study is funded  by [CONTACT_291253]  (NIH R21)  and is a group  project  
between  HFHS  and Michigan  State  University (MSU).  
 
2. WHAT WILL HAPPEN  IF I TAKE  PART  IN THIS  RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
There  will be two groups  in the study.  The group  you are assigned  to will be chosen  by [CONTACT_3364]  (like 
flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a coin).   Both groups  will get educational  information  about  how to get a healthy  start for both mom  
and baby.   One group  will get written  information,  and the other group  will get information  from an online  
program  and will have  in-person  visits from a community  health  worker.  
 
Women  in both groups  will be asked  to: 
1) Answer  survey  questions  three  (3) times  during  the 6-month  study.   Have  your height,  weight and  
body  composition  measured  three (3) times  during  the 6-month  study.   Body composition  will be 
measured  with a bioelectrical  impedance  analysis  (BIA)  scale  that sends  a small  current th rough  
your body  that you can’t feel.  This information  will be collected  from you either  at the NCO  clinic  or 
at your home.  
2) Have  some  urine  (from the  sample  you give your doctor during  your visit) collected  two (2) times  
during  the 6-month  study  (today  and at your routine  doctor  visit that will  be about  6 weeks  after your 
baby  [CONTACT_50835]).  Your urine  will be tested  for iodine  and some  environmental  chemicals  that interfere  
with iodine  uptake  into the thyroid  gland  (including  perchlorate  which  is found  in many  products  and 
thiocyanate  which  is found  in cigarette  smoke  and some  foods).

3) Have  some  extra  blood  (2-4 teaspoons  or 10 -20 ml) collected  and stored  two (2) times  during  the 6- 
month  study  (today  and at your routine  doctor  visit that will be about  6 weeks  after your baby  [CONTACT_546169]).  Your blood  will be tested  for nutrition  factors  (including ferritin  which  measures  your iron 
status  and carotenoid  concentrations  which  estimates  your fruit and vegetable  intake),  and other  
factors  (including  thyroid  hormone).  
4) Allow  your medical  records  from pregnancy,  labor and  delivery  and your baby’s  medical  records  to 
be reviewed  by [CONTACT_827].  
5) Researchers  will collect  health  and other information  concerning  the birth of your child as reported  
to the Michigan  Department  of Healt h and Human  Services  (MDHHS)  at the time of your child’s  
birth. In order to locate  your baby’s  birth certificate,  research  staff will request  your social  security  
number.  
All of the procedures  at these  data collection  visits  are extra  – these  are things  that you will not do if you 
choose  not to participate  in the study.   None  of these  data collection  procedures  are experimental.  If your 
identifiable  specimens  or health  information  are selected  for use in additional  research, you will be 
contact[CONTACT_546170].  
 
All women:  
At visit 1, which  will be today,  if you choose  to participate, you will have  the following  procedures:  we 
will measure  your height, weight  and body  composition,  and ask you if we can collect some  urine  and 
blood.   If you choose  not to participate  in this collection,  you may still enroll.  
At visit 2, which  will be by [CONTACT_756],  a researcher  will call you—within  the next week  or two— and ask 
you some  survey questions  about your social  situation,  your diet and physical  activity  habits  (about 25  
minutes  to complete).  
At visits  3 and 4, after your baby  [CONTACT_50835], we will meet you at NCO  or at your home  to measure  your 
weight and  ask you the same  survey questions  and a few more  about what you are feeding  your baby  
(about 25  minutes  to complete).  
 Visit 3 will be when  your baby  [CONTACT_439509]  4-8 weeks  old. 
 Visit 4 will be when  your baby  [CONTACT_439509]  20 weeks  (5 months  old). 
 
We will try to schedule  these  study  visits  at the same  time you come  to see your doctor  or your baby’s  
doctor,  but if that doesn’t work,  we will ask your permission  to schedule  a visit at your home.  
 
For women  in the group  that gets information  from the online  program:   You will receive  information  and be 
encouraged  to use an online  program  to record  activities  related  to returning  to your pre-baby  [CONTACT_8497].   You 
will also have  one-on-one visits,  at your home  and by [CONTACT_756],  with a community  health  worker to  talk 
about  infant feeding  and your weight  before  and after the baby  [CONTACT_50835].  These  visits  are extra  beyond  your

Witness  to Signature  [CONTACT_546190]:  
 
Aim 1: Feasibility of recruitment and retention: Feasibility will be assessed at multiple points:  
enrollment rate (percent of eligible and approached women); percent of participants for whom 
study staff is notified of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_546165]; percent of participants completing each 
additional data collection point. By [CONTACT_546180] R21 
exploratory/developmental project, we will be better able to target specific areas for refinement 
to inform our planned phase III trial. Retention will be assessed by [CONTACT_546181] 20 week postpartum data collection visit.  
 Aim 2: Acceptability will be measured at each data collection point using a brief questionnaire 
developed by [CONTACT_546182][INVESTIGATOR_546166], ease of use, and delivery method. 
Control group participants will be asked a similar set of questions to compar e satisfaction with 
usual care practices. Engagement will be assessed as percent of intervention arm participants 
completing each planned intervention contact [CONTACT_546183]-ins to the online 
system, use of web/mobile-based tracking tools, and interactions with peer counselors. 
Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed separately from, but also in relation to the primary 
outcomes of breastfeeding duration and weight retention. For example, we will assess the 
number of women who discontinue  BFing but continue tracking diet and exercise. These results 
will guide our structured interview questions planned for the final data collection visit (20 wks postpartum). 
 
Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary effect size of the intervention relative to a) the control group (at 
20 weeks postpartum) and secondarily to b) patients in the same health system who are not 
enrolled in our study (via electronic medical records at 6 weeks postpartum) on: (1) 
breastfeeding duration, and (2) postpartum weight retention. S tatistical Analyses: Subjects will 
be randomized to treatment (TRT) or control (CNT). Adequacy of the randomization: Randomization adequacy will be tested by [CONTACT_546184]. Where substantive differences exist, they will  
be controlled for in subsequent analyses. We will test the degree of similarity, however, 
following Altman
 we will be guided by [CONTACT_546185], not strict statistical significance.  
Outcomes and Analysis : The data on n participants are denoted by [CONTACT_546186] i-th participant. The two main outcomes are: (1) Duration of 
breastfeeding assessed by [CONTACT_546187] (possible range=0-140 
d), and (2) Weight retention assessed by [CONTACT_546188] [ADDRESS_714719] the hypothesis where is the coefficient for the TRT group indicator, with CNT as 
referent. Results will be presented as (1) a point estimate and 95% confidence interval for , with 
and without regression-adjustment and (2) a standard two-sample t-test of 0 H . 
Statistical Power: With a total sample size of [ADDRESS_714720] size of 0.65 (i.e., in units of standard deviation) with power of 80% (2-
sided test, alpha=0.05). Our objective, however, is the estimation of effect size rather than 
testing for significance.

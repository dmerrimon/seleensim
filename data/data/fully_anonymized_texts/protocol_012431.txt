mRNA -[ADDRESS_456165] 2023: Current Amendment  
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial because it neither impacts the safety or 
physical/mental integrity of participants nor the scientific value of the study.  
Overall  Rationale for Amendment  11: 
The main purpose of  this amendment is to update the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP)  in 
accordance with the updated FDA guidance on emergency use authorization for vaccines to 
prevent COVID -19 (FDA 2022 ). 
The immunogenicity objectives and endpoints outlined in the CSP amendment 10 are no longer 
applicable. Therefore, these objectives and endpoints were  removed from the CSP. 
The amendment also removes the antibody response comparisons between different vaccines 
because each modified vaccine targets a specific VOC that is no longer in circulation. Hence, 
comparing antibody responses between such vaccines is deemed not clinically meaningful or 
relevant .

mRNA -1273.815 and mRNA -1273.231 treatment  arms may be performed.  
Immunogenicity endpoints applicable to all study parts : 
SARS -CoV -2-specific bAb and nAb are assessed at multiple timepoints in each part of this 
study . 
For each of the antibodies of interest, eg, levels of SARS -CoV -2–specific bAb and 
SARS -CoV -2–specific nAb, the GMT or level with corresponding 95% CI at each time point, 
and GMFR of post-baseline/baseline titers or levels with corresponding 95% CI at each 
post-baseline time point will be provided for each arm. The 95% CIs will be calculated based 
on the t -distribution of the log -transformed values then back -transformed to the original  scale 
for presentation. The following descriptive statistics will also be provided at each time point: 
number of participants (n), median, minimum, and maximum.  
The mixed effect model repeated measure (MMRM) will be used to analyze all postboost er 
measure s for between -booster comparison  when applicable , the model will include treatment 
group, analysis visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], and adjusting for age groups and 
preboost er titer levels. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model t he 
within -participant errors. The GMT will be estimated from the model and its corresponding 
95% CI will be provided for each group at each postboost  timepoint. The GMR (ratio of 
GMTs) will be estimated from the model and the corresponding 95% CI will be p rovided at 
each postboost  timepoint.  
The SRR of each arm against ancestral SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456382] ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and variant s 
respectively, will be provided for each arm with the 95% CI calculated using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  
The primary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4  × LLOQ for those with pre-dose 1 of 
primary series baseline <  LLOQ; ≥ 4 -foldrise for those with pre-dose 1 of primary series 
baseline ≥ LLOQ. The secondary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4  × LLOQ for 
those with preboost er baseline <  LLOQ; ≥ [ADDRESS_456383] er ≥ LLOQ.  SRR 
will be summarized using both definition s for all the study parts .

1.1. Study Rationale   
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_365086] (SARS). An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID -19, later designated 
SARS -CoV -2) initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. The 
World Health  Organization (WHO) declared COVID -19 a pandemic on 11  Mar 2020 with more 
than 157  million cases and 3.2  million deaths by 09 May 2021 ( WHO 2021 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc. (the Sponsor)’s scalable messenger RNA (mRNA)/lipid nanoparticle ( LNP) 
technology platform allowed for a rapid response to the pandemic and was used to develop 
mRNA -1273, a novel LNP -encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against SARS -CoV -2. 
mRNA -1273 contains a single mRNA (CX -024414) that encodes for the full -length 
SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein of the Wuhan -Hu-1 SARS -CoV -2 virus, modified with 2 proline 
substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S -2P) to stabilize the spi[INVESTIGATOR_365087] a 
prefusion conformation. Having achieved the primary endpoint in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 s tudy 
conducted in persons at high risk for SARS -CoV -2 infection, in December 2020, mRNA -1273 
was granted EUA for the prevention of COVID -19 for individuals 18 years of age and older 
based on the demonstration of efficacy and safety in a Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_365088] U S (31 January 2022) (Baden  et al 2021 ). 
Over the course of the pandemic, SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456399] raised concern, due to 
reports of increased infe ctivity or reduction in the ability of convalescent sera or sera from 
vaccinated participant s to neutralize these emergent strain variants. Mutations occurring in the 
receptor -binding domain (RBD) are of particular concern, as this site includes the domina nt 
neutralization epi[INVESTIGATOR_228738] S protein and these mutations could impact the effectiveness of 
antibodies elicited by [CONTACT_365127] ( Greaney et al 2021 ). 
These recent evolutionary event s indicate that SARS -CoV -2 has the capacity to develop more 
efficient transmission between human hosts ( Martin et al 2021 ) and vaccination strategies to 
control the virus need to be responsive to this evolution. A SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456400] 11 mutations located in the S protein, 3 of 
which (K417 N, E484K, and N501Y) are found in the RBD.  More recently SARS -CoV -2 variants 
emerged in India, and the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta variant) containing 2 mutations in the RBD 
(L452R and T478K) is currently circulating globally. In vitro characterization of ser a from 
individuals recently vaccinated with the [ADDRESS_456401] key emerging variants tested, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B. 1.617.2 ( Wang et al 
2021 , Wu et al 2021a , Choi A et al 2021 ). The studies showed no significant reduction in 
neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 relative to the ancestra l Wuhan -Hu-1 strain and a 2.1 -fold 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 55 reduction versus B.1.617.2; however, a greater than six -fold reduction in neutralizing titers was 
observed against the B.1.[ADDRESS_456402] moderate to severe COVID -19 in South Africa where the B.1.351 variant is 
circulating ( Madhi et al 2021 , Sadoff et al 2021 ). 
In November 2021, the SARS -CoV -2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 ; BA.1 ) was detected in South 
Africa and currently epi[INVESTIGATOR_365089]. The Omicron variant has significant antigenic change with a potentia l growth 
advantage. In addition, it contains  potential antibody escape site mutations (such as K417N, 
T478K, E484A, and N501Y) . After the emergency of the BA.1 sublineage, other Omicron 
sublineages (BA.2, BA.4, BA.5 , and XBB.1.5 ) with additional potential antibody escape site 
mutations have been detected in multiple geographies.  
There is an urgent need for vaccination strategies that induce broader protection against variants 
of concern (VOC), to decrease morbidity and mortality.  In addition, it is currentl y not known 
whether breakthrough infections could occur long -term due to waning antibody titers 
(Doria -Rose et al 2021 , Pegu A et al ). Based on the experience of mRNA -[ADDRESS_456403] booster dose will elicit a similar or superior 
antibody response to the B.1.1.529 compared to a single booster dose of mRNA -1273, using an 
extern al comparator; Study Part F Cohort 2 will assess whether a single booster dose of the

Background and Overview  
The Sponsor has developed a rapid  response, proprietary vaccine platform based on mRNA 
delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo can 
take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The 
delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact wi th the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently.

mRNA -[ADDRESS_456407] SARS -CoV -2 (mRNA -1273 ). mRNA -1273  encodes for the 
full-length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce 2 proline residues to stabilize the 
S protein (S -2P) in a prefusion conformation. The CoV -S protein mediates attachment and entry 
of the virus into host cells (by [CONTACT_340085]), making it a primary target for neutralizing antibodies 
(nAbs) that prevent infection ( Corbett et al 2020 ). It has been confirmed that the stabilized 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456408] prefusion conformation ( Wrapp et al 2020 ).

The Sponsor has conducted preclinical studies to evaluate modified vaccines. The 
immunogenicity of mRNA -1273.351 (a monovalent product containing mRNA CX -027367) and 
a 1:1 mix of mRNA -1273 and mRNA -1273.351 was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Both vaccines 
were evaluated as a [ADDRESS_456411] the B.1.351 variant, while a 1:[ADDRESS_456412] dose of mRNA -1273.351 significantly increased both Wuhan -Hu-1 and B.1.351 -specific 
neutralization titers ( Wu et al 2021b ). 
Additional studies are being performed in mice, golden Syrian hamsters, and rhesus macaques to 
further evaluate mRNA -1273, mRNA -1273.351, and mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_456413] and as a component 
in a multivalent f ormulation, mixed with mRNA -1273 or mRNA -1273.351.  Additional animal 
studies are currently being conducted with mRNA vaccines that target  different Omicron 
variants.  
1.3. Clinical Studies   
The Sponsor has previously evaluated modified  Beta variant -matched booster  vaccines in the 
completed Phase 2a clinical study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and the Sponsor is currently evaluating

1.4.2.  Risks from Study Partic ipation and Their Mitigation   
The safety profile of mRNA -1273 is largely based on data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 Study 
mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) . 
Solicited ARs were reported more frequ ently among vaccine participants than among placebo 
participants. The most frequently reported ARs after any dose in the vaccine group were pain at 
the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia and chills. The most common solicited local AR 
was pain. Soli cited systemic ARs were reported more frequently by [CONTACT_365128] 2 (fatigue, 65.3%, headache, 58.6%, myalgia, 58% and arthralgia, 42.8%) than after dose 1 
(fatigue, 37,2%, headache, 32.7%, myalgia, 22.7% and arthralgia,16.6%). Grade 3 sy stemic ARs 
were also reported more frequently after dose 2 than after dose 1. The majority of local and 
systemic ARs had a median duration of 1 to 3 days.  
Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some ARs in younger age groups: the incidence of 
axillar y swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, and 
fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above.  
Grade 3 solicited local ARs were more frequently reported after dose 2 than after dose 1.  
Unsolicited AEs that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 
23.9% of participants who received mRNA -1273 and 21.6% of participants who received 
placebo. Unsolicited AEs that occurred in ≥ 1% of study pa rticipants who received mRNA -[ADDRESS_456422] 1.5 -fold higher rate than placebo, were lymphadenopathy related events 
(1.1% vs. 0.6%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are similar to the axillary 
swelling/tenderness in the injected arm reported as solicited ARs. Several participants reported 
injection site reactions after Day [ADDRESS_456423] likely dermal 
hypersensitivity an d were unlikely to represent a long -term safety concern.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 59 Hypersensitivity AEs were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 1.1% of placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection 
site urticaria , which are likely related to vaccination. There have been no cases of severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after vaccination in the trial to 
date.  
There were 3 reports of Bell’s palsy in the mRNA -1273 vaccine group (one o f which was a n 
SAE ), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group which 
occurred 17 days after vaccination. Currently available information on Bell’s palsy is insufficient 
to determine a causal relationship with the va ccine.  
SAEs  were reported at the same rates in participants who received mRNA -[ADDRESS_456424] observation. There were 2 SAEs of facial swelling in vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] a history of injection of dermatological fillers.  The onset of swelling was reported 
1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination. There was 
1 SAE of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior history of severe headache 
and nausea requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]. This event occurred 1 day after vaccination and was likely 
related to vaccination.  
There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between study arms for specific 
categories of AEs (including other neurologic, neuro -inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that 
would suggest a causal relationship to mRNA -1273.  
In the Post -Authorization setting, anaphylaxis has been reported following mRNA -[ADDRESS_456425].  Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs 
and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis . Safety will be monitored throughout the study 
(Section 7.4).

whether screening and dosing are performed on the same day.  
At the dosing visit on Day 1, participants will be instructed how to document and report solicited 
ARs within a provided electronic diary (eDiary). Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7 days (the 
day of injection and the following 6 days), and unsolicited A Es will be assessed for 28 days after 
injection; SAEs, MAAEs, A Es leading to withdrawal, pregnancies a nd AESI will be assessed 
throughout the study. All participants will be tested for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies 
at baseline and at Day 29 (primary immunogenicity endpoint).  Participants in Part J will also be 
tested for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies at Day 15  (primary immunogenicity 
endpoint) . Additional blood draws will be collected on  Day 9 1 (Part s A.2, F, G, H, and J  only) , 
Day 181 , and Day  366 (Part s A.1, B, C, D, F, and G only) . In addition, active surveillance for 
intercurrent or breakthrough SARS -CoV -2 infection will occur throughout the study and 
reported as AEs (confirmed symptomatic infections will be reported as MAAEs if not SAEs). 
Participants with signs and symptoms meeting the CDC case definition for COVID -19 
([ADDRESS_456501] recent [ CDC 2020 ]) will be asked to contact [CONTACT_365130] -PCR testing (of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_152922]) to assess 
symptomatic COVID -19. Participants with any clinical or radio graphic evidence of pneumonia 
will also undergo RT -PCR testing. Suspected COVID -19 cases will also be tested using a 
multiplex assay to assess for non –SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456502] 
infection  (Table  12 and Table  13). Participants will have blood samples collected at scheduled  
study site visits during the study for immunogenicity assessments or other medical concerns 
according to the investigator’s judgment.  
Participants may experience A Es, to include symptoms of COVID -19, that necessitate an 
unscheduled visit. There may also b e situations in which the investigator asks a participant to 
report for an unscheduled visit following the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be 
conducted at these visits as necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of participants during 
the study. Electronic case report forms should be completed for each unscheduled visit. In 
addition, participants may have blood samples collected at unscheduled visits for acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].

completed their Day [ADDRESS_456505] NP swab samples collected 
before vaccination on Day 1, on Day 29, and also on Day 91 (Part s A.2, F, G, H, and J  only), 
Day 181, and Day  366 (EoS)  (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F , and G  only) . Furthermore, in case of any 
signs or symptoms or MAAEs suggesting SARS -CoV -2 infection in a participant, an additional 
NP swab sample and blood sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 
via serology and RT -PCR. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
Since it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the NP swab samples collected before study injection and the serologic assays 
performed for antibody responses to non -vaccine antigen(s), may help to discriminate between 
natural infection and vaccine -induced antibody responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
3.3. Justification for Dose, Control Product, and C hoice of Study 
Population   
The dose of the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 vaccine (mRNA -1273) was clinically evaluated at dose 
levels of 25, 50, 100, and 250 µg in a 2 -dose series in a Phas e 1 dose -ranging study, with the 
100-µg dose level selected for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trial. Therefore, the dose of 100 µg will be 
used as the booste r dose in Part B of this study (monovalent mRNA1273 booster). In addition, 
the dose of 50 µg and 100 µg will b e used for the monovalent mRNA1273.617.2 booster ( Part C).  
In Part D, the bivalent mRNA -[ADDRESS_456506] 3 months after  mRNA -1273 50  µg booster . In Part G and Part A.2, the multivalent 
mRNA -1273.214 booster candidate will be administered at the 50 -µg dose level as a second 
booster  dose. In Part H the multivalent mRNA -1273.222 booster candidate will be administered 
at the 50 -µg dose level as a second booster dose. In Part J, the multivalent booster candidates 
mRNA -1273. 815 and mRNA -1273.231  will be administered at a dose of  50 µg. 
In the mRNA -1273 -P201 study, mRNA -1273 administered as a single booster dose of 50  µg was 
well-tolerated and demonstrated significant boosting of neutralizing antibody responses to 
SARS -CoV -2 in a pseudovirus neutralization assay ( Wu et al 2021b ). 
This study will screen and enroll healthy adults, [ADDRESS_456507] previously 
received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in the mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) study  or under EUA  (Parts 
A.1, B, C, and D) ; or who have previously received  2 doses of mRNA -1273 and a booster dose

to 5°F). All study vaccines must be stored in a secure area with limited access and protected from 
moisture and light until it is prepared for administration ( Section 5.3.1 ). The freezer should have 
automated temperature recording and a [ADDRESS_456539] of compliance with these storage 
conditions. The site is responsible for reporting any IP that was not temperature -controlled 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 90 during shipment or storage. Such IP will be retained for inspection by [CONTACT_365132].  
The 0.9% sodium chloride injection (USP) should be stored at 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF) in a 
restricted access area.  
5.3.6.  Study Vaccine Accountability   
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the IP accountability study staff maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition  of used and unused IP vials.  
A site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and at the 
completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA -[ADDRESS_456540] observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Quali fied staff will 
confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of IP. If a participant does not receive IP 
or does not receive all of the planned dose, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded. Data 
will be reconciled with site accountabi lity records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_14311] a visit  within the defined visit window specified in the SoE ( Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). If a participant does not complete a visit within the time 
window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with 
subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requireme nts of the missed visit will be captured 
and included in the subsequent visit.  
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications   
5.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_365093] (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by [CONTACT_14312] 28 days before providing 
informed consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in 
the participant’s eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_456541] the following information in the 
eCRF:  
• All non -study vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 da ys before the 
study injection.  
• Seasonal influenza vaccine administered for the current influenza season (typi[INVESTIGATOR_340006]).  
• All concomitant medications and non -study vaccinations  taken through 28 days after 
vaccina tion. Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the 
absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as 
such.  
• Any concomitant medications used to prevent or treat COVID -19 or its symptoms.  
• Any concom itant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or an 
MAAE . 
• The participant will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or 
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within [ADDRESS_456542] -injection study visits or 
via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including v accinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the contract 
research organization (CRO)’s medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or 
withholding further i njection of the participant based on the time the medication was 
administered, the drug’s pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication 
will compromise the participant’s safety or interpretation of the data. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medications are adequately 
recorded in the eCRF.  
5.5.3.  Concomitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the Elimination of a 
Participant from Per -Protocol Analyses   
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the per -protocol 
(PP) analysis  (analysis sets are described in Section  8.4): 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study  period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chronically (ie, 
more than 14  days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean 
that prednisone ≥ 10  mg/day or the equivalent is not permitted. Inhaled, nasa l, and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271].

period (eg, infliximab).  
• An authorized or licensed vaccine administered during the period from 28  days before 
through 28  days after vaccinatio n, except for any licensed influenza vaccine that was 
administered 14  days before or after vaccination.  
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period.  
In addition, any participant confirmed to have received or plans to rece ive a non -study  
COVID -[ADDRESS_456543] be reported to the Sponsor.

AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL   
6.1. Criteria for Delay of Vaccine Administration   
6.1.1.  Individual Participant Criteria for Delay of Study Vaccination   
Body temperature must be measured before vaccination. The following events constitute criteria 
for delay of injection, and, if either of these events occur at the time scheduled for dosing, the 
participant may be injected at a later date  within the time window specified in the SoE ( Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20), or the participant may be discontinued from dosing at the 
discretion of the investigator ( Section  6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing . 
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) at  the time of dosing . 
Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator. 
Participants with a fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher will be contact[CONTACT_340101] -evaluated for eligibility. If the investigator determines that the 
participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug  therapy, an injection could be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
6.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study   
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
A participant who chooses not to receive the  second booster dose of mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_456544] 
received subsequent non -study COVID -19 booster vaccines . If a participant meets the criteria for 
an illness visit (Section  7.1.6 ), NP samples will be collected during the illness visit  per protocol.  
If participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will attempt 
to obtain agreement to f ollow -up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or 
stable and will then complete the EoS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a part icipant from the study was made by [CONTACT_46362], Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 94 participant or by [CONTACT_093], as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• AESI (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (speci fy) 
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_3445] (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs and AESI) must 
be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators 
will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE 
until resolution of the event.  
A parti cipant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may ret ain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  10.2.6 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all rese arch results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted  by [CONTACT_427]).  
6.3. Lost to Follow -up  
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the part icipant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 95 necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_14386] (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachab le or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 96 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES   
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) (as detailed in Section 10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study procedures at the time 
points specified in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). A participant can also 
be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An unscheduled visit may be 
prompted by [CONTACT_340097], illness vi sit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. 
The site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform 
the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 202 3), investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the app roval of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with 
state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and 
Table  20). Adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for 
study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue participation 
in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedure s conducted as a part of the participant’s routine clinical management and 
obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided that the procedures meet the protocol -specified criteria and are performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and 
Table  20). 
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 visit may be completed on the same day.  
7.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures   
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant, 
according to the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs (Section 7.4.3 ) that occur during the 7 days 
following vaccination (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs 
will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section 7.1.1 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 97 • Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following vaccination (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are defined in 
Section  7.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to withdrawal from Day 1 through EoS.  
• MAAEs from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• AESI from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• SAEs from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• Vital sign measurements before and after vaccination ( Section 7.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings (if performed) ( Section 7.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV 2 infection from Day 1 through study completion.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study treatment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section 7.4.6 ). 
The incidence and severity of the above events will be monitored by [CONTACT_365133] a regular basis.  
Participants who receive a non -study second booster dose (or any subsequent doses, if available 
in the future), after having received all prior booster doses in the study, can remain in the study 
for safety follow -up. 
7.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries   
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they will be willing to complete an eDiary 
using either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a device that will be 
provided at the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, the p articipant will be instructed 
to download the eDiary application or will be provided an eDiary device to record solicited ARs 
(Section  7.4.3 ) on Day  1. 
On Day 1 (dosing day), participants will be instructed on thermometer usage to measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), 
and self -assessment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness  on the same side as the injection 
arm. 
On Day 1 (dosing day), participants will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 
[ADDRESS_456545] the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity A Rs, as defined in Section  7.4.3 , that 
occur on the day of vaccination and during the 7 days after vaccination (ie, the day of 
injection and 6 subsequent days). Any solicited AR that is ongoing beyond Day  7 will 
be reported in the eDiary until it has resolved, and not to exceed 28 days after 
vaccination. A Rs recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by [CONTACT_46362], Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 98 study site staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site 
visit.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by [CONTACT_3452]. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Other measurements, as applicable, for solicited local A Rs (injection site erythema 
and swelling/induration) will be performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_3452].  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on Day 1 or for the next 
6 days.  
The eDiary will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic or local A Rs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. The participant will have a limited window on the following day to complete 
assessments for the previous day; quantitative te mperature recordings and measurement of any 
injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on the following day may be excluded 
from the analyses of solicited A Rs. 
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone calls or at site visits  (including a 
solicited AR) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the source documents 
as a verbally reported event. Any AR reported in this manner must be described as an unsolicited 
event and therefore entered on the AE eCRF.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants during the safety call 7  days after 
vaccination.  
The eDiary will also be used every 2 weeks from Day  36 to Day  162, and from Day  202 to 
Day 342 (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F , and G  only) or every 2 weeks fr om Day 36 to Day 162 
(Parts  A.2, H, and J  only), to capture the occurrence of MAAEs, AESI, SAEs, and AEs leading 
to withdrawal. The eDiary will prompt the participant to complete an eDiary questionnaire that 
collects the following data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact [CONTACT_271076] . 
• Known exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
• Any experience of symptoms of COVID -19. 
• Any MAAEs, AESI, or SAEs . 
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events or of symptoms of 
COVID -19, a follow -up safety call will be triggered.  
Apart from the safety telephone calls described in Section  7.1.2 , each participant will complete a 
questionnaire in an eDiary as shown in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
The eDiary responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_365134] a follow -up 
safety call by [CONTACT_365135].  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 99 [IP_ADDRESS].  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use   
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by [CONTACT_365136], respect ively, for recording solicited ARs 
in the eDiaries. Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants 
who do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2.  Safety Telephone Call   
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by a trained site personnel. 
This call will follow an approved script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety 
information. There wil l be a safety telephone call on Day 8 for each participant to discuss their 
health and review their eDiary. Subsequent s afety calls by [CONTACT_365137] 2 weeks from Day 43 to Day 169, and from Day 209 to Day 349 (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F, 
and G  only)  (Table  17) and every 2 weeks from Day 43 to Day 169  for Parts A.2  (Table  18), 
H (Table  19), and J ( Table  20). The participant will be interviewed according to the script about 
the occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, AESI, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any non -study vaccinations ( Section 7.4.7 ). In 
addition, study personnel will collect information on known participant exposure to someone 
with COVID -19 or SA RS-CoV -2 infection and on the participant’s experience of COVID -[ADDRESS_456546] either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the 
investigator. If not documented in a female participant’s medical records, an FSH test may be 
performed at the Scr eening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the investigator, to 
confirm postmenopausal status.  
7.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements   
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points 
indicated in th e SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). Vital signs are to be collected 
pre- and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital sign 
measurements should be performed before blood collection.  
Participants who are febrile (bo dy temperature ≥ 38.0°C  [100.4°F ]) before injection on Day  [ADDRESS_456547] be rescheduled within the relevant window period to receive the injection. Afebrile 
participants with minor illnesses may be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.

A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at Day 1 as 
indicated in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). The full examination will 
include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, 
cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system an d extremities. Any 
clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the investigator. On the day of vaccination, before injection, the arm receiving the injection 
should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated.  
7.1.6.  Assessment for SARS -CoV -2 Infection   
Participants will hav e NP samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing at time points specified in 
the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
A study illness visit or a consultation will be arranged within [ADDRESS_456548] an NP swab ( Table  12 and Table  13) to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via 
RT-PCR if a participant experiences any of the following (the presence of  any one of these  
symptoms lasting at least 48  hours [except for fever an d/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]]):  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection as defined by [CONTACT_6750] ( CDC 2020 ), 
including:  
- Fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) or chills (of any duration, including 
≤ 48 hours)  
- Cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
- Shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including 
≤ 48 hours)  
- Fatigue  
- Muscle or body aches  
- Headache  
- New loss of taste and/or smell  
- Sore throat, congestion, or runny nose  
- Nausea or vomiting  
- Diarrhea  
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection  
• Clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia  
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. All findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
It is important  to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with solicited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common , 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 101 investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide whether an NP swab should be 
collected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1 and Day 29 vaccination can help 
ensure that cases of COVID -19 are not overlooked. Any study participant rep orting respi[INVESTIGATOR_365094] 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical 
history, physical examination, and blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing. The NP swab 
sample may be tested by [CONTACT_76878] -PCR for respi[INVESTIGATOR_365095] -CoV -2 to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. Blood 
samples will be collected at all illness visits for potential future immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for 
COVID -19 and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72 hours  
of the study participant reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants 
who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19 without the opportunity for a clinic visit will also be 
considered cases, assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_365096] -CoV -2 by [CONTACT_365138] a Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) -certified or CLIA -certified waiver laboratory. Investigators are encouraged 
to try to obtain a respi[INVESTIGATOR_365097], if feasible.  
Symptomatic COVID -19 is defined by [CONTACT_365139] -listed symptoms 
(CDC  2020 ) and a positive RT -PCR test on a respi[INVESTIGATOR_152922]. Asympto matic SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_456549] SARS -CoV -2 infection and are 
symptomatic or asymptomatic , the investigator will notify the participants’ primary care 
physicians of the diagnosis and the local public health authorities as required per local 
regulations.  
If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure to someone with a confirmed  
case of COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure form, and the participant will 
continue to follow all remaining study assessments as scheduled. Likewise, participants with a 
confirmed case of COVID -19 will continue to follow all remaining study assessments as 
scheduled.  
Any confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 infection occurring in participants will be captured as 
an MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, 
and outcome.  
7.2. Immunogenicity Assessments   
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial 
volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 102 sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF. Handling and preparation of the samples for 
analysis, as well as shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76818], will be provided in a separate study 
manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nAb levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_429].  
According to the ICF ( Section 10.2.6 ), excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used 
for future research, which may be performed at th e discretion of the Sponsor to further 
characterize the immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the 
immune response across CoV.  
Nasopharyngeal swab samples to be collected are also shown  (Table  12 and Table  13).

7.3. Efficacy Assessments   
Vaccine efficacy will not be formally assessed in this study, but active surveillance for 
COVID -[ADDRESS_456550] and blood draws (see Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20), will be performed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_456551] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definit ion 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition . 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after vaccination even though they may have 
been present before the start  of the study . 
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46283]).  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.4.3 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the vaccine and 
the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by [CONTACT_46354] a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccination). Any unsolicited AE which began during 
mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) but is ongoing at the time of enrollment in this study, should be 
documented as medical history.  
7.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events   
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the i nvestigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365098], Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_456552] one overnight stay for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76821]. 
Complications that occur during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365099]; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_76823], the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365100]. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Ex amples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
7.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions   
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will s olicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  7.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDiary durin g the 7 days after vaccination (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days).  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  14 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond [ADDRESS_456553] udy staff either via phone call or 
at the next study visit. All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered causally related 
to dosing.

Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by [CONTACT_340112]’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare provider  (HCP), to 
be recorded as an MAAE ( Section  7.4.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093] (AE leading to 
withdrawal) . 
• Solicit ed local or systemic AR lasting beyond [ADDRESS_456554] -injection . 
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE . 
7.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events   
An M AAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a n HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory follow -up, COVID -19 
[Section  7.1.6 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care 
physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of  the eCRF . 
All confirmed COVID -19 cases will be recorded as MAAEs.  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As 
an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours per Section  7.4.11. The investigator will submit any updated 
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 107 purposes, a participant who displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as follows) 
should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance for 
investigat ors and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14274], a sev ere life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_716]:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, and red and itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated 
shock, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, and evidence of 
reduced peripheral circulation.  
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, 
upper airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], 
persistent dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, and 
rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  
7.4.5.  Adverse Event of Spe cial Interest   
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program for which ongoing monitoring and immediate n otification by [CONTACT_365140] a case narrative . Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Section 10.4 
(Appendix 4) provides a list of AESI pertinent to this study. All AESI will be collected through 
the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported AESI and the eCRF has been taken  offline, then the site 
can report this information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section 7.4.11 ). 
Myocarditis and/ or Pericarditis   
Very rare events of myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported after vaccination with the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine. All suspected cases of probable and confirmed  myocarditis, pericarditis , or 
myopericarditis should be reported  as an AESI even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case 
definition. The event should also  be reported as an SAE, if it meets seriousness criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be report ed to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section 7.4.2 . The investigator will submit any updated 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 108 myocarditis, pericarditis , or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being 
available. For reporting purposes, any events suspi[INVESTIGATOR_365104], pericarditis, or 
myopericarditis should be reported as an AESI. The CDC case defini tion is displayed below as 
guidance  (Gargano et al, 2021 ). These definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help 
reporting of suspected cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis, but the diagnosis of 
suspect ed cases are left to the investigator ’s clinical judg ment . 
Acute Myocarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms  (persons who lack  the 
listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis 
[probabl e or confirmed]) : 
• Chest pain/pressure/discomfort  
• Dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing  
• Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
• Syncope  
AND  
For probable case:  
≥ 1 new findi ng of:  
• Troponin level above upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
• Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG ) or rhythm monitoring findings 
consistent with myocarditis  
− To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion,  a probable case  must include at 
least one of:  
o ST segment or T -wave abnormalities  
o Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias  
o AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defects  
• Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnorm alities on echocardiogram  
• cMRI finding consistent with myocarditis ( Ferreira et al, 2018 ) 
AND  
• No other ident ifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
For confirmed case : 
• Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [Aretz et al, 1987 ]) 
OR 
• cMRI findings consistent with myocarditis in the pre sence of t roponin level above 
upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
AND  
• No ot her identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 109 Acute Pericarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 2 new or worsening of the following clinical features  (Adler  et al, 2015 ): 
• Acute chest pain  (Typi[INVESTIGATOR_14284], deep 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or cough; and relieved by [CONTACT_289645], although other 
types of chest pain may occur)  
• Pericardial rub on exam  
• New ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or MRI  
Case Definition of Myopericarditis   
Participants who meet criteria for both myocarditis and pericarditis may be described under 
myopericarditis.  
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and 
adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determin e if 
they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity 
(Gargano  et al 2021 ). Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probably or confirmed 
cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be  referred to the Sponsor, who will then make a final 
decision on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on assessment of 
the overall potential risk to study participants . 
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter  that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter . 
7.4.6.  Recording and Follow -up of Pregnancy   
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at any time during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
conge nital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered as SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, or the SAE Fax 
line (Section  7.4.11 ). If the participant agrees to submit this information, the pregnancy must be 
followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if intended duration of the 
safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be distributed to the study 
site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately (within 24  hours of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 110 awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome accordi ng to 
the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.4.7.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after vaccination. Other (unsolicited) 
AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after vaccination.  
The MAAEs, AESI, AE leading to withdrawal, AESI, and SAEs will be collected from 
participants as specified in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20) until the end of 
their participation in the study. Any AEs occurring before receipt of IP will be analyzed 
separately from AEs occurring after receipt of the study vaccine.  
At every study site visit or telephon e contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including COVID -19 symptoms) 
according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
had any a ccidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any non -study vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings, or other documents 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be t reated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  6.3). 
7.4.8.  Assessment of Intensity   
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  7.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ) will be used to categorize local and 
systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign 
measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity 
events are presented in Section  7.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by [CONTACT_365141]:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s d aily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.

daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
7.4.9.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator’s assessment of  an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the documentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event)  for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the 
following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not 
receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relati ve to administration of the IP is not 
reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_76881].  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the IP 
is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_340116].  
7.4.10.  Reporting Adverse Events   
The investigator is res ponsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All uns olicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes type of event, time of onset, investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and rela tionship to IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome. The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be 
reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_365142]. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will 
be used to code all unsolicited AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time of screening but does not deteriorate should not 
be reported as an unsoli cited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study, it 
should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
7.4.11.  Reporting SAEs   
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_365143] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 112 Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_365144] ( Section  7.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The inve stigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in [ADDRESS_456556] information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox: [EMAIL_6994]   
• SAE Fax Line ([LOCATION_003] and Canada): +[PHONE_7545]  
Regulatory repor ting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  7.4.15 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the  study.  
7.4.12.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, AESI, and SAE Information   
Medical occurrences that begin before IP dosing but after obtaining informed consent will be 
recorded in the Medical Histor y/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF and not in the 
AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, it will be recorded 
and reported as an AE.  
AEs may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner.  
Solicited AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after vaccination. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day  of injection through 28  days after vaccination.  
Serious AEs (including AESI) will be collected from the start of IP dosing until the last day of 
study participation.  
All SAEs and AESI will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately an d 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC 
system. If a site receives a report of a new SAE or AESI from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported SAE or AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then 
the site can report this information on a paper SAE or AESI form using the SAE Mailbox or the 
SAE Fax line ( Section  7.4.11 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by [CONTACT_11150] (eg, leads to study drug 
discontinuation, or meets any serious criteria). If this is the case,  it must be recorded in the 
source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that produced the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 113 value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stabilized and 
the participant’s safety is not at  risk. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EoS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has 
withdrawn from or completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
7.4.13.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs   
Electronic diar ies have specifically been designed for this study by [CONTACT_1034]. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomita nt 
medications/vaccinations.  
The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of study arm or 
suspected causal relationship to IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
7.4.14.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigato r is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, stabilization, 
the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU, as  defined in Section  6.3. 
7.4.15.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_365145] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory autho rity 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigator s. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious ARs 
according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report descr ibing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_456557] is planned for this study.  
Safety monitoring for this study will include study team members, inclusive of, at a minimum, 
the Sponsor medical monitor, Sponsor safety physician (from Pharmacovigilance), and CRO 
medical monitor. The study team will conduct ongoing safety reviews during the study and will 
be responsible to monitor for safety concerns during the study as described in the Saf ety 
Management Plan.  
An Independent CEAC  that includes pediatric and adult cardiologists will review suspected cases 
of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or 
“confirmed” events, and to assess severity . 
7.6. Treatment of Overdose   
As the study treatment is to be administered by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely that an 
overdose will occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as pr otocol deviations ( Section  10.2.8 ). 
7.7. Pharmacokinetics   
Pharmacokinetic par ameters are not evaluated in this study . 
7.8. Pharmacodynamics   
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. 
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the 
clinical database lock for the study . If changes are made to primary and/or secondary objectives 
or the related statistical methods after the study has begun, then the protocol will be amended 
(consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made 
after t he protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they 
occurred, will be listed in the SAP or CSR  for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, 
will be clearly identified in the CSR.

There is no hypothesis testing for Parts A.1, B, C, and D.  
The primary analysis population for immunogenicity will be the PP IS for Immunogenicity  
analysis  for Parts A.1, A.2, B, C, D  and J . PPIS-Neg will be the primary analysis for 
immunogenicity analyses for Parts F (Cohort 1), F (Cohort 2), G, and H.  Each arm will be 
evaluated separately.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis for the Primar y Immunogenicity Objective   
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Analysis for the Primary Immunogenicity Objective for Part s A.1, B, C, and D   
Immune response of each booster arm against  ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and SARS -CoV -2 
variants, the GMT, geometric mean fold rise and seroresponse rate will be calculated at the time 
points where the immune response is assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Analysis for the Primary Immunogenicity Objective for Part A. 2  
There is no hypothesis testing for Part A.2 . 
For Part A.2 participants,  Day 29 and Day 181 immune response after mRNA -1273.214 (50  µg) 
as a second booster dose will be compared with their own Day 29 and Day 181 immune response 
of mRNA -1273.211 (50 µg) received as the first booster dose. GMT ratios will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_3382] t ransforming the mean of paired differences of antibody titer data on the logarithmic scale 
between Day [ADDRESS_456621] mRNA -1273.211. The difference  in serore sponse 
rates and its corresponding 95% CI based on adjusted Wald method will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Analysis for the Primary Immunogenicity Objective for Part F   
Cohort 1:  
The 50-µg mRNA -1273.529 booster dose (first booster dose) will be assessed with respect to the 
mRNA -1273 booster dose (first booster dose) using an external comparator ( details regarding the 
external historical control will be included in the SAP ). For the primar y immunogenicity 
objective, there are 3 hypotheses to be tested.

Confidential  Page 123 An ANCOVA model will be performed to assess the difference in  immune response between 
mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 (using external comparator) as  the first booster dose. For 
immune response against the B.1.1.[ADDRESS_456628] the B.1.1.529 strain will be a dependent  variable, and a group variable 
(mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273) will be the fixed effect,  adjusting for age groups (< 65, 
≥ 65 years) and preboost er antibody titer level, if applicable.  
The GMT will be estimated by [CONTACT_365147] 95% will be 
provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) for mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_456629] to 
mRNA -1273 will be estimated by [CONTACT_340078] 95%

in immune response against the B.1.1.529 strain f or mRNA -1273.529 at Day 29 compared to the 
mRNA -1273.  
The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving seroresponse at Day 29 will be 
summarized with 95% CI calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for each group. The 
difference of SRR between  mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 will be calculated with 95% CI  
based on Miettinen -Nurminen method . The non -inferiority in SRR of mRNA -1273.529

1. The Screening Visit and Day 1 (vaccination) visit can be combined and occur on the same day.  
2. Safety follow -up via eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 2 weeks from at Day 36 to Day 162, and from Day 202 to Day 342. These study days are 
relative to Day  1 vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day 7 should be reviewed by [CONTACT_365149].  
3. Physical examination: A full phy sical examination, including height and weight, will be performed on Day 1. Symptom -directed physical examinations may 
be performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during  a study vis it should be reported as 
an MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected pre - and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital sign measurements should be 
performed before blood collection. For participants who are febrile (body temper ature ≥  38.0°C [100.4°F]) before injection on Day  1, the visit must be

4. The NP swab sample, collected prior to vaccination on Day 1, will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR. The NP swab sample will 
also be collected within 24 hours if participant experience signs and symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection. It is important to note that some of the symptoms 
of COVID -19 overlap with solicited local and systemic  reactogenicity  ARs, that are e xpected after vaccination with mRNA -1273.211 (eg, myalgia, 
headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7  days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgment 
to decide if an NP swab should be coll ected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1 vaccination can help ensure that cases of COVID -19 are not 
overlooked. Any study participant reporting respi[INVESTIGATOR_340010] 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19.

7. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the end of study visit (Day  366).  
8. All concomitant medications and non-study  vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days following injection.

Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion of the 
investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. 
Vital signs are to be collected pre - and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital 
sign measurements should be performed before blood collection. For participants who are febrile (body 
temperature ≥  38.0°C [100.4°F]) before injection on Day  1, the visit must be rescheduled within the relevant 
window period to receive the injection.  Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be administered 
investigational product at the discretion of the investigator.  
4. The NP swab sample, collected prior to injection on Day 1, will be used to ascertain the presence of 
SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR. The NP swab sample will also be collected within 24 hours if a participant 
experiences signs and symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection. It is important to note that some of the symptoms 
of COVID -19 overlap with solicited local and systemic reactogenicity  ARs, which are expected after 
vaccination with mRNA -1273.222 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, chills). During the first 7 days after 
vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide if 
an NP swab should be col lected. The collection of a NP swab prior to the Day 1 vaccination can help ensure

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant docume nts (eg, 
advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by [CONTACT_365153].  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design,  except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with t he requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by [CONTACT_1201] . 
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by [CONTACT_27491] . 
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB, European regulation 536/2014 
for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations . 
10.2.2.  Study Monitoring   
Before an investigat ional site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of the 
Sponsor or its representatives will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the investigator.  
According to ICH GCP gu ideline, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the 
eCRFs. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Sponsor in the mainte nance 
of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB  
review, and inspection by [CONTACT_365154]/or documents. In 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 148 addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator all regulations 
applicable to the clinical evaluation of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to ins pect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct to any loc al regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the i nvestigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perform source da ta verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant ( eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Mailbox , and those SAEs  that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
10.2.3.  Audits and Inspections   
The Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct site 
visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of the 
study. The investigator agrees t o allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory 
authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, participant charts and study 
source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and the IRB may visit the site 
to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a Sponsor 
audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities a nd 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP (R2), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_365155] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant . 
A participant who is rescreened is not required to sign another ICF if the rescreening occurs 
within 28  days from  the previous ICF signature [CONTACT_568] (within the initial screening period).  
The ICF will also explain that excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize  the 
immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across CoV.  
10.2.7.  Protocol Amendments   
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by t he investigator or the Sponsor after 
the protocol has been agreed to and signed by [CONTACT_365158](s) or amendment(s) 
has (have) been agreed upon by [CONTACT_211293]. Any change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the  written amendment will be signed by [CONTACT_340152]. Institutional review board approval is required prior to the implementation of an 
amendment, unless overriding safety reasons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) 
will be promptly notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, 
potential benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study 
objectives, study design, participant population, sampl e sizes, study procedures, or significant 
administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be 
released by [CONTACT_1034], agreed by [CONTACT_093](s), and approved by [CONTACT_56335](s) prior 
to implementation. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant 
amended documents and the ICF have been approved by [CONTACT_33149](s) must be provided to the 
Sponsor before the study is initiated.  
Administrative changes to the protocol are minor correc tions and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be released by 
[CONTACT_1034], agreed by [CONTACT_473], and notified to the IRB(s).  
10.2.8.  Protocol Deviations   
Noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478].  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations to the Sponsor or its designee. All deviations must be addressed in study source 
documents and reported to the study monitor. Protocol deviatio ns must be sent to the reviewing 
IRB per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the 
reviewing IRB requirements.

disclosure commitments established by [CONTACT_13174]. These websites 
include clinicaltrials.gov, EU clinical trial register (eu.ctr), as well as some national registries.  
10.2.13.  Data Quality Assurance and Quality Control   
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision of 
the si te investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded in the eCRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee  electronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_46388].  
- The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that 
supports the information entered in the eCRF.  
- The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, 
and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data 
documents.  
- Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk -based initiatives in operations 
and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and 
Analytical Risk -Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and 
requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring 
techniques (central, remote, or onsite monitoring) are provided in the clinical 
monitoring plan.  
- The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data.  
- The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to oth er individuals 
(eg, CROs).  
- Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that 
data entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_1191], 
complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of 
participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
- Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertai ning to the conduct of 
this study must be retained by [CONTACT_1732] a period of at least [ADDRESS_456713] s may be transferred to another location or party 
without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated,  documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A quality assurance representative from Sponsor or qualified designee , who is independent of 
and separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the 
clinical study by [CONTACT_46389]. These inspections may 
include onsite inspections/audits and source data c hecks. Direct access to source documents is 
required for the purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
10.2.14.  Data Collection and Management   
This study will be conducted in complian ce with ICH CGP guidelines. This study will also be 
conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study will use electronic data collection to collect data directly from the study site using 
eCRFs. The investigat or is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between 
the eC RFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the 
principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the clinical monitoring 
plan.  
AEs will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using  WHO  – Drug 
Reference List.  
10.2.15.  Source Documents   
Source documents are original documents or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and include, but are not limited to, 
eDiaries, medical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93476], screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact [CONTACT_29543], and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s 
site. 
Data repo rted on the case report form or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer re cords, depending on 
the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
clinic, or office charts and the signed ICFs are to be included in the investigator’s files with the 
participant’s study records.  
10.2.16.  Retention of Records   
The principa l investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of at 
least [ADDRESS_456714] permit access to such records. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be  retained.  
10.2.17.  Study and Site Closure   
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the study of the 
reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214]. The 
investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant 
therapy and/or follow -up. 
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_23863]:  
• Continuation of the study represents a significant medical risk to participants  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]  
• Discontinuation of further  mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_456715] editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will gen erally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  
Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_11403] I nternational Committee of

Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Women of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cann ot be confirmed before 
vaccination at Day 1, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing potential:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal,  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy  
b. Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 m onths without an alternative 
medical cause. The following age -specific requirements apply:  
− Women < [ADDRESS_456716] luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the 
postmenopausal range for the institution.  
− Women ≥ [ADDRESS_456717] 
menses >  [ADDRESS_456718] menses 
> 1 year ago.  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal s tatus before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive method in accordance with the product label. For example:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273

Global  Part F is being added to the study.  
Part F evaluates the immunogenicity, 
safety, and reactogenicity of 
mRNA -1273.529 vaccine candidate as 
a single booster dose (50 µg, 100 µg) in 
adults who have previously received 2 
doses of mRNA -1273 as a primary  
series (Cohort 1) or have received 2 
doses of mRNA -1273 as a primary 
series and a single dose of mRNA -1273 
(50 µg) as a booster dose (Cohort  2). The Part F primary objectives 
will enable a comparison 
between the Omicron -specific 
immune response elicited 
from a mRNA -1273.529 
booster dose with the 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2-
specific immune response 
elicited from the mRNA -1273 
primary series immunization 
(historical cohort). These 
immunogenicity objectives 
adhere to the regulatory 
guidance for variant vaccines.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
In 2016, an estimated 19,950 individuals will develop AML in the U.S.1 With current 5-year 
relative survival rates of 55-60% for patients <45 years of age but only ∼ 5% for adults >age 65 
(the median age at diagnosis),2 many patients will ultimately die from either treatment -related 
toxicities or therapeutic resistance.3-5 The need for improved therapeut ic approaches is therefore 
unquestioned. This is particularly true for individuals presenting with medical co -morbidities that 
may limit their ab ility to tolerate intensive treatments; such patients are generally, but not 
invariably, older. Many of these s ubjects never receive any AML-directed therapy.6,7 Among 
those who do, the optimal treatm ent strategy i s unknown but typi[INVESTIGATOR_314951]-intensive therapy (e.g. azacitidine/decitabine or low -dose cytarabine) or intensive therapy 
(e.g. “7+3”).8 
U.S. and European population-based registry data support the use of intensive c hemotherapy 
rather than low -intensity therapy (or no therapy) in most AML patients up to age 80.6,9 Likewise, 
a recent retrospective analysis of 1,079 adults who received chemotherapy at 5 U.S. institutions 
from 2008-2012 suggested that, after adjustment for age, co -morbidity index, and 
cytogenetic/molecular risk, intensive therapy leads to better long-term survival even in older 
patients (age 70 -79 years) with significant co -morbiditie s without increase in early mortality.[ADDRESS_387616] regimens 
is not available and differences in supportive care and selection bias may confound the apparent 
benefit of intensive therapy. This possibility highlights the need for a randomized clinical trial to 
define the optimal treatment intens ity for medically less fit AML patients with varying co -
morbidity burden.  
One barrier to improving care for medically less fit  adults with AML has been the lack of 
explicit definition of “less fit ”. In the AZA -001 trial, which randomized older adults with newly 
diagnosed AML with >30% blasts to either azacitidine or “conventional care regimens” (CCRs), i.e. best supportive care (BSC), low -dose cytarabine, or “7+3”, the investigators determined 
which protocol -designated CCR was most appropriate for each patient on the basis of age, 
performance stat us, and institutional practice b efore randomization.
[ADDRESS_387617] in those (presumably the most fit) in whom the alternative was “7+3”, and worst in  
those (presumably the least fit) in whom the alternative was BSC. This suggests that physicians 
are adept at distinguishing fit from less fit  individuals. However, it seems doubtful that they are 
as adept as a quantitative model. To develop such a model, we recently analyzed data from 3,365 
adults with newly diagnosed AML given intensive chemotherapy in SWOG trials or at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDA) and found t hat the weekly risk of death falls sharply once [ADDRESS_387618] group and allowed an empi[INVESTIGATOR_314952] -related mortality (TRM) as deaths occurring within these 4 weeks.
12 We 
then used a reas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to quantify the ability of 
individual covariates to predict TRM in 2,238 patients treated at MDA between 1995 and 2008. 
Performance status (PS) and age wer e the most important single covariates i n predicting TRM 
(AUC of 0.75 and 0.65 for models with PS or age alone, respectively). However, a “simplified” 
multicomponent model, which was validated by [CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_314953] [ADDRESS_387619] relevant 
individual c ovariates (PS, age, platelet count, seru m albumin, type of AML [secondary vs. de 
novo], white blood cell count [WBC], peripheral blood blast percentage, and serum creatinine) 
9759  
Page 5/[ADDRESS_387620] on the AUC, suggesting 
that age is largely a surrogate for the other covariates contained in the model.  
The TRM score, computationally derived from the “simplified” TRM model, is now in routine 
use at F red Hutch, where research protocols now primarily assign patients based on predicted 
likelihood of TRM (e.g. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Because the early death rates 
following intensive chemotherapy in adults with AML have declined substantially over the last 2 
decades,
13,14 we very recently re-examined the value of the “simplified” TRM model to predict 
early deaths in patients treated at Fred Hutch.15 Among 285 patients with newly diagnosed AML 
treated with intensive induction chemotherapy from 2008-2014, 17 (6.0%) died within [ADDRESS_387621] early deaths after AML therapy. So far, the comparative abilities of a model such as the one that underlies the TRM score and “physician intuition” (“I know it when I see 
it”) to predi ct TRM are uncertain. Moreover, an AUC of 0.75-0.80 approximately intermediate 
between certainty (AUC=1.0) and a coin flip (AUC=0.5). Therefore, although the TRM score will be the principal eligibility criterion for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087], an important  part of this 
application will be examining (a) w hether incorporation of other covariates (e.g. HCT -CI, ELN 
risk group) will improve the ability to forecast TRM and (b) the concordance between our models and simple physician judgment. While we have developed online means to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_314954] ( https://cstaging.fhcrc -research.org/TRM/Default.aspx
), it is perhaps naïve 
to expect widespread use barring a quantitative demonstration of the value of pred ictive models.  
Recognizing the c urrent limitations in our knowledge regarding treatment approach to adults 
with AML who are medically less fit , the goal of our research, is to conduct a controlled clinical 
trial to improve outcomes in these patients. Because of the possibility of signifi cant selection 
bias in non-randomized assessments, the preferred trial is based on a randomized assignment to 
higher-intensity vs. lower-intensity chemotherapy. However, such a trial may prove impractical. Therefore, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_314955] t he feasibility of randomization in this situation, 
and explore reasons why patients and/or physicians might be reluctant to randomization in this situation. For this purpose, we will use preference surveys to examine patient and physician attitudes towards  medical decision -making and treatment allocation. In addition to focusing on 
feasibility and estimates of anti -leukemia activity (e.g. response rates) and survival, we will also 
assess complementary dimensions of treatment benefit, in particular quality o f life (QOL) as well 
as resource utilization and care cost.  
Contemporary clinical trials often utilize DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (e.g. azacitidine or decitabine) or low doses of cytarabine as non-intensive therapy, whereas multi -agent 
chemotherapy, most typi[INVESTIGATOR_314956] 7+[ADDRESS_387622] therapeutics in medically less fit  individuals with AML are relatively poor. This is exemplified by [CONTACT_314980] -001 
trial, in which median overall survival times of approximately 6 -7 months for low -dose 
cytarabine and 10 -12 months for azacitine or 7+3 were estima ted. This observation highlights the 
need for better therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In a recent phase 1/2 trial in medically fit adults with newly diagnosed AML, we found that combination therapy with G -CSF, cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, and 
escalated doses of mitoxantron e (G-CLAM) is well tolerated and appears to produce higher rates 
9759  
Page 6/[ADDRESS_387623], and possibly longer survival than 7+3, after accounting for prognostic 
covariates. Given these data, G -CLAM will be used as intensive therapy in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] 
(“highe r-dose G -CLAM”). As comparator non-intensive therapy, we will use G -CLAM with 
reduced doses of cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (“ lower-dose G -CLAM ”). Rather than 
selecting different classes for the non -intensive and intensive treatment arm in our trial – which 
may have different modes of action and therefore confound the question of treatment intensity – we purposefully chose G -CLAM as backbone for both arms.  
Development of G -CLAM as highly active, intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML  
Since 2012, we have used G -CLAM extensively in adults wit h newly diagnosed AML and high-
grade MDS, primarily as part of a large, ongoing institutional phase 1/2 trial (FHCRC #2734.00). Our interest in this regimen stems from data indicating improved anti -leuk emic activity with 
regimens containing cladribine, high -dose cytarabine, and escalated doses of mitoxantrone 
compared to standard 7+[ADDRESS_387624] dose tested (mitoxantrone at  18 mg/m
2/day) as the maximally tolerated dose. A total of 
62 patients, including 6 treated in phase 1, received G -CLAM at MTD. Patient characteristics 
were as follows: median age 58 (21 -81) years, median TRM score 2.85 (0.06-6.73), with AML 
(n=52) or high-risk MDS (n=10). Cytogenetics were favorable in 6, intermediate in 44, and adverse in 12 (MRC criteria); 11 patients had NPM1 and 6 had FLT3 mutations. Fifty-two 
patients (83.9%, 95% confidence interval: 72.3-92.0%) achieved a CR (n=48 [77.4%: 65.0-87.1%]), or CRp/i (n=4 [6.5%: 1.8-15.7%]) with 1-[ADDRESS_387625] response. Among the 48 CR patients, 43 (89.6%) were negative for measurable residual disease (MRD
neg) by [CONTACT_4133]. Four patients had morphologic leukemia  free state, 
1 patient with myeloid sarcoma had a partial remission, 4 had resistant disease, and 1 died from indeterminate cause. One patient died within 28 days of treatment initiation (septic shock). Median times to an absolute neutrophil count ≥500/μL and a platelet count of ≥50,000/μL were 26 and 23 days. Besides infections and neutropenic fever, maculopapular rash, and hypoxia (fluid overload/infection-related) were the most common grade ≥3 adverse events. In addition to the phase 1/2 MTD cohort, ther e were 15 patients treated in an expansion cohort and 3 eligible 
patients treated off protocol with mitoxantrone at 18 mg/m
2. For these 80 patients combined 
treated at MTD, the CR and CR/CRp/i rates were 76.3% and 81.2%. After multivariable 
adjustment, com pared to 300 patients treated with 7+3 on the SWOG S0106 trial, G -CLAM with 
mitoxantrone 18mg/ m2 was associated with an increased probability of CR (odds ratio [OR]= 
3.08, p=.02), CR/CRp/i (OR=2.96, p=.03), a trend towards improved MRDneg CR (OR= 3.70, 
p=.06), and a trend towards improved overall survival ([OS]; hazard ratio=0.34, p=.07). For the 
entire study cohort, the 6 and 12- month relapse -free survival were 73% (64-83%) and 62% (42-
74%) and the 6 and 12- month OS were 89% (82- 96%) and 77% (67-88%). Together, our study 
found G -CLAM with mitoxantrone up to 18 mg/m2/day to be well tolerated and to have potent 
anti-leukemia activity.  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], patients meeting the in/exclusion criteria and primary oncologists are asked whether or not they woul d agree to participate in the randomized treatment assignment. Patients 
agreeable to randomization will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the higher -intensity arm and given 
G-CLAM or the lower-intensity arm that is built on G -CLAM but utilizes lower doses of 
9759  
Page 7/38 
 cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone. For the other patients, the reasons to decline 
randomization will be recorded, and patients will be allowed to receive the treatment intensity of 
their choosing. We will then follow these patient for a variety of di sease specific outcomes —
remission rates, overall survival —as well as examine patient and physician attitudes towards 
medical decision -making and treatment allocation, assess QOL, and examine resource utilization 
and care cost.

6.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 This study is a single- center, open- label randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_314957]-dose vs higher -dose  G-
CLAM for medically less fit  adults with newly diagnosed AML or analogous myeloid neoplasms  
at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/University of Washington /Seattle Cancer Care 
Alliance.  
 Study Overview  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], patients meeting the in clusion/exclusion criteria and their primary oncologists 
are asked whether or not  they would agree to participate in the randomized treatment assignment  
(APPENDIX D) . Patients agreeable to randomization will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 
higher-dose  G-CLAM  arm or the lower -dose  G-CLAM arm that utilizes lower doses of 
cladribine, cy tarabine, and mitoxantrone. For those who wish to not be randomized, the reasons 
to decline randomization will be recorded, and patients will be allowed to receive the treatment intensity of their choosing. Patients will receive high er-dose or low er-dose G -CLAM as follows:  
 
 
After study enrollment, patients will receive a first cycle of G -CLAM on one of the  designated 
treatment arms . Post -induction bone marrows will be reassessed upon blood count recovery or 
between day Days +28 to +[ADDRESS_387631]. If a response 
other than a  measurable (“ minimal ”) residual disease-negative ( MRDneg) CR is achieved, the 
patient will receive re-induction with G -CLAM at the same dosing. Patients who achieve a 
morphologic CR or CR with incomplete count recovery (CR i) with up to 2 courses of higher -
dose G -CLAM or up to 6 courses of low er-dose G -CLAM can r eceive consolidation therapy 
with G -CLA (i.e. mitoxantrone omitted; up to 4 cycles with high-dose G -CLA and up to 12 
cycles of low -dose G -CLA).

6.1  Baseline/Pre-Treatment Assessment  
  The following procedures  should be obtained at baseline before initiation of study 
therapy to establish trial eligibility and allow patient characterization and disease 
prognostication. Results of tests and/or procedures  conducted as per standard of care may be 
used to determine study eligibility if conducted within an appropriate window prior to screening. 
Outside testing and previously collected clinical data may be used if within the appropriate time 
frame.  
6.1.1 History and physical examination (assessed within 1 4 days prior to study day 0).  
6.1.2 Bone marrow examination (or peripheral blood assessment if ≥10% blasts are 
present) with morphologic and flow cytometric assessment . Routine cytogenetic 
analysis and molecular testing  should be obtained. A  bone marrow biopsy should 
be obtained if spi[INVESTIGATOR_314958] (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_314959] 2 months prior to study day 0).  
6.1.[ADDRESS_387632] ete blood counts with differential blood count and platelet count (assessed 
within 1 4 days prior to study day 0).  
6.1.3 Metabolic panel, including bilirubin, albumin, and creatinine (assessed within 1 4 
days prior to study day 0).  
6.1.4 MUGA scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality, to 
assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; assessed within 3 months prior to study day 0). 
 
6.2 Pre-Treatment  
  At the discretion of the treating physician  for clinical management only , allopurinol 300 
mg PO daily (or equivalent dose adjusted for renal function) may be considered in all patients without known allergies to allopurinol to reduce the risk of tumor lysis. Higher doses of allopurinol are permitted if patients develop tumor lysis syndrome. Patients may receive rasburicase, a recombinant uric acid oxidase, for the prevention and/or treatment of tumor lysis syndrome at the discretion of the treating physician  if clinically indicated . All patients sho uld be 
adequately hydrated and receive anti -emetics as necessary.

to consolidation therapy with G -CLA as per 6.6, per discretion of treating 
attending.  
6.5.3 Patients with persistent disease:  Patients with persistent disease (≥5% blasts) are 
eligible for a second course of induction chemotherapy at the same dosing used in cycle [ADDRESS_387637] resolved to Grade <2. If they 
are not in CR or CRi  after the 2
nd induction course , they will be removed  from the 
study. 
6.5.4 Patients with persistent aplasia without evidence of disease after Day +49:  
patients will be removed from protocol.  
 
6.6 Consolidation  Therapy  
  After achievement of  a CR/CRi (irrespective of MRD) with 1-[ADDRESS_387638] -remission therapy with G -CLA.  
  6.6.1 The treatment is identical to the induction course but without mitoxantrone (i.e. G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine, or “G -CLA” at same dose level as induction). 
If a patient had excessi ve toxicities (grade > 3 non-hematologic toxicity excluding 
neutropenic fever and infections) during induction, a dose reduction can be considered as described in section s 6.[ADDRESS_387639]-remission courses should start within 6 weeks of achieving CR/CRi  once 
patients have recovered to ≤Grade 2 toxicities from the previous course of therapy.  
  6.6.3 Patients on the higher -dose arm can receive up to 4 courses of consolidation 
therapy.  
  6.6.4    Patients on the low er-dose arm can receive up to 12 cycles of consolidation 
therapy.   
  6.6.5 Patients can proceed to transplantation barring contraindications and if a suitable donor is available.

6.7  Monitoring during/after Induction and Consolidation  Therapy  
For patient monitoring, the following studies and study intervals are suggested  and will 
be performed at the physician’s discretion : 
6.7.1 Complete blood counts with differential blood count, including immature 
cells/blasts, and platelet count at least 2 times weekly until ANC > 500/µL and 
then at least weekly until platelet count >100,000/µL.  
6.7.2 Metabolic panel, including bilirubin, ALT/AST, and creatinine at least weekly until ANC >1,000/µL and platelet count >100,000/µL.  
6.7.3 If pati ents develop signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac dysfunction, LVEF 
should be assessed using the same method to evaluate baseline LVEF status (MUGA scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality).   
 
6.[ADDRESS_387640] organ dysfunction at baseline —defined as a serum creatinine > 2.0 
mg/dL  or a bilirubin concentration is ≥[ADDRESS_387641] -- or those who experienced ≥Grade [ADDRESS_387642] induction, a dose reduction can be considered as follows (see also APPENDIX B]:  
6.8.1 If a patient develops Grade ≥[ADDRESS_387643] dose of G -CLAM, the next course of G -
CLAM will be given once toxicity  is ≤ grade 2; doses for this course will be 
cladribine 4 mg/m
2 days 1-5, cytarabine 1 ,500mg/m2 days 1-5, mitoxantrone 14 
mg/m2 days 1-3, and G -CSF dose unchanged. Assuming these doses are well -
tolerated the first course of G -CLA will be administered at these doses, omitting 
mitoxantrone. If Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity occurs again, there will be a 
further reduction in doses of cladribine to 3 mg/m2 daily days 1-5 and cytarabine 
to 1,000mg/m2 daily days [ADDRESS_387644] cycle of G -CLA. Doses for subsequent 
courses of G -CLA will be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  
 6.8.2 Mitoxantrone:  If the  bilirubin concentration is ≥[ADDRESS_387645] , consider a dose 
reduction of mitoxantrone by 25-50% in consultation with the Oncology Pharmacist  
 6.8.3 Cladribine:  If the serum creatinine exceeds 2.0 mg/dL and/or estimated creatinine 
clearance (calculated by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault) decreases to less than 50 mL/min 
during therapy, we will consider dose reduction in discussion with the Oncology Pharmacist.  
 6.8.4 Cytarabine : If the serum creatinine exceeds 2.0 mg/dL and/or estim ated creatinine 
clearance (calculated by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault) decreases significantly during therapy, 
we will consider dose reduction in discussion with the Oncology Pharmacist . 
 
6.9 Dose Modifications of Chemotherapeutic Drugs for Subsequent Treatment Cycles 
for Low -Dose Arm  
9759  
Page 14/38  
   Given the doses of the chemotherapy in this arm are already low, there will be no further 
dose reduction for toxicity. Also, doses do not need to be adjusted ba sed on liver or kidney 
function. Decisions whether to proceed with further cycles of chemotherapy if ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_387646] institutional practices.  
  6.10.4 Transfusional support should be carried out according to institutional practice guidelines.  
 
6.11 Treatment of CNS Disease  
  Treatment of CNS disease is done according to institutional practice guidelines or the 
preference of the attending phys ician.  
 
6.12 Recommended Follow -up Care  
  After completion of protocol treatment, patients should be evaluated by [CONTACT_314984]/or national guidelines or the discretion of the attending physician. These evaluations may include peripheral blood studies and/or bone marrow examinations, as clinically indicated.  
 
 
7.0 INFORMATION ON STUDY DRUGS  
 G-CSF, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone will be obtained commercially.  
 
7.1  Drug Information on G -CSF (Granu locyte colony-stimulating factor)  
7.1.1 Mechanism of Action:  G-CSF is a growth factor that stimulates the production, 
maturation, and activation of neutrophils. Further, it promotes premature release of neutrophils from the bone marrow and enhances their phagocytic capacity.  
7.1.2  Pharmacokinetics:  Peak G -CSF con centrations after sub -cutaneous dosing occur 
in 2 to 8 hours, though the onset of action is approximately 24 hours, with plateau concentrations in 3 -5 days, and elimination over an 11-20 day period. G -CSF is 
cleared by [CONTACT_314985]. Notably, as G -CSF binds neutrophils, plasma 
levels are controlled in large part by [CONTACT_314986].   
7.1.3  Adverse Effects (AEs):  Common drug-related AEs (occurring in >10% of 
patients)  include fever, petechiae, elevated uric acid, splenomegaly, bone pain, 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. Less common drug-related AEs (occurring in 1% -10% of patients) 
9759  
Page 15/38  
 include hyper- or hypotension, arrhythmias, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
leukocytosis, and transfusion rea ction. Infrequent drug-related AEs (occurring in 
<1% of patients) include acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], allergic reactions, alopecia, alveolar hemorrhage, arthralgia, bone density decrease, capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], cerebral hemorrhage, vasculitis, dyspnea, edema, erythema nodosum, hematuria, hemoptysis, hepatomegaly, hypersensitivity, injection site reaction, pericarditis, proteinuria, psoriasis exacerbation, pulmonary infiltrates, renal insufficiency, sickle cell crisis, splenic rupture, Sweet’s syn drome, tachycardia, 
and thrombophlebitis. 
7.1.4 Recommended dose adjustments for organ dysfunction:  There is limited or no 
data examining the toxicity of G -CSF in patients with renal or liver dysfunction. 
Therefore, administration of G -CSF to patients with  liver or kidney disease must 
be done with caution.  
 
7.2  Drug Information on Cladribine (2-chloro -2’-deoxyadenosnie, 2-CdA)  
7.2.1 Mechanism of Action:  Cladribine is a prodrug that is converted to an adenosine 
deaminase-resistant triphosphate derivative (2 -CdATP). This molecule is then 
activated by [CONTACT_68009] a 5’ -triphosphate derivative (2-CdAMP), 
which is incorporated into DNA where it acts as a transcription reg ulator. In 
addition to its cytotoxic properties in dividing cells, cladribine induces death in quiescent cells of lymphoid origin through an unknown mechanism.  
7.2.2 Pharmacokinetics: Cladribine is renally excreted, with 18 -35% as unchanged 
drug. It is able to penetrate the CSF, where it achieves 25% of plasma concentrations. It is 20% protein-bound. The half-life for elimination after a 2 -
hour infusion is 6.7± 2.5 hours in patients with normal renal function.   
7.2.3 Adverse Effects:  Common adverse effects (occurring in >10% of patients)  include 
fever, fatigue, headache, rash, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, myelosuppression (including grade 3/4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia), injection site reaction, and infection. Less common adverse effects (occurring in 1 to 10% of patients) include edema, tachycardia, thrombosis, chills, dizziness, insomnia, malaise, diarrhea or constipation, weakness, myalgias and arthralgias, cough, dyspnea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and diaphoresis. Rare adverse effects (occurring in <1% of patients)  
include aplastic anemia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, lymphocytopenia, altered mental status, hemolytic anemia, hypersensitivity, myelodysplastic syndrome, quadriparesis, and renal dysfunction/failure.  
7.2.4 Reconstitution:  Cladribine is supp lied as a sterile, preservative-free, isotonic 
solution containing 10 mg of cladribine (1 mg/mL) in 10 mL single -use vials. 
Cladribine should be passed through a sterile 0.22μm filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  
7.2.5 Administration and Compatibility:  The use of 5% dextrose is not recommended as 
a diluent because of increased degradation of cladribine. The infusion solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature.  
7.2.6 Storage and Stability:  Store refrigerated 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Protect from 
light during storage.  
9759  
Page 16/38  
 7.2.7 Recommended Dose Adjustments for Organ Dysfunction:  Specific guidelines for 
cladribine dosing in patients with hepatic/renal dysfunction or hypoalbuminemia 
are not clearly defined. Because of the potential for compensatory elimi nation of 
cladribine in patients with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, specific guidelines for dosing are difficult to define. Thus, when deciding whether to adjust cladribine doses for renal dysfunction, the risks for potential toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression, neurotoxicity) against the benefits and goals of treatment must be considered.  
 
7.3 Drug Information on Cytarabine (Cytosine arabinoside) 
7.3.1  Mechanism of Action:  Cytarabine is a synthetic pyrimidine analog, in which the 
sugar moiety (normally a ribose or deoxyribose) has been replaced with arabinose. Although its mechanism of action is not completely understood, the active form of cytarabine is probably incorporated into the DNA and interferes with DNA synthesis. As such, cytarabine has been f ound to primarily effect 
dividing cells, blocking their progression from G
1 to S phase.  
7.3.2 Pharmacokinetics:  Cytarabine is metabolized by [CONTACT_314987] (aracytidine triphosphate). Aracytidine triphosphate is converted to nontoxic uracil derivatives by [CONTACT_100302]. This balance between the levels of kinases and deaminases is critical for regulating the sensitivity/resistance of cells to the drug. The plasma clear ance 
of cytarabine is biphasic, with an initial rapid phase and more prolonged second 
clearance phase. The rapid clearance phase has a relatively short half -life (t
1/2α = 
10 minutes), while the half - life of the second clearance phase is slightly longer 
(t1/2β = 1 – 3 hours). The nontoxic metabolites from the drug are excreted in the 
urine, and within 24 hours after the infusion, approximately 80% of these 
nontoxic metabolites can be recovered from the urine.  
7.3.3  Adverse Effects:  The dose -limiting toxic ity for cytarabine is myelosuppression. 
Adverse Events Associated with Standard Dose Cytarabine: Frequent AEs (not definitely quantified) include the following: myelosuppression (leucopenia, 
anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), pyrexia, rash, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, anal inflammation or ulceration, hepatic dysfunction or increased liver enzymes, and local thrombophlebitis.  Less frequent AEs (not 
definitely quantified)  include chest pain, pericarditis, dyspnea dizziness,  headache,  
neural toxicity, neuritis, alopecia, pruritis, skin freckling, skin ulceration, urticaria, abdominal pain, bowel necrosis, esophageal ulceration, esophagitis, pancreatitis, sore throat, urinary retention, jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia, local site cellulites, renal dysfunction, allergic edema or anaphylaxis, sepsis, and sudden respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]. Infrequent AEs (not definitely quantified)  include 
aseptic meningitis, cardiopulmonary arrest, cerebral dysfunction, cytarabine syndrome (bone pain, chest pain, conjunctivitis, fever, maculopapular rash, malaise, myalgia), exanthematous pustulosis, hyperuricemia, intestinal pneumonitis, increased lipase, paralysis with intrathecal and IV combination therapy, rhabdomyolysis, veno-occlusive disorder , and death. Adverse Events 
Associated with High Dose Cytarabine include cardiomegaly and 
9759  
Page 17/38  
 cardiomyopathy, coma, severe neurotoxicity, personality change, somnolence, 
total body alopecia, severe rash or skin desquamation, gastrointestinal ulceration, perito nitis, intestinal pneumatosis, necrotizing colitis, liver abscess or damage, 
peripheral neuropathy, corneal toxicity, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, pulmonary edema, sudden respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], and sepsis.  
7.3.4 Reconstitution:  Cytarabine should be  reconstituted in sterile water and can be 
further diluted using either 5% dextrose or sodium chloride solutions into appropriate concentrations for infusion.  
7.3.5  Administration and Compatibility:   The diluted cytarabine solution should be 
inspected fo r particulate matter, discoloration, and haze prior to infusion.  If there 
is evidence of particulate matter, discoloration, or haze the solution should not be infused. Patients should be medicated with standard anti -emetic therapy. 
Cytarabine is not compatible (1) during Y -site administration with allopurinol, 
amphotericin B, ganciclovir; (2) in syringe with metoclopropamide; or (3) admixed with fluorouracil, heparin, insulin (regular), nafcillin, oxacillin, penicillin G. Cytarabine may have variable compa tibility when admixed with 
gentamycin, hydrocortisone, and methylpredinsone.  
7.3.6 Storage and Stability:  Vials of non-reconstituted cytarabine should be stored at 
room temperature 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 86°F). The diluted cytarabine solution may be stable fo r up to 48 hours if stored at room temperature.  
7.3.7 Drug-Drug Interaction:  Reversible decreases in the plasma steady -state 
concentration for digoxin and cardiac glycosides may occur. Cytarabine may diminish the therapeutic effect of flucytosine. There is ex vivo  data suggesting that 
cytarabine may reduce the effectiveness gentam ycin for killing K. pneumoniae .  
7.3.8  Warnings and Precautions:  Ex vivo and in vivo  studies have found that cytarabine 
causes extensive chromosomal damage and potential malignant transformation.  Although there have been some case reports describing cytarabine  use in pregnant 
humans, these cases reports are few. Thus, cytarabine is considered Pregnancy Category D. Women should be advised not to become pregnant while receiving cytarabine, and men should be advised not to father a child while receiving cytarabine  and for at least [ADDRESS_387647] milk; thus, it is not recommended for lactating females who are breast -feeding. As with any highly 
immunosuppressive  medication, cytarabine may diminish the effectiveness of 
dead and live vaccines and enhance the toxic/adverse effect of live vaccines. One should avoid use of live vaccines while receiving it. A small percentage of patients will have a hypersensitivity re action to cytarabine, and these individuals 
should not receive the drug again.  
7.3.9  Recommended Dose Adjustments for Organ Dysfunction:  Guidelines for 
adjusting cytarabine dose due to renal or liver dysfunction are not standardized, but many clinicians w ill adjust the dose based upon the function of these organs.   
 
7.4 Drug Information on Mitoxantrone  
9759  
Page 18/38  
 7.4.1 Mechanism of Action:  Mitoxantrone (dihydroxyanthracenedione) is an 
anthracenedione  derivative that intercalates with DNA, resulting in inhibition of 
nucleic acid synthesis.  
7.4.2 Pharmacokinetics:  Mitoxantrone is 78% bound to plasma proteins. A three -
compartment model was described after a single intravenous dose of 
mitoxantrone. The m ean alpha half-life is 6 to 12 minutes, the mean beta half -life 
is 1.1 to 3.1 hours, and the mean terminal (gamma) or elimination half -life is 23 to 
215 hours (median 75 hours). Mitoxantrone has extensive distribution into body tissues and is metabolized i n the liver to two main inactive metabolites 
(monocarboxylic acid derivative and dicarboxylic acid derivative). The major route of excretion for mitoxantrone appears to be biliary into the feces; approximately 11% of the dose is recovered in the urine with in 5 days of drug 
administration, with 65% of this being unchanged drug.  
7.4.3 Adverse Effects:  Common adverse effects (occurring in >10% of patients) include 
edema, fever, fatigue, headache, alopecia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis/stomatitis, myelo suppression, weakness, dyspnea, cough, and infection. 
Less common adverse effects (occurring in 1 to 10% of patients) include congestive heart failure, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), hypertension, chills, anxiety, cutaneous mycosis, hypcalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, menorrhagia, jaundice, myalgia, arthralgia, renal failure, proteinuria, rhinitis, diaphoresis, and infection.  
 Mitoxantrone may cause cardiac toxicity with prolonged administration and doses exceeding 80 to 100 mg/m
2; Appendix B provides an overview of the 
cardiotoxicity index of individual anthracyclines as well as mitoxantrone. When used after doxorubicin, cardiotoxicity is more frequent; an analysis by [CONTACT_314988] a risk of 6% at 134 mg/m
2 prior doxorubicin 
and 60 mg/m2 mitoxantrone, rising to a 15% risk at 120 mg/m2 mitoxantrone. 
Cardiac events reported included arrhythmias, decreased left ventricular function, 
chronic heart failure, tachycardia, ECG changes, and, infrequently, myocardial 
infarction. Bradycardia has been rarely reported. Patients with prior treatment 
with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal radiotherapy, or with preexisting 
cardiovascular disease may have more frequent occurrences of cardiac toxicity.  
7.4.4 Reconstitutio n: Mitoxantrone must be diluted prior to use. The dose of 
mitoxantrone should be to at least 50 mL with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection (USP) or 5% Dextrose Injection (USP). Mitoxantrone may be further diluted into Dextrose 5% in Water, Normal Saline or Dextrose 5% with Normal Saline and used immediately.  
7.4.5 Administration and Compatibility:  Care in the administration of mitoxantrone will 
reduce the chance of extravasation. Mitoxantrone should be administered into the tubing of a freely running intravenous infusion of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.  Care should be taken to avoid extravasation at the infusion site and to avoid contact [CONTACT_314989], mucous membranes, or eyes. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation have occurred, including burning, pain, pruritis, erythema, swelling, blue discoloration, 
9759  
Page 19/38  
 or ulceration, the injection or infusion should be immediately terminated and 
restarted in another vein.  
 Mitoxantrone should not be mixed in the same infusion as heparin since a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_314963].  
7.4.6 Storage and Stability:  Mitoxantrone should be stored between 15°C - 25°C (59°F -77°F) 
 
8.0 EVALUATION  AND END POINT DEFINITIONS  
 
 8.1 Treatment Response and Outcome  
Treatment response (e.g. morphologic/cytogeneti c/molecular CR/CRi) or treatment 
failure (e.g. resistant disease, aplasia, morphological or molecular/cytogenetic relapse) as well as treatment outcome (e.g. overall survival, relapse-free survival, event -free survival, and remission 
duration) will be determine by [CONTACT_314990] 6.5 and categorized according to criteria recommended by [CONTACT_314991] .
17,18 
Patients are routinely assessed for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by [CONTACT_7163] -parameter flow cytometry and cytogenetic assessment, as per institutional practice.  
 
8.2 Monitoring of Exploratory Endpoints 
 
8.2.1 Quality of life (QOL) assessment  
In order to measure QOL, we will use the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -C30), a validated 30 -
item instrument that includes 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health  scale, 
and 6 single items  (APPENDIX C). Standardized scores for each scale range from 0 to 
100 (higher scores representing better domain-specific QOL),
[ADDRESS_387648] survey completion upon 
study enrollment as well as aft er each on-study treatment cycle.Given that patients do not 
always fill out questionnaires d ue to illness, time or other constraints, w e will measure 
percentage of returned surveys as one of our feasibility outcomes.  
 
8.2.2 Evaluation of medical complications and use of medical resources  
Information on medical complications (e.g. need for intens ive care unit (ICU) -level care,  
length of ICU stay, neutropenic fever, documented infections, bleeding, reasons for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc.) and use of medic al resources (e.g. red blood cells and platelet 
transfusions; days of IV antimicrobial therapy, total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] ) will be 
collected from th e medical records from the UWMC and SCCA as done previously.21,[ADDRESS_387649] drivers and total/subset costs per phase of treatment 
(i.e. induction, outpatient management, and readmission), similar to our approach used 
previously.21,22 
 
9759  
Page 20/38  
 8.2.4 Examination of patient and physician attitudes towards medical decision -
making and treatment allocation  
[IP_ADDRESS] We will explore patient -reported factors influencing medical decision -
making though a Patient Preference Survey (APPENDIX D)  distributed  on study 
enrollment. This survey will include a question on whether they agree to be 
randomized or prefer to choose the ir treatment arm, and explores the reasons 
underlying this decision. As above, given that patients do not always fill out 
questionnaires, we will measure percentage of returned responses regarding reasons 
for treatment decision -making as one of our feasibi lity outcomes.  Surveys not 
returned will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] We will also explore physician preferences towards treatment -intensity 
randomization through a Physician Preference Survey (APPENDIX E) also 
distributed on study enrollment. This survey includes questions about whether the 
physician was agreeable to randomization (even if the patient was not) and explores reasons the physician might have not wanted to randomize the patient. As physicians 
are extremely busy,  we will  measure percentage of returned responses regarding 
reasons for treatment decision -making as one of our feasibility outcomes. Surveys not 
returned will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
 
8.3 Correlative Studies  
Due to the lack of translational science funding, there are no pre -planned correlative 
studies. However, study participants will be encouraged to provide biospecimens (i.e. peripheral blood and/or bone marrow specimens) to the Fred Hutch’s AML sample repository (FHCRC #1690.00; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_314964], MD).

and following the administration of the medications . Subjects are observed for the development 
of an immediate localized allergic reaction or  anaphylactic reaction during this time.  
 
Toxicity Criteria  
  This study will use the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) 
Version 5.0 for Toxicity and Adverse Event reporting. A copy of the CTCAE v5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).

       10.1.8 Withdrawal of consent; the patient may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
 
 
10.2  Duration of Follow -up 
  Patients will be followed after completion of study treatment to determine event free 
survival (EFS) and relapse -free survival ([ RFS] (for patients achieving CR ), as well as overall 
survival (for all patients) for a maximum of 5 years. Follow -up may include periodic (e.g. every 
3 months) review of medical records, and, if absolutely necessary, direct contact [CONTACT_314992].  
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
11.1  Expedited Reporting Requirements  
In accordance with Fred Hutch/UW Cancer Consortium IRB policy, all adverse events 
(AEs; whether occurring on-site or off-site), which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371] 
(PI) are (1) unexpected, and (2) related or possibly related to the research, and (3) serious or 
suggests that the research places research participants or oth ers at a greater risk of physical or 
psychological harm than was previously known or recognized, will be submitted to the IRB 
within ten (10) calendar days  of learning of the problem . Both the “Expedited Reporting Form 
for Unanticipated Problems or Noncompliance” and the “Adverse Event Reporting Form”, or 
equivalent forms, will be completed for this reporting.  
 
11.2 Definitions : 
11.2.1 Adverse Event (AE):  Any harm or untoward medical occurrence in a research 
participant administered a medical product, medical treatment or procedure even 
if it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the product, treatment, or procedure. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical product, medical treatment, or procedure whether or not considered to be rel ated. Mechanisms of obtaining 
information on AE include monthly transcripts, assessment forms obtained after each clinic visit, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314965].  
11.2.2 Related or Possibly Related AE:  An AE is “related or possibly related to the 
research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], it was more likely than not caused by [CONTACT_28821]. AEs that are solely caused by 
9759  
Page 22/[ADDRESS_387653] are not “related or possibly related”. If there is any question whether or not an AE is related or possibly related, the AE should be reported.  
11.2.3 Serious AE (SAE):  An adverse event that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life -threatening adverse event (real risk of dying)  
• Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]*  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity/or change in psychosocial status  
• Congenital anomaly  
• Requirement of intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage  
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56595] a serious adverse event if required for complications of AML or comorbid conditions. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123324] a SAE if it fulfills the criteria for a serious and unexpected adverse event as otherwise described.  
11.2.4 Unexpected AE : An unexpected adverse event is defined as an event that has a 
nature or severity, or frequency that is not consistent with the applicable 
investigator brochure, or the prior medical condition of the subject or other treatment given to the subject.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and reported in preclinical or clinical studies rather than an experience that has not been anticipated based on the pharmacological properties of the study drug.  
 
11.3 Grading Adverse Event Severity  
 All AEs will be graded in severity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V ersion 5.0  (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). If a CTCAE criterion does 
not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threa tening), or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity 
of the adverse event.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_387654] Reporting of Adverse Events  
Only grade ≥[ADDRESS_387655] . AEs that do not meet the requirement for 
expedited reporting will be reported to the  IRB as part of the annual renewal of the protocol. 
Myelosuppression and associated complications are expected events during leukemia therapy; therefore, myelosuppression and associated complications such as fever, infections, bleeding, 
and related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314966].

to the therapy  in this study (i.e., the start of the first dosimetry infusion). AEs with an onset date 
prior to the first exposure to an investigational product will not be recorded, except in the case of 
clinically significant worsening of the AE during the specified AE monitoring time frame.  
 
 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the F red Hutch/University of 
Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.   Under the 
provisions of this plan, F red Hutch Clinical Research Support (CRS) coordinates data and 
compliance monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_51760], contract research  organizations, or F red Hutch 
employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study.   Independent monitoring visits occur at 
specified intervals determined by [CONTACT_314993] P.  
 In addition, protocols are reviewed at least annually and as needed by [CONTACT_122934] (DSMC), F red Hutch Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the 
Fred Hutch /University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutiona l Review Board 
(IRB).  The review committees evaluate accrual, adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and adherence to the applicable data and safety monitoring plan for studies actively enrolling or treating subjects.   The IRB reviews the study progress and safe ty information to assess continued 
acceptability of the risk -benefit ratio for human subjects.  Approval of committees as applicable 
is necessary to continue the study.  
 The trial will comply with the standard guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_314994], state and federal guidelines.  
 
 
13.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Research data will be recorded in a study -specific, password protected database using a unique 
study ID for each patient to assure patient confidentiality. Data from source documents will be 
transcribed into this database. Source documents are documents wh ere patient data are recorded 
and docum ented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, quality of life assessments, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from a utomated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_314967], X -rays, patient files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, laboratories, and medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  There 
will be no case reports forms (CRFs) used for this trial.  
 The investigator will ensure that data co llected conform to all established guidelines. Each 
subject is assigned a unique subject number to protect subject confidentiality. Subjects will not be referred to by [CONTACT_9127], by [CONTACT_2300], or by [CONTACT_314995]. The licensed medical records department, affiliated with the institution 
where the subject receives medical care, maintains all original  inpatient and outpatient chart 
9759  
Page 24/38  
 documents . Patient  research files will be maintained under control of the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study team and kept in a locked office or file room within a secure building.  Access to the 
study database will be restricted by [CONTACT_314996] (i.e., locked offices).  
 
 
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_314968] -intensity 
or higher-intensity chemotherapy in a 1:1 fashion.  
14.1  Treatment allocation  
Treatment will be allocated based on patient preference. If agreeable to randomization, 
participants will be allocated to either lower -intensity G -CLAM or higher-intensity G -CLAM in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_387657]’s preference.  
14.2  Sample Size and Power  
This study will enroll up to 50 subjects.  
14.3   Primary/ Exploratory Endpoints/Hypotheses and Analytical Methods 
14.3.[ADDRESS_387658] remission chemotherapy. We will consider randomization feasible (i.e. a subsequent, larger study would be designed as a randomized trial) if the true proportion of patients willing to be randomized is 60% or higher. With [ADDRESS_387659] 52% of the patient s agree to be randomized (i.e. 26 or 
more of 50 patients agree to be randomized). If the true proportion willing to be randomized is 60%, the probability of observing 52% of more willing to be randomized is 90%. The probability of having 26 or more of the 50 patients agree to be randomized is only 6% if the true randomization agreement rate is 40%, and <1% if the true randomization agreement rate is 30% 
or lower, providing good operating characteristics not only to avoid a false negative result but also a f alse positive result. If one treatment arm closes prematurely (see section on monitoring 
below), we will conclude that randomization is not feasible, and the remaining patients will be treated on the remaining arm. Continuation of enrollment into that remaining arm will allow us to gain additional experience and provide more precise estimates of treatment efficacy and treatment -related toxicities.  
 
14.3.2 Exploratory  endpoints  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_314969], descriptive, and observational methods  to  
1) Evaluate the attitude of patients and physicians toward randomization and explore reasons for treatment preference  
2) Evaluate whether the ability to assess fitness for intensive chemotherapy can be improved by [CONTACT_314981] -related mortal ity (TRM) score that includes additional (co -
9759  
Page 25/38  
 morbidity) factors, and to compare the ability of physicians of the prediction algorithm(s) and 
physician to assess the likelihood of early death  
3) Estimate differences between patients treated with lower -inten sity G -CLAM and those 
treated with higher -intensity G -CLAM with regard to anti -leukemic efficacy (response, 
duration of response) and survival, QOL, and medical resource utilization as well as care cost  
 
Importantly, t his trial is not powered to detect statistically significant differences between the 
study arms for these clinically important endpoints. Rather, the primary goal is to estimate outcomes with both treatment intensities to inform a subsequent larger study, sho uld follow -
up investigation appear warranted.

neg CR. 
 
We will use our ongoing clinical trial using a CPX -351 in medically less fit  adults with AML or 
high-grade MDS will provide “historical” control data for both inefficacy and early mortality. In this trial (FHCRC #2642.00), which used essentially identically inclusion/exclusion criteria, we 
have so far treated 37 subjects at a CPX -351 dose of 32 units/m
2. Among these, 8 patients 
achieved an MRDneg CR (22%). Ten patients (27%) died within 28 days of treatment initiation; 
at least [ADDRESS_387661] stage, 10 patients will be accrued  to each arm, either in a randomized or non-
randomized fashion. Each arm will be evaluated separately for early death and inefficacy  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] . Accrual may temporarily be held while outcome data on these patients matures. . 
As some patient s may  choose  to not be randomized, the 2 treatment arms  may be evaluated at a 
different time point for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
1) Lower -dose Arm:  After [ADDRESS_387662] been accrued to the lower -dose arm , we will 
evaluate for early death and inefficacy.  
Early death: If the number of early deaths is 5 or higher, accrual will stop with the conclusion that the arm is too toxic for further randomizatio n. If the true early mortality 
rate is 30% or less, the probability of observing 5 or more early mortality events is 15%.  
Inefficacy: If there are [ADDRESS_387663]
neg CR, accrual will stop with the conclusion 
that the arm is not efficacious enough for further randomization. If the true MRDneg CR 
rate is 22%, the probability of observing 0 MRDneg CRs in 10 patients is 8%.  
2) Higher -dose Arm:  After [ADDRESS_387664] been accrued to the higher dose arm, we will 
evaluate for early death and inefficacy.  
9759  
Page 26/38  
 Earl y death: If the number of early deaths is 5 or higher, accrual will stop with the 
conclusion that the arm is too toxic for further randomization. If the true early mortality 
rate is 30% or less, the probability of observing 5 or more early mortality events  is 15%.  
Inefficacy: If there are 0 patients with MRDneg CR, accrual will stop with the conclusion 
that the arm is not efficacious enough for further randomization. If the true MRDneg CR 
rate is 22%, the probability of observing 0 MRDneg CRs in 10 patients is 8%.  
Between -arm monitoring for efficacy and early mortality  
After enrollment of  at least 10 patients in each arm  (at which point one arm may have more than 
10 patients accrued due to slower accrual in one arm), we will compare the two arms for relative mortality and efficacy. I f, based on Fisher’s exact test , the early mortality rate is significantly 
higher in one arm at the alpha =10% level ( this criterion will be met if, for exa mple, both arms 
have accrued 10 patients one arm has 0 early mortality events and the other arm has 4), accrual 
will stop in that arm with the conclusion that the arm with the higher early mortality rate is too 
toxic for further randomization. In addition, if based on Fisher’s exact test, the MRD
neg CR rate 
is significantly higher in one arm compared to the other at the alpha = 10% level (for example, 
this criterion will be met  if both arms have accrued 10 patients and one arm has 2 MRDneg CRs 
and the other has 7), the accrual will stop  in that arm  with the conclusion that the arm with the 
lower MRDneg CR rate is not efficacious enough for further randomization.  
 If accrual does not  stop in both arm s, up to a total of [ADDRESS_387665] a slight male predominance of the disease as well as the general demographic distribution of AML patients seen at our institution. Up to 50 patients with newly diagnosed AML or analogous high-grad e neoplasms will be enrolled in this study .

flip” decide whether lower - or higher- intensity chemotherapy is used. We also want to 
understand how you made this decision, and why. Please answer the following questions:  
 
 
1) Preference for treatment assignment  
After thinking about this study and discussing it with your doctor(s), how do you prefer to be 
treated?  
 
  I am willing to let a coin flip ( i.e. computer program) decide whether I receive lower - 
or higher intensity chemotherapy  
 
  I would like to make the decision whether I receive lower - or higher-intensity 
chemotherapy myself  
 
             My preference is to receive lower- intensity chemotherapy  
 
             My preference is to receive higher -intensity chemotherapy  
  2) How did you make this decision?  
  I made the final decision about which treatment I would receive  
 
  I made the final decision of my treatment after seriously considering my doctor's 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_314976] I decided together which treatment is best for me  
 
  My doctor made the decision after seriously considering my opi[INVESTIGATOR_314977] I would receive

 APPENDIX E: PHYSICIAN PREFERENCE FOR TREATMENT 
ASSIGNMENT  SURVEY 
We are conducting a study to better understand whether patients and their doctors are 
comfortable letting a “coin flip” decide whether lower - or higher- intensity chemotherapy is used. 
We would like to ask you two questions about your preference for treatment assignment and which factors are important for making this decision. It should take about [ADDRESS_387672] Karen Hansen, Director of the Institutional Review Office, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, at [PHONE_6605].  
 
 
1) Preference for treatment assignment  
After thinking about this study and discussing it with the patient,  how do you prefer for the 
patient to be treated.  
 
  I am willing to randomize the patient to lower - or higher intensity chemotherapy and 
they agree  
 
  I am willing to randomize the patient to lower - or higher intensity chemotherapy but 
the patient would prefer to choose treatment themselves and they chose : 
 
             Lower -intensity chemotherapy  
 
             Higher-intensity chemotherapy  
 
  Neither I nor the patient want to proceed with randomization and the following 
person chose the treatment arm:  
 
    Myself  
 
             The patient  
 
2) Which factors were most important for you in making this decision?  
 
  The patient did not want to be randomized (did not like the idea of a “coin flip”)  
 
  The patient thought one treatment  arm was better than another  
 
  I thought one treatment arm was better than another  
9759  
Page 37/38  
  
  I thought the patient was too frail/unfit for the higher intensity treatment and that this  
  arm would be too toxic  
 
  I was concerned the lower intensity arm would not be effica cious enough

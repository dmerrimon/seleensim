SPECIFIC AIMS 
Concisely state the objectives of th e study and the hypothe sis being tested. 
 
The overall goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_812605] (n=270) about Version 
2 of a smartphone app we designed to  support smoking cessation.  Feedback 
will be collected via passively collected  smartphone app usage data, surveys 
and, in a sub-sample (n=20), onlin e video-conference user feedback 
sessions.  Results will be used to gu ide the design of Version 3.0 of the 
“Smiling Instead of Smokin g” (SiS) smartphone app.  Specifically, our aims 
are to: 
(1) Assess ease-of-use and helpfulness of the app, as rated by [CONTACT_812618] 6 weeks after their chosen smoking cessation date  
(2) Test if within-person changes o ccur in theorized mechanisms of 
behavior change as nondaily sm okers undergo a SiS app assisted 
quit attempt 
(3) Identify app features in need of  improvement, as identified by 
[CONTACT_812619], REDCap op en-ended survey 
items, and, in a sub-sample, us er feedback sessions (n=20) 
 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
Provide a brief paragraph su mmarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, 2014    2  The prevalence of smoking has remain ed stable in recent years, yet 
nondaily smoking (22% of all adult sm okers) is an increasingly prevalent 
smoking pattern (30% increase in  less than two decades). It is 
disproportionally represented in ethnic mi nority groups.  The cancer risk of 
nondaily smoking is substantial (40-50 % of that seen in daily smokers).  
Existing treatments are ill-suited for nondaily smoking, because they are 
based on nicotine dependence, and tr aditional treatments and treatment 
modalities (e.g., in-person counseling, medication) do not appeal to non-
dependent nondaily smokers.  Moreov er, cross-sectional, naturalistic and 
laboratory studies have shown that nondaily smoking differs from daily 
smoking on numerous important dimensions related to smoking cessation, suggesting the need for specialized smoking cessation support for this 
population of smokers.  Fortuitously, nondaily smokers are motivated to quit 
smoking, even more so than daily smok ers.  Like daily smokers, however, 
they overwhelmingly fail in their quit attempts, demonstrating their need for 
smoking cessation support.  Treatm ents that target the unique 
characteristics of nondaily smoking are sorely needed.   
To address this need, we are in the process of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a smartphone 
app that acts as a behavioral, in-t he-pocket coach and uses positive 
psychology exercises to enhance quitting success.  Treatment via smartphone app is promising given the demonstrated effectiveness of 
texting interventions.  It is particular ly appealing because it is anonymous, 
portable, and provides just-in-time  support, an important feature for 
smokers who smoke under specific co nditions and circumstances.  To 
support treatment, we use a positive ps ychology approach.  Positive affect 
enhancement is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_812606]: positive affect is 
psychometrically and neurologically dist inct from negative affect, and plays 
an important role in the days leading up to and following a quit attempt.  
Enhancing positive affect with brief, self-administered exercises is entirely 
feasible: in recent years, a large num ber of positive psychology exercises 
have been developed that have cons istently led to improvements in 
happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], reductions in depression, and improvements in overall well-being.  
The smartphone app administers such positive psychology exercises to 
enhance and/or maintain positive affect , which is hypothesized to stimulate 
nondaily smokers to enact healthier al ternatives to smoking by [CONTACT_812620]-action repertoire, increasing confidence, and decreasing craving and defensiveness about smokin g-related health information (Figure 
1).  The focus on happi[INVESTIGATOR_812607], as the 
pursuit of happi[INVESTIGATOR_812608]-stigmatizing.  To this 
end, we have worked closely with nondaily smokers in Study 1 (#2017P001106) to develop Version 2 of our “Smiling Instead of Smoking” 
app.  In the current study (i.e., Study 2 in a series of 3 studies funded by 
[CONTACT_9422] (130323-RSG-17-021-01-CPPB)), we will conduct a larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_812609] 2.  Study [ADDRESS_1125322] of Version 3 of this app.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollm ent, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_584014].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gende r, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrol lment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
An estimated  270 participants will pa rticipate (i.e., sign consent) in 
this study based on the following eligib ility criteria: (a) 18+ years of age, (b) 
smartphone ownership (c) current nond aily smoker, who smokes at least 
weekly, and no more than [ADDRESS_1125323] 30 days (i.e., 71% of nondaily 
smokers), (d) has current quit intentio n (i.e., 65-74% of nondaily smokers), 
and (e) interested in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_812610] a smartphone app for smoking 
cessation.  We will stop enrollment when n=[ADDRESS_1125324] completed the primary endpoint of the study, whic h is the 6-week follow-up.  Our study 
will be conducted entirely remotely an d will require a screening process prior 
to enrolling participants on the app.  Based on our experience in Study 1 
(#2017P001106), we expect that 1/3 of pa rticipants who initially provide 
consent will pass the screening process and be retained for the 6-week 
follow-up.  Thus, we are estimating that n=270 will be necessary to sign the initial consent for this study in or der for n=[ADDRESS_1125325] rictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of  the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
                                                                       

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1125326] 6 
months, where surveys will be administered prior to the quit day (online, as part of a screening test), and at 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month 
follow-ups of the 
participant’s chosen quit day (Figure 2).  Participants will use the app for a strongly encouraged period of 7 weeks (1 week before, 6 weeks 
following the quit attempt), and op tional continued use thereafter.  
Participants will complete two types of assessment: (1) surveys, and (2) 
(in a sub-sample) user feedback sessio ns conducted via Skype.  Potential 
participants will click-through to the st udy website.  This website will explain 
that participants must call study staff in order to be phone-screened and to 
participate in the study.  During th e phone-screen, participants will be 
directed to complete an online surve y via REDCap.  Within the survey, 
participants will be asked if they woul d be willing to participate in an online 
video-conference user feedback session after they have used the app for seven weeks ([ADDRESS_1125327]  their chosen smoking quit day).  
Participation in the user feedback sessio n is optional. Participants will receive 
survey links for 2-week, 6-week, 3-mo nth and 6-month follow-ups via an 
emailed link.  If selected for the onlin e user feedback sessions (selected at 
random from interested participants),  participants will receive an email 
and/or phone call upon completing thei r 6-week survey to set up the user 
feedback session. 
The online user feedback sessions (n= 20) will consist of the participants, 
and 1-2 members of the study staff.  Relatively little guidance will be 
provided in this setting.  Instead, 4 open-ended questions will be posed (i.e., 
did the app help you in your quit attemp t?  What did you like?  What did you 
dislike?  How could the app be improv ed?).  All conference calls will be 
video-recorded for later analysis.    
Sample size and Power Considerations: The primary goal of this study is 
to gather qualitative input rather than data to detect a pre-specified effect.  
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_812611], without the benefit of in-
person interaction, which is closer to  the real-world experience potential 
users would have than the participants in  Study 1.   Thus, to identify issues 
not identified within the smaller sample  in Study 1, we tripled the sample 
size of the current study, Study 2.

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, 2014    5  Aim 1 (Ease-of-use and usefulness).  To assess the degree to which SiS 
Version [ADDRESS_1125328] deviations  for the survey items querying ease 
of use and usefulness for each feature of the app.   
Aim 2 (Within-person changes).  To test if nondaily smokers utilizing SiS 
Version [ADDRESS_1125329] (i.e., desire to 
smoke, mood, self-efficacy to quit /stay quit, motivation), where the 
construct will be the dependent variab le, and time (0=baseline, 1=2-week, 
2=6-week, 3=3-month, 4=6-month) will be the predictor. Correlations over 
time will be modeled with an unstructu red covariance matrix.  A contrast 
statement will be used to compare ba seline versus follow-up.  Given the 
explorative nature of this study, we w ill not correct for multiple testing.   
Aim 3 (Identify app features in need  of improvement).  To identify 
features of the app that are in need  of improvement, we will examine the 
passively generated app usage data as  nondaily smokers enrolled in our 
study undergo their quit attempts, and will generate descriptive summary statistics on these usage data.  To gain  deeper insight, we will also conduct 
user feedback sessions with a randomly selected subsample of participants.   
 
 
 
For studies involving treatment or  diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedur es, or methods of diagnosis.
 
Not applicable. 
 
 
Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by  [CONTACT_584019].
 
Risks are expected to be minimal, an d include breach of confidentiality, 
subject discomfort form answering ques tions about smoking, and discomfort 
from quitting smoking (see below).  We will minimize these risks by 
[CONTACT_812621]-compliant electronic 
data capture processes, assuring part icipants that they do not need to 
answer any questions they do not want to answer, and by [CONTACT_812622].   
 
Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safe ty of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, fo r example, objective criteria fo r worsening disease/lack of 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, 2014    6  improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
A subject will be removed from the study if he or she no longer wishes to 
participate for any reason.  A subject may also be removed from the study 
by [CONTACT_978], if he or she cannot comply with study procedures (e.g., responds 
incorrectly to survey check items,  cannot install the app on his/her 
smartphone) or causes undue distress to study staff (e.g., becomes belligerent towards study staff).  
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
Provide a brief description of a ny foreseeable risks and discomfort s to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being stud ied and/or administered/ performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosoc ial risks, and risks re lated to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicab le, describe risks to a develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
Potential Risks: Participation will la st 6 months, where surveys will be 
administered at enrollment, 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-
up.  Participants will use the app for a strongly encouraged period of 7 
weeks (1 week before, 6 weeks followi ng the quit attempt), and optional 
continued use thereafter.  Additional tasks are potential participation in online video-conference user feedback se ssions, as summarized in Figure 2.  
As such, the potential risks in the st udy are considered minimal and include 
(1) potential discomfort related to completing questionnaires about 
potentially sensitive information such as smoking, (2) potential breach of 
confidentiality and/or privacy, and (3) potential discomfort in quitting 
smoking (i.e., withdrawal symptoms, craving, etc.).  
 Protection Against Risks: For the po ssibility of subjective discomfort from 
answering questions, any distress will be  minimized by [CONTACT_812623] y question that they do not feel 
comfortable addressing and that they may withdraw from the study at any 
time without penalty.  To protect agai nst breach of confidentiality, we will 
assign a numeric study ID to each pa rticipant, which will be the primary 
identifier by [CONTACT_9449]’s prog ress through the trial will be reviewed.  
The database linking names and study id entification numbers will be kept in 
a separate password protected file.  Only  study staff will have access to this 
database.  All staff are or will be fully trained in relevant ethical principles 
and procedures, including confidential ity.  All assessment and treatment 
procedures will be closely supervised by  [CONTACT_978].  Most of the data will be 
captured electronically.  Fo r surveys and data entry by [CONTACT_464], we will be 
using Partners implementation of REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture) https://redcap.partners.org , which is a secure, web-based 
application designed to support data ca pture for research studies, and which 
is fully compliant with HIPAA-Security guidelines. The data generated by [CONTACT_812624]-built app (i.e., app usage data) will be kept on secure 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, 2014    7  servers behind a firewall within the Partners network.  The app will be 
hosted by [CONTACT_9451]/Partners servers.  All data collected through the app will be transmitted using Transport La yer Security (TLS) encryption to 
prevent eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_812612].  Finally, the Skype user feedback sessions will be 
video-recorded in Skype, and summary information will be entered by [CONTACT_812625]’s REDCap databa se.  All Skype correspondences are 
transmitted using the Advanced Encrypti on Standard (AES) if both users are 
using Skype accounts (i.e., the participant is not Skypi[INVESTIGATOR_52857] a landline or 
mobile telephone number). Thus, we will require that all participants taking 
place in the user feedback sessions will use a Skype account to ensure 
security.  Screen recordings of the user  feedback sessions will be stored in a 
shared folder on secure  MGH servers that only study personnel will have 
access to.  All data for all participants  will be kept strictly confidential, 
except as mandated by [CONTACT_2371].  Regardin g the potential discomfort in quitting 
smoking, participants will receive inform ation about how to alleviate cravings 
as part of their study participation.   Given that study participants are 
nondaily smokers, who regularly abst ain from smoking for several days, 
these discomforts are expe cted to be minimal. 
 
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS 
Describe both the expected benef its to individual subjects partic ipating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be  expected to result fro m the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of pot ential benefits to s ubjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human phys iology or behavior, 
improved safety, or t echnological advances. 
 
Potential Benefits:   All participants will receiv e behavioral counseling and 
smoking cessation resource information as  part of their study participation.  
They will also engage in positive psyc hology exercises designed to increase 
positive affect to support smoking cess ation.  Consequently, participants in 
this study may quit smoking as a result  of their participation, which would 
have a positive impact on their health .  Furthermore, study participation will 
provide generalizable knowledge about the process of smoking cessation in 
nondaily smokers, which can be used to guide the development of further 
treatments to support smoking cessati on in this growing population of 
smokers.    
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
The risks and benefits of the re search must be fairly  distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, fo r example, men, women, pr egnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded  from the research without a good scientific or 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1125330] an interpreter present.
 
We will exclude people who do not speak English, because the app we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_812613].  Moreov er, several of the 
scales we will be administering in the online surveys are only available in 
English. 
 
For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:

English_Speaking_Subjects.1.10.pdf
 
 
RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES 
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_812626].  Include any speci fic recruitment methods used to  enhance recruitment of women 
and minorities.
 
We will use both commercial advertis ing (e.g., Facebook) and grass-root 
efforts (e.g., Craigslist, quit smoking forums).  We will use stratified enrollment to ensure that our final sample will (a) be equally balanced 
between men and women, and (b) refl ect national prevalence rates of 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  October 15, 2014    9  nondaily smoking in terms of ethnici ty and race, where we will enroll no 
more than 54% non-Hispanic White pa rticipants, as per the 2014 National 
Health Interview Survey (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhi s/nhis_2014_data_release.htm ), which shows 
that 54% of nondaily smokers are non-Hispanic White.   
 
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable .  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case th at extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconvenien ces will result in additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigat ors may wish to consider pr oviding reimbursement for such 
expenses when funding is available
 
Participants will be remunerated acco rding to the following remuneration

CONSENT PROCEDURES 
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_584030], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studi es involving investigational dr ugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed  consent.  When subjects ar e to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients,  describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
During the phone screen, research staf f will provide an overview of the 
study, and will answer any questions part icipants may have about the study.  
If deemed eligible after the phone screen, study staff will send participants a 
link to the online baseline survey, which co ntains an electronic consent form.  
Additionally, study staff will also email a pdf copy of the online consent form 
to participants, and direct them to th e HarvardScholar website that provides 
this information in written format, so that prospective participants have an 
opportunity to review the consent form at  leisure, prior to encountering it as 
the first page on the REDCap survey.  This is the same process we have 
used to obtain informed consent for a remote-only longitudinal study on the 
use of the texting intervention Smokef reeTXT to support smoking cessation 
in nondaily smokers (protocol # 2016P002555). The online consent form will 
outline the nature of the st udy, risks and benefits to participation, details on 
remuneration for participation, and how to contact [CONTACT_9436] [INVESTIGATOR_812614] (see atta ched).  Participants must click “I 
agree to participate in this study”  to proceed to the baseline survey.

in the development and admini stration of the plan.   
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators will meet  weekly on the project, at which 
time they will evaluate the progress of  the trial, review data quality, 
recruitment, and study retention, and examine other factors that may affect 
outcome.  They will review the rates of adverse events to determine any 
changes in participant risk.  A brief re port will be generated annually for the 
study record and forwarded to Massachus etts General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Institutional 
Review Board.  The Investigators will be available to meet outside of the 
weekly meetings, if necessary, due to  concerns regarding a particular 
participant or any problems that may arise for participants.  If necessary, 
they will make appropriate recommendatio ns for changes in protocol.  Dr. B. 
Hoeppner will conduct daily oversight of  participant safety.  She will meet 
weekly with staff to review  participant progress.   
 
Describe the plan to be followe d by [CONTACT_079]/st udy staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_584032] r his/her care, and when appli cable, for review of sponsor 
safety reports and DSMB reports.  Describe the plan for reporti ng adverse events to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, fo r submitting sponsor safe ty reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  Wh en the investigator is  also the sponsor of the IND/IDE, include 
the plan for reporting of adverse events to the FDA and, when applicable , to investigators at 
other sites.

 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
Describe methods used to protect the privacy of  subjects and maintain confidentiality of data 
collected.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] s such practices as substituting codes for names and/or medical 
record numbers; removing face sheets or other identifiers from completed 
surveys/questionnaires; proper disposal of prin ted computer data; limi ted access to study data; 
use of password-protected comput er databases; training for res earch staff on the importance of 
confidentiality of data, a nd storing research records in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when th e research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, cri minal or illegal behaviors.
 
To protect the privacy of each particip ant, we will assign a numeric study ID 
to each participant, which will be the primary identifier by [CONTACT_812627]’s progress through the trial will be reviewed.  The database linking names and study identification numbers will be kept in a password protected file.  Only study staff will have access to this database.  All staff are or will 
be fully trained in relevant ethical principles and procedures, including

Why is this research being done?
The purpose of this research study is to test the ease of use and usefulness of a smartphone app we developed to
support nondaily smokers in quitting smoking.  This is the second study in a series of three studies, and will involve
90 participants.  The American Cancer Society (ACS) is paying for the study to be done.
We are asking you to participate in this study, because we would like you try out Version 2.[ADDRESS_1125333]: 
1. Complete an online baseline survey (this one), which will contain five randomly placed check-questions.  For these
items, we will ask you to respond in a specific fashion.  For example, a question may read "Please answer 'not at all
confident.'"  You will need to click the bubble or move the slider to indicate "not at all confident" to answer this
question correctly.  We are inserting these check-items in the survey to make sure you are reading the survey
carefully, and are comfortable with using the buttons and sliders to indicate your responses.  You must answer these
items correctly in order to qualify for the study.
2. Provide contact [CONTACT_812629] (e.g., family members, friends) who can assist research staff in
locating you for follow-up assessments.  We will contact [CONTACT_812630].  We
will tell them that you are participating in a study tracking health behaviors.  Your two contacts must confirm they
are willing to serve in this role.
3. Provide your social security number and mailing address to enable us to pay you by [CONTACT_9434].  Our home institution,
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], requires payment by [CONTACT_812631].
What will happen in this research study?
- Pass the screening test (as explained above)
- Choose your smoking cessation quit day
- Complete a 20 minutes phone call with us 1 week prior to your chosen quit day.  In preparation of this call, we will
email you a how-to guide for using the SiS app, which you can consult at your leisure.  During the phone call, we will
walk you through downloading, installing, and using the app, including scheduling your quit day in the app.  
- Use the app for 7 weeks, 1 week prior to your quit day, and 6 weeks after your quit day.  App use involves the
completion of daily happi[INVESTIGATOR_9403], logging the cigarettes you smoke as you smoke them, and completing 1-2
"challenges" each week that are designed to keep you on track with quitting smoking for good.
- Complete 4 more online surveys (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after your quit day).  The 6-week
survey will be longer than the other surveys, as we will provide you with summary information on your app use, and
will ask you specific questions about your app use. 
- (Optional) Participate in a user feedback session with study staff via Skype to talk further about your experience
using our app.  This Skype session will occur 6 weeks after your chosen quit day.
What are the risks and/or benefits of this research study?
There are two risks in participating in this study:
- Subjective discomfort from answering our questions: please rest assured that you may skip any question you are
uncomfortable answering, with the exception of check-items. 
- Breach of confidentiality:  we believe this risk to be minimal, because we are collecting data via technologies that
are fully HIPAA compliant, and because our study staff is properly trained about the critical importance of
confidentiality and in human research subjects' protection.  
There are two benefits to participating in this study:
- You will receive smoking cessation support as part of your participation in this study, and thus, you may be able to
quit smoking.   Quitting smoking would have a substantial positive impact on your health!
- Your study participation will provide generalizable knowledge about the process of smoking cessation in nondaily
smokers, which can be used to guide the development of further treatments to support smoking cessation in
nondaily smokers.

Will I be remunerated for my study participation?
Yes.  You will be remunerated to a total of up to $195.  For each online survey you complete, you will receive $25,
unless you miss one of our check items.  In that case, you will receive $10.  The 6-week survey is longer, as it
contains information about your app usage.  You will receive an additional $25 for answering these questions about
your app usage.  You will also receive compensation for taking the time for the 20min (or so) phone call occurring 1
week prior to your quit attempt, during which we will walk you through downloading, installing and using the app. 
Finally, if you complete the Skype user feedback session after finishing app usage, you will receive an additional
compensation of $25.   The Skype user feedback session is optional, and will only be completed with some of the
participants.  We will select participants for these feedback sessions at random, selected from those participants who
would like to participate. 
To pay you, we will mail you checks to your US mailing address.  For that, we will need to know your social security
number, as we are required to keep a record of research remuneration amounts for tax purposes, if the remuneration
exceeds $50, as it does in this study.  
We will mail you checks after you complete each online survey (i.e., screening, 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after your quit
date) and right after you complete the Skype user feedback session.  Please note that it takes approximately [ADDRESS_1125334] received your survey, checked the check items, and requested our accounting department to mail out the
check to you.
What else do I need to know?
We are required by [CONTACT_154213] (HIPAA) to protect the privacy of health
information obtained for research. This is an abbreviated notice, and does not describe all details of this requirement.
 During this study, identifiable information about you or your health will be collected and shared with the researchers
conducting the research.  In general, under federal law, identifiable health information is private. However, there are
exceptions to this rule. In some cases, others may see your identifiable health information for purposes of research
oversight, quality control, public health and safety, or law enforcement. We share your health information only when
we must, and we ask anyone who receives it from us to protect your privacy.

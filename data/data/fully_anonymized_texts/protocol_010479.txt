Tracheal intubation of infants and children is a critical lifesaving skill, and its importance is 
recognized by [CONTACT_253533] (ACGME), Residency 
Review Committee (RRC), the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and Pediatric Advanced 
Life Support (PALS) programs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_253529], current training is lacking in teaching this 
critical pro cedural skill as demonstrated by [CONTACT_253534] 1/3 of upper level Pediatric 
residents to be able to successfully intubate  Very Low Birth  Weight (VLBW, <1500 grams) 
neonates . New technology, which has now been adapted to the existing telemedicine n etwork in 
Arkansas, offers an exciting opportunity to improve the ability of pediatric trainees to accomplish 
this critical task. We will utilize a deliberate  practice approach with immediate feedback during 
neonatolog y rotations using the Storz video  laryngoscope to teach this critical skill to Pediatric 
and Med -Peds residents (n=95 residents total). Previous work demonstrated improvement in 
skills with a manikin, but it is unknown if these skills will translate to live intubations. The 
residents will rece ive training during alternating months, and will be recorded during live 
intubations. We will assess how intubation skills using a manikin translates to live patients. We 
anticipate this training will dramatically improve i ntubation skills and  resident confidence as 
evidenced  by [CONTACT_253535] . 
 
 
Project Narrative  
 
Background and Significance  
Tracheal intubation is one of the most important interventions in the stabilization of critically ill or 
injured children.  Advanced airway skills training is one of the major pi[INVESTIGATOR_253530] n (Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education, 2007) .  The pediatric airway presents unique anatomic challenges 
depending on the patient age, size and underlying condition.  These challenges, coupled with 
low frequency of pediatric trainee exposure to advanced airway management, make tracheal 
intubation procedural competency difficult to achieve.  As a result, tracheal intubation in  infants 
and children is associated with high levels of operator stress as well as patient morbidity and 
mortality.1-[ADDRESS_308415] management in selected environments including the ope rating room, 
delivery room and Neonatal Intensive Care U nit (NICU).3-[ADDRESS_308416] , with 1/3 of upper level pediatric residents unable to intubate 
a very low birth weight (<1500 grams) neonate.5,7,8 The RRC agreed that neonatal intubation is 
a critical skill, but respondents to a survey sent to Residency Program Directors determined that 
“many residents do not develop competence in that area” and that a  “more robust and 
standardized method is needed for teach ing procedural skills and for documenting

 competence”.9 A survey of pediatric emergency room directors foun d that the number of 
intubations necessary to maintain skill in this area was inadequate.10 Even mo re concerning is 
that procedural skills such as intubation deteriorate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_75763] (within the first year).[ADDRESS_308417] that the training of pediatric residents is not sufficient prior to “live” tracheal 
intubations i n the critical care setting.  The  current one to two days of airway mana gement 
training as a part of resuscitation training (such as PALS or NRP) is not sufficient to provide safe 
intubation skills.  A new approach to the instruction of tracheal intubation is needed for pediatric 
trainees, to decrease adverse events and to imp rove patient safety.12  One approach would be 
to develop and implement tracheal intubation training using concepts of deliberate practice 
modeled after Ericsson . The concepts include focused training o n a specific task, immediate 
feedback, time for problem solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated 
perform ance .13,14  All pediatric residents will be required  to meet a pre -set training goal 
(intubating a manikin consistently within 15 seconds , half the time allowed by [CONTACT_253536] ) in a 
simulation setting  with intense, repeated training with feedback.  This proposal is an attempt to 
develop such a training model.     
 
Video  laryngoscopy offers a potential solution to the problem of intubation training, because it 
allows the educator to actually “see” what the trainee is seeing with the laryngoscope. Although 
this mode of intubation has been used for some time with adult laryngoscopy, the technology 
has only recently been adapted for neonatal an d pediatric use. One recent study found 
satisfaction with the proposed equipment, but patients were not randomized and its use in 
training has not been studied.[ADDRESS_308418] determine if this improvement translates 
into improved intubation skill in live patients.  
 
 
Hypothesis and/or Specific Aims or Objectives  
 
Specific Aim 1. Assess the impact of this educational manikin intervention on live patients.  
 
We hypothesize learners in the Intervention G roup vs. the Control  Group will have enhanced 
success  in intubation  as determined by [CONTACT_253537].  
 
Specific Aim 2. Assess the satisfaction of this educational intervention and equipment.  
 
We hypothesize pediat ric residents will have increased  satisfaction scores  and confidence for 
intubating live patients  in the Intervention Group vs. the Control  Group.  
 
Specific Aim 3. Assess the association of confidence in intubation with actual success in 
intubation . 
 
We hypothesize increased confidence wi ll be associated with increased intubation  success .

The target audience will be Pediatric and Med -Peds residents. Total n = 95 potential 
participants  
 
Methods  
 
This research study will include 95 resident physicians. We anticipate 80 residents will enroll , 
similar to our previous study in which 82 residents participated . Residents  will be randomized to 
the Intervention Group or the Control  Group . This study will be explained to potential  
participants as they begin their  assigned rotation to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 
The explanation of the study and the Information Sheet will be introduced  during the first five (5) 
days of this rotation.  Residents will be allowed to ask any questions they feel necessary a nd 
take as much time as needed  in order to m ake a fully informed  voluntary consent. It will be 
explained that their participation in this study is completely voluntary and a decision to not 
participate will have no impact on their training or standing in the residency program. 
Randomization will occur by [CONTACT_253538] . 
 
All participants will:  
 
• Receive NRP training and certification  offered at the beginning of their residency  
• Complete a Baseline  Survey  
• Complete a Baseline Cognitive and Simulation Assessment  
• Have a Stabilization Room video recording  as part of the quality improvement process 
for neonatal resuscitation  
• Complete a Cogni tive and Simulation Assessment at the end of the month  
• Complete a n End of Rotation  Survey  
 
Residen ts wh o are randomized to the I ntervention Group  will, in addition : 
 
• Observe a 7 minute NRP video  
• Complete a hands -on intubation simulation with [CONTACT_38845] instructing : 
o Using state of the art technology, a Storz C -MAC video  laryngoscope  
o Identifying anatomical landmarks  
o Practice  on the manikin until intubation occurs within 15 seconds  
 
During the monthly rotation of each resident, ongoing data will be collecte d on the residents’ 
ability to successfully intubate on the first attempt , the total number of attempts to intubate , and 
the total number of successful  attempts at intubating  a neonate  within [ADDRESS_308419] access to start/stop

 recording as well as status an d duration of recording. Recording will default to t hree (3) hour 
durations and can be extended from the control panel. All recordings will be managed by a 
video recording server and stored on network accessible server storage space. All videos will be 
labeled by [CONTACT_568], time and bed space at which the recording took place. Staff can then log into 
the server and review videos to ensure proper intubation procedures have been followed and to 
improve training methods.  
 
Below is a technical workflow diagram:  
 
 
1. User accesses control panel to select camera at bed space. Control panel sends signal  
    to recording server to start recording on requested camera.  
2. Recording server requests video from camera.  
3. Camera starts sending video and audio data to record ing server.  
4. Recording server stores video and audio data on video storage server.  
5. Staff can then access recorded data directly from the video storage server.

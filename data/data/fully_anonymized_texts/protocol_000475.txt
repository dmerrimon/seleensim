Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1281137] Title: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_912061]:  Dan Matl ock, MD  
Version Date:  01/08/19        
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :   
The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912062] (PtDA).  
 
Aim 1:  Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_912063] a diverse 
population of older adults at multiple stages of illness and in two health care settings (an academic medical center and a county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619]) using a mixed- methods approach.  
 
Aim 2:  Determine the preliminary efficacy of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912064], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912065], and values -concordance.  
 II. Background and Significance :  
Although hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912066] [ADDRESS_1281138] payers cover hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249]. S ome believe that enrolling in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912067], despi[INVESTIGATOR_847398] 80% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912068].
1-3 For some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912069] “giving up”, 
even though evidence suggests that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912070] a sense of hope, 
relief, and improved quality of life.4-6 Finally, people report concerns that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912071], 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_912072].5,7-10 To understand how to address 
these mis conceptions, we performed a qualitative needs assessment with patients, caregivers and 
healthcare providers. We found, in addition to the aforementioned misunderstandings, that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912073]. Caregivers expressed regret for not knowing 
of and not enrolling in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912074]. The patient decision aid (PtDA) being studied in this application is designed specifically to address these 
misperceptions of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912075].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_912076], less than [ADDRESS_1281139] of all hosp ice users spend less than 
7 days receiving care.2 Approximately 40% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries die enrolled in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. In other words, almost two- thirds of eligible patients do not benefit from the documented 
advantages of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]. Raci al and ethnic minority patients account for only 15% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912077].2,[ADDRESS_1281140] several years with little more 50% enrolling in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].
14 The reasons for underutilization are complex but include knowledge barriers 
and misunderstandings about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912078],15-17 cultural beliefs 
about death,18-20 lower health literacy in older adults and minorities,21-23 physician gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_912079],16 and disparities in ac cess to quality healthcare.15,18,19,24  
The absence of quality shared decision making (SDM) and of quality patient -centered care 
is a disparity highlighted by [CONTACT_120845].[ADDRESS_1281141] of patient -centered care.26 One strategy to support SDM is utilizing PtDAs which 
engage patients in the process of decision making by [CONTACT_912092]/or 
treatment options.28,29 PtDAs assume various forms including paper (e.g. leaflets, pamphlets, and 
booklets), electronic media (e.g. audio recordings, videos) and web- based interactive portals.[ADDRESS_1281142], 
Protocol #18-0173                                                                  Page 2                                                                PI: [INVESTIGATOR_912080] -provider communication, and increased patient involvement in medical decision 
making.30 Video PtDAs are effective in older patients and patients with lower literacy and 
numeracy.31-33 Critical to PtDAs is the presentation of balanced, evidence- based, accurate, neutral 
and unbiased information to patients.30,34 
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
We conducted and extensive qualitative needs assessment and environmental scan of 
available h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_209897]. Though the needs assessment we interviewed 5 patients, 20 
caregivers and 27 providers (e.g. social workers, nurses, chaplains) regarding their perceptions of participating in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. In the preliminary analyses, we found that all par ticipant groups describe 
misunderstandings and myths regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209898]. 
Additionally, we learned that timing of introduction and initiating of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209899] a major theme 
across all participants. Hospic e is often presented as an option only when death is imminent. As a 
result, caregivers expressed regret for not being aware of or enrolling their loved ones in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209901].  
Our environmental scan found only [ADDRESS_1281143] all participants went to sites such as yelp to get narrative 
descriptions  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187621].

IV. Research  Methods  
A.  Outcome  Measure(s):   
Overview:  The goal of the project is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary 
efficacy of a novel  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912081]. We will achieve this goal through a series of quantitative 
surveys and through qualitative methods.  
 
Aim 1 . Feasibility and Acceptability Outcomes:  
Acceptability  of the decision aid will be measured using the Ottawa Acceptability Scale (OAS). The 
OAS scale consists of 8 questions on a 5- point Likert scale with additional yes/no questions.36 
Feasibility will be assessed asking patients when they viewed the decision aid, if the used the 
paper ver sion, the video version or both. We will also ask for input on the overall design and 
usefulness of the decision aid in facilitating their decisions.  
Aim 2. Preliminary Efficacy :  
Efficacy will be measured qualitatively and quantitatively through surveys.  We are trying to 
determine if the decision aid improves hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209895], decreases decisional conflict and 
improves self -efficacy.  
• Description of qualitative writing sample:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912082]. Matsuyama et al37 described a brief qualitative assessment 
in which participants are asked to describe “what is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]” in their words. Participants w ill 
provide their answers on paper. These brief writings will be analyzed using thematic 
content analysis.  
Protocol #18-0173                                                                  Page 3                                                                PI: [INVESTIGATOR_912083] 1. Recruitment  • Knowledge of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209907] : The Knowledge of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209908] a 23- item scale with 
true/false questions.1,38 The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the scale is 0.75 showing 
good internal reliability.  
• Decision Self -efficacy:  Is an 11- item instrument that one’s self -confidence in decision 
making. This scale is a validated scale with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 and correlates with 
DCS subscale of being informed (r=0.47). Based on our prior study of a decision aid in 
palliative care, we hypot hesize that one of the strongest effects of a decision aid might be 
to increase self -efficacy of the decision making.31   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209909] (HBAS) : The HBAS is an 8- item scale developed to 
measure beliefs and attitudes towards hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677].39 It has a Cronbach’s α = .74 for the 
scale, indicating a good degree of internal reliability . 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled :   
Patients:  Patients will be older adults age ≥[ADDRESS_1281144] one life- limiting illness or syndrome as 
defined by [CONTACT_47656].  
 
Exclusions: We will exclude patients who cannot speak English. In future work, we plan to make a 
Spanish version if this version is deemed  acceptable.  We will exclude patients with cognitive 
impairment as determined by [CONTACT_912093]. We will also exclude patients on 
isolation precautions due to resistant bacteria or impaired immune function.  
 
 
C. Study Design and Research  Methods    
Settings : For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will recruit fr om Denver Health Medical Center  and UCHealth. At each 
site, we will recruit patents from both the inpatient  and 
outpatient  palliative care services and the outpatient geriatric 
and primary care clinics.  In order to get perspectives on 
feasibility of the PtDA in populations at different places in their 
illness trajectory. We plan to recruit 120 patients ( Figure 1). 
Hundreds of patients each year who meet our eligibility criteria 
are served in each sett ing, so we will have no difficulty 
recruiting 20- 25 patients from each site/setting.  
 
Recruitment : Patients will be identified differently in each setting:  
• In the outpatient setting , potential patients will be identified through weekly chart reviews. 
The study team will communicate with the outpatient physician by [CONTACT_5657]/her preferred 
communication method ( e.g. email, phone) to determine whether the patients are appropriate 
to be approached. Reasons for non- approach will be recorded. If eligible and appropriate, a 
research team member will approach the patient and introduce the study following their clinical encounter.  
• In the inpatient settings,  the study team will speak with the palliative care teams twice a week 
to identify eligible patients who are currentl y being followed by [CONTACT_912094]. Then, a 
member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_912095]. If eligible  and appropriate, a research team member will approach the patient and 
introduce the study.  
 
Research Methods: This will be a patient -level trial randomized in a 2:1 intervention: control  (see 
figure 1 above).  
• Control - No PtDA: Patients assigned to the c ontrol group will receive usual care. On the 
palliative care service, this typi[INVESTIGATOR_232826] a team with a physician, an advanced practice nurse, and occasionally other team member including a chaplain or a social worker. This consultation typi[INVESTIGATOR_912084] a discussion of advanced directives, symptoms, and prognosis. 
In the primary care settings, this is more variable and is a function of the primary care 
physician’s practice and the patient’s clinical situation.  
Protocol #18-0173                                                                  Page 4                                                                PI: [INVESTIGATOR_912060]  
 • Intervention - PtDA:  In addition to usua l care, patients assigned to the intervention group will 
also be asked to view the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]- PtDA. In the inpatient setting, the PtDA can be utilized 
anytime in the course of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912085] a DVD player for the 
video). This could be before, during, or after the palliative care team consultation. In the 
outpatient setting, the patient will receive the PtDA after a clinic visit and will be allowed to take it home. In both settings, we have chosen a model with the PtDA delivery facilitated by 
[CONTACT_3647]. The staff will NOT sit with patients while they watch the PtDA, as to allow 
patients to declare their desired use without study staff influence.  
  
Data collection:  For patients who agree to participate, the study coordinator w ill collect baseline 
demographic and quantitative data (surveys described above in Section A). The research 
coordinator will then open the envelope to determine the patient’s allocation. Control patients will 
be asked to complete the baseline measures at t ime of enrollment and again at 1- month follow -up. 
Intervention patients will be given the decision aid and asked to review it within the next week . 
Then the best way to contact [CONTACT_476] 1 week  later will be recorded (for outpatients, this will likely be 
at home by [CONTACT_648], for inpatients, this will likely be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].) Then the baseline surveys will 
be administered again by [CONTACT_648]. Finally, each participant (control and intervention) will be 
contact[CONTACT_912096]. $ 25 gift cards will be given for baseline 
and one- month follow -up surveys.    
• Baseline visit (control & Intervention)-  All participants will be asked to complete the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Decisional Conflict Scale, Decision Self -efficacy scale, SPMSQ, 
HADSA, PH Q-9 and demographics .  
• 1 week  Follow -up call (intervention only)- Participants will be asked to complete the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Decisional Conflict scale, Decision Self -efficacy scale and brief 
qualitative survey .  
• One Month Follow -up (control & inter vention)- At one month follow -up all participants 
will be asked to complete the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Decisional Conflict scale and the 
Decision Self -efficacy scale.  
 
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools: 
The study team believes that this project poses minimal risk to all subjects involved. The 
intervention involves review of decisional support materials and a series of quantitative and qualitative questions.  Data collection from participants i ncludes questions and medical record 
review to screen for eligibility  and only limited demographic data will be obtained. Audio- recordings 
of all qualitative will be kept on a secure server on the University network to which only the study to 
will have acc ess. There is always a risk that participants may feel uncomfortable discussing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209920]- of-life decisions. P articipants will be informed of their right to refuse to answer any 
question they do not wish to answer, and may terminate participation in t he study at any point (and 
that shoul d they decline to participate, answer a question or withdraw this will not affect their 
medical care).   
Data collection and storage has been planned to appropriately protect participant 
confidentiality. All patients wil l be given a unique identification number, and study data and 
identifiable information will always be kept separate. REDCap, the COMIRB -preferred system, will 
be used to store all survey and enrollment data, and the University’s secure server will be used to store clinic audio files, interview audio files, transcripts and notes; access to both REDCap and the 
secure server will be limited to study personnel only. All paper documents will be stored in a secure 
and locked file cabinet in a secure and locked of fice building –  again, all study data paperwork will 
be stored separate from paperwork with identifiable information (i.e. signed consent forms) and be 
accessible to study personnel only.  
    
E.   Data Analysis Plan:   
Qualitative Data:  The open- ended qualitative question will be analyzed using inductive and 
deductive content analysis .40-42 The deductive approach will i dentify participant knowledge of key 
domains of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. The inductive approach will identify any key misconceptions or fallacies 
Protocol #18-0173                                                                  Page 5                                                                PI: [INVESTIGATOR_912086]. The quantitative acceptability and feasibility measures will 
be analyzed descriptively  with means and interquartile ranges. Analysis of qualitative data will be a 
continuous process beginning with initial interviews and continuing throughout and beyond the data generation period. All interviews will be audio- recorded and professionally transcribed verbatim. A 
multidisciplinary team, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Morris will begin the analysis process with repeated readings of 
the transcripts to achieve immersion. The team will then develop and apply a list of codes to the 
transcripts using an emergent rather t han a priori approach, in order to emphasize interviewee 
perspectives and de- emphasize team member speculations.
43,44 All coded data will be entered into 
Atlas.ti  v 7.0 (GmbH, Berlin) for data management. Coded transcripts will be analyzed within and 
across sites and settings to develop the major themes or concepts that the participants reported. The trustworthiness of study results will be enhanced through triangulation of the data and an audit 
trail throughout the data collection and analysis process. Following the interpretation of the 
qualitative findings, we will compare and contrast the results with the findings from the quantitative 
surveys using methods consistent with the NIH guidelines on mixed methods research.
45 
 
Quantitative Data:  We will compare differences between intervention and control using t -tests for 
continuous outcomes and chi -square tests for dichotomous outcomes. We will perform a 
multivariate analysis of  our outcome variables (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209895], self -efficacy and decisional 
conflict) and look for mediation and/or moderation effects of age, race, and gender; while controlling for potential confounders. There is no power calculation as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_912087].   
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
Through this R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], we will answer several key questions regarding the utility of this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912081]. Our innovative decision in which we intervene at three different time points 
(primary care, outpatient palliative care and inpatient palliative care) will provide valuable insights 
on when in the disease trajectory is appropriate to discuss hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912088]. We will also gather data and when and how patients use these decision aids which will 
inform future research on implementation of decision aids and best formats  
(i.e. paper vs video) to present decision aids to patients. If this PtDA proves to be feasible and acceptable with positive preliminary efficacy, we will move forward with a multi -site pragmatic RO1.

 CONFIDENTIAL Introduction and Rationale 
Introduction 
 Dextenza (dexamethasone 0.4mg ophthalmic insert) is a steroid eluting 
intracanalicular plug approved on-label for the treatment of pain and postope rative 
inflammation in patients who’ve undergone ocular surgery. Utilizing Dextenza, in plac e 
of ophthalmic steroid drops, will provide patients with a lessened number of  post-
operative drops which decreases both contamination possibilities and impr oper drug 
installation. Dextenza’s hydrogel technology is proposed to offer patients a gradua l 
sustained delivery of steroid to the ocular surface which may decrease subjecti ve post-
operative pain.  
 
 Post-operative drop regimens frequently induce both concerns and questions for 
patients undergoing ocular surgery. Poor compliance with postoperative medications  can 
lead to unexpected and or unsatisfactory outcomes. In post-operative catarac t surgery 
patients, un-treated or non-resolving inflammation can lead to pain, anterior cham ber 
inflammation, and potentially cystoid macular edema (CME). Lessening the risk of  these 
adverse events due to drop complications is a key benefit of Dextenza. There may b e 
future possibilities to combine intracameral medication combinations (a ntibiotic, steroid, 
NSAID) plus Dextenza to further reduce the patient post-operative drop burden.  
 
 On introduction to the market, Dextenza was most commonly inserted in the 
operating room (OR) pre-cataract surgery, but other instillation protoco ls will increase 
practitioner adoption and patient access. Increasing optometrist adm inistration in clinic 
allows for another route for insurance reimbursement while freeing up ophthalm ologists 
in the OR.  
 
 
Rationale 
 DEXTENZA (dexamethasone 0.4mg ophthalmic insert) has increasing research  
and evidence for post-cataract surgery patients, but a gap remains in bes t practices for 
instillation timing and protocols. In clinic insertion provides another route for  device 
administration which can help foster additional reimbursement codes.  
 
  Dextenza’s ability to treat post-operative inflammation while also increa sing 
remaining tear volume by [CONTACT_746042]-operative drop inconvenience. The studied p atient 
population is having their initial cataract evaluation and surgery on the same day, 
decreasing patient inconvenience, adding Dextenza is another arrow in the quiver.  
 
 
Rationale for Study Design 
 This prospective contralateral eye study will compare the outcomes of [ADDRESS_1020285] surgery. All eyes will receive intracameral DMK at the  conclusion of 
surgery. All eyes will be treated with Vigamox 0.5% QID for 1 week and Prolensa

Safety Definitions, Reporting, and Monitoring 
Definitions 
Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient a dministered a study 
drug which may or may not have a causal relationship wit h the study drug.  
Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is  temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not con sidered related to 
the study drug.   
 
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically s ignificant change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition tha t is temporally 
associated with the use of the study drug. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any do se: 
x Results in d eath – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be 
completely unrelated to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a patient 
is a passenger). 
x Is life-threatening – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  This does n ot include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
x Requires in-patient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].  In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2140] a s admission to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28682] 24 hours.  Prolon gation of

February, 2021  Page 34 
 CONFIDENTIAL was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the 
development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_746046]. 
x Results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity (substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life function s). 
x Is a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is an i mportant medical event – Important medical events may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], but may 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 1 of  the 
other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment i n an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or developm ent of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  Any malignancy (other than bas al cell skin 
cancers) would be considered a medically important event. 
 
Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded only if they are medicall y relevant. 
 
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship t o study insert will 
be reported to Ocular Therapeutix. 
To report an SAE, Ocular Therapeutix will be contact[CONTACT_6811] t he 
following:

SAE hotline: [PHONE_9545] 
 
The investigator will promptly report to the IRB all unant icipated problems 
involving risks to patients.  This includes death from an y cause and all SAEs 
related to the use of the study insert.  All SAEs will be rep orted to the IRB, 
regardless of assessed causality. 
 
Study Variables 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography  (e.g. age, race, 
weight, height, etc.), disease characteristics includin g medical history, and 
medication history for each patient. 
 
Ethical and Regulatory Considerations 
Good Clinical Practice Statement 
It is the responsibility of the investigator(s) to ensure tha t this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethical princip les that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consist ent with the ICH 
guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicabl e regulatory 
requirements.

informed consent form. 
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if a cceptable by [CONTACT_13125]) to obtain written informed consent from each pati ent prior to 
his/her participation in the study and after the aims, m ethods, objectives, and 
potential hazards of the study have been explained to the pati ent in language 
that he/she can understand.  The ICF will be signed and d ated by [CONTACT_746047].   
 
Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before 
signing and dating the ICF. 
Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have 
the ICF read to them in presence of an impartial witness, w ho will sign and 
date the ICF to confirm that informed consent was given. 
 
The original ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_746048]’s 
study record, and a copy of the signed ICF will be given t o the patient. 
 
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit 
assessment, the ICF will be reviewed and updated appropri ately.  All study 
patients will be informed of the new information and provide t heir written 
consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original  signed revised ICF 
will be maintained in the patient’s study record and a c opy will be given to 
the patient. 
 
Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection 
The investigator will take all appropriate measures to ensure that the 
anonymity of each study patient will be maintained.   
 
The patient’s and investigator’s personal data will be tr eated in compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.

Group)) to patient-only administered total topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] ((Treatme nt B- Control Group)). 
 
Interviewer: Please read the following verbatim! 
 
Thank you for participating in our study. Your evaluation of the test “fewer-drops” trea tment 
(Treatment A- Experimental Group) that the surgeon and you administered followi ng your

Every patient received both treatment regimens. Every patient recei ved Treatment A in one eye 
and Treatment B in the opposite eye. For clarification, here are the definitions  of each treatment 
group: 
 
Treatment A (Experimental Group- fewer-drops, physician & patient a dministered):  
 
x Dextenza (steroid punctal plug/insert) + Vigamox drops 4x/da y for 1 st  week + Prolensa drops 
1x/day for one month 
 
Treatment B (Control Group- total topi[INVESTIGATOR_746035], patient-only admi nistered): 
 
x Prednisolone drops 4x/day for 1 st  week, 3x/day for 2 nd  week, 2x/day for 3 rd  week, 1x/day for 
4th  week + Vigamox drops 4x/day for 1 st  week + Prolensa drops 1x/day for one month

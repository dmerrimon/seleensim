Study  Design  (for example, hypothesis,  research  question, standard and experimental procedures, 
special or unusual  equipment  of procedures):  
 
IVF is a process  which  involves  a schedule  of injectable  medication  to recruit  several  follicles,   each containing  
an egg, to be retrieved  under  ultrasound  guidance  where  they can be fertilized.  Embryos  are then selected  to 
be transferred back  into the patient’s uterus  or are cryopreserved  and transferred at a later date.  
 
Letrozole  is a potent  and highly selective  third generation  aromatase  inhibitor  that was developed in the early  
1990’s.  Aromatase is an enzyme  of the cytochrome  P-[ADDRESS_361233]  cancer,  we 
would  like to prospectively  randomize  them  to fixed  dose vs. titrated  dose of Letrozole.  Due to time restraints  
for chemotherapy  patients  may present  for ovarian  stimulation  prior  to Day 2 of their menstrual  cycle.  If this 
were  to occur,  a gonadotropin- releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  antagonist  may be started  to suppress  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_295840].  Eligible  subjects  will be  fully informed  RESEARCH PLAN - RCT of Fixed vs Titrated Letrozole  
about  the nature  of the trial. Subjects  could  be enrolled  for IVF treatment  at any point  after breast  cancer  
diagnosis  but before  the initiation  of chemotherapy,  if chemotherapy has been  prescribed  by [CONTACT_295851].  
After  obtaining  written  informed  consent,  the subjects  will be screened  based  on inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  
medical  and infertility  history,  ovarian  reserve  (eg, antral  follicle  count,  AMH,  FSH)  and estradiol,  physical  
and gynecological  examination,  oncology  clearance  and the Center’s  standard  screening  evaluations  for IVF 
patients.  A thorough  gynecologic  and endocrinologic  evaluation  will be performed  before  the start of any 
treatment.  Laboratory  assessments  will include  CBC,  chemistry  and lipid profile  (see attached  history and 
physical  form).  Vital signs  including  blood  pressure,  pulse,  and weight  will be assessed  at baseline (prior  to 
start of stimulation  medication),  with preoperative  evaluation,  on day of egg retrieval,  and with post  retrieval  
visits.  
 
Patients  will have  serum  blood  tests for bHCG,  FSH,  AMH,  Estradiol,  and LH and vaginal  sonogram.  Start  of 
stimulation  medication  will proceed  only with documentation  of a serum negative pregnancy  test. Patients  will 
only be eligible  to participate  in the study  for one cycle of in vitro fertilization.  
Patients  who elect  to participate  in the study  will be provided with gonadotropin  medications.  
 
The starting dose  of gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_295841]' age and by 
[CONTACT_295852].  The HMG  form  of 
gonadotropin  may be added to  the FSH formulation,  as needed.  See below:  
Age <35 , Antral  follicle Count  >15 gonadotropin  dose 150 - 225 IU 
Age <35, Antral  follicle Count  <15 gonadotropin  dose 225 - 300 IU 
 
Age 35-39, Antral  follicle  Count  >10 gonadotropin  dose 150 - 300 IU 
Age 35-39, Antral  follicle  Count  <10 gonadotropin  dose 300 - 450 IU 
Age>40  Independent  of antral  follicle  count,  gonadotropin dose 300 - 450 IU. All patients  would  also be 
given  a daily  medication  to prevent  them  from  ovulating (GnRH  e.g. Ganirelix,  Cetrotide),  no later than 
stimulation  day #7 and continuing until  HCG  administration.  
 
Group#1 -Fixed  Letrozole  Group: Provided  their blood  tests and sonograms  were within  normal limits,  patients  
who are randomized  to fixed  dose Letrozole  will start Letrozole  5mg daily  (orally)  and then gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]  2 
days later (Current  Letrozole  protocol  at CRM).  Patients  will be monitored  with blood  tests for estradiol  and 
LH and sonogram  every  1-3 days.  Adjustments  to gonadotropin  dosing will be made  as per usual  protocol  for 
IVF. Letrozole  dose will not change  and will  continue for  up to two weeks  after egg  retrieval.  
 
Group  #2-Titrated  Letrozole  Group:  Provided their blood  tests and sonograms  were  within  normal  limits,  
patients  who are randomized  to the titrated  dose of Letrozole,  will start gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_295842]  (FSH)  and human  menopausal  gonadotropin 
(HMG).  Oral Letrozole  will be added  to the stimulation  in the following titrated  regimen:  
 
Serum  Estradiol level  <150 pg/ml - No Letrozole  
Serum  Estradiol Level  150-250 pg/ml - 2.5mg  
Serum  Estradiol Level  251-350 pg/ml - 5  mg 
Serum  Estradiol Level   >350 pg/ml -  7.5 mg 
 
The maximal  starting  dose of Letrozole will be 5 mg, regardless  of the initial estradiol level.  The Letrozole  
dose may be reduced  if the appropriate  suppression of estradiol  occurs.  The maximal  increase or decrease  in 
Letrozole  dose will be 2.5 mg/ day. Patients  will be monitored  with blood tests for estradiol and LH and 
sonograms  starting  on the second  day of gonadotropin  stimulation  and every  1-[ADDRESS_361234]  serum  estradiol  levels  drawn  weekly  for 2 weeks  after 
stimulation.  Follow -up vital signs will  be recorded  along with  CBC,  liver function panel,  and cholesterol  panel  
1-2 weeks  after stimulation,  if oncology  treatment  is not started  immediately  after retrieval.  They  will also be 
asked  to return  6 months  to 1 year after completion  of chemotherapy  for AMH  and FSH levels  to evaluate  
ovarian  reserve,  and then followed  on a yearly  basis  by [CONTACT_648]/mail  questionnaire  or in person  with an annual  
gynecological  examination.  
 
All study  patients  will be provided with an emergency  24-hour phone  number  to reach  a physician  to report  
adverse  reactions  to medications,  and these  physicians  will file adverse  event  report  forms  to the principal 
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_295843].  In addition,  they will be asked  to report  any adverse  reactions  to 
medications  during  follicular  monitoring  sonograms.  All decisions  regarding  daily  medication  doses  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_295853].  Otherwise,  the treatment of ovarian  stimulation,  egg retrieval,  
and cryopreservation  is identical  to non-study  patients  undergoing ovarian  stimulation,  oocyte  retrieval,  and 
embryo/oocyte  cryopreservation.  
 
After  retrieval,  follow -up instructions  will be reviewed.  Patients  will be advised  to refrain  from  embryo 
transfer  for a minimum  of 2 years  after chemotherapy.  Patients  will not be permitted  to undergo  embryo  
transfer  for a minimum  of one year after completing  chemotherapy  and only after clearance  for pregnancy  has 
Gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_295844]  5 mg/d  
Gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_295845].  Patients  will be followed  for five years  on an annual  basis  with a 
follow -up telephone  call from  one of the investigators  inquiring  about  health  status  (see patient  follow -up data 
sheet).  A pregnancy  registry  will be created  for any pregnancy occurring  following  enrollment  in the study.  
Detailed  pregnancy outcome  will be collected between  age 2-5 years  (see baby [CONTACT_6492] -up data sheet  attached).

A2. Rationale and justification for  the study  (for example,  historical  background,  investigator’s personal  
experience,  
pertinent  medical  literature):  
For several  years  in Europe and North America,  aromatase inhibitors have been  used to block estrogen  
production  in the treatment of post-menopausal breast cancer.  Researchers in  the United  States  and Canada  
have  used aromatase  inhibitors  in otherwise healthy women undergoing ovulation inductio n. By [CONTACT_295854],  many researchers have  found  that ovulation  induction could be performed  with 
significantly  lower doses  of fertility  medications (Fertil Steril  75:305- 9,2001;  Fertil Steril 86(5):1428- 1431;  
Fertil  Steril  85:1774- 7, 2006).  Pregnancy  outcome  was similar  to that of traditional  stimulation  protocols  
(Journal  of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation 11(6):406- 15,2004).  
 
In 2005,  an observational  pi[INVESTIGATOR_295846] [ADDRESS_361235]  5 days of stimulation. The Letrozole  
group  had more  oocytes retrieved  and higher  implantation rates  (Fertil  Steril  :84(1):82 -7, 2005). In 2006,   
Verpoest  et al. published  a small randomized  prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_295847],  endometrial thickness  
and pregnancy rates. They  showed that median  estradiol  concentrations were  significantly  lower  in the 
Letrozole group vs.  no Letrozole, whereas  endometrial thickness was significantly greater  in the  Letrozole  
group.  
 
In 2005,  at our  institution, a Letrozole  protocol was  applied  to a population of women  with breast cancer  
undergoing fertility  preservation.  [ADDRESS_361236]  cancer,  were  prospectively  followed  after fertility  
preservation procedures with  tamoxifen  alone  or in combination with  low dose  FSH, or  Letrozole  in 
combination with  low dose FSH.  After IVF,  all resultant embryos were cryopreserved.  The combination of  
low-dose FSH with  tamoxifen or  Letrozole  resulted  in higher  embryo  yield  compared  to tamoxifen alone.  
Recurrence rates  did not seem to  be increased. The Letrozole  protocol resulted in lower peak  estradiol levels.  
(J Clin Oncol 23:4347 -4353,  2005).  
 
In 2006,  at out institution, [ADDRESS_361237] cancer  patients  were studied who received 5mg/d  Letrozole and 150- 300 
IU FSH to cryopreserve embryos or oocytes.  Age matched retrospective controls were  selected  from  women  
who underwent  IVF for tubal  disease. Letrozole  with FSH stimulation  resulted  in significantly  lower peak  
estradiol levels and 44%  reduction  in gonadotropin requirement,  compared  to controls. Length of  stimulation,  
number  of embryos  obtained,  and fertilization rates were  similar. The  mean  delay  from  surgery  to 
cryopreservation without delay in  chemotherapy  was 39 days  with 81% of  patients  completing  their 
stimulation  within  the 8 weeks of  surgery.  (J Clin  Endocrinol Metab  91:3885- 3890,  2006)  
 
At our institution,  [ADDRESS_361238]  cancer  were prospectively  evaluated for  fertility  preservation  
before adjuvant  chemotherapy.  Of those  79, elected  to undergo  controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with 
letrozole 5 mg x 5 days and gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_295848]. The remaining  136 
patients  underwent  no fertility -preservation  procedures  and served  as controls. In  the fertility  preservation  
group  the mean  E2 was 406 ±  257 pg/ml.  The hazard  rate for recurrence and the survival rate  after IVF was 
not compromised  in comparison to  the control group  after 23 months. (J Clin Onc 26:2630- 2635, 2008)

A8. Statistical  considerations  (e.g. justification for  sample size or “n”):  
Sample  size: 
The primary  aim of the study  is to determine  if titrated dose  Letrozole  in comparison to fixed  dose Letrozole  
during gonadotropin stimulation in IVF  in breast cancer patients  results  in a 50% increased  mature  oocyte  yield.  
With  a sample  size of [ADDRESS_361244] 80%  power  (alpha=0.05)  to detect  a difference  in 
the mean  number  of mature  oocytes  of 4.3 between  the titrated  dose group  and the fixed  dose group.  This is  
based on an expected  mature oocyte  yield of 8.7±4.8 in  the fixed dose group and an expected  50% increase  in the 
mature  oocyte  yield  in the titrated  dose group (e.g., [(13.0- 8.7)/8.7  = 50% increase]).  
 
Analysis  Plan : 
The mean  and median  mature  oocyte  yield  will initially  be compared between  the titrated and  fixed  dose groups  
by [CONTACT_112913]-group t -test and Wilcoxon rank- sum test, respectively,  in an intent -to-treat analysis.   Stratification by 
[CONTACT_295857]  
(ANCOVA) for  the primary  endpoint  (i.e., ooctye yield),  using the stratification factor  (age group)  as a covariate 
in the ANCOVA model  (in addition  to the dose group variable)  (this will also be an intent -to-treat analysis).  The 
ANCOVA procedure recognizes  the reduction  in variability in  the titrated -versus -fixed dose  comparison  that is 
attained by [CONTACT_295858]  (by [CONTACT_551])  at the time of randomization.  This reduction  in variability will 
increase the  power  of the study  (>80%)  to detect  the hypothesized difference  and will  potentially allow  for the 
detection  of smaller  differences  with the stated  sample  size of [ADDRESS_361245] or Fisher’s  exact  test, as  
appropriate.  Similarly,  to account  for stratification  at randomization, ANCOVA  and multivariate logistic  
regression will  be performed for the secondary  endpoints,  as appropriate, by [CONTACT_295859] a covariate in the 
multivariate  models.  One-year and [ADDRESS_361246] will be employed for comparing  recurrence -free survival  between  the titrated  
and fixed dose  groups.  
 
Subjects who discontinue  the study  prior  to egg retrieval  will be still be considered  in the primary  intent -to-treat 
analysis  by [CONTACT_20526]  a value of zero eggs retrieved for the primary endpoint (i.e., oocyte  yield).   This will 
conservatively  underestimate any observed titrated -versus -fixed  dose effect but  will preserve  the benefit  of 
randomization.  A secondary  analysis will  be performed  to assess the  between dose  group  effect after these  
patients  have been removed, but  this will only be for descriptive  purposes.  
 
All p-values  will be two-sided with  statistical significance  evaluated  at the 0.05 alpha level and 95% confidence  
intervals  will be calculated  to assess the  precision of the obtained  estimates.  All analyses  will be performed  in 
SAS Version  9.1 (SAS  Institute,  Inc., Cary,  NC).  
 
Randomization : 
A series of randomized  blocks  of four will be generated for  the study.  This will provide  assurance  that after four 
patients  are enrolled,  there will be two patients assigned  to the titrated dose  letrozole  group  and two patients  
assigned  to the fixed dose  letrozole group.  The blocked randomization  will be stratified  according  to age group:  
≤32 years,  33-36 years,  and ≥[ADDRESS_361247]  access to the  computer generated  randomization  file and will make  assignments  accordingly.  
 
  
 
A9. Relative  importance/value  of the trial,  considering “standard”  therapy and published/competing  
trials.  Please  
specify  what  the current  standard of care  is. 
This trial will investigate  if a superior  and safer  controlled ovarian  hyperstimulation  protocol  with Letrozole  
exists for  breast  cancer  patients  for fertility  preservation  and cryopreservation  of oocytes or  embryos.  As 
these patients  cannot  delay chemotherapy,  any improvement in oocyte  yield  would be a significant  benefit.

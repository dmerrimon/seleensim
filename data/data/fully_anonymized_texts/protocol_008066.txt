participate in this study.  
Number of subjects 
planned  Approximately 375 subjects  will be screened and 
approximately 240 subjects are planned for enrollment (80 subjects per treatment group), assuming a screen failure 
rate of approximately 35%. 
Test product, dose, and 
administration  The test products are ACP -044, 400 mg tablets or matching 
placebo (size- and color -matched) tablets. Study drug doses 
are to be administered orally prior to surgery through approximately [ADDRESS_657707] dose of study drug on Day -1. 
Doses to be studied are: 
• ACP -044, 1600 mg t otal dose delivered once daily  in 
the morning (provided as 4× 400 mg ACP -044 tablets 
once daily )  
• ACP -044, 400 mg total dose delivered every 6 hours 
(provided as 1× 400 mg ACP -044 tablet 4 times per 
day for a total daily dose of 1600 mg)  
• Placebo size- and color- matched to ACP -[ADDRESS_657708] and a verifier  will prepare the study

Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: [ADDRESS_657709] any involvemen t with subjects or pain 
assessments.  
In order to maintain the double-blind design of the study, on 
each treatment day (Days -1 to Day 3) all subjects will receive four tablets (either active study drug and/or placebo) for the first dose of the day  and one tablet  (either active study 
drug or placebo) for the second , third , and fourth  doses of the 
day. 
Study design  This study will be conducted as a Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, inpatient study in subjects with acute postoperative pain (following bunionectomy surgery ). The study will compare each of the 
two active treatment groups receiving a total daily dose of 1600 mg ACP -044, administered either once daily or 400 mg 
every 6 hours, with a placebo group. The Sponsor, subjects, and Investigators will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
The study periods are: 
• Screening: up to 4 weeks  (prior to surgery) 
• Double- blind treatment: Day -1 (post first dose of 
study drug/day of surgery) to Day 4  
• Safety follow-up: approximately 7 days after end of 
treatment  (EOT)/early termination  (ET) and  
approximately 30 days (post last dose of study drug) 
Screening Period  
During the Screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. Only those subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study.  
All prohibited medications should be discontinued during the 
Screening period and prior to surgery. Investigators must not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications will be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the prescribing physician. 
With approval of the Medical Monitor, r escreening of a 
subject will be allowed one time if there is an extenuating 
circumstance that was not under the subject’s control or if is due to an identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, and there is no medical reason that would prevent the subject to be rescreened and enroll ed in the study.

Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 9 of 76 On the day of surgery  (Day -1), eligible subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_657710] dose of study drug will be administered within 
60 (± 15) minutes prior to  the start of  surgery. S ubjects will 
then have a popliteal and/ or ankle nerve block administered to 
anesthetize the knee, distal leg, and foot, after which they will enter in to surgery. Following surgery, subjects will be 
administered the remaining three daily doses approximately every 6 hours after the initial dose .  
The popliteal and/or ankle nerve block will be discontinued approximately 2-[ADDRESS_657711]  dose on Day 1 
(i.e., the fifth  dose of the study) and nerve block removal; a 
discontinuation window of approximately [ADDRESS_657712] dose on Day 1  is 
administered  will be time 0 for all pain  assessments. Study 
drug administration  and study procedures are to be completed 
on Days -1 through 4 according to the schedule of assessment s (Table  S-1). Subjects will be encouraged to 
refrain
 from taking rescue medication until 1-[ADDRESS_657713] dose of study drug on Day 1 (details provided in Section 4.8.1). 
On Day 4 ,
 after the 72 hour pain assessments are performed, 
the EOT procedures will be completed and subjects will be 
discharged from the clinical site.  
Safety Follow- up Period  
Safety will be further assessed during a follow-up visit to 
occur in the clinic approximately 7 (±3) days after EOT /ET 
procedures and s ubjects will receive a follow-up telephone 
call approximately 30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study 
drug. Subjects should return to standard of care after the follow-up visit that will occur in the clinic 7  (±3) days after 
the EOT/ET.  
The study schematic is presented in  Figure S–1. 
Study duration  The duration of participation for individual study subjects 
will be approximately 9 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 4-day treatment period, and a 
safety follow-up period of approximately 30 (+4) days.

Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 14 of 76 Sample size calculations  The planned sample size is 240 subjects randomized 
(80 subjects per treatment group). Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Assuming a treatment difference in the AUC from [ADDRESS_657724] deviation is 50 points, 76 subjects per treatment arm will provide approximately 80% power to detect the assumed treatment difference between each ACP -044 dose arm and placebo at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming no more than 5% of randomized patients will be ex cluded from primary 
efficacy analysis, [ADDRESS_657725] one dose of study drug (ACP-044 or placebo). Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that th ey actually received. The S afety Analysis Set will be 
used for all safety analyses.  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS) includes all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and who have undergone bunionectomy with at least one postoperative pain assessment. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per -protocol (PP) Analysis Set  will consist of those 
subjects in the FAS  who did not have any protocol deviations 
that could potentially have a substantia l impact on the 
primary efficacy outcome. The precise reasons for excluding 
subjects from the PP Analysis Set will be fully defined and documented prior to the clinical database lock. Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment assignment. The PP Analysis Set will be used for supportive analyses of selected efficacy endpoints.  
For ACP -[ADDRESS_657726] one measurable ACP -044 plasma concentration. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups and will be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy variable, AUC 0-24, will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_508838] (ANOV A) with treatment group 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: [ADDRESS_657727]  stratified by [CONTACT_3725] . 
Proportion of patients who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_39897] 24, 48, and 72 hours will be analyzed using stratified Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site.  
Secondary Analyses  
Continuous secondary variables will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy variable. Proportion of patients who are pain free at each specific timepoint will be analy zed using 
stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling 
for study site. 
General Statistic al Approach  
Continuous measurement results will be reported using the number of subjects with data values, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median. For each categorical outcome, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be reported.  All 
statistical hypoth esis tests will be 2- sided at the significance 
level of 0.05. 
Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity  
A fixed sequence method at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_657728] terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by [CONTACT_764], fatal TEAEs, and SAEs  reported after 
study drug start will all be summarized. Other TEAEs of special interest (e.g., ORAEs ) may also be summarized.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, the International Council for Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) Guideline, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
1.1 Background Information 
Acute postoperative pain has limited treatment options, each  with their own benefits  and 
shortcomings. The mainstays of acute pain treatment are opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. While they provide efficacy 
to the patients that take them, there are significant risks of constipation, tolerance and dependence, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], abuse, diversion and potentially addiction. Postoperative pain following surgery is expected to be moderate to severe and often requires opi[INVESTIGATOR_508814]. Many operative procedures 
result in pain that f ollows a predictable course and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_508815]. More than 
thirteen million ambulatory surgeries were performed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- owned facilities in the 
[LOCATION_002] in 2016 ( Karaca and  McDermott  2019).  
Following the procedure, patients are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_508816]. While opi[INVESTIGATOR_508817], many physicians have concerns about the potential for subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_85582], addiction, and diversion. With an ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_508818] 128 overdose deaths each day ( Wilson et al. 
2020),  and prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_508819] $78.5 billion per year, new nonaddictive pain

non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_508821]. Therefore, Acadia is developi[INVESTIGATOR_508822]-044, a 
peripherally -acting molecule  with demonstrated efficacy in a wide array of nonclinical 
models of pain to prevent and treat acute postsurgical pain. 
1.2 Investigational Produc
t 
ACP -044, is a non- metal based, orally bi oavailable, small molecule Reactive Species 
Decomposition Accelerant (RSDAx) that works by [CONTACT_508839] 
(PN) and peroxide. Peroxynitrite and peroxide are powerful oxidants produced under conditions of injury (e.g., surgical incision) and disease (e.g., diabetes) that cause untoward effects via protein nitration and modification of sensory ion channels leading to neuronal 
sensitization and pain ( McConnell et al. 2003; Lee et al
. 1998a ; Lee et al.  1998b; 
Chaplan  et al. 1994
; Hargreaves et al. 1988; Fehrenbacher et al. 2012 ; Sluka and Willis 1997; 
Brennan et al. 1996) . By [CONTACT_508840], ACP-044 prevents or disrupts the ensuing pathways 
causing hypersensitivity thereby [CONTACT_508841].

both prophylactically and palliatively. This suggests that ACP-044 may be of use in 
peri-operative settings as a replacement or to  reduce the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2577] 
(i.e., Percocet, Vicodin) often prescribed following minimally invasive surgical procedures. 
1.[ADDRESS_657752] received ACP-044 (single oral doses up to 
2000 mg) and 14 subjects received placebo.  In the single ascending dose study, 32 subjects 
were enrolled in four dose cohorts (150, 450, 1100, and 2000 mg ACP-044; subjects were randomized to six  active and two placebo for each dose cohort). In the food effect study, 
12 subjects received two  single oral doses of 600 mg ACP -044 according to fed or fasting 
conditions. In the multiple ascending dose study, 24 subjects w ere enrolled in three dose 
cohorts (200, 400, and 600 mg dosed orally three times each day for 7 days ; subjects were 
randomized to 6 active and 2 placebo for each dose cohort). The s ingle and multiple

to maximum drug concentration (T
max) of approximately  1-[ADDRESS_657755] on the rate of absorption (approximately  23% reduction in maximum 
observed drug concentration (C max) and 1 hour delay in T max) and had no effect on the extent 
(area under the curve [ AUC ]) of ACP -044 absorption. Since the relative extent of absorption 
was unaffected by [CONTACT_46917] a hi gh fat meal, it is anticipated that the slight reduction in 
Cmax and prolongation of T max will be of no clinical significance.  
In vitro, ACP -044 has shown moderate protein binding in human plasma. At concentrations 
of 10 µM, binding was 88%. 
Consistent with the nonclinical data, ACP-044 volume of distribution in studied subjects was 
<30 L, which suggests that ACP -044 does not reach beyond the extracellular fluid with 
limited to no distribution into tissues (intracellularly).

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 30 of 76 ACP -044 is primari ly metabolized and the major metabolite is sulfate conjugate  and to a 
lesser extent is glucuronide conjugate. Consistent with preclinical data, following oral 
administration in healthy subjects, a pproximately 35% of ACP -044 was excreted unchanged 
in urine indicating that hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute to ACP-044 
elimination. Following oral administration in healthy subjects, decline from peak is mono-exponential and is characterized by a rapid  elimination phase with rapid clearance 
(mean CL/F =6.04 to 11.3 L/h) and a short  half-life ( mean t
½=1.6 to 3.2 hours).   
According to nonclinical assessments ACP-044 did not directly inhibit (IC 50 values >100 
µM) the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isozymes tested (1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) nor 
transporters (IC 50 >600 µM for P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT1, MATE1 and 
MATE2 -K; IC 50=174 µM for OAT3; IC 50 >[ADDRESS_657756] cancer resistant protein 
(BCRP ). Future studies are planned to investigate the full panel of CYPs and transporters and 
their drug-drug interaction ( DDI) potential.

benefit/risk assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding nonclinical data,  drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety.  
1.5 Study Rationale 
ACP -044 has demonstrated efficacy in  acute 
 and chronic nociceptive models in rodents and 
has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteer subjects. The present study is a proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy of ACP -044 as an analgesic for the treatment of acute postoperative pain  and to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile. The postoperative 
bunionectomy model is a widely used human orthopedic model in the development of analgesic drugs ( Desjardin
s et al.  2002; Daniels et al. 2009; Pollak et al. 2018) .

essentially complete prevention of hyperalgesia. Similarly, daily doses of ACP -044 given 
postincision provided continuous relief from an ongoing hyperalgesic insult in a 
dose-dependent manner . It is not clear , however, whether the response is driven by C max or 
AUC . In the present proof of concept study, the maximum tolerated dose of ACP-044 is 
being evaluated by [CONTACT_508842] (i.e., once-daily or every 6 hours) to allow 
the selection of the optimal dosing regimen and better characterization of  the 
exposure-response relationship.

3.1.1 S
creening  Period  (Up to 4 Weeks ) 
During the Screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. Only those 
subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. 
All pr ohibited medications should be discontinued during the Screening period and prior to 
surgery. Investigators must not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications will be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically 
appropriate to do so and in consultation with the prescribing physician. 
With approval of the Medical Monitor, r escreening of a subject will be allowed one time if 
there is an extenuating circumstance that was not under the subject’s con trol or if  it is due  to 
an identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, and there is no 
medical reason that would prevent the subject to be rescreened  and enroll ed in the study.  
3.1.2 Treatment  Period  (Day -1 to Day 4) 
On the day of surgery (Day -1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_657766] dose of study drug will be administered within  60 (±15) minutes  prior to the start of 
surgery. S ubjects will then have a popliteal and/or ankle nerve block administered to 
anesthetize the knee, distal leg, and foot, after which they will enter into surgery. Following

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: [ADDRESS_657767] iteal and/or ankle nerve block will be discontinued approximately 2-[ADDRESS_657768]  dose on Day 1 (i.e., the fifth  dose of the study) and  nerve block removal ; a 
discontinuation window of approximately [ADDRESS_657769]  
dose on Day 1 is administered  will be time 0 for all pain assessments. Study drug 
administration and study procedures are to be completed on Days -1 through 4 according to 
the schedule of assessments ( Table S –1). Subjects will be encouraged to refrain from taking 
rescue medication until 1-[ADDRESS_657770] dose of study drug on Day 1 ( details  
provided in Section 4.8.1). 
On Day 4 , after the 72 hour pain assessment s are performed , the EOT procedures will be 
completed and  subjects will be discharged from the clinical site.  
See Section  4.5 for subjects who discontinue early from the study. 
3.1.3 Safety Follow- up Period  (30 Days) 
Safety will be further assessed during a follow-up visit to occur in the clinic approximately 
7 (±3) days after EOT /ET procedures  and s ubjects will receive a follow-up telephone call 
approximately 30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects should return to 
standard of care after the follow- up visit that will occur in the clinic 7 (±3) days after the 
EOT/ET .

Circumstances may arise (e.g., pandemic, natural disaster, or political upheaval) when the 
follow-up safety  assessment  at the clinic may not be possible. In those cases, the follow-up 
assessments may be performed at a location other than the research site either in person, or 
via video technology or telephone where possible. The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_508846]. Sites must keep a log to identify details of all visits that 
are performed  remotely.  The location of the collected assessments should be captured in the 
source documents. 
6.[ADDRESS_657796] at the 
Screening visit. Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well.  
Any new medical condition reported with a start date after the informed consent form (ICF) 
has been signed will be captured as an AE. Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or 
medical records to substantiate the medication history . 
Any medicati on reported as taken on or after Day - 1 will be captured as concomitant 
medication . 
6.3 Block Quality Assessment  
Postoperatively, assessment s of the popliteal block depth (Block Quality Assessment) will be 
performed and recorded hourly (±15 minutes) at the top  of each hour until 2200 hours. 
Between the hours of 2200 and 0600 hours, Block Quality Assessments will continue to be performed hourly (±15 minutes) if subject is awake, but , even if asleep, the subject will be 
awakened to perform a Block Quality Assessment at 0300 hours (±15 minutes ). Block 
Quality Assessments will continue  until the block is removed .

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: [ADDRESS_657797]’s pain at the time of popliteal and/or ankle 
nerve block removal , for the subsequent 72 hours, and for the 7 days after EOT. Subjects will 
be asked:  
“Please describe your foot pain at the present time from 0 to 10 where “0 ” 
mean s “no pain at all” and “10” mean s “the worst pain imaginable”. 
Trained study coordinators will present the NRS scale and all other questionnaires at the 
designated times.  
Pain (efficacy) assessments are to be recorded hourly (±15 minutes) for a 12-hour interval on 
Day 1  beginning immediately prior to  the fifth dose (time 0) administered in the study. Pain 
assessments will continue every  [ADDRESS_657798] ice administered  to the surgical area within the 30 minutes prior to 
each pain assessment.  Pain assessments should be performed before blood sample collection, 
ECG, and other procedures. 
Subjects will be provided a diary upon discharge to document their pain from EOT to the follow-up clinic visit that occurs 7 days after EOT.  
6.4.2 Global Evaluation of Study Drug  
For the global evaluation of study drug subjects will be asked to provide a graded  response 
(4=excellent, 3=very good, 2=good, 1=fair, or 0=poor) to the statement “How would you rate 
the study drug you received to delay or reduce your foot pain?” The time at which the statement is completed will be recorded.  
Evaluation of study drug will be completed  just before receiving the first dose of rescue 
medication , and  at the end of 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours relative to time 0 (when the 
first dose on Day 1 is administered). The evaluation of study drug should be performed before blood sample collection, ECG, and other procedures. 
6.4.3 Foot and Ankle Ability Measure  
The FAAM is a validated , self -r

of function during usual activities of daily living , graded on a scale of [ADDRESS_657800] ed on Day -1 and Day 4/ EOT/ET.  Height 
will only be measured and reported at Screening and weight will be measured and recorded at 
Screening  and Day -1 predose. An exam of the operative site will also be performed on Day 4  
(EOT/ET) prior to discharge and at the follow-up visit 7  (±3) days after the EOT procedures 
are completed.  Both exams must include visual inspection of the operative site. 
The full examination should include a review of body systems and should include a neurological examination (e.g., level of consciousness, speech, cranial nerves [including pupil equality and reactivity], motor assessment, sensory assessment, coordination, gait, reflexes, and Romberg test). Height and weight will be measured and reported as described  
above. 
The brief physical exam will include the following: evaluation of general appearance, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. A general physical examination will 
be conducted. 
6.5.[ADDRESS_657801] has been sitting for ≥ [ADDRESS_657802] 6  hours after the initial dose. Vital signs will then be evaluated every 6 hours 
thereafter until Day 4/ EOT/ET . A 15 -minute window is permitted for vital sign 
measurements.  
Vital signs should be measured prior to ( PK and laboratory) blood draws.

All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. A s ingle 
12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening, Day -1 predose, on Days 1 through 3 at 1 hour 
postdose (the first dose of the day ), and Day 4 /EOT/ET. A 1 -hour window is permitted  for the 
predose ECG; a 20-minute window is permitted  for the postdose ECG. ECGs should be 
performed prior to blood sampling and vital signs but after pain assessments are completed . 
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood sampling or at least [ADDRESS_657803] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes  before the ECG is 
obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB 
intervals) will be included in the subject's study records. 
At Screening, if the ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable cause, and it is 
medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat ECG may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. 
On Day -1, a subject may be enrolled based on the review and interpretation of the ECG by a 
qualified physician. If the interpretation of the ECG indicates a QTcF outside of the allowable 
range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
6.5.4 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
deter
mine risk ( Posner e
t al. 2011).  The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of idea
tion, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The Baseli
ne/Screening version will be administered at Screening, and the Since Last Visit 
version will be administered at all subsequent visits. The C- SSRS results for each subject 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_508847]. If at any time the C -SSRS results for 
a given subject reveal potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical 
significance of such results. If a clinically significant risk of suicidality  is identified for a 
subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  4.5).  
6.5.5 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA1c at S creening  only) is  encouraged, but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory eval uations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Clinical chemistry serum tests  (CHEM )

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations 
of ACP -044. ACP -044 plasma concentration data will remain blinded until the unblinding of 
the clinical database at the end of the study.  
PK blood samples will be collected Day - 1 (predose, within one hour of dosing), Day  1 
(one sample taken between [ADDRESS_657807] 
dose of the day), Day 2 (prior to the first dose of the day), and Day 3 (one sample taken 
between [ADDRESS_657808] dose of the day). 
A 15 -minute window is permitted around each nominal timepoint on Day 1 and beyond. 
Pharmacokinetic samples will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit or the visit 
immediately following any SAE or following any AE leading to discontinuation, even if it is 
an unscheduled visit.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: [ADDRESS_657811]  evaluation  is a follow-up visit that will be conducted  at the clinic approximately 
7 (±3) days after EOT  visit. The assessments to be conducted at this visit include: 
• Examination of the operative site , which must include visual inspection (at the 
follow-up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• FAAM  (at the follow -up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• Collect diary  (at the follow -up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs  
The second evaluation is a follow- up telephone call to occur approximately 30 (+4) days after 
the last dose of study drug. The subject will be asked about the following during the 
telephone call:  
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs  
6.8 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by [CONTACT_737]. The following safety 
assessments generally should be recorded at each uns cheduled visit : assessment of AEs, 
concomitant medications/treatments, and measurement of vital signs . The Investigator may 
perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by [CONTACT_508848].  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulatio n, or dose, including an overdose. 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 55 of 76 A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglas ses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at the 
time of informed c onsent, or scheduled surgery/procedure. 
• Overdose of concomitant  medication without any signs or symptoms. If subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508826], the overdose shall be reported on the Sponsor’s Overdose Reporting form 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to t he severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (initial or prolonged) 
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Other serious event  (medically significant/important medical event)  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject  at immediate
 risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused deat h. 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 56 of 76 Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508827] a full  admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431800] . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508828]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be assessed as described belo w and reported in detail as 
indicated on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyd ay activities

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 57 of 76 • Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if the re is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
• Response to drug cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of concomitant medications 
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
• Past medical history 
7.2.3 Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_508829] 
• Stop: Date when AE ceased  permanently , worsened in severity,  or resolved with or 
without sequelae  
7.2.4 Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
• Recurrent : More than one discrete epi[INVESTIGATOR_431802]  
7.2.5 Action Taken with Study Drug  
• Dose not changed : No change in study drug 
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily stopped 
• Drug withdrawn : Study drug discontinued permanently

different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienc ed since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] 
(e.g., “cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_657814] be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee ; use 
the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting. At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_387424], 
unexpected, and related  to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible 
institutional r eview board/e thics c ommittee ( IRB/ EC), as per applicable regulations. These 
will be provided by [CONTACT_508849]. For European Union member states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) directly to the ECs, as required by [CONTACT_19666]. In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the 
responsible IRB/ EC. It is also the Investigator ’s responsibility  to notify the responsible 
IRB/ EC regarding any new and significant safety information.  
When an SAE occurs, Investigators will review all documentation related to the event and 
will complete the paper SAE form with all required information (for initial and/or follow -up

Subjects will be followed through the safety follow-up period (i.e., 30 [+4] days after last dose of study drug) for any SAEs and/or other reportable information until such events have resolved or the Investigator deems them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_508851]. 
Serious AEs occurring after the safety follow -up period (i.e., 30 [+4] days after last dose of 
study drug)  should be reported if in the judgment of the Investigator there is “a reasonable 
possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_77425]. SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations.

amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements . Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan document. 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be 
approved by [CONTACT_120037] . Deviations from the approved SAP will be 
described and justified in the final clinical study report. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary endpoint is AUC
0-24 based on the pain intensity scores from 0 to 24 hours 
assessed using NRS.  
Let Δ auc_1 and Δ auc_ 2 be the difference between each of the two  ACP -044 dose groups and 
placebo group in the mean AUC 0-24, respectively.  
The null hypotheses are: Δ auc_i = 0 and the alternative hypothesis is: Δ auc_i ≠ 0, i=1,2 
9.2.1 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
A fixed-sequence method at alpha=0.05 for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be used to control for mult iplicity . The following will be the  sequence for testing:

10. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_39897] 72 hours 
The testing procedure will stop once a p-value in the sequence is greater than 0.05. P-values that 
are less than or equal to 0.05 prior to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will be declared statistically significant; p-values 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_508831].  
9.3 Sample Size Determination  
The planned sample size is 240 subjects randomized (80 subjects per treatment group). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Assuming a treatment difference in the AUC from [ADDRESS_657820] deviation is 50 points, 
76 subjects per treatment arm will provide ap proximately 80% power to detect the assumed 
treatment difference between each ACP -044 dose arm and placebo at a 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05. Assuming no more than 5% of randomized patients will be excluded from primary efficacy analysis, [ADDRESS_657821] one dose of 
study drug (ACP-044 or placebo). Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that they 
actually received. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The Full Analysis Set  includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug and who have undergone bunionectomy with at least one postoperative pain 
assessment. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per -protocol (PP) Analysis Set  will consist of those subjects in the FAS  who did not 
have any protocol deviations that could potentially have a substantial impact on the primary 
efficacy outcome. The precise reasons for excluding subjects from the PP Analysis Set will be fully defined and documented prior to the clinical database lock. Subjects will be analyzed

level of 0.05. 
9.5.2 Primary  Analyses 
The primary efficacy variable, AUC
0-24, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_508838] 
(ANOVA) with treatment group and site as factors in the model. Each active dose group will 
be compared to placebo using this model. P- value and associated 95% confidence interval for 
treatment difference betw een each active dose and placebo will be presented. Missing pain 
assessment at scheduled time point will be imputed. The details of missing data imputation 
and multiplicity adjustment will be described in the SAP.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_657823] stratified by [CONTACT_3725] . 
Proportion of patients who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_39897] 24, 48, and 72 hours will be analyzed 
using stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site. 
9.5.4 Secondary Analyses 
Continuous secondary variables will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy variable. 
Proportion of patients who are pain free at each specific timepoint will be analyzed using 
stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site.

TEAEs related to  study drug, TEAEs by [CONTACT_764], fatal TEAEs, and SAEs  reported 
after study drug start  will all be summarized. Other TEAEs of special interest (e.g., ORAEs ) 
may also be summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs and weight, and clinical laboratory parameters, 
including changes from Day -1 ( prior to first dose), will be tabulated by [CONTACT_11191]. 
Additionally, categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
9.5.7 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for ACP -044 will be listed and summarized using descriptive 
statistics. Results will be used for other analyses (e.g., population PK modelling), which will 
be presented in a separate report.  
9.5.8 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
A population PK/PD model to describe the exposure response relationship between ACP -044 
plasma concentrations and the relevant efficacy and safety endpoints will be developed using appropriate PK/PD methods. Results will be presented in a separate report. 
9.5.9 Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses may be performed in subgroups. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim ana lyses are planned for this study. 
9.7 Measures to Minimize Bias  
On Day - 1 eligible  subjects who meet inclusion and do not meet exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1600 mg ACP -044, administered either once daily or 
400 mg every 6 hours, or placebo, according to a randomization schedule. Treatment 
assignments will be blinded to all study subjects, Investigators, site personnel  (with the 
exception of the unblinded pharmacist and verifier), and Sponsor personnel. An unblinded 
pharmacist and a verifier will prepare the study drug and shall have no role in pain assessment or patient care. 
In order to maintain the double-blind design of the study, all subjects will receive the same 
numbers of tablets at the same intervals , regardless of the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. Placebo tablets  will be size - and color -matched to the ACP -044 tablets.

For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and t he clinical database is locked.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if 
unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides 
that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_139115] a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the  participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the 
sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_657825] of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_431849]/or auditing by [CONTACT_259006]. 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), regulatory authorities (including inspectors), and the IRB/EC direct  (or remote ) access to source documents (such as original medical 
records)  as allowed by [CONTACT_427]. Direct (or remote) access includes permission to 
examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study, either in person or through a remote video/electronic medium, if applicable. The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents

11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial 
are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following documented activities: 
• Critical Process and Data Identification: during protocol development, risks of 
processes and data that are critical to ensure human subject protection and the reliability of trial results are identified and assessed.  
• Risk Identification: risks to critical trial processes, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified.  
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by [CONTACT_387436]: 
(a) likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data 
integrity, and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be avoided, reduced (i.e., mitigated ), or accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: [ADDRESS_657832] safety 
or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the clinical study report (CSR).

inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records need ed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. T he monitor may review documents 
remotely, as needed , in conjunction with site policies and procedures. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, sites participating in 
this study may be audited. These audits may include a review of site facilities (e.g., 
pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related records may 
occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with  the protocol, ICH guidance 
on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The Sponsor’s or designee ’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject  
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

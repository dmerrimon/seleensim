Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_87002] on infection establishment.  
 
In this protocol , we will examine the early skin immune response to bites of three 
arthropods: the mosquito Aedes aegypti , the vector of Zika, d engue, and c hikungunya 
viruses; the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the vector of malaria; and the sand fly 
Lutzomyia longipalpis , the vector of leishmaniasis.  We will also explore how multiple 
vector bite exposures over time modulate future immune response at the bite site.  
Healthy participants will come to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) and undergo 
feeding by [CONTACT_79816], then have three skin punch biopsies performed by 
[CONTACT_79817]. Participant s in Cohort 
A will have one feeding; participants in Cohort B will have 4 feedings, each 2 weeks 
apart . Biopsies will be collected after the final feeding. Blood will be collected after the 
one feeding in Cohort A and after the fourth and final feeding in Cohort B  to assess 
systemic immune response.  
 
With the current rise of vector -borne diseases in the [LOCATION_002]  and around  the world, 
we hope the results of this study contribute to future vaccine design and clinical 
development strategies  for vector -borne diseases.

Page 12 of 46 1 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Background Information 
Arthropod -borne diseases are emerging and re -emergi ng globally at a rapid pace [1]. 
Malaria, le ishmaniasis, and dengue cause signifi cant morbidity and mortality in many 
parts of the world, and the emergence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_79789], chikungunya, and West Nile 
viruses show how quickly these diseases can spread [2]–[4]. Studies of pathogenesis 
and vaccine development for these diseases have mostly focused on the pathogens 
themselves, and little  attention has been given to the role of their  vectors. Many of these 
vectors deliver the pathogens into the skin of humans while taking a blood meal, and a 
cumulative body of evidence from animal models demonstrates that in the  process  of 
delivering a pathogen , a variety of vector -derived component s are co -delivered that may 
play an important role in the establishment of infection [5]–[7].  
 
The majority of vaccines developed against vector -borne diseases have not been 
effective in humans despi[INVESTIGATOR_79790]. Most 
developed vaccines ignore the importance of the complex infectious inoculum delivered 
by [CONTACT_79818]. In addition, 
many preclinical studies are carried out in animal models that do not replicate natural 
infec tion and do not evaluate what role the vector plays in these infections. As a  
consequence,  many vaccine candidates fail during development. For example, 
Leishmania candidate vaccines have demonstrated protection in animals challenged 
artificially  by [CONTACT_79819]  a needle but not when challenged naturally by 
[CONTACT_79820]  [8].  
 
We lack a clear understanding of the immune response in skin after insect bites and how 
that response  affects disease initiation and efficacy of vaccines against these important 
pathogens. Furthermore, many clinical studies are performed in naïve individuals who 
have never been exposed to the vector , while people living in endemic areas will have 
long-term exposur e to these vectors and different immune response to subsequent bites , 
which could interfere with vaccine effectiveness. These are likely important factors in 
why many of these vaccines fail once they move on to clinical trials.  
 
In this protocol , we propos e to perform a careful examination of  the early skin immune 
response to bites of three arthropods: the mosquito Aedes aegypti , the vector of Zika, 
dengue, and chikungunya viruses; the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the vector of 
malaria; and the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis , the vector of leishmaniasis. We will also 
explore how multiple vector bite exposures over time modulate future immune response 
at the bite site.   
        
                                                                              
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_87003]  [9]. 
Vector  saliva has been shown to inhibit  T- and B -cell proliferation and downregulate the 
expression of interferon gamma (IFN -γ), a soluble T helper cell  type 1 (Th1) pro-
inflammatory immune mediator known to have in vivo therapeutic and prophylactic 
effects against other arthropod- transmitted diseases such as leishmaniasis  [10]–[12]. 
With time and repeated  exposure, individuals become desensitized to mosquito bites 
due to a reduction in T helper cell type 2 ( Th2) cytokine mediators, thus allowing for the 
more effective development of pro- inflammatory Th1 responses  [10].  
 
When comparing  the effect on parasite dissemination of needle infection vs.  
transmission of Leishmania donovani  by [CONTACT_79821]; mice only injected with 
virulent parasites  demonstrated that the parasites  did not visceralize to the spleens of 
the animals ; in contrast, animals infected by [CONTACT_79822] a sand fly had  spleen 
visceralization of the Leishmania parasite (Figure 1). The immune profile and cellular 
recruitment at the injection/ bite site of animals infected by [CONTACT_79823] . Animals bitten by [CONTACT_79824]-
infected sand flies activ ated the host inflammasome and displayed an increased 
recruitment of neutrophils that was sustained for more than 18 hours , a completely 
different innate response than  animals who received parasite injected by [CONTACT_79825] (Figure 
2). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_79791] . also reported  similar findings , show ing that Aedes aegypti  mosquito 
bites induced an inflammatory response in mice characterized by [CONTACT_79826], and this immune response augmented the severity of Semliki Forest and 
Bunyamwera virus infections [13] . All these results strongly suggest that a vector bite 
(mosquito es or sand flies) alter s the skin environment , and consequently , the 
establishment of the parasite or virus delivered by [CONTACT_79827]. Our objective is to 
translate these findings in animal models to human studies , as well as  to gain a better 
understanding of the immune responses generated in the skin of humans and how t his 
information can help us to design or improve  test vaccines targeting vector -borne 
diseases.

Concerning adaptive responses after multiple exposures to vector saliva, various  groups 
have shown that saliva of insects or bites of an insect can alter the immune response in 
rodents, dogs , and non -human primates [13]–[15]. In rodent models , Teixeira et al. have 
shown that the cytokine and chemokine environment in the skin changes significantly 
when the rodent was previously exposed to bites of sand flies c ompared to naïve 
animals [16]. In dogs , Collin et al.  have shown tha t multiple sand fly bites generate an 
adaptive immune response that can be recalled by a sand fly bite [14] . In non -human 
primates and in human subjects living in  a sand fly -prevalent area,  a skin immune 
response to bites of uninfected sand flies  was observed [15], [17] . These data show that 

Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 15 of 46 bites of vectors can generate a specific systemic immune response to vector -derived 
factors; we aim to investigate the nature of the adaptive immune response to vector bites 
in the skin of humans. This may elucidate how the immune response may affect the 
efficacy of vector -based vaccines currently in clinical trials.  
 
This study will be the first to carefully examine the early immune response to bites of 
different vectors in humans and to explore how multiple exposures over time modulate future local skin responses , potentially affecting pathogen transmission and vacci ne 
efficacy. We hypothesize that bites of arthropod vectors of disease egest specific vector -
derived factors including saliva that modulate the innate immune response in naïve 
individuals not previously exposed to vector bites (Cohort A) and recall a saliv a-specific 
adaptive immune response to the bite site in previously exposed individuals (Cohort B), 
thereby [CONTACT_79829]. 
Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the role vector -derived 
factors play in the establishment of vector -borne infections in humans. These findings 
may be useful in determining why many current vaccine candidates fail as they move 
further into clinical development . Additionally, the findings  will be essential in informing 
future vaccine design and clinical development for both well -established vector -borne 
diseases like malaria and dengue as well as emerging threats requiring t he rapid 
development of countermeasures like Zika and c hikungunya viruses.

3.1 Description of the Study Design 
This is a  single -center , case -control study  of healthy skin immune response to  bites of  
three species of colony -reared arthropods not infected with any pathogen . Healthy 
participants will undergo vector feeding with one of the three types of vector s as 
described in Table 1. Participants will be assigned to a vector in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Additionally, participants will be assigned to a cohort : Cohort A will undergo a single 
feeding and Cohort B will undergo 4 feedings , each about 2 weeks apart .

After the one  vector feeding for Cohort A, participants will undergo skin punch biopsy at 
three sites: two at the sites of bites at 2 different time points (case) and one from 
unbitten skin (control). After the fourth and final vector feeding  for Cohort B,  participants 
will undergo skin punch biopsy at  three  sites: two at the sites  of bite s at 2 different time 
points  (case), and one from unbitten skin (control).  Skin biopsies will be used for 
research tests to evaluate local immune response to vector bites. Additionally, systemic immune response will be evaluated on blood collected after the one feeding for Cohort A 
and after the fourth and final feeding for Cohort B .

12. Pregnant or breastfeeding.  
 
Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, but may take 
place after consultation with the study staff and approval from the PI. 
4.5 Justification  for Exclusion of Special Populations 
Exclusion of P regnant Women:  In this study, participants will have multiple exposures 
to mosquito or sand fly bites. Because  pregnant women are known to be 
immunosuppressed to some degree and the primary objective of the study is to examine 
immune response  to vectors, they will be excluded so as not to compromise the 
scientific validity of the study.  
 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0

Page 21 of 46 Exclusion of Children: This is a study of the adult immune response to insect bites.  
Therefore, children will be excluded from the study.  
5 Study Intervention  
5.1 Arthropod Feeding  
At the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research (LMVR), established state of the art 
insectaries for both mosquitoes and sand flies have been inspected and certified by [CONTACT_79834]2 (arthropod containment level 2) insectaries. The sand fly colony of Lutzomyia longipalpis  originates from Brazil and was initially established at the 
Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases and was brought to LMVR in 2004. The Aedes aegypti  
and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were first established in [ADDRESS_87011] response to saliva, each bite site will be distinguished by a red pi[INVESTIGATOR_79797],  visible to the eye with careful inspection of the skin. Other  participant s may 
be more reactive to component of saliva,  such as vasodilators , and will exhibit clear 
redness and/or induration that denotes a clear site of bite.  
 
Each  feeding will be conducted as follows:  
i. Assessment of the skin will be documented pre -feeding.  
ii. Depending on the cohort, starved female Aedes aegypti  mosquitoe s, 
Anopheles  gambiae mosquitoe s, or Lutzomyia longipalpis  sand flies will 
be selected from a colony approved for human feeding studies in LMVR, NIAID.   
a. 5-10 female insects will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_79798] a secured 
feeding device prior to feeding and brought to the CC from the LMVR Insectary.  
iii. The feeding site will be wiped clean with mild unscented soap and water 
and the device will be placed on the participant’s arm for up to 20  
minutes.  The insects  will feed through a disposable mesh on the bottom 
of the feeding device. This device permits the evaluation of feeding on 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 22 of 46 the human participant at the end of exposure, where the abdomen of 
blood fed mosquitoes or sand flies will be distended and bright red, and 
clearly visibile through the mesh .  
a. In the unlikely event of no feeding or poor feeding (only 0- 2 
insects  fed or probed as noted by [CONTACT_32341]), the particip ant 
may undergo a repeat feed with 5- [ADDRESS_87012]-feeding, redness, swelling and number of visible bites will be 
assessed and documented immediately (+15 minutes) and 30 minutes (+15 minutes) after the feeding device is removed. This may also 
include taking photographs of the bites.  
v. Once the mosquitoe s or sand flies  have fed,  they will be brought back to 
the lab for  evaluation and then  disposal . 
 After each feeding, participants may be offered standard treatment as needed to control 
reactions to vector bites.  These treatments may include cold compresses, topi[INVESTIGATOR_79799], or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826]. O n days when biopsies will be performed, necessary 
treatment to control the reaction to the vector bite will be offered after the biopsy is completed. Any necessary treatment to control bleeding, discomfort, or reduce scarring 
from the biopsy will also be offered.  
[ADDRESS_87013] at  the NIH CC. All aspects of the protocol will be carried out in 
accordance with NIH guidelines , and International Council on Harmonis ation ( ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP)  involvi ng human participant research. The study schedule is 
described below and in Appendix  A: Schedule of Procedures/Evaluations.  
6.1 Enrollment  
At the time of enrollment, participants will  be assigned to one of two cohort s and one of 
three vector groups based on their history of exposure and vector -specific ELISA results 
performed during screening (for Cohort A only, see Section 4.3) . Vector assignment  will 
also consider participant  availability , since  not all  vector s may be available for feeding on 
the same feeding day . Participants may be assigned to any of the vectors or groups until 
a group is full. At that point , participants will only be assigned to vectors and groups that 
have not been completely enrolled. If a participant is only eligible for a vector or group 
that is already completely enrolled, they will not continue with consent and enrollment.  
 
The researc h team will thoroughly discuss the informed consent  form with each eligible 
individual and obtain consent prior to performing any study  procedures . This process 
may take place within 90 days of  or on Day 0 before any research procedures are 
performed.

8 Potential Risks and Benefits  
8.1 Potential Risks  
8.1.1  Risks of vector feeding  
Vector feeding may result in itchiness,  pain, swelling, and redness at the site of bites . 
These reactions resolve after a short period of time and pose little risk to the participant. 
Applying cold packs and administering over -the-counter pain medications  or 
antihistamines  (topi[INVESTIGATOR_79803])  if necessary can generally treat these reactions. Vector 
feeding or scratching after vector feeding may result in scarring such as 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. In rare cases a more severe irritation could occur, such as 
anaphylactic reaction or secondary infection at the site of the bite. Signs of infection 
include pain, redness, swelling, and drainage at the site.  Oral antibiotics  or 
anti-inflammatory medications  can be administered if necessary.  
8.1.2  Risks of skin punch biopsy  
Risks of biopsy include local pain, bleeding, redness, infection, a  scar and possible 
keloid formation. Oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_79804]. Any non- routine complications resulting from the 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 29 of 46 procedure will be addressed in consultation with the NIH CC Dermatology service. 
Injection of l ocal anesthetic may cause a  minimal burning discomfort or bruising at the 
site of the needle puncture.  
8.1.3  Risks of blood draw  
Risks of blood draw include pain, bruising, bleeding,  local discomfort, lightheadedness, 
dizziness  or possibly fainting and rarely infection  or blood clot . The amount of blood 
drawn will be within the limits allowed for adult participants  by [CONTACT_79837] (Medical 
Administrative Policy 95- 9: Guidelines for Limits of Blood Drawn for Research Purposes 
in the Clinical Center:   
http://cc -internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95- 9.pdf ).  
8.[ADDRESS_87026]  benefit to the participant.  The information collected from this study will 
allow a better understanding of  the skin immune response to vector bites to inform future 
vaccine development . 
9 Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens, and  Data  
Intended Use: Samples , specimens  and data collected under this protocol may be used 
to study aspects of leishmaniasis, Zika virus infection , and other vector -borne diseases .  
Storage: All of the stored study research samples are labeled by a code that only the 
investigators can link to the participant. Samples are stored in a freezer within a secure laboratory  with limited access. Data will be kept in password- protected computers. Only 
investigators or their designees will have access to the samples and data.   
Tracking: Samples and data acquired under this protocol will be track ed using a 
database located on  password- protected computer s, which will be maintained by [CONTACT_79838].  
Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol:  
• In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study 
these samples and/or data. Bef ore any sharing of samples, data, or clinical 
information, either  institutional review board (IRB) approval must be obtained 
or the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research Protections (OHSRP) must determine that the research is exempt from IRB oversight. OHS RP can make 
this determination for some research where the samples or data have no 
personal identifying information about the study participant and the 
researcher is not able to ascertain it.  
• At the time of protocol termination, samples will either be des troyed, or after 
IRB approval, transferred to another existing protocol. Data will be archived 
by [CONTACT_79839]; alternatively, after IRB approval, the data may be either destroyed or 
trans ferred to another repository.  
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 30 of 46 Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB:  
• Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples  or data (for example, due to 
freezer malfunction) that meets the definition of protocol deviation or 
unanticipated problem (UP),  and/or  compromises the scientific integrity of the 
data collected for the study will be reported to the NIAID IRB.  
• Additionally, participants  may decide at any point not to have their samples 
stored. In this case, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_79805]. This decision will 
not affect the individual ’s participation in this protocol or any other protocols 
at NIH.  
10 Data Sharing Plan  
Human data generated i n this study will be shared for future research as follows:  
• De-identified data in an NIH -funded or approved public repository.  
• De-identified data in another public repository.   
• Identified data in the Biomedical Translational Research Information System 
(BTRIS, automatic for activities in the CC).  
• De-identified or identified data with approved outside collaborators under 
appropriate agreements.  
• Data sharing may be complicated or limited in certain cases by [CONTACT_79840] c ollaborators, such as cooperative 
research and development agreements (CRADA), clinical trial agreements 
(CTA), other restraints, etc.  
 
Data will be shared through:  
• BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center).  
• Approved outside collaborators under appropriate individual agreements.  
• Publication and/or public presentations.  
 
Data will be shared at the time of publication or shortly thereafter . 
11 Remuneration Plan  
Participants w ill be compensated according to Table 2 below . Study visits will be 
compensated according to the number of visits the participant completes. Participants 
will only be compensated for the protocol visits and interim visits  requested by [CONTACT_79841]. Remuneration will be provided to the 
participants in Cohort  A after the completion of the day 7 phone call . Remuneration will 
be provided to participants in Cohort B two times : after th e completion of Day [ADDRESS_87027] participates in Cohort A and Cohort B of the same vector, he/she will 
undergo Day 0 Feeding only once as part of Cohort A (which will also count for Day 0 
Feeding for Cohort B).  Therefore , these participant s will not be compensated for Day 0 
of Cohort B . They wi ll receive compensation for the other protocol visits as described 
above and outlined below.

Severity grading for clinical events that are not found in the FDA Healthy Volunteer 
Toxicity Table will be graded according to the following grading scale:  
• Grade 1 (Mild)  
Events causing no or minimal interference with daily activity . 
• Grade 2 (Moderate)  
 Events causing greater than minimal interference with daily activity but not 
requiring medical intervention.  
• Grade 3 (Severe)  
 Events causing inability to perform daily activity and/or requiring medical 
intervention.  
• Grade 4 (Potentially Life- Threatening)*  
 Events causing inability to perform basic self -care functions OR medical or 
operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death . 
 
*Note:  A severity assessment of “potentially life- threatening” is not necessarily the same 
as life-threatening as a  “serious adverse event” (SAE)  criterion. The latter means that 
the event is an immediate threat to life as opposed to a potential threat to life.

Page 32 of 46 12.2 Recording/Documentation  
At each contact [CONTACT_6635], information regarding AEs will be elicited by 
[CONTACT_79842] . All 
events, both expected/unexpected and related/unrelated will be recorded on a source 
document. Source documents will include: progress notes, laboratory reports, consult 
notes, phone call summaries, survey tools, and data collection tools. Source documents will be reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_5051]. All reportable AEs that are identified will be recorded in the Clinical Research Information Management System of 
the NIAID (CRIMSON) . The start date, the stop date, the severity of each repor table 
event, and the PI’s judgment of the AE’s relationship and expectedness to the study 
intervention will also be recorded in CRIMSON.  
 All vital sign, physical exam, and laboratory abnormalities found prior to the first arthropod feeding will be documen ted as a baseline finding (not an AE) and will be 
assessed for clinical significance . The participant will be reassessed for inclusion or 
exclusion to undergo each feeding. After the first arthropod feeding, all new gradable 
abnormalities not found at baseline will be reported as AEs.   
 
Causality (likelihood that the event is caused by  [CONTACT_34144]) will be assessed 
considering the factors listed under the following categories:  
 
Definitely Related  
• Reasonable temporal relationship 
• Follows  a known response pattern  
• Clear  evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
• There  is no alternative etiology  
 Probably Related 
• Reasonable temporal relationship 
• Follows  a suspected response pattern (based on similar products)  
• No evidence of a more likely alternative etiology  
 Possibly Related 
• Reasonable temporal relationship 
• Little  evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 Unlikely Related  
• Does not have a reasonable temporal relationship  
OR 
• Good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 
Not Related  
• Does  not have a temporal relationship  
OR

Page 33 of 46 • Definitely  due to an alternative etiology  
 
Note:  Other factors should also be considered for each causality category when 
appropriate. Causality assessment is based on available information at the time of t he 
assessment of the AE. The investigator may revise the causality assessment as 
additional information becomes available.  
12.3 Definitions  
Expected Events 
The following are mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2) signs or symptoms that are 
induced by [CONTACT_79843] .  If deemed related to vector 
feeding or skin biopsy by [CONTACT_978] , they will be not be recorded as adverse events in 
CRIMSON per protocol, unless deemed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a bnormal or greater than Grade 
2. 
 
Feeding:  
• Local swelling  
• Pruritis  
• Erythema  
Biopsy:  
• Local swelling  
• Erythema  
• Bleeding at biopsy site  
• Scar at biopsy site  
 
Reactions should be graded in the following manner:  
 
Grade 1  Mild transient reaction; interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated.  
Grade 2  
 Interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment 
(e.g., antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug s, narcotics, 
intravenous  fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for less than 24 
hours . 
Grade 3  Prolonged (e.g. , not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_38192]/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79806].  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated . 
Grade [ADDRESS_87030], including any abnormal sign, 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the individual ’s participation in 
research, whether or not considered related to the individual ’s participation in the 
research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an AE that results in 1 or more of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening event ( places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred)  
• An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• A medically important event*  
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79807].  
 Protocol Deviation  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved study procedures in a 
research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non- serious and 
further characterized as:  
• Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the 
protocol.  
• Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented.  
• Those that are discovered after they occur.  
 
Serious Protocol Deviation  
A deviation that meets the definition of an SAE or compromises the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or others.  
 Non-compliance  
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects. Non -compliance is further characterized as:  
1. Serious: Non -compliance that  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP.  
d. Invalidates the study data.  
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 35 of 46 2. Continuing: Non- compliance that is recurring.  
3. Minor: Non- compliance that is neither serious nor continuing.  
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 3 of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document , investigator’s brochure, or 
other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly  related to participation in the research;  
3. Suggests that the research places  participants or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, o r social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Serious UP  
A UP that meets the definition of a SAE or compromises the safety, welfare, or rights of 
subjects or others.  
 
UP that is not an AE (UPnonAE )  
A UP that does not fit the definition of an AE, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], involve risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data . These events may involve a greater 
risk of social or economic harm to subjects or others rather than physical/psychological harm. Such events would be considered non -serious UP s. Examp les of a UPnonAE 
include a breach of confidentiality , accidental destruction of study records , or 
unaccount ed-for study drug.  
12.[ADDRESS_87031] that may require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation 
include, but are not limited to:  
• Excessive reactions to study intervention.  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a study intervention.  
• Medication error involving a product (with or without participant  exposure to 
the study intervention, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]) . 
 
Special reporting situations will be recorded.  Any special reporting situation that meets 
the criteria of an  SAE should be reported as described in sections 12.4.[ADDRESS_87032] of the protocol will not be reported to the IRB 
unless they occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. . 
12.4.4  Annual reporting to the NIAID IRB  
The following items will be reported  to the NIAID IRB in summary at the time of 
continuing review:  
• Serious and non -serious UPs  
• SAEs that are possibl y, probably, or definitely related to the research  
• SAEs that are not related to the research  
• All AEs, except expected AEs granted a waiver of r eporting  
• Serious and n on-serious protocol deviations  
• Serious, continuing, and minor non -compliance 
• Any trends or events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_52567]  
• A summary of accumulated safety data  
12.5 Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy itself i s not an AE, events occurring during pregnancy, delivery, or 
in the neonate (e. g., congenital anomaly/birth defect) may be AEs or SAEs.  
 
In the event of pregnancy, the following steps will be taken:  
• Discontinue the study intervention and procedures but con tinue to follow -up for 
safety.  
• Report to the IRB.  
• Advise research participant to notify the obstetrician of study participation and 
study intervention exposure.  
12.6 Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Participants after AEs  
AEs that occur following enrollment of the participant (by [CONTACT_79844]) will be followed until the final outcome is known or until the end of the study follow -up 
period. AEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_40738] -up period w ill be 
recorded as “not recovered/not resolved.” If a participant is lost to follow -up and AEs 
have not resolved, the outcome of these AEs will be recorded as “unknown.” Any  
participant who experiences complications due to  feeding or biopsy  will be followe d until 
such complications  have resolved or appropriate referral to the necessary medical care 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 37 of 46 has been made.  For SAEs, i f it is not possible to obtain a final outcome (e .g., the 
participant is lost to follow -up), the reason a final outcome could not be ob tained will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_79845] . 
 
SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_1008] -up period will be followed until final  
outcome is known. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE (e.g., the 
participant is lost  to follow -up), the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_79846].   
12.[ADDRESS_87033] in this study include any of the following:  
• A subject experiences an SAE that is possibly, probably,  or definitely related 
to a study intervention;  
• A subject experiences two  Grade 3 or greater AE s that are possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to a study intervention;  
• Any safety issue that the investigator determines should pause administration of a study intervention to a single subject.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_79808].  The study may also be paused for an entire group if a safety concern 
is identified.  
12.7.1  Reporting a p ause  
If a pausing criterion is met, a description of the AE(s) or safety issue must be reported by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_87034] who does not resume study interventions  will continue to be followed for 
safety.  
12.8 Halting Rules for the Protocol  
Halting th e study requires immediate discontinuation of study intervention administered 
for all participants  and suspension of enrollment until a decision is made whether or not 
to continue enrollment and study intervention administration.  
 
The halting rules are:  
Skin immunity to vector bites

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_79811]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_79812].  
 
Participants  who do not resume study intervention  will continue to be followed for safety.  
12.9 Premature Withdrawal of a Participant  
An individual participant will be withdrawn for any of the following:  
• An individual participant’s decision. (The investigator should attempt  to determine 
the reason for the participant’s decision.)  
• Non-compliance with study procedures to the extent that it is potentially harmful 
to the participant or to the integrity of the study data (e.g., participant misses a 
feeding visit beyond visit window) . 
• A change in the participant’s baseline condition after enrollment so that the 
participant no longer meets one or more of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• The investigator determines that continued participation in the study would not be 
in the best i nterest of the participant.  
12.[ADDRESS_87035] protections are appropriate and comply with applicable 
regulations and guidance.  
 
13.1 Monitoring  
To help ensure that NIH/ ORSC Good Clinical Practices are being carried out, a Clinical 
Trials Management (CTM)/ RCHSPP designee on behalf of  OCRPRO will conduct a 
Study Initiation Visit (SIV) prior to study enrollment beginning. The purpose of this 
meeti ng is to review with the Principal Investigator (PI) and study team their roles and 
responsibilities, as well as their commitment to adhere to the requirements of the 
protocol, especially in terms of AE, SAE and UP reporting requirements 
(NIH/OHSRP).  In addition, the quality management and data management plans for the 
study will be reviewed.  
[ADDRESS_87036] made estimates that will allow us to see useful differences between bittena 
dn unbitten skin.  
14.1 Study Hypothesis 
The study hypothesis is that there will be differential transcriptomic gene expression and 
immunihistochemical differences  between the cases ( bitten skin)  and controls ( unbitten 
skin from the opposite arm ) with regard to innate immune markers  at Day [ADDRESS_87037] to see differential  gene 
expression and immunohistochemical differences of adaptive immune markers  between 
cases (bitten skin) biopsies collected on Day 42 and Day 44 (experienced cohort ) as 
compared to controls  (unbitten skin) . 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_87038] estimated approximately 13,000 genes 
per biopsy of healthy individuals [18] . This large number of genes will be examined to 
find a smaller list of differentially expressed genes within cohorts.  To analyze the data, 
non-normalized raw counts will be used with an analysis program (e.g.,  the EdgeR 
package ) to perform differential gene expression analysis after quality control of 
samples. Our anticipated analysis program will utilize model -based scale normalization, 
estimate dispersions, and apply a negative binomial model for RNA  transcriptomic  data 
analysis to find differentially expressed genes.   
 Single comparisons w ill be made within cohorts of bitten skin at a particular timepoint to 
the unbitten skin biopsy.  Because our study will analyze paired samples ( bitten skin  and 
unbitten skin biopsies from the same individual ), we can employ two different 
approaches. First, we can apply general linear modelling  (GLM)  using a GLM likelihood 
ratio test for comparing bitten versus unbitten skin . Also, we can employ  group- wise 
comparisons where negative binomial fitting is  followed by [CONTACT_79847]. FDR adjustment 
will be  used for  multiple testing correction. An FDR threshold of 0.1 for statistical 
significance is typi[INVESTIGATOR_79813]. Genes with larger differential expression will be  defined 
with a log-fold-change  threshold of 0.5 (i.e. , 50% change between experimental 
conditions).  
 Currently it is unknown how uniform skin immune responses to bites of these vector are 
and how much variability will be observed.  Therefore it is very difficult estimate an exact 
samples size.  As this study is very exploratory in nature it is likely with the relative small 
number of individuals in each cohort the results will be very informative of future studies 
as it will offer more insight into the diversity or lack thereof in the skin responses.  The 
cohort sizes of [ADDRESS_87039] adequat e numbers to perform these detailed 
and expensive immunohistochemical and transcriptomic techniques that could lead to 
future larger studies with more focused testing once the differential genes and important areas of immune response are identified.   
 
15 Ethics/Protection of Human Participants  
15.1 Informed Consent Process 
Informed consent is a process where information is presented to enable persons to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research participant. It is an ongoing conversation between the human research participant and the researchers, which 
begins before consent is given and continues until the end of the participant’s 
involvement in the research. Discussions about the research will provide essential 
information about the study and include: purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternativ es, risks, and benefits. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask 
questions and have them answered.  
 
Skin immunity to vector bites  
Protocol Version 3.0  
February 1 , 2019  
Page 41 of 46 The participants will sign the informed consent document prior to undergoing any 
research procedures. The participant s may withdraw consent at any time throughout the 
course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The researcher will document the signing of the consent 
form in the participant’s medical record. The rights and welfare of the participant will be 
protected by [CONTACT_79848].  
15.1.1  Non-English –speaking participants  
If a non -English –speaking part icipant is unexpectedly eligible for enrollment, the 
participant will be provided with the CC Short Written Consent Form for Non- English –
Speaking Research Participants in the participant’s native language and a verbal explanation of the purpose, procedures , and risks of the study  as described in NIH 
HRPP standard operating procedure 12, and 45 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR)  
46.117(b)(2). The IRB -approved English consent form will serve as basis for the verbal 
explanation of the study. The investigator wi ll obtain an interpreter unless the 
investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s language.  Preferably, the interpreter 
will be someone who is independent of the participant (i.e., not a family member). 
Interpreters provided by [CONTACT_79849]. The interpreters will interpret all oral communications (English to target language and conversely) between 
the investigator and a limited E nglish -proficient participant, facilitate discussions, and 
clarify information as necessary . 
 
The IRB -approved English consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_4537] a witness to the oral presentation. The CC Short Written Consent Form will 
be signed by [CONTACT_4538] a witness who observed the presentation of information . 
The interpreter may sign the consent document as the witness and, in this case, will note 
“Interpreter” under the signature [CONTACT_4548]. A copy of both signed forms will be provided to the participant to take home.  
 The investigator obtaining consent will docum ent the consent process in th e participant’s 
medical record (CRIMSON) , including the name [CONTACT_4549]. Further, all instances 
of use of the CC Short Written Consent Form will be reported to the IRB at the time of 
annual review. If the CC Short Writt en Consent Form is used three times or more for the 
same language, this will be reported to the IRB immediately.  
15.[ADDRESS_87040] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
16.1 Data Capture and Management  
Study data will be collected and maintained in CRIMSON and the Clinical Research 
Information System (CRIS)  and collected directly  from participants during study visits 
and telephone calls , or will be abstracted from participants’ medical records . Source 
documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary to confi rm the data abstracted for this study. Data entry 
into these systems will be performed by [CONTACT_4539]. The i nvestigator is 
responsible for assuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, and recorded in a timely manner.  
16.[ADDRESS_87041]. All stored records will  be kept confidential to the extent required by [CONTACT_1032], 
state, and local law.

recurrent glioma.   
Short Title  A Microdose Evaluation Study of ABY- 029 in Recurrent  Glioma  
Protocol Number  N/A 
Phase  Phase 0 microdos e 
Methodology  Patients will be administered a  single  intravenous dose of ABY -029 1-3 hours 
before surgery. At different times during resection, the coregistered surgical 
microscope (Zeiss Pentero enabled with  intraoperative fluorescence imaging , 
iFI) will be focused on a point of interest.  The surgeon will switch to iFI mode 
to capture images of the surgical field.  Quantitative measurements of 
fluorophore concentration will be made at the focal point of the operating 
microscope with an intraoperative probe and biopsy samples will be taken at 
the coregistered point of interest for subsequent histological analyses and ex -
vivo assessments of fluorophore concentration.   In addition, an imaging array 
mounted on second commercial, clinical microscope, will be briefly exchanged 
with the primary scope to take  additional images of the surgical field.   
Study Duration  12-18 months  
Study Center(s)  Single -center , Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center  
Objectives  The primary study objective  is to determine if microdoses of ABY-029 (up to 
6X) lead to detectable signals (defined as signal -to-noise ratio, SNR ≥10, with 
wide-field iFI) in sampled tissues with an EGFR pathology score ≥ 1 based on 
histological staining .  
 
The secondary study objective is to assess  diagnostic accuracy of ABY -029 
detection by [CONTACT_672757], 
and other indicators (e.g. proliferation, infiltration, etc.) as the gold standard, and to measure the molecular uptake and concentration of ABY -
029 in 
resected specimens.  
Number of Subjects  A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 adult patients with a  diagnosis of 
recurrent  glioma will be enrolled .  
Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria  Operable brain tumor in adults with pre-surgical diagnosis of recurrent glioma.

Route, Regimen  
Criteria for s uccessful i FI are locations of all EGFR positive  samples  (defined 
as having a pathology score ≥ 1 based on histological staining) having a 
measurable signal (defined as SNR ≥10). A single micro dose of ABY- 029 at 
30 nanomoles  (237µg)  will be injected into the first 3 patients . If samples  from 
these subjects  meet successful iFI criteria, 3 more patients will be enrolled at 
the same dose, concluding the study with a total of 6 subjects . Otherwise, the 
ABY- 029 dose in the next 3 patients will be increased to 3X (90 nanomoles, 
711 µg). If samples  from these subjects  meet successful i FI criteria, 3 more 
patients will be enrolled at the 3X dose, concluding the study with a total of 9 subjects . If iFI criteria are not met, the next 3 patients will be enrolled at 6X 
dose (180 nanomoles, 1.42 mg).   If iFI criteria are met, [ADDRESS_909286] 3 patients at the 6X dose, enrollment will be stopped with a total of 9 subjects.   
 
Because of the microdosing levels used, the results of the Dartmouth Toxicity Study  (at 10X, 100X, 1000X doses) , and the safety profile of  similar 
compounds (e. g. ABY- 025), we d o not anticipate any serious adverse events 
(SAEs) related to ABY -029. 
Duration of administration  ABY- [ADDRESS_909287].  
Statistical Considerations  Repeated measures  analyses of variance  will be  performed  to account for

CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
This document is a clinical research protocol and describes a human research study. This study will be 
conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 
and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures. All personnel involved in the conduct of this study have 
completed human subject protection training.  
1.1 Background Information 
The focus of this exploratory investigational new drug (e IND) development is to realize a fluorescent 
reporter to guide neurosurgical glioma resection using a synthetic peptide that binds to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (EGFR) and provides an optical fluorescent signal of the concentration.  The combined peptide and fluorophore will be called ABY -029, and is the focus of this first -in-human trial in neurosurgery .  
The initial focus  of this P hase 0  clinical study  is evaluation of drug uptake and concomitant  imaging signal .  
 This research is funded by [CONTACT_672759] R01 CA167413.  Following completion of the manufacturing and nonclinical plans, we will submit an exploratory IND (eIND)  to FDA .  Depending on the findings from 
clinical studies conducted under eIND, we anticipate the submission of a traditional IN D. 
 
Several groups have pi[INVESTIGATOR_672741]  [1] and a platform 
of targeted compounds for surgical appl ications [2-5] in which the surgeon’s white light visual field is 
augmented with fluorescent -guided information. Perhaps the largest clinical experience with fluorescence-
guided resection has been gained in neurosurgery with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin 
IX (PpIX). The approach has been evaluated in a prospective randomized Phase III trial [6] with sufficiently 
positive outcomes to alter standard- of-care in [LOCATION_013] for surgical resection of high grade glioma [7] and 
related studies have been completed and are ongoing at Dartmouth under FDA IND #77,751 for oral 
administration of ALA [8-12]. 
 Clinical motivation exists for pursuing new brain tumor fluorescent probes beyond PpIX  for guiding surgical 
resection. F irst, ALA- induced PpIX fluorescence is enhanced by [CONTACT_105]- tumor -specific molecular proces ses 
related to increased metabolism and blood- brain- barrier breakdown.  Second, w hile these processes 
provide reliable enhancement in high- grade glioma tumors, enhancement at the margin and in low-grade 
glioma is relatively  poor.  Third , the anti -EGFR ABY-[ADDRESS_909288] 
importantly , a wealth of information exists on EGFR fluorophore targeting [13-25] [26-28] which  suggests 
our approach is likely to be successful and could benefit patients with malignant  glioma and other cancers 
whose prognosis is improved by [CONTACT_637653].  
1.[ADDRESS_909289] partners Affibody AB , LI-COR  Biosciences, and the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham (UAB)  Vector Production Facility , with Bachem AG (Switzerland) as the manufacturing 
subcontractor.  
 The Swedish biotechnology company Affibody AB has developed a group of molecules which are small, single domain, non- immunoglobulin proteins based on a 58 amino acid, three- alpha- helical scaffold [ 29, 
30]. The target binding site is composed of 13 s urface- exposed amino acids on helix 1 and helix 2. By 
[CONTACT_672760] 13 amino acids, the company has created large libraries of Affibody
® molecules from 
which ones  that bind to a given target protein are selected (examples include EGFR, HER2 or PDGFRß  
[31-33]) . Their small size and stability, high affinity and target recognition specificity, and rapid 
biodistribution kinetics and clearance make them ideal for in vivo targeting. Affibody molecules can be produced either by [CONTACT_672761]. Site specific modification of Affibody molecules is achieved by [CONTACT_2359] a single cysteine which can be used for modification of maleimide-activated functional groups leading to defined and homogenous products  [34].

CONFIDENTIAL   
LI-COR is a privately held company that is committed to the development of in vivo fluorescence imaging 
during surgery and has been systematically developi[INVESTIGATOR_672742] -infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecules with the 
goal of creating in vivo reporters for targeted contrast. IRDye 800CW is a NIR dye that can be functionalized with either an NHS or maleimide reactive group, allowing it to be attached to a number of biomolecules .[35] 
Recently, cetuximab conjugated to IRDye 800CW  was used at the University of Alabama in a dose 
escalation study in 12 patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck.  After passing  through 
FDA safety and pharmacokinetic studies , the investigators showed positive correlation between 
fluorescence markers  and EGFR levels , and demonstrated that fluorescently labelled molecules can be 
safely administered to humans to identify tumor cells with sub- millimeter resolution [ 36]. 
  The ABY -[ADDRESS_909290] incubating the Z03115- Cys peptide with Dithiothreitol (DTT) , 
to break up Affibody dimers that naturally form , and then mixing the peptide with IRDye 800 CW maleimide 
dye, at a ratio of one dye molecule per peptide molecule.  
 Z03115- Cys is a synthetically generated 59 amino acid peptide  produced by [CONTACT_672762] (Switzerland). The 
peptide has a molecular formula of C
299H468N78092S3 and is composed of (H -Ala-Glu-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Ala-Lys-
Glu-Met-Trp-Lle-Ala-Trp-Glu-Glu-Lle-Arg-Asn-Leu-Pro-Asn-Leu-Asn-Gly-Trp-Gln-Met-Thr-Ala-Phe- Lle-
Ala-Lys-Leu-Leu-Asp-Asp-Pro-Ser-Gln-Ser-Ser-Glu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Glu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Leu-Asn-Asp-Ser-Gln-
Ala-Pro-Lys-Cys-OH).   
 The dye is coupled to the peptide molecule via maleimide chemistry at a single Cys residue at the C -
terminus of the peptide, a s illustrated schematically below .  The conjugation reaction is followed by 
[CONTACT_672763].

1.3 Preclinical Data  
1.3.1  Pharmacology studies (non- GLP)  
The following studies  (performed with a non- GMP batch  of ABY-029) confirm that fluorescently labeled anti -
EGFR Affibody molecul es delineate tumor margins better than a fluorescently labeled anti -EGFR antibody . 
[37,38 ] 
 
• Target binding assay (Biacore)  
Using 3 human tumor models with varying EGFR positive expression, and 1 EGFR negative tumor line for 
rats, Dartmouth determined the EGFR concentration in each tumor model using ABY -029, along with a 
simultaneously delivered reference agent (control affibody -IRDye680RD conjugate). We found that in vivo 
receptor concentration, calculated through receptor concentration imaging (RCI), was strongly correlated with e x vivo pathologist -scored immunohistochemistry and computer -quantified ex vivo immuno- 
fluorescence. Weak  correlation was observed with ex vivo Western blot or in vitro flow cytometry assays.  
 
• Cell binding assays  
o Isolated receptor binding assay  
The dissociation constant  (KD) and receptor -ligand binding on and off rates (Kon and K off) were 
determined using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore, GE Life Sciences). Sensograms were 
acquired and evaluated using the Biacore evaluation software to determine K on and K off using a 
1:1 binding ratio kinetic fitting scheme. The KD value was subsequently calculated using the 
experimentally determined rate constants. We demonstrated that the binding affinity of anti -EGFR 
Affibody with IRDye 800 CW with human and rat EGFR was maintained as compared with anti-
EGFR Affibody alone.  
 
• EGFR phosphorylation assay  
LI-COR Biosciences conducted a study  in 2010 in which they labelled an EGFR -specific Affibody  molecule 
(Eaff) with IRDye800CW maleimide and tested the molecular binding in cell culture and xenograft mouse 
tumor models. This study showed the dye labelled Affibody  was bound and taken up specifically by [CONTACT_281249] -
overexpressing tumor cells. When the fluorescent molecule was intravenously injected into nude mice with 
xenograft tumors, the tumor could be identified [ADDRESS_909291] in the liver, 
followed by [CONTACT_672764]. This study demonstr ated that an Affibody labelled  with a NIR  fluorophore 
holds promise as a molecular imaging agent for EGFR -overexpressing tumors.  
 
• In vitro  cytotoxicity study   
Phototoxic potential of the infrared light source when cells are exposed to ABY -029 was evaluated, 
compared to a known FDA approved phototoxic agent benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid A (BPD -MA) 
and found to be negligible.    
 • Imaging study for localization in U251 orthotopic xenograft glioma in mice  and rats   
Rats or mice were inoculated with orthotopic implantations of a human glioma cell line (U251, F98 or F98-
EGFR) or with PBS (control) in the brain. Tumors were allowed to grow for 2 – 3 weeks before carrying out 
fluorescent tracer experiments.  
 
We demonstrated that ABY-029 penetrated further into the margin of a U251 orthotopic xenograft mouse 
model than did a fluorescently labelled antibody (IRDye 680RD -Erbitux)  (Sexton et al, PLoS One 2013) . 
Longitudinal imaging of mice bearing U251 xenografts grown orthotopi[INVESTIGATOR_672743] 0- [ADDRESS_909292] (LI -COR Biosciences, Inc) 
was used to quantify blood vessel leakage vers us ABY -029 binding to the tumor. We also quantif ied the 
A Microdose Evaluation Study of A BY-029 i n Recurrent Glioma Page 6 
Version: [ADDRESS_909293] fiber optic probe 
measurements in situ and ex vivo. We validated the concept that sufficiently high signal to noise is 
achievable for ABY -029 uptake in the xenograft tumor model for microdose injection levels. This study 
suggests  that microdoses of the compound will be detectable via imaging in human studies.   
 
We used the U251 orthotopic xenograft rat model to demonstrate that distribution and uptake of microdose 
levels of ABY -029 is heterogeneous within a tumor, and that  high fluorescing regions closely match with 
highly overexpressing regions of EGFR, as determined by  [CONTACT_9064]  (D’Souza et al, subm itted 
2016) . We evaluate d the uptake of the preGMP batch of ABY -029 in glioma after intravenous injection in 
normal rats. Fluorescent imaging of ex vivo brain slices from rats was conducted at different time points 
after ABY -029 administration (1 h – 48 h)  to verify which time points provided maximal tumor to normal 
contrast . Although U251 tumor was most clearly visualized [ADDRESS_909294] levels between 10 and 15. 
 We compared uptake of pre -GMP ABY- 029 and in orthotopic  rat model using both an EGFR negative tumor, 
F98, and EGFR positive tumor line, F98- EGFR, which was transfected with EGFR. In addition, we compare 
the uptake of ABY -029 with protoporphyrin IX (PpIX, administered as 5- aminolevulinic acid, ALA), a 
fluorophore currently under investigation for surgical guidance during glioma resection at Dartmouth 
College, and the standard of care for glioma patients in [LOCATION_013]. It was shown that in the EGFR positive 
tumor (F98- EGFR) ABY -029 outperforms PpIX in both the bulk and the margins of the tumors, while they 
performed the same in the bulk EGFR negative tumor (F98) and PpIX showed a slight advantage in the margin of the EGFR tumor (Elliott et al, 2016 submitted). These results show a clear indication that ABY -
029 provides a surgical advantage in EGFR positive tumors.  
1.3.2  Toxicology  stud y (GLP)  
The preclinical toxicology assessment is based on a single- dose toxicity study in one species  conducted at 
Dartmouth.  
 
• Extended single -dose Safety Study in rats  
We conducted a definitive, extended single- dose toxicity study of ABY -029 in Sprague- Dawley rats, 
consistent with the principles outlined in “Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers: Exploratory 
IND Studies” (2006). This study used the non- GMP -manufactured ABY -[ADDRESS_909295] (or ~237 µg for a protein drug, or 3.95 µg/kg in 
a human), and this study used the equivalent rat dose  of 4.898  µg for a 0.20 kg rat  (allowing for a 6.2X rat -
to-human correction for skin surface area) . Following review of FDA guidelines and pre- IND meetings with 
FDA, doses of 10X, 100X  and 1000X were studied to evaluate whether pharmacologically relevant effects 
exist.  The dose levels tested w ere 0.[ADDRESS_909296]-injections

 A comprehensive set of protocol tissues was collected during necropsy and sent to a veterinary pathologist 
for microscopic  examination. No histopathologic evidence of systemic toxicity was associated with the 
single- dose  (10X, 100X, 1000X)  intravenous administration of ABY -029 after 24 hours or 14 days  in the 
study rats.  Further, no toxic effects were observed among any of the animals during the routine daily 
checks.  
 
• Biodistribution Study in normal rats  
Biodistribution of the 100X microdose of ABY-[ADDRESS_909298] were removed and then imaged on the Pearl Imaging System 
(LI-COR Biosciences). We found a  high accumulation of ABY -029 in the liver, skin, lungs, and kidney, which 
are all organs with high endogenous EGFR expression and/or that are involved in the route of excretion. 
No significant difference occurred between ABY -029 accumulation in male and female non- sex organs , 
although males had slightly higher values, possibly due to size of organ v ersus body weight , as injected 
dose was normalized to body weight . Rats without brain tumors had comparably very low levels of ABY-
029 accumulation in normal brain tissue, due to the blood brain barrier .   
 • Pharmacokinetic Study in normal rats  
Plasma pharmacokinetics of the dye was assessed as function of time by [CONTACT_672765] a jugular 
vein catheter at various time points after administration. Pharmacokinetic data was collected from normal 
Sprague Dawley rats at time points from 1 minute to 48 hour) after intravenous injection of 100X microdose 
ABY- 029 (244.9 µg/kg).  Blood plasma was read on a Fluoromax -3 fluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon) , a 
standard curve was created, and all fluorescent data was converted to concentration using the standard 
curve and the bi -exponential plasma curve. The plasma curve created in this study matched closely wi th 
the previously determined pre- clinical plasma curve s, ind icating that the physical and biological 
characteristics of ABY- 029 were closely retained.  The plasma half -life of ABY -029 in normal rats is 
approximately 15- 20 minutes and less than 10% remains in the plasma at 24 hours and is undetectable at 
48 hours. In pre- clinical rat and mouse studies, ABY -029 has been detectable in tissues (tumor, liver, 
kidney) for up to [ADDRESS_909299] ABY -025 
ABY- 025 (Z HER2:2891 -Cys-MMA -DOTA), is a HER2 -specific Affibody® molecule that targets a radionuclide to 
HER2 -receptor expressing tumors, for in vivo diagnosis of HER2- expressing cancer. ABY -025 is a 61 amino 
acid peptide that is modified site-specifically with one DOTA molecule at the side chain of the C -terminal 
cysteine. DOTA acts as chelator for the radionuclide Indium -111 (111In) or Gallium -68 (68Ga). An 
Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) for ABY -025 labeling with 68Ga o r 111In has been filed for

1.4.2  IRDye 800CW in Clinical Trials  
As of March 31, 2016 , seven trials are listed on http://clinicaltrials.gov/  involving the use of IRDye 800CW, 
two that were completed and five are ongoing with patients being recruited.  
 
1) A Phase 1 study was completed (NCT 01508572) ( VEGF -targeted Fluorescent Tracer Imaging in 
Breast Cancer ) (Oct 2011 – Sept 2012), using a VEGF targeted fluorescent tracer to breast cancer, 
imaging with diffuse tomography, opto- acoustic tomography and fluorescence reflectance imaging, with 
administration of 4.[ADDRESS_909303] been 
published. 
 
2) A Phase 1 study  was completed (NCT 02113202) ( Molecular Fluorescence Endoscopy in P atients 
with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Using Bevacizumab -IRDye800CW ) between March [ADDRESS_909304] ered 
Bevacizumab- IRDye800  at 4.5mg, 10mg or 25mg at 1- 3 days prior to endosc opy.  The study’s primary 
objective was to determine the sensitivity of the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab- IRDye800CW , a NIR 
fluorescence endoscopy platform , in identifying adenomatous polyps.  Results have not been published. 
 
3) A Phase 1 study is recruiting patients (NCT 01972373) ( Visualization of Rectal Cancer Dur ing 
Endoscopy, Using a Fluorescent Tracer ), as of 2014, imaging rectal cancer with endoscopy and 
optical tomography methods, using two imaging sessions, each with a dose of 4.5mg of Bevacizumab-
IRDye800, imaged before and then again 3 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy.  In these cases fluorescence imaging is performed 2 days after administration of the conjugate.  30 patients were 
estimated for enrolment.   
 
4) Another Groninigen study is a Phase 1 trial for esophageal imaging (NCT 02129933) ( VEGF -targeted 
Fluorescence Near- Infrared (NIR) Endoscopy in (Pre)Malignant Esophageal Lesions ), approved 
for April 2014 – June 2016.  In this study, 4.5 mg of Bevacizumab- IRDye800 is given  by [CONTACT_340596] 2 days 
prior to fluorescence endoscopy imaging in 10 patients .   
 
5) An ongoing Phase 1 trial in the [LOCATION_002] with IRDye800CW targeted to the EGF receptor, (NCT 
01987375) ( Cetuximab IRDye800 Study as an Optical Imaging Agent to Detect Cancer during  
Surgical Procedures ) is a  dose escalation trial  at the University of Alabama Birmingham . Head and 
Neck cancer is imaged during surgery, with Cetuximab- IRDye800CW conjugate as the administered 
agent. This study is directed by [CONTACT_672766], planned for November 2015  – December 2016. 
Fifteen patients must be shown to tolerate a test dose of unlabelled Cetuximab of [ADDRESS_909305] dose to 10 mg.

CONFIDENTIAL  6) Radboud University  in the Netherlands  is conducting a Phase 1 trail (NCT 02497599) ( Intraoperative 
Dual -modality Imaging in Renal Cell Carcinoma ) with Indium -111-DOTA -girentuximab-
IRDye800CW in renal cell carcinoma patients.   The study will assess the feasibility and safety of 
intraoperative dual -modality imaging with Indium -111-DOTA -girentuximab- IRDye800CW  in [ADDRESS_909306]/CT scan and a partial nephrectomy. The study  will be 
extended by [CONTACT_672767] -modality imaging.  
 
7) A Phase 1 and 2 study at the University Medical Center Groningen  (NCT 02583568) ( Fluorescence 
Guided Surgery in Breast Cancer ) is recruiting patients.  This study will enrol  [ADDRESS_909307] been selected to determine if a fluorescence signal can 
be detected by [CONTACT_133758]-field imaging technology with a signal -to-noise ratio of 10, which is considered 
necessary for subsequent assessment of  diagnostic performance of ABY -029 as a tumor biomarker 
sufficient to guide surgical resection in the future.   No diagnostic or therapeutic intent is proposed, and 
administration of the study drug is not intended to alter the extent of planned brain tumor resection during 
the surgical procedure.  
 Dosing Scheme:  A single microdose of ABY-029 at 30 nanomoles  (237µg)  will be injected into the first 3 
patients . If samples  from these subjects  meet successful i FI criteria  (defined as SNR ≥10 at  locations of 
samples with EGFR pathology score ≥ 1 based on histological staining ), 3 more patients will be enrolled at 
the same dose, concluding the study with a total of 6 subjects. Otherwise, the ABY -029 dose in the next 3 
patients will be increased to 3X (90 nanomoles, 711 µg). If samples  from these subjects  meet successful 
iFI criteria, 3 more patients will be enrolled at the 3X dose, concluding the study with a total of 9 subjects. 
If iFI criteria are not met, the next 3 patients will be enrolled at 6X dose ( 180 nanomoles, 1.42 mg).   If iFI 
criteria are met, [ADDRESS_909308] 3 patients at the 6X dose, enrollment will be stopped with a total of 9 subjects.  
1.6 Potential Risk s and Benefits   
The risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and/or knowledge that might reasonably be expected from the results  of this clinical trial. 
1.6.1  Potential Risks  
Because of the microdos e levels  to be used, the results of the Dartmouth Toxicity Study, and the safety 
profile of  similar compounds (e.g. ABY- 025), serious adverse events ( SAEs) related to ABY -[ADDRESS_909309] -operative radiation and/or chemotherapy. Unfortunately , achieving a high 
degree of tumor removal is often limited by [CONTACT_11065]’s ability to distinguish residual disease from 
intervening parenchyma under conventional white light il lumination, and rates of complete resection have 
A Microdose Evaluation Study of A BY-029 i n Recurrent Glioma Page 10 
Version: 14 February 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  been reported to be as low as 20% in high grade glioma. iFI augments the surgeon’s white light visual field 
with fluorescent informati on, and in the case of ALA- induced PpIX, improved patient outcomes in a 
prospective randomized Phase III trial sufficiently to alter standard- of-care in [LOCATION_013] for surgical resection 
of high grade glioma. While ALA appears to be effective, motivation  exists for pursuing new fluorescent 
probes beyond PpIX  for guiding surgical r esection. First, ALA -induced PpIX fluorescence is not tumor -
specific. Second, fluorescent enhancement at the margin and in low-grade glioma is relatively  poor. Third , 
ABY- 029 has potential to guide a range of  oncolog ic surgeries, given the large number of tumor  types that 
overexpress  EGFR. Fourth , a wealth of information  exists on EGFR fluorophore targeting which  suggests 
our approach is likely to be successful and c ould benefit patients with malignant  glioma and other cancers 
whose prognosis is improved by [CONTACT_637653].  
2 Study Objectives  
The primary study objective  is to determine if microdoses of ABY-029 (up to 6X)  lead to detectable signals 
(defined as signal -to-noise ratio, SNR ≥10, with wide- field iFI) in sampled tissues with an EGFR pa thology 
score ≥ [ADDRESS_909310], and to measure the molecular u ptake 
and concentration of ABY -029 in resected specimens.   
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This study is a  Phase 0 open label, single- center clinical trial of ABY -029, an Anti -EGFR Fluorescence 
Imaging Agent, via single intravenous injection to subjects with recurrent glioma.  The expected duration for 
enrolling study participants is 12 to 18 months, and up to 12 subjects may  be enrolled. Doses of 1X ( 30 
nanomoles  or 237µg) , 3X, and 6X may be considered depending on strength of signal detection with iFI in 
tissues  within the surgical field, subsequently sampled and determined post -operatively to have  positive 
EGFR scores  based on histological staining. 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is signal detection  (defined as  SNR with wide -field iFI)  in vivo in brain tissues  
within the surgical field  intended for resection that are subsequently sampled during surgery and assigned 
an EGFR pathology score based on histological staining.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints of the study are diagnostic accuracy of  ABY-029 detection by [CONTACT_672768], and other indicators (e.g. proliferation, infiltration, etc.)  as 
the gold standard, and measurement of molecular uptake and concentration of ABY-[ADDRESS_909311] Selection and Withdrawal

4.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.5.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects participate in a “one- time” event (i.e., surgery) as part of this study  and are not expected to be 
withdrawn because of subsequent post -surgical conditions and/or scenarios (e.g. the need for alternative 
and/or additional treatment). Subjects may withdraw their consent at any time prior to surgery. Subject data 
collected per protocol may subsequently not be included in the final analysis, if IV administration of A BY-
[ADDRESS_909316] occurred at the proper dose (237µg, 711µg or 1.42mg, depending on the dose 
group) approximately 1-[ADDRESS_909317]-operative end- points or follow -up information is needed to meet study objectives; hence, 
consenting subjects who complete surgery will not be lost to follow -up. 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 
Patients will be administered A BY-029 by [CONTACT_672770] 1-3 hours prior to induction 
of anesthesia. The range of approximately 1-3 hours is acceptable given pre- clinical data indicating that 
imaging signal  levels appear to be stable over this time period. Time from ABY-029 administration to 
surgery is collected. Subjects are considered enrolled in the study once ABY-029 has been injected.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.2 Treatment Regi men 
Groups of up to 6 patients  (as described in Section 1.5) will receive a single injection of ABY- 029 at 1X or 
3X or 6X of the microdose of 30 nanomoles (237µg).  The dose will be administered by [CONTACT_672771] , approximately 1-3 hours prior to the procedure.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
No separate treatment groups are part of the study design.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
ABY- 029 used in this study is stored, prepared, and dispensed by [CONTACT_672772]- Hitchcock Medical Center. (Address: Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Investigational 
Pharmacy, Rubin- 463N3, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH [ZIP_CODE]; email address: 
[EMAIL_12838] ; Tel: 603- 650-7890).    
 
ABY -029 Preparation and Admin istration Procedures:  
1) ABY- 029 is prepared by [CONTACT_672773], typi[INVESTIGATOR_672744], depending on the scheduled surgery date and time.   
2) From the vial containing ABY -029, the required dose is withdrawn into a syringe, labeled, and 
placed into a l ight-impermeable bag .  
3) Once prepared at the requested dose , the drug in the light -impermeable bag is either held by [CONTACT_672774][INVESTIGATOR_140467] a member of the study team, or  stored in a refrigerated 
and locked box in the Same Day Surgery patient holding area. The key to the lock -box is placed in 
an associated Acudose Unit.  
4) The dose of ABY -[ADDRESS_909318] Compliance Monitoring  
Subjects participate in a “one- time” event (i.e., surgery) as part of this study and are monitored through the 
in-patient surgical service during the time of their participation.   
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
This study is a Phase 0 diagnostic trial of ABY- 029 fluorescence as a possible  intraoperative imaging 
biomarker during open cranial surgery for tumor resection. Prior and/or concurrent medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_672745]/or endpoints associated with the study.  
5.7 Packaging  
ABY- 029 is packaged as a transparent , green- blue liquid  in 5mL glass vials  at a concentration of 0.27 
mg/mL, in PBS (phosphate- buffered saline). It is stored at the Investigational Pharmacy at Dartmouth-
Hitchcock Medical Center (Address: Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Investigational Pharmacy, 
Rubin- 463N3, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH [ZIP_CODE]).  ABY- 029 is shipped in clear  glass vials, 
each with a rubber stopper in boxes containing  10 mL units.

5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug 
Once drug assignment is performed, a study authorized staff member (e.g., [CONTACT_290381], his designee) will order ABY -029 through the institution’s electronic medical record. This order will specify the dose of 1X 
(237 µg), 3X (711 µg) or 6X (1.42mg) for ABY -029. Since the concentration in each vial of ABY -029 is 1.35 
mg or  5.7X, in order to conserve our supply of ABY- 029 we will administer a 5.7X dose to the 6X dose 
group in this study, and will call this the “6X dose” throughout this protocol. One dose of ABY -[ADDRESS_909320]. The investigational ph armacy pharmacis t will process this order and a 
pharmacy technician will prepare the ABY -029 dose a s described in Section 5.4 (above)  
5.9.[ADDRESS_909321] will make an entry into 
the electronic investigational drug management database to remove vial(s) used to prepare a dose from 
ABY- 029 drug inventory . A member of the study team will document the amount of ABY -029 administered 
and any amount remaining in the institution’s electronic medical record.  
5.9.5  Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
At the completion of the study, a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining 
will occur. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated. Any 
discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused study drug. Site policy (i.e., Investigational Pharmacy) is to destroy any used, open drug containers on site. Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6 Study Procedures  
This study is a Phase 0 clinical investigation of ABY -029 concentration measured/detected in brain tissue 
through its fluorescence emissions as an intraoperative biomarker of tumor during open cranial surgery for tumor resection. Subjects participate in a “one- time” event/visit (i.e., surgery) as part of this protocol. Images 
and data from the patient’s pre- and post -operative MR scans are used for analysis in the study, but these 
acquisitions are part of the patient’s standard- of-care, would occur independently of whether the participant 
is enrolled, and thus, are not considered to be research study visits. No post -surgical follow -up visit is part 
of the protocol data collection or analysis. Patients are monitored for possible adverse events for approximately 30 days through the routine follow -up under the care of the operating surgeon involved in 
A Microdose Evaluation Study of A BY-029 i n Recurrent Glioma Page 14 
Version: [ADDRESS_909322]- of-care and is available for adverse event 
surveillance.  
6.1 Surgical Visit  
After  the study drug is administered (~1- 3 hours prior to surgery), the patient will be prepared and 
transported to surgery as per routine at  Dartmouth- Hitchcock. In the OR, patient positioning, registration of 
the MR image- guidance system, preparation of the surgical field, and drapi[INVESTIGATOR_672746], 
as will scalp incision and craniotomy. Upon opening of the dura, the coregistered and tracked Zeiss Pentero 
operating microscope adapted for  intraoperative fluorescence imaging (iFI) at 800 nm will be brought in to 
begin conventional image- guided microsurgical technique for tumor resection. At approximately 4 time 
points during each surgery  and/or at the discretion of the surgeon, data/image and specimen acquisitions 
will occur . Three (3) will typi[INVESTIGATOR_672747], at the approximate mid- point of tumor 
resection  (when a significant tumor tissue is in the field), and at a point nearing but prior to completion of 
tumor resection (when small amount of tumor tissue remains), and a fourth may occur at presumed end of 
resection. At each time point, iFI acquisitions will  be recorded. The surgeon will then focus the coregistered 
microscope at discrete points in the operative field which exhibit non- , weakly, moderately, and strongly 
fluorescent emissions, if evident on the iFI scan. At each point, a second iFI will be acquired, optical probe 
measurements  will be recorded and a surgical biopsy specimen will be obtained (except at presumed end 
of resection when no more tissue is planned for excision). Since the 2nd iFI, probe data and biopsy  sample 
will occur each time at the focal point of surgical microscope which is coregistered, all intraoperative images, 
data and specimens will also be coregistered. If no signal is evident on the iFI  scan, the surgeon will sample 
several locations in the surgical field by [CONTACT_672775] s of interest  intended 
for resection, performing the probe measurement s and biopsying the pos itions  for later analysis.  iFI and 
optical probe readings will also be acquired from normal brain to establish baseline/background signal  
levels for the case.  Additionally, an imaging module mounted on a second commercial, clinical microscope, 
will be used to acquire images during surgery.  Acquiring these images will involve moving the primary 
clinical scope out of the field, positioning the new scope to acquire images, and moving the primary scope 
back into place. This process will take approximately three minutes or less and poses no additional risk to the patient. When the case is performed in the Center for Surgical Innovation, and when indicated clinically, 
iMR (intraoperative MRI)  may be acquired and resection may continue based on the findi ngs. In these 
cases, iFI , optical probe and biopsy may  occur at locations planned for resection.  We have used these 
same coregistered image, data, and biopsy procedures in our current studies of ALA-induced PpIX  
fluorescence and have collected high quality information from up to 12-16 surgical specimens per case  
(~10 on average) . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_909323] clinical care will be analyzed according to practice. Tissues taken as part of the study will be bisected immediately in the OR into nearly equivalent pi[INVESTIGATOR_672748] o 10% buffered formalin and the other snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen. If the specimen cannot be divided, the sample will be formalin- fixed.  
6.2 Clinical Laboratory and Monitoring Data   
Since the microdoses  that will be administered are presumed to fall below levels needed to cause 
pharmacological and/or physiological responses/effects that increase subject risks, and the preclinical 
(rodent) results from the Dartmouth Toxicity Study showed no evidence of sy stemic toxicity , either 
histolo gically or in terms of blood chemistry  (in the latter, some clinical chemistry values in dosed animals 
were statistically different from un-dosed controls  at 24 hours , but all levels were well within the normal 
range)  associa ted with much higher  single -doses of ABY-029 (10X, 100X, 1000X), no protocol -specific  
clinical laboratory  or monitoring data associated, for example, with renal or liver function will be collected. 
Data obtained in this patient group as part of standard- of-care laboratory studies and clinical monitoring 
procedures includes  hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, electrolytes (sodium, 
potassium, chlorate, bicarbonate), glucose, BUN and creatinine prior to administration of ABY -029. 
Similarly, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) are monitored pre- operatively, during

Version: [ADDRESS_909324] -operati vely (typi[INVESTIGATOR_672749]). These data will not be collected as part of this clinical protocol per se, but 
will be available for adverse event monitoring, as needed.  
6.[ADDRESS_909325] according to the following criteria: 0 = no staining; 1 = low membranous staining around 
cells; 2 = medium membranous staining completely around cells; and 3 = high membranous staining 
completely around cells. Standard formalin- fixation with paraffin embedding will be used for histopathologic 
type and grade to confirm diagnosis of astrocytoma or glioblastoma (following WHO criteria) by [CONTACT_248571]. As these tumors  are recurrences and patients have received radiation and 
chemotherapy, an assessment of reactive gliosis vs. residual/recurrent glioma will also be scored as well as tumor burden and necrosis using methods previousl y described. Here, histopathology will be classified 
as non- tumor tissue, solid tumor, infiltrating tumor, or indeterminate. Infiltrating tumor will be further graded 
into <33% tumor, >33% but <67% tumor, and >67% tumor ). Proliferation will be assessed by [CONTACT_672776] -[ADDRESS_909326] the anti -EGFR A ffibody following the protocol. 
EGFR protein expression often corresponds to gene amplification, thus, we will assess gene- protein 
correlations on a cell -by-cell basis by [CONTACT_672777] a multi -spectral analysis microscope (Nuance) to distinguish in individual tumor cells. 
Frozen tissue will be solubilized and evaluated for quantitative fluorescence using fluorimetry. Western and/or ELISA will be used if the signal is not sufficiently strong.  
 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size determination is based on the primary objective of the study as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_672750]- 029 localization in EGFR+ tumors with iFI. We estimate a minimum of 6, 
and more typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 12- [ADDRESS_909327] enrolled over 100 
subjects. To assess the adequacy of this sample size, if only 3 patients are enrolled at a specific dose, the study will hav e 80% power to detect a difference in fluorescence signal mean in samples relative to normal 
brain as small as 3.[ADDRESS_909328] 
deviation with the same power and significance level (assuming samples are equally distributed between 
EGFR pathology scoring levels). If [ADDRESS_909329] deviations (at the same 
power and significance level) and to 1.[ADDRESS_909330] deviations for differences in signal mean between two EGFR pathology scoring levels.  
7.2 Data and Statistical Analy sis 
The primary study objective is to relate ABY- 029 fluorescence (resulting from a specific pre- surgical dose) 
measured by [CONTACT_133758]- field iFI to EGFR pathology score (based on IHC staining) of coregistered tissue 
specimens sampled at the same time points during surgery. Similar but more sensitive fluorescence data will be available from the intraoperative optical probe. A minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled at a given dose, and up to 6 patients may be enrolled at one dose, if iFI SNR requirements are met. Assuming 10 specimens are available for analysis on average from the surgical cases at a given dose (this value is 
consistent with average specimen counts in related ALA -induced PpIX studies which have enrolled more 
than 100 subjects), [ADDRESS_909331], if iFI SNR goals are achieved. Clustered 
A Microdose Evaluation Study of A BY-029 i n Recurrent Glioma Page 16 
Version: 14 February 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  data analyses of variance will be performed to account for multiple samples from each pati ent. Student’s t-
test evaluation will be used to determine signal detectability relative to measurements in normal brain, and 
relative to the noise floor of the iFI system determined from laboratory measurements in phantoms. ANOVA 
will also be used assess differences in signal means when stratified by [CONTACT_672778] (0 = no expression, 1 = low expression, 2 = medium expression, 3 = high expression). Pearson’s and Spearman’s -
rank correlations between iFI signal strength and EGFR pathology score will be computed. These analyses 
will be repeated for the optical probe data as well.  
 
Secondary study objectives will be assessed by [CONTACT_672779] a 
diagnostic test with the corresponding specimen histopathological diagnoses as  the gold standard. 
Predictive models (for each pathology) of the odds of tumor positivity for biopsies given concentration of 
ABY- 029 will be constructed. Histologically confirmed tumor status from biopsies will be treated as a binary 
outcome with a logit  link function in a generalized linear mixed model (SAS GLIMMIX) with a subject -specific 
random effect to account for intra- individual correlations among biopsies. The iFI and/or probe fluorescence 
measures will be introduced first as linear terms. Interactions and polynomial fits will also be assessed via 
goodness of fit statistics. The predictive accuracy of the model fit will be summarized through a concordance index, i.e., area under the ROC curve formed with the fitted probabilities of tumor. Analyses  will be repeated  
for other histopathological indicators (beyond tumor/non- tumor) such as degree of proliferation, infiltration, 
ABY- [ADDRESS_909332] Population(s) for Analysis  
This study will involve patients  with recurrent  intra-cranial malignant glioma judged to be operable. Subjects 
eligible for enrollment in the trial will be patients with a previously resected high grade glioma with tissue 
positive for EGFR expression (pathology score ≥ 1 based on histological staining).  
8 Safety and Adverse Events 
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_45584], Safety Monitoring, and Accrual  Committee (DSMAC) of the Norris 
Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center. All unexpected and/or serious adverse 
events will be reported to committee by [CONTACT_350712]  [INVESTIGATOR_672751], along with a determination of their 
relationship to study procedures. Given that brain tumor patients undergoing open surgical resection 
procedures present with post -operative complications and medical events that are expect ed, we will log 
and review all adverse events, but evaluate and report on only those with outcomes that would not routinely be expected in this surgical patient population to the NCCC DSMAC , along with a determination of their 
probable relationship to study procedures. Summaries of study enrollments, clinical status, and data will be submitted for annual review (or more frequently as required depending on enrollment patterns). In the case 
of any unexpected adverse events, the patient’s medical record will be reviewed by a study physician, and 
if necessary, the patient will be examined by a study physician and appropriate medical action taken. The event will be recorded in the patient's study file with the date of occurrence, date of resolution, severity and the actions taken. Any unexpected or serious adverse events, or drug reaction beyond those expected from open- cranial brain tumor surgery that are determined likely to be related to the study procedures, will be 
reported to the Dartmouth IRB and the FDA as  required.

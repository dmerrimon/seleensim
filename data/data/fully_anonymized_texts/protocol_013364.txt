glasses in the study (or changing glasses for children given glasses at the start of the study) include: 70 
 Crossing of the eyes 71 
 Distance vision becomes worse than what is normal for their age  72 
 A large difference in vision develops between eyes 73 
 Depth perception becomes worse than what is normal for their age 74 
 You have concerns about your child’s vision or ability to see well close up  75 
 76 
If your child gets glasses during the study, the glasses may need to be updated as your child’s eyes 77 
change.  Your child’s eye doctor will not change your child’s glasses if they think it is better not to make 78 
the change.  Your child’s eye doctor may also decide that your child needs other treatments in addition [ADDRESS_172027] as if your child were not part of the study.   80 
 81 
If your child gets glasses at the start of the study, you will receive a phone call within 2 weeks from the 82 
eye doctor’s office to make sure there are no problems getting the glasses and answer any questions.  83 
 84 
Follow-up Visits:  85 
Your child will need to return to the eye doctor for follow-up visits every 6 months for 3 years.  The 86 
visits occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after enrollment.  Some children will need to come back 87 
for another visit within 2 weeks after the 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 month visits depending on your child’s 88 
condition.  Some children will need to come back 4 weeks after the 36-month visit if their glasses need 89 
to be changed.  90

   Your child’s eye doctor may decide that more follow -up visits are needed for your child, just as if your 96 
child were not part of the study. 97 
 98 
Your child’s eyes will be tested at each visit to see if they turn in or out, and also see how well your [ADDRESS_172028] his/her eyes dilated with eye drops at [ADDRESS_172029] one time per year, and maybe more often if your child has more vision problems.  These tests 101 
would be done even if your child was not part of the study.  All children in the study will receive 102 
dilating eye drops during the 30- and 36 -month exams. 103 
 104 
4. Risks 105 
Eye Exams: The risks and discomforts for the examinations will be the same whether or not your child is 106 
taking part in the study. 107 
 108 
Glasses:  The risks associated with glasses are the same whether your child receives glasses as part of 109 
the study or not.  Some children experience temporary discomfort or blurred vision when adjusting to 110 
new glasses.  There are no known serious or long-lasting risks. 111 
 112 
Amblyopia or Strabismus: Some children with hyperopia may develop amblyopia (decreased vision in 113 
one or both eyes) or strabismus (crossing of eyes).  Amblyopia or strabismus may develop even if a [ADDRESS_172030].  If amblyopia or strabismus develops, additional treatment may be 118 
needed.  Treatment will start with prescribing new glasses or changing the glasses the child is currently 119 
wearing.  Many cases of amblyopia and strabismus can be corrected with glasses alone.  If needed, 120 
amblyopia may be treated with patching one eye, putting drops in one eye to blur vision, or by [CONTACT_6094] a 121 
blurring filter over the good eye.  If needed, strabismus may be treated several different ways, including 122 
prism, bifocals, vision therapy or surgery.   123

Unknown Risks: Although we have tried to list all possible risks and discomforts, there may be others [ADDRESS_172031].   131

Your child may not directly benefit from taking part in this study.  However, the results of this study 133 
will be very important for doctors treating children with hyperopia in the future. 134

2. BACKGROUND  
 
Allogeneic HSCT  is considered a curative modality  for many patients with high risk hematologic 
malignancie s. Transplantation using a matched related sibling if available leads to improved 
outcomes when compared to other graft sources1. Unfortunately, only about a third of candidates 
for HSCT  have HLA -matched siblings.  For patients who lack HLA -matched siblings, there are 
other  alternative sources of stem cells for HSCT : 1) volunteer unrelated donors; 2) umbilical 
cord blood; and 3) partially HLA -mismatched, or hap loidentical, related donors.  Haploidentical 
HSCT  has been historically associated with significant risks of graft rejection  and severe 
GVHD2, which are manifestations of excessive  alloreactivity by [CONTACT_572963] T cells3, 
respectively.  Earlier study of T cell depletion in the setting of haploidentical HSCT were 
associ ated with prolonged immune compromise and increase risk of mortality from infections4. 
Recently, the use of cyclophosph amide (Cy) post infusion of stem cells has become a new 
standard to reduce the incidence of GVHD without significantly increasing the risk of infections 
seen with T cell depleted haploidentical transplantation5. 
 
Version 6/9/[ADDRESS_752191]-transplant  Cy (PTCY) was studied by [CONTACT_572964]  a non -ablative  
condition ing regimen of non -T cell -depleted marrow from haploidentical first degree relatives6.  
This study showed that optimally  dosed and timed  PTCY , after a conditioning regimen of 
fludarabine and low dose total body irradiation  had an acceptably low risk of graft rejection and 
GVHD, the two major complications of haploidentical HSCT .  All patients received 
mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF)  and tacrolimus, beginning 24 hours after PTCY  administration  
for GVHD prophylaxis . The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery for all patients 
were 15 and 24 days, respectively. Graft failure occurred in a total of 15/84 patients (18%).  All 
but two patients with graf t failure experienced recovery  of autologous hematopoiesis with 
median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment of 24 days (range 11 -48 days) and 44 days 
(range 15 -395 days), respectively.  
 
The cumu lative incidences of grades  II-IV and III -IV acute GVHD were 35% and 10%. 
The cumulative incidence of chronic and extensive chronic GVHD in the first year after 
transplantation for the entire population was 22% and 14%, respectively.  The cumulative 
incidences of NRM at 180 days and 1 year after transplantation were 13% and 19%, respectively. 
The cumulative incidences of relapse at 1 and 2 years after transplantation were 50% and 57%, 
respectively. At a median follow -up of survivors of 817 days (range, 112 -1808 days), the 
actuarial ov erall survival at 1 and 2 years were 45% and 35%, respectively.  
 
  From these results, it was  concluded that a combination of PTCY , tacrolimus, and  MMF 
were associated with an acceptably low incidence of graft rejection,  severe acute GVHD, and 
extensive c hronic GVHD . There was effective  clinical immune reconstitution as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_572965].  Relapse  represented  the major cause of 
treatment failure in this poor risk patient population.   One explanation for the  high rate of 
relapse, as in other nonmyeloablative HSCT trials, is that the transplantation conditioning was 
not intense enough to achieve sufficient tumor cytoreduction.    
 
 Given that relapse remains the largest impediment to success after nonmyeloabla tive 
bone marrow transplantation utilizing PTCY , efforts to reduce relapse remain  an important are a 
of clinical investigation . We have recently published [ADDRESS_752192] study with busulfan based cond itioning established that 
myeloablative haploidentical transplantation can yield full donor chimerism at day 30, grade III -
IV acute GVHD rate of 10%, and a 1 year OS of 69% and DFS of 50%7. The sec ond 
myeloablative study with total body irradiation (TBI)  based conditioning showed full donor 
chimerism at day 30, and a 2 year DFS of 73%8. The limitation of myeloablative regimens is that 
they cannot be  safely  administered for elderly patients or patients with poor organ function , 
increased comorbidities  and poor performance status.  The need of a more intense regimen than 
the non -ablative (Flu darabine /low do se TBI)  but less intensive than the full myeloablative 
Version 6/9/[ADDRESS_752193] -degree relatives utilizing PBSC as the stem cell source.   
The primary objective of the study is to estimate the in cidence of graft rejection  and acute 
GVHD . A secondary objective will be to es timate the incidence of the  relapse, NRM, OS, 
chronic GVHD  and EFS.   
  
3. Drug Information  
 
3.1 Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®)  
 
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent which prevents c ell division  primarily by [CONTACT_12783] -linking 
DNA strands. Cyclophosphamide is cell cycle nonspecific. Cyclophosphamide for injection is 
available in [ADDRESS_752194] is 20 mg/ml. The calculated dose will be diluted 
further in  250-500 ml of Dextrose 5% in water. Each dose will be infused over 1 -2 hr (depending 
on the total volume). Clinical toxicities of cyclophosphamide include alopecia, nausea and 
vomiti ng, headache and dizziness, hemorrhagic cystitis, cardiotoxicity, immunosuppression, 
myelosuppression, pulmonary fibrosis, increased hepatic enzymes and syndrome of 
inappropriate anti -diuretic hormone (SIADH).  
 
3.2 Mesna (sodium -2-mercapto ethane sulphonat e) 
 
Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis  induced by [CONTACT_12785] (cyclophosphamide and ifosphamide). It has  no intrinsic cytotoxicity and no 
antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna  binds with acrolein, the urotoxi c metabolite 
produced by [CONTACT_12786],  to produce a non -toxic thioether and slows the rate of 
acrolein formation by  [CONTACT_12787] 4 -hydroxy metabolites of oxasophosphorines.  Mesna is 
available in 200 mg, 400 mg and 1000 mg vials containing a 100  mg/ml solution. Each dose of 
mesna will be diluted further in 50 ml of normal  saline to be infused over 15 min or as per 
institutional standards. Mesna dose will  be based on the cyclophosphamide dose being given. 
The total daily dose of  mesna is equal to 8 0% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide.  At the 
doses used for uroprotection mesna is virtually non -toxic.  However, adverse effects which may 
be attributable to mesna include nausea and  vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, 
rash, urtica ria, headache, joint  or limb pain, hypotension and fatigue. Mesna will be dispensed by 
[CONTACT_572966].  
Version 6/9/16 7 3.3 Melphalan  
 
 Melphalan is an alkylating agent that is commonly used in stem cell transplant du e to its 
significant myelosuppressive effects. Melphalan will be infused as a single dose on day -1 prior 
to infusion of stem cells. Even with the use of hematopoietic growth factors, significant 
neutropenia is expected. Neutropenic infections and/or need for transfusions of red cells and/or 
platelets may result.  Stomatitis, esophagitis and severe diarrhea are common with high dose 
melphalan: management with i.v. narcotics and potentially i.v. alimentation may be needed.  
Other  less common toxicities reporte d include pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis, 
skin hypersensitivity, vasculitis, alopecia, hemolytic anemia and allergic reaction.  
 
3.4 Fludarabine  (Fludara ®) 
 
Fludarabine phosphate is purin e antimetabolite that, after administration, undergoe s rapid 
conversion in plasma to the nucleoside 2 -fluoro ara -A (F-araA). F -araA subsequently enters cells 
where it is phosphorylated to F -araATP and the monophosphate F -araAMP.  Once activated, F -
araATP inhibits DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase. The monophosphate F -araAMP, 
once incorporated into DNA, is an effective DNA chain terminator.  Fludarabine monophosphate, 
50 mg/vial, is reconstituted with 2 ml of sterile water, resulting in a 25mg/ml solution. The 
desired dose is further diluted to concen trations of 0.04 -1 mg/ml in normal saline or 5% dextrose 
(50-100ml) for injection and will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes or longer.  
Following IV administration, the drug is metabolized to 2 -F-araA and widely distributed in 
tissues.  2 -F-araA is excreted primarily in urine and has a terminal elimination half -life of 7 to 12 
hours.  Clinical toxicities of fludarabine monophosphate include: myelosuppression, primarily 
lymphopenia and granulocytopenia, alopecia, rash, dermatitis, nausea, vomitin g, anorexia, 
stomatitis, diarrhea, somnolence, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, mental status changes, cortical 
blindness, hepatocellular toxicity with elevation in serum transaminases, and interstitial 
pneumonitis. These effects are reversible when the dru g is discontinued.  Fludarabine will be 
administered by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes in a dose of 40 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -2. 
Fludara ® will be dispensed by [CONTACT_12782].  
 
3.5 Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus, also known as FK -506, is a macrolide immunosuppressant. It  inhibits lymphocytes 
by [CONTACT_12789] a complex with FKBP -12, calcium, and  calmodulin, leading to the decrease in the 
phosphatase activity of calcineurin.  This drug is used with corticosteroids for prophylaxi s of 
organ rejection in  patients receiving allogeneic liver transplants. Its use is also currently being  
investigated in kidney, bone marrow, cardiac, pancreas, pancreatic islet cell and  small bowel 
transplantation. This drug is well -absorbed orally. It is  metabolized  in the liver by [CONTACT_572967] 6/9/[ADDRESS_752195], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifamycins and  
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_572952] -506 levels. Adverse reactions include tremor,  headache, diarrhea, 
hypertension, n ausea, and renal dysfunction.  
 
3.6 Mycophenolic Acid Mofetil (Cellcept®)  
 
Mycophenolate Mofetil is an ester prodrug of the active  immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid 
(MPA). This active metabolite is a  noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of inosine 
monopho sphate dehydrogenase  (IMPDH). There are no pharmacokinetic interactions with 
ganciclovir,  cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives and cyclosporine.  Side effect profiles include 
diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, allergic reactions,  and vomiting. There is also an inc rease in certain 
types of infection mainly from  the herpes virus family (CMV, HSV & VZV) and candida.  
3.7 Hematopoietic growth factor: G -CSF 
G-CSF may be associated with development of fevers, chills, skin rash, polyserositis, muscle 
aches, malaise and/or headache. It has also been reported to cause bone aches or pain in a 
minority of patients

7.[ADDRESS_752207]  dose of cyclophosphamide after the graft infusion may damage the graf t. The 
Version 6/9/[ADDRESS_752208]  all engrafted, and 
intensification of the preparative regimen reduces the likelihood of graft rejection. The risk of 
treatment -related malignancy in donor cells is difficult to estimate, but is likely to be similar 
to the 1% risk estimated after limited exposure to cyclophosphamide.  
 
7.2  Acute and Chronic GVHD  
 
The second major risk in participating in this research protocol is the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_207085]/or chroni c GVHD given the use of a reduced intensity  preparative regimen followed by 
[CONTACT_572971]. The degree of GVHD varies  from mild 
cutaneous reactions to extensive widespread and systemic involvement of skin, liver, and 
gastrointestinal tract.  The incidence of fatal infection is greater in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_572957]. The 
development of g rade 3 or higher acute GVHD is considered clinically significant and 
associated with increased morbidity and non -relapse mortality. The likelihood of surviving 
severe GVHD is to a large part dependent on the age of the p atient and the patient’s overall 
condition. For the majority of the patients eligible for this trial who have high -risk 
hematologic malignancies, a moderate increase in GVHD may be accompanied by [CONTACT_572972] -versus -malignancy (GVM)  benefit, so that the same long -term relapse free 
survival is maintained.  
 
7.3 Regimen -related toxicities   
 
Toxicities directly related to the administration of high -dose chemotherapy include 
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, mucositis), alopecia, infertility (which  may be 
permanent), interstitial pneumonitis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, hemorrhagic cystitis, 
hepatic venoocclusive disease, or multi -organ failure which may be fatal.  
Toxicities related to individual chemotherapy drugs are described in section 3.0.  
Version 6/9/[ADDRESS_752209] and is a major concern in these patients.  
Infections may be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal.  Often, these infections are life -
threatening, particularly when caused by [CONTACT_208520] o r fungal organisms, and are associated with 
high mortality in the transplant population.  
 
7.5  Aplasia /Graft Failure  
Pancytopenia is an expected side effect of allogeneic HS CT with the use of reduced intensity 
preparative regimens. Given the previous exper ience with post -transplant cyclophosphamide 
in other trials, we would expect the duration of aplasia to be relatively short. Prolonged 
aplasia can result from the failure of donor PBSC to engraft and is usually fatal.

earlier than indicated in Section 5. 7. If there is evidence of low donor chimerism and no 
evidence of GVHD, patients may be eligible for subsequent donor lymphocyte infusions.  
 
8.3  Hematologic recovery  
 
A secondary endpoint of t his Phase II trial is time to recovery of circulating  neutrophils and 
platelets (following chemotherapy). Neutrophil recovery is defined  as the first day of three 
consecutive lab values on different days, after the  conditioning regimen -induced nadir of 
blood counts, that the absolute neutrophil  count is > 500/μL. Platelet recovery is defined as 
the first day of three consecutive  lab values on different days, after the conditioning regimen -
Version 6/9/16 18 induced nadir of blood  counts, that the platelet count is ≥ 20,000 /μL without platelet 
transfusion support in  the seven days prior.  
 
8.4  Donor chimerism  
 
Chimerism will be assessed beginning at day +30.  If full donor chimerism is reached by [CONTACT_4475] 
+30, it will be assessed per institutional guidelines for restaging.  If full donor chimerism is 
not reached by [CONTACT_4475] +30, additional assessments will be done at day  +60, +90 and then every 
four weeks (+/ - 3 days) until the goal of full donor chimerism is achieved. For the purposes 
of this protocol mixed chimerism will be defined as the detection of > 5% and < 95% cells of 
donor origin and full donor chimerism  will be defined as 95% cells of donor origin.

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160]:  
 
10.1  NRM : As outlined in Section 2.0 (Background), the overall nonrelapse  mortality 
on the phase I nonmyeloablative haploidentical HSCT  trial utilizing [ADDRESS_752216] -
transplantation Cy, MMF and tacrolimus was approximately 19% at one year. Other 
haploidentical HSCT  trials, both nonmyeloablative and ablative have shown NRM in the 
range of 30-40%, mostly from infectious causes. The working hypothesis of this trial is 
that the overall toxicity of reduced intensity  haplo identical HSCT  is less  than that of 
haploidentical HSCT  after myeloablative conditioning u tilizing PTCY . Therefor e we 
adopt t he stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572958]  a NRM incidence is greater than 30% after a minimum 
enrollment of 5 patients. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572959].

occurs in r patients  r ≥ 2  r ≥ 2 r ≥ 3  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 4 r ≥ 4  r ≥ 5  
 
 
 
 
10.2   Severe acute GVHD : The incidence of severe aGVHD (Gr ades III -IV)) on the 
myeloablative haploidentical HSCT  trial utilizing 2 doses  of PTCY , MMF and  tacrolimus 
was approximately 23 %. The working hypothesis  of this trial is that the overall toxicity of 
reduced intensity conditioning should not be significantly more than that seen with 
myeloablative conditioning utilizing  post-transplantation Cy. Therefore we adopt the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572960] o f III-IV aGVHD  is greater than 35% after a minimum 
enrollment of 5 patients.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572959].

GVHD occurs in r patients  r ≥ 2  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 4  r ≥ 4  r ≥ 4  r ≥ 6  
 
10.3   Engraftment Failure:   As outlined in Section 2.0 (Background), the incidence of 
engraftment failure on the phase I nonmyeloablative haploidentical HSCT  trial utilizing [ADDRESS_752217] -transplantation  Cy, MMF and tacrolimus was approximately 18%. All patients in the two 
Version 6/9/16 20 myeloablative stu dies at our center engrafted. It  is concerning that with the intensity of flu/mel, 
patients are not going to recover their own count if they fail to engraft . The workin g hypothesis 
of this trial is that the overall toxicity of reduced intensity haplo  HSCT  is not significantly 
greater than haploidentical HSCT  after nonmyeloablative conditioning utilizing PTCY . 
Therefore we adopt the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572961] 30% 
after a minimum enrollment of 5 patients. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572962].

failure occurs in r patients  r ≥ 2  r ≥ 2  r ≥ 3 r ≥ 3  r ≥ 3  r ≥ 4 r ≥ 4  r ≥ 5  
 
 
If any of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23892] a is met, accrual to the trial will be temporarily halted, until a 
decision regarding either modification or termination of the trial could be made.

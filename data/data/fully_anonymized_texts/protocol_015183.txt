1.0 Background  
 
Indiana University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] a large academic health center that performs a large number (~180)  of cystectomies per year.  C ystectomy is  a urologic procedure that involves the radical 
removal of the bladder, with subsequent need for urinary tract reconstruction.  The reconstruction requires harvesting of portions of the small and/or large bowel, and can be in 
the form of an ileal conduit, o rthotopic bladder replacement, or continent urinary reservoir 
such as an “Indiana Pouch”.  The postoperative course usually spans on average a [ADDRESS_760391] technique for our  enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for  
cystectomy.  This will be done by [CONTACT_578664]- operative pain scores (V AS) at both resting  
and with movement. The VAS (Visual Analog Scale) pain scores  will be measured at 24, 48, [ADDRESS_760392].  
 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_578628].  Ozyuvaci et al found that when combining epi[INVESTIGATOR_578629], radical cystectomy patients had significantly less intraoperative bleeding and pain by 
[CONTACT_116098] (VAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours  when compared to general 
analgesia alone3.  Ladjevic et al saw similar results with combined epi[INVESTIGATOR_578630]4.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_578631] a randomized clinical trial by [CONTACT_578665]- Sunko et al5.  In a study by [CONTACT_578666],

Surgeon infiltration has not been studied as much in cystectomy patients specifically, but it is 
well-studied in a wide variety of other surgeries  including large pelvic surgeries .  Liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_578636]6.  In hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, Wu et al showed 
improved NRS scores as well as decreased analgesic usage and intestinal function recovery time
7.  Sun et al saw similar decreases in pain and analgesic use in open hepatectomy, but also 
showed decreases in surgical stress response including hormonal response, heart rate, and 
mean arterial pressure in the first 48 -h postoperatively8.  In total knee arthroplasty, local 
wound infiltration analgesia combined with adductor canal block decreased early incisional pain 
in the postoperative period, decreased operative time, and promoted earlier knee joint mobility

Exparel, a liposomal formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB), has shown significant promise in 
providing extended analgesic covera ge in the postoperative period. Due to its extended release 
format, LB can provide analgesia coverage for up to 72 hours postoperatively when compared 
to normal saline and has been suggested to reduce postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_391617] (9) . It has 
provided effective analgesia in total knee arthroplasty and hip arthroplasty and has shown promise in open and laparoscopic colectomy

 2.[ADDRESS_760393] been used as postoperative analgesia in 
prior studies. The specific aim of this study is to compare the difference between the pain control methods in achieving the following:  
 
1. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]  
2. Improved postoperative VAS (Visual Analog Scale) pain scores  
3. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293] (Nausea, sedation, ileus, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341])  
4. Decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS)  
 The primary endpoint of this study will be VAS (Visual Analo g Scale) pain score  at both resting  
and with movement.  The VAS Visual Analog Scale) pain score will be measured at 24, 48, [ADDRESS_760394].  
 The secondary endpoint includes intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_76198] n, opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293] (nausea, 
sedation, ileus, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]), and LOS. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS) will be collected via EMR of the admission and discharge date to calculate the LOS. The IV and PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_391618] 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. All the opi[INVESTIGATOR_578644] (both PO and IV) 
will be converted to PO morphine equivalent for analysis. We will also measure postoperative 
nausea and sedation scores at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.  Nausea will be measured on a 4 -
point scal e: none, mild, moderate or severe. This is collected as patient reported as well as per 
nursing documentation.  Sedation score is also reported on a 4 -point scale: awake/alert, quietly 
awake, asleep/arousab le or deep sleep. This is collected as an observat ion by [CONTACT_578667]/staff. We will access patient’s satisfaction at 24, 48 72 and 96 hours. This will be 
measured on a 5 -point scale; very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied and very satisfied.  
We will also measure time to first flatus, pos toperative creatinine, incidence of hypotension 
(defined as BP decrease of more than 20%) , incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and 
ambulation activity.  
Ambulation is defined as anytime out of bed (up in chair, to bathroom and walking in hall with PT/nurse ) activity will also be recorded daily. It will be recorded as yes/no.

4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
All cystectomy cases scheduled by [CONTACT_578669][INVESTIGATOR_242620]. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_242640] -to-face prior to surgery by [CONTACT_578670]. They will be informed about the study and all questions will be answered. The potential subjects will be given a copy of the informed consent form and authorization form. The subjects will then be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] f ace-to-face in POCU on the day of surgery and if 
participation is agreed, written consent will be taken.  All patients will undergo a standardized enhanced recovery perioperative care pathway designed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_578671].  
 
A total of 160 subjects will be randomized by a computer program into  four groups (40 in each 
group):  
 
1. Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] – epi[INVESTIGATOR_578648] 0.05%/hydromorphone 0.05mg/ml mix will be 
given throughout the duration of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].  
2. Rectus Sheath Block -  20 mL of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_578649] 40 mL of 0.125% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 40 ml of injectable saline for a total of 100 mL.  The 100 mL will be 
injected into 4 locations below the rectus abdominis muscle.  
3. Surgeon infiltr ation  with Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB)  – 20 mL of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_578650] 40 mL of 0.125% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39847] [ADDRESS_760396] Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (SB) –  60ml of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_578651] 4 0ml of saline for a total of 100ml. The 100 mL will be injected throughout 
the incision site by [CONTACT_578672] .  
 Randomization will be performed using Research Randomizer. The primary investigator will inform the person doing the block as to what group the patients are randomized to  
 Study procedures:  
 Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_578652] . Both the rectus sheath block 
and the surgeon infiltration will occur at the end of the case.  All procedures will be done using sterile technique with masks, hats, and sterile gloves. Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_578653].  Surgeon infiltration will be performed by [CONTACT_11065].  
 Patients  will be randomized to one of the four arms  by [CONTACT_578673].  On the day of 
surgery , the Princ ipal Investigator will inform the person doing the block as to what group the 
patients are randomized to.

Morgan &Amp; Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology, 6e ([LOCATION_001], NY: McGraw -Hill Education, 2018).  
Rectus sheath block will be performed at [ADDRESS_760398] and on movement (knee flexion) will be measured by [CONTACT_578674] (VAS). VAS will measure pain from a scale of 0 -10. Nausea 
will be measured using a categorical scoring system (none=0; mild=1; moderate=2; severe=3). Nausea score will be reported by [CONTACT_13935]. Anti- emetic usage will also be recorded. 
Sedation scores will also be assessed by a member of the study team using a sedation scale.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS)  will be collected via EMR of the admission and discharge date  to 
calculate the LOS. We will also measure time to first flatus, postoperative creatinine, incidence 
of hypotension (defined as BP decrease of more than 20%  from morning of surgery ), incidence 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]  (defined by [CONTACT_578675]) , and ambulation activity  
(anytime out of bed (up in chair, to bathroom and walking in hall with PT/nurse) will al so be 
recorded daily. It will be recorded as yes/no.  
 
All these parameters will be measured at 1, 24, 48, 72, and [ADDRESS_760399] the 
patient are unsuccessful, the survey will not be completed; this will not be considered a deviation as the survey is not critical to the overall data collection.  
 
Data management will include quality assurance and quality control measures.  All collected data will be monitored by a data and safety monitoring group independent from the research team.  Data quality, subject recruitment, accrual,  rete ntion, outcome and adverse event data, 
assessment of scientific reports or therapeutic development, results of related studies that may impact subject safety and procedures designed to protect the privacy of subjects will be monitored at least annually.     
 
5.0 Reporting of Adverse Events

Analgesia: A Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis," Int J Clin Exp Med  8, no. 10 (2015).  
 
Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_391633], and any adverse events or unanticipated problems such as local anesthetic toxicity or epi[INVESTIGATOR_578656]. All adverse events or unanticipated problems that meet the criteria for prompt reporting 
will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days.  
 6.0 Study withdrawal/DC  
 The patient can withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_391634]. In such an event, patient may still have access to all the IV and oral 
pain medications. Anesthesia acute pain team will continue to follow the patient for 24 hours. 
After  24 hours, the anesthesia acute pain team will sign off and all further pain management 
will be done by [CONTACT_96204].  
 
7.0 Statistical consideration 
 Primary outcome: VAS score with movement at 48 and 72 hours  
 Primary Research Hypothesis: Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_578657] 24, 48, 72, and [ADDRESS_760400].    Secondary outcomes: Narcotic usag e after 1, 24, 48, 72, and [ADDRESS_760401] flatus, postoperative 
creatin ine, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS) will be collected via EMR of the 
admission and discharge date to calculate the LOS) , ileus, hypotension (defined as BP decrease 
of more than 20%), and ambulation /anytime out of bed (up in chair, to bathroom and walking 
in hall with PT/nurse ) activity  will also be recorded daily . It will be recorded as yes/no.  
 
If the patient is discharged within 96 hours, every effort will be made to obtain data points, but 
we wil l not consider these data point  deviations since our 96 -hour data point will not change 
the integrity of the study.  
 Secondary Research Hypotheses:  Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_578658].  
 Statistical analysis will be performed using a standard statistical program (SAS or SPSS). All data 
will be summarized (means, standard deviations, standard errors, and ranges for continuous 
variables; frequencies and percentages for categori cal variables) by [CONTACT_19313]. Demographic data 
will be compared between the four groups using ANOVA or chi -square tests as appropriate. The 
primary outcome, VAS ( Visual Analog Scale)  at 48 and 72 hours, will be compared between the 
groups using repeated measures ANOVA; the model will include fixed effects for group, time, 
and the group by [CONTACT_578676].   
Pain and satisfaction scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_578659] r time will be analyzed using repeated 
measures ANOVA. Nausea and sedation scores will be compared between groups at each time 
point using Mantel -Haenszel chi -square tests for ordered categorical data. Time to first flatus, 
postoperative creatinine, and LOS will be compared between the groups using one -way 
ANOVA. The binary outcomes of incidence of ileus, hypotension (defined as BP decrease of more than 20%), and incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_578660]. Distributions of the continuous variables will be examined, and a transformation of 
the data (e.g. natural logarithm) or nonparametric tests will be used as necessary. A 5% 
significance level will be used for all comp arisons.  
 
Based on prior studies, the coefficient of variation for the VAS ( Visual Analog Scale) score at [ADDRESS_760402] 
80% power to detect a ratio of means of 1.5 for VAS score between any two of the four 
treatment groups, assuming two -sided tests each conducted at a 5% significance level.  
 All patients will receive a phone survey approximately [ADDRESS_760403] the patient are 
unsuccessful, the survey will not be completed; this will not be considered a deviation as the 
survey is not critical to the overall data collection.  
  8.0 Privacy  
 All study papers containing patient identifiers will be kept in each subjects’ confidential  study 
file accessible to only the research team.  All records will be kept in a locked room in a locked cabinet that only authorized staff enters.  Collected data from each enrolled participant will be 
recorded on Redcap, which is a secure web -based data collection tool. Three years after 
completion of the study, all electronic information and paperwork containing patient identifiers 
will be deleted or shredded.  
 9.0 Follow -up/record retention 
 The study will start in August  of 2019 and will end when a sample size of 160 subjects is 
achieved. Since Indiana University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10301] a large number (~180) of cystectomies per 
year , the estimated time frame to enroll [ADDRESS_760404] been enrolled, the study will be stoppe d and the data collected will be analyzed using 
statistical methods.  
 
Three years after completion of the study, all study papers with patient identifiers will be 
shredded and only data without any patient identifiers will be retained by [CONTACT_391637].

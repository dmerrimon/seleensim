1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
The MiSight® [ADDRESS_572414] lens with a US-FDA indication to slow the 
progression of myopia (nearsightedness) in children between the ages of 8 and 12 years old at 
the initiation of treatment. Johnson and  Johnson Vision Care (JJVC) has developed a series of 
soft contact [CONTACT_449268]. The EMO -118 design was efficacious in 
slowing refractive error progression and axial elongation in children between 7 and 12 years 
of age after 6 months of wear ( ) and is being confirmed in a longer -term myopia 
control clinical trial ( ). The EMO -114 design was efficacious in slowing axial 
elongation and performed similarly to EMO -116, a dual focus  myopia control design, but did 
not demonstrate a statisti cally significant reduction in refractive error progression at 6 months 
( ).
5,[ADDRESS_572415] with conventional optics (1- DAY ACUVUE® 
MOIST) will be used during the study run- in period for neophyte and existing soft contact [CONTACT_89626].  
 This study will test two senofilcon A -C3 design prototypes with varying myopia control optical 
designs (Test [ADDRESS_572416] 2)  and one commercially availab le marketed product for myopia 
control ( Control ). Both Test lenses  are senofilcon A -C3 prototypes and use the same 
manufacturing process as the ACUVUE OASYS
® Brand Contact [CONTACT_449269]™ 
Technology (AO1D; cleared by [CONTACT_179937] K042275) . The Test len ses have a smaller lens 
diameter and a steeper base curve  compared to the AO1D to facilitate lens application while 
maintaining a well -centered fit in children. While both Test lenses have myopia control optical 
designs, the EMO -[ADDRESS_572417] version of the 
Investigator's Brochure for EMO Design Family Lenses  and the package insert of the marketed 
products.
[ADDRESS_572418] article will be worn bilaterally in daily wear, daily disposable

modality for at least [ADDRESS_572419] version of the Investigator's Brochure for EMO Design  Family Lenses.
[ADDRESS_572420]’s axial  length and myopia control efficacy is not an endpoint of this 
study. Other potential benefits are that soft contact [CONTACT_13276] (conventional and myopia control) 
have shown better subjective performance versus glasses regarding appearance,  satisfaction, 
social self -perception, and willingness to try new activities.[ADDRESS_572421] lens worn in the same modality (i.e. daily 
disposable wear) and within the same population.   While the target population for this study is children (<18 years) , not adults , clinical research 
has generally supported that younger children can successfully  and safely wear soft contact

utilizing Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Boar d (IRB) approved 
materials.  
 The goal is to enroll approximately 75 eligible subjects and complete 50. Up to  6 sites are 
expected to enroll approximately 15 subjects each. The preferred ratio for the number of subjects in the two age groups (7 -12 years and 13- 17 years) is 1:[ADDRESS_572431] lenses featuring 
myopia control optical designs using a 3 ×[ADDRESS_572432] is less concerning. All subjects will begin with a run -in period

using a single vision contact [CONTACT_449274] a similar contact [CONTACT_449275].  
 
 Enrollment Target and Study Duration  
Approximately [ADDRESS_572433] (not including application and removal training) . Total 
study duration including the enrollment period is expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_572434] Article Allocation  
The three study lenses (Test1, Test2, and Control) will be worn in a bilateral and random 
fashion using a 3×[ADDRESS_572435] lens design 
(run-in lens: [ADDRESS_572436] ) and then will be randomly assigned to one of six unique 
sequences of the three lens types (Test1/Test2/ Control , Test1/ Control /Test2, 
Test2/Test1/ Control , Test2/ Control /Test1, Control /Test1/Test2, Control /Test2/Test1) using a 
3×[ADDRESS_572437] -order carryover effects.  Each block will 
contain these six different lens trial sequences.
20 The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_449276] (7 – 12 years old and 13 - 17 years  old). The preferred  ratio for the number of subjects 
in the two age groups is 1:1 within each site. The randomization scheme will be generated 
using the PROC PLAN procedure in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).
[ADDRESS_572438] occurred prior to 
randomization: 
• Informed consent must have been obtained.  
CR-6457, v 6.0
 
Page 28 of 248
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
• The subject must have met all eligibility criteria . 
• The subject’s screening and baseline information must have been collected. 
 
When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing . 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the lens fitting schedule . 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountabil ity 
Log in the “Dispensed” section. 
 Masking  
This is a single -masked study with the subjects being masked. The subjects will not be told 
any information regarding the optical designs of the lenses beyond that they are intended to correct for their refractiv e error and feature myopia control  optics. The investigators cannot be 
completely masked to the identity of the investigational lenses because there will be more than 
one fitting guide used and the fitting guide is specific to the lens design.  
 Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
The identity of the study lenses will be masked by [CONTACT_169761], lot number, sphere power, expi[INVESTIGATOR_35440]. The medical monitor will have access to the decode information in case breaking the mask is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  
 Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise,  the mask should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_169762]. In such cases, the investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195]. In the event the mask is b roken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, 
and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. The investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the clinical site or sponsor personnel.   Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all remaining scheduled evaluations. Subjects who are discontinued will not be replaced.

Primary Packaging  Secondary Packaging  
  
 Storage Conditions 
Test articles will be maintained at ambient temperatures at the clinical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions. 
 Collection and Storage of Samples 
No samples will be collected as part of the study procedures. When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Event and/or a Product Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC. 
 Accountability of Test Articles  
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study articles and supplies to complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment  documentation 
for the test article accountability records.  
 Test article s must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site  
personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log. All test articles must be accounted. This includes:  
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785]. 
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements. 
 The Investigator will collect all unused test articles from the subjects at the end of the subject’s participation. Subject  returned unused test articles must be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un- dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or monitor will return all unused test articles to JJVC.

 Withdrawal/Discontinuatio n from the Study  
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Subject withdrawal of consent. 
• Subject not compliant to protocol (e.g., refusing any protocol specified procedure) 
• Subject lost to follow -up. 
• Subject no longer me ets eligibility criteria (e.g. the subject becomes pregnant) . 
• Subject develops significant or serious adverse events necessitating  discontinuation of 
study lens wear  
• Subjects who have experienced a Corneal Infiltrative Event (CIE) . 
• Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the 
best interest of the subject to stop treatment) . 
• Subject not compliant with study lens wear schedule  
• Subject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor vision, poor comfort or unacceptable fit.  
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will: 
• Complete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled). 
• Complete the Final Evaluation, indicating the reason that the subject was discontinued from the study. 
• Record the spherocylindrical refraction with best corrected distance visual acuity. 
• Collect used test article(s) (worn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard them, unless othe rwise stated in section  7.2 
• Collect all unused test article(s) from the subject. 
• Make arrangements for subject care, if needed, due to their study participation  
Additional subjects will not be enrolled  if a subject discontinues from the study prematurely.  
 In cases where a subject is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_312794]/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or equivalent) as the final attempt.  
9. PRE -STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION 
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study. Disallowe d medications for this study include:

further dispensing of test article. In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any further subjects are enrolled.  The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_402138]’s results are compromised.  JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the IEC/IRB reserves  the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_71153], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.  
 JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that part of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.  Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.   
 Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
• Subject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
• Clinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site . 
• Lens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs. 
• Damage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficien cy alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
 Within [ADDRESS_572439] be recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, the COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.    
CR-6457, v 6.0
 
Page 66 of 248
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:  
• Date the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness) . 
• Who received the complaint. 
• Study number. 
• Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
• Lot number(s). 
• Unique Subject Identifier(s). 
• Indication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject). 
• OD/OS indication, along with whether  the lens was inserted . 
• Any related AE number if applicable. 
• Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
• Eye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
• Confirmation of product availability for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return  
 
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow section  13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.   
 In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.”  
 
Note : This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
compa rator , and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events relate d to investigational medical devices .1   
 
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that: 
a) Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeared following initiation of the study.

erosion with overlying staining; conjunctival and lid edema; anterior chamber reaction (iritis); severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset; 
severe redness; purulent or mucopurulent discharge; tearing; photophobia. For the purposes of reporting, a corneal ulcer which has any of the following characteristics 
should be considered in this category: 
1) central or paracentral location;  
2) penetration of Bowman ’s membrane;  
3) infiltrate > 2 mm diameter; 
4) associated with iritis ≥ grade 2; 
5) associated with any increase in intraocular pressure;

Adverse Device Effect (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. ” 
 
NOTE  1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the investigational medical device. 
 
NOTE  2: This definition includes an y event resulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of t he investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_572440] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature,  severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.  
 Assessing Adverse Ev ents 
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
• Seriousness/Classifications (see definition in section 13.1). 
• Causality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the test article, study treatment 
or study proc edures and the adverse event (not related , unlikely related , possibly 
related , or related - see definition in section  13.2.1). 
• Adverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild , moderate, or severe - see definition in 
section 13.2.2). 
• Outcom e – not recovered or not resolved, recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae , recovered or resolved, death related to adverse event , or 
unknown. 
• Actions Taken – none, temporarily discontinued, permanently discontinued, or other.

Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
13.2.1. Causalit y Assessment  
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
• Not Related - An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
• Unlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
• Possibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant  
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded . 
• Related – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) a nd cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]- challenge and re- challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relati onship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities . 
• Moderate – Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities . 
• Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities . 
 Documentation and Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non- ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449252].   
 Complete description s of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system . 
CR-6457, v 6.0

Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.    It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events w ill be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following: 
• Adverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
• Drawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, location, and depth, etc.). 
• Date the clinical site was notified . 
• Date and time of onset . 
• Date and time of resolution . 
• Adverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable. 
• Treatment regimen instituted  (where  appropriate) , including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements . 
• Any referral to another health care provider if needed. 
• Outcome, ocular damage (if any). 
• Likely etiology. 
• Best corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and  upon conclusion of the 
event , if the AE is related to the visual system. 
 Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related ’ or ‘ related ’ to the test article or 
study pr ocedures  (whether related to the visual system or not), a n AE review form  
must be completed . Additional dated and initialed entries  should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral.  
 
In addit ion, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date o f culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded.   Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermitte nt require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.  
 Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the patient will be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investiga tor will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether  a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If 
a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit

date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non- ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatment, or study procedures may be re corded as

 Event of Special Interest  
13.5.1. Specific Requirements  for Recording and Diagnosing Possible Microbial Keratitis  
The signs of a presumed infectious ulcer (defined as progressive erosion of the corneal tissue) may include irregular focal infiltrates (>1 mm); active lesions with raised edges; significant diffuse infiltration; anterior corneal to mid -stromal involvement; erosion with 
overlying staining; conjunctival and lid edema; anterior chamber reaction (iritis); severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis,  MK) may include pain of rapid onset; severe redness; purulent or mucopurulent 
discharge;  tearing; photophobia. For the purpose of reporting, per the ISO [ZIP_CODE], a presumed 
corneal  ulcer which has any of the following characteristics should be reported as a serious 
adverse event:
48 
 
1) Central (6 mm) or paracentral (8 mm) location; 
2) Penetratio n of Bowman’s membrane; 
3) Infiltrate> 2 mm diameter  
4) Associated with iritis ≥ Grade 2;  
5) Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure;  
6) Culture positive for microorganisms 
7) Increasing size of severity at subsequent visits. 
 In the event of any case of possible microbial keratitis (e.g., presence of an infiltrative lesion), 
the investigators shall provide complete descriptions of the event. A comprehensive description of diagnostic procedures is provided in .  
 The investigator shall record the following in the CRF:  
• Presence and severity of pain;  
• Presence and type of discharge; 
• Presence of lid edema;  
• Presence of chemosis;  
• Pattern and grading of redness (bulbar/limbal);

• Characterization of infiltrates (size, shape, location, depth) on the Infiltrate Assessment 
Form;  
• Characterization of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_17754] (size/depth);  
• Involvement of surrounding cornea;  
• Endothelial involvement; 
• Grading of anterior chamber cell and flare  
The investigator shall record the diagnosis and specific treatment on the Adverse Event Form. 
Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected  to determine if the infection 
is microbial in nature. For example, if an overlying epi[INVESTIGATOR_449253] l isted below is present when the infiltrate is first evaluated, the infiltrate must 
be cultured.  
• Diameter greater than 1 mm  
• Location within the central (6 mm) optical zone  
• Purulent discharge 
• Pain 
• Photophobia 
• Iris/Anterior chamber inflammation  
 Any corneal lesions meeting the criteria set forth above must be cultured as outlined in the Premarket Notification (510[k]) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact [CONTACT_32993] (Revised  May 1994).

• Definite MK:  one or more central (6 mm) or paracentral (8 mm) corneal stromal  
infiltrates greater than 2 mm in size with pain rated more than mild, and one of the following: 
o anterior chamber reaction (iritis) Grade 2 or higher  
o mucopurulent discharge  
o positive corneal culture 
• Probable MK:  One or more corneal stromal infiltrates greater than [ADDRESS_572444] one of the following additional criteria:  
o anterior chamber reaction;  
o mucopurulent discharge; 
o positive corneal culture;

o aggressive treatment consistent with standard of care for MK in North America  
(choice of medication, high frequency dosing of long duration to resolution). 
• Probably not MK:  not meeting any of the above specified MK definitions. 
• Definitely not MK: not meeting any of the above specified MK definitions and with 
significant evidence that suggests non- infectious etiology (e.g., reduction in severity 
without pharmacologic treatment).  
• MK unrelated to contact [CONTACT_13279]:  cases such as Herpes simplex keratitis or  
Staphylococcal marginal keratitis, where, in the judgment of the panel, the etiology is  
unrelated to the wear of contact [CONTACT_13276].  
13.5.2. Loss of Best Sphero -cylindrical Corrected Visual Acuity without Physical Cause 
At the fin al study visit, if it is found that best sphero- cylindrical corrected visual acuity  
(BSCVA) of a subject is less than 20/25 (0.1 logMAR) in either eye and is more than 1.5 
lines worse than that was measured at baseline without any physical cause (confirmed through up to 3 repeated independent measures to rule out potential measurement errors or variations), an adverse event will be filed. The subject  will be followed until the best 
corrected visual acuity is no more than 1.5 lines w orse than  baseline or is stabilized before 
being discontinued from the study. A decrease of more than 1.5 lines of BSCVA is considered a significant change. This criterion is established based on the 95% limits of agreement of repeated measures of visual acuity in children.
24 It is not anticipated that 
development of amblyopia (defined as a reduction of BSCVA to 20/30 or worse or a two -line 
difference between the two eyes, in the absence of pathology25-27) will occur while wearing 
the investigational soft contact [CONTACT_13293]. Upon identifying the first confirmed case of amblyopia during the course of the study, the event will be investigated and followed according to procedures specified for an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect ( section 11 and 
section  13.1).  
 
 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_71179], but due to general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Specifically, pregnant women are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined below. More details will be included in the stand -alone Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The 
SAP will be developed and finalized prior to database lock.

 Level of Statistical Significance  
The planned primary analysis for this study will be conducted with a  two-sided type I error 
rate of 5%. Each exploratory analysis will be conducted with a two-sided type I error rate of 
5%. 
 Primary Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
Binocular Distance (4m) l ogMAR Visual Acuity (VA)  
Non-inferiority of the EMO -[ADDRESS_572445] to the primary 
endpoint of distance binocular HLHC logMAR visual acuity will be assessed on the Per-
protocol population (PP).  
 The distance binocular logMAR VA under HLHC will be analyzed using a linear mixed model at the follow -up evaluation. The model will include lens type, lens sequence, period, and first -
order carryover as fixed effects and interaction between lens type and period will be evaluate. Other subject characteristics such as age, gender and race will be included as fixed covariates when appropriate. Site will be included in the model as a random effect (G -side). The 
covariance of resi duals between measurements from different periods within the same subject 
(R-side) will be modeled using Unstructured (UN) covariance structure. If the model does not 
converge, the compound Symmetry (CS) covariance structure will be considered. The Kenward  and Roger method will be used for the denominator degree of freedom.
[ADDRESS_572446] to logMAR visual acuity  are as follows:  
 
𝐻𝐻0:  𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸118− 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑡𝑡≥0.05 
𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴: 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸118− 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑡𝑡 < 0. 05 
 
Where, 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸118 represents the mean logMAR VA score for the EMO -118 lens and 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑡𝑡  
represents the mean logMAR VA score for the MiSight lens. Non- inferiority  will be declared 
if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval  (CI) of the mean difference (EMO -
118 – MiSight)  is less than 0.05. 
 
Primary Safety  Endpoint  
Primary safety endpoint will be evaluated by [CONTACT_449279] (i.e., related and possibly related) serious and significant ocular a dverse events and will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_449280]. The tables will present the number and percentage of eyes and subjects by [CONTACT_449281].  
 Additionally, all ocular and non- ocular ad verse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_12917] (i.e., 
ocular AEs by [CONTACT_96514], significant and all other ocular AEs, and non- ocular AEs by [CONTACT_449282]-serious), relatedness, severity and diagnosis. A listing of all adverse events including all

informatio n of an event (e.g., diagnosis, duration, treatment and resolution status) will be 
provided.  
 
 Secondary Analysis  
Not applicable.  
 
 Other Exploratory Analysis 
Exploratory hypotheses on distance binocular HLHC logMAR VA will be assessed using the 
same model  as the primary analysis. Comparisons between EMO-114 and the other two study 
lenses will be conducted based on the 2-sided 95% CIs constructed for the mean differences 
between EMO -114 and EMO -118 (EMO -114 – EMO -118) and between EMO -114 and 
MiSight (EMO -114 – MiSight). Superiority of EMO -114 lens relative to EMO -118 lens will 
be declared if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the mean difference  is less than 0. Superiority 
of EMO -114 lens relative to MiSight lens will be declared if the upper bound of the 
corresponding 95% CI is less than 0. 
  
Patient -reported outcome  (PRO) items  will be used to measure subjective vision, comfort, and 
ease of handling, with descriptive summaries tabulated by [CONTACT_340379]. Exploratory analysis will 
be conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of these PRO measures.    
 Descriptive data summaries will be tabulated by [CONTACT_449283]. 
A by -subject listing of all adverse events (ocular and non- ocular AEs) will be provided. 
 As supplementary analyses to support the primary analysis, two sensitivity analyses may be considered. (1) If non- inferiority for the primary endpoint is met with subjects in the per -
protocol population, a sensitivity analysis using ITT population may be considered. (2) To 
evaluate the impact of missing data, a sensitivity analysis using ITT population with missing 
data imputed may  be conducted using multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject 
dropout is greater than the 15%. The SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC 
MIANALYZE will be utilized with a parametric regression method using the fully conditional 
method (FCS) to make at least [ADDRESS_572447] clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. M issing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of missing values will be 
included in the summary tables and listings.

2. Why  is  this research being done?
This research is being done to measure the effectiveness  of the Freespi[INVESTIGATOR_332655] (FBS) for 
children and adolescents  who have an anxiety disorder.
The FBS is a portable, at-home device that has been cleared by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for use in adults with panic disorders. The device trains users to adjust their breathing to control 
and normalize their breathing patterns. The objective of this study is to see if FBS decreases anxiety in  
children and adolescents.
Children between the  ages  of 9-17  years old, with an anxiety disorder may join the study.
How many people will be in this study?
Up to 60 children and adolescents and their parents will be recruited to participate in the study.
3. What  will happen if you allow your child to  join this study?
If you  agree to allow your child to be in this study, we will ask you and your child to complete the 
following things:
The role of the parent in this study will be to fill out the required questionnaires, bring their child to the 
study visits and to monitor their child’s compliance in using the Freespi[INVESTIGATOR_332655].
During this study if a study team member suspects abuse, neglect or abandonment of a child they will 
report it to the proper authorities. 
a) Screening  Visit (Week 0):
You and your  child will be asked to take part in a screening visit where the study will be 
explained to you and your child. At this visit, you will be asked to provide your child’s current 
medication list and confirm it has not changed in the last month.
If at  any time during the study, your child is found to be depressed or exhibit severe suicidality or 
ideation, he/she will be referred to the study doctor, who will evaluate your child and make the 
appropriate treatment referral.
As part of the study, your child will be randomly (by [CONTACT_3364], like a flip of a coin) assigned into 
either the Active  Intervention Group or the Active Control Waitlist Group. In this visit, we will 
discuss the use of FBS.  The FBS will be used by [CONTACT_332664] a day, once in the morning for 
17 minutes and once in the evening for 17 minutes. During this screening visit, we will help you 
and your child come up with a plan to help your child use the FBS on a regular schedule.
b) Baseline  Visit (Week 1)
Active Intervention  Group
During a second visit, a personal interview  will take place with your child, which will last about [ADDRESS_411386] in participant’s home visit (at study doctors discretion) or will 
take place at the research study office. The questions will primarily address your child’s anxiety and 
past history.

We will ask about any changes to your  child’s medication since the last study visit. We will also 
ask how many therapy sessions your child has attended since they last study visit.
You and your  child will receive training on how to use the FBS.
oThere  will be sounds emitted from the device to help your child with his/her breathing pace.
oThis  device will also measure breathing rates and  carbon dioxide, a gas that  you breath 
out normally..
oThe  device will come with a hand-held  Tablet computer  with the Freespi[INVESTIGATOR_332656]. 
The App provides  easy-to-follow audio and visual  instructions  that guide your child through 
prescribed breathing sessions.

loaned, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_332657] a charge of $500 after the study is 
over.
Daily panic attack diaries:  Your child will be given a daily panic attack diary to track frequency,  
symptoms and severity of any panic  attacks they may experience over the four weeks of 
breathing retraining. You may help  your child complete the diary as needed.
Active Control  Waitlist Group
You will be contact[CONTACT_332665] (SKYPE), whichever is more convenient, to fill out  
baseline assessments (clinical interview and pen and paper questionnaires). The waitlist 
participants will complete the same baseline assessments as the active intervention group. 
Waitlist participants will also be given daily panic attack diaries diary to track frequency, 
symptoms and severity of any panic attacks they may experience.  You may help your child 
complete the diary as needed.
c) Scheduled  visits (Weeks 2, 3, 4 and 8):
Active Intervention  Group
During each study visit we will ask about any changes to your child’s medication since the last study 
visit.  We will also ask how many therapy sessions your child has attended since they last study visit.

go over any questions or concerns you or  your child may have.  Your child may do a four-minute 
breathing session at  both office visits. The panic  diary will be reviewed during these sessions. The 
device will be returned at the Week [ADDRESS_411390] an in-home visit (at study doctors

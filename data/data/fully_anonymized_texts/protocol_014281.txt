Study Title: Body Fat Reducing Efect and Safety of Enzymatically Modifed 
Isoquerc itrin in Overweight and Obese Subjects
I. Aim and Hypotheses
Specifc Aim 1: To compare the body fat reducing efect of 360mg/day 
enzymatically modifed isoquercitrin (EMIQ) with that of a placebo.
Hypothesis 1:  Compared to a placebo, participants receiving EMIQ 
supplementation will have a greater reduction in total body fat as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_363292], skinfold thickness, waist to hip 
circumference ratio, resting metabolic rate, plasma adiponectin levels, physical 
activity, and dietary intake.
Specifc Aim 2: To determine the safety of long term intake of EMIQ.
Hypothesis 2:  Long-term intake of EMIQ has no ill efect on participant 
health as evidenced by [CONTACT_363293], liver, kidney function, and 
psychological state.
II. Background and Rationale
Dietary quercetin is a natural bioactive polyphenol with potential health benefts
and the capacity to prevent development of various diseases including those of 
the cardiovascular system, central nervous system and others [  1-3  ]. It is widely 
distributed in various plant foods such as onions, broccoli, concord grapes, 
apples and more [4]. In plants, quercetin is present as conjugated with diferent 
forms of glucosides [5], which afect their bioavailability. The bioavailability of 
diferent forms of quercetin has been the subject of several investigations [6]. 
Enzymatically-modifed isoquercitrin (EMIQ) is a mixture of quercetin 
monoglucoside and its -oligoglucosides, which mainly consist of quercetin-3- O-
-glucoside (Q3G) and -glucosyl derivatives with 1-7 of additional linear 
glucose moieties [7, 8]. Supplementing the diet of apoE-defcient mice with 
EMIQ increased quercetin levels and suppressed atherogenesis in this mouse 
model of human atherosclerosis [9]. In human trials, the bioavailability of EMIQ 
1
Study Title: Body Fat Reducing Effect and Safety of Enzymatically Modified Isoquercitrin in Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/2018
has been shown to be 17-fold higher than quercetin aglycone [10]. After 
efficient absorption of EMIQ, quercetin is released, and it exerts its biological 
activity such as reducing body fat, improving cardiovascular health and 
reducing blood pressure. 
EMIQ has been shown to be efective in reducing body fat in Japanese people 
who have diferent dietary habits and lifestyle from that of a person in the 
[LOCATION_002]. Thus, this study is designed to investigate if EMIQ is also 
efective in reducing body fat in subjects with a western lifestyle. 
Quercetin, according to Seo et al [11] in addition to being a very strong 
antioxidant, prevents adipogenesis by [CONTACT_363294], a) by 
[CONTACT_363295] (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase 
(HSL) expression and, b) by [CONTACT_363296] (FAS), 
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein  (aP2) 
expression, through expression of transcription factors such as C/EBPα, PPARγ, 
SREBP-1. These observations suggest that quercetin has therapeutic potential 
for body fat reduction through regulating the expression of transcriptional 
factors and enzymes associated with adipogenesis. Dong et al [12] also 
reported that dietary quercetin reduces high fat diet-induced body weight gain, 
fat deposition, and insulin resistance and suppresses glucose uptake by [CONTACT_363297]. They reported that these efects of dietary quercetin is mediated through
quercetin activating of AMPK/ACC signaling pathway which promotes fatty acid 
-oxidation and suppresses fatty acid esterifcation into triglyceride in 
adipocyte.  Administration of 275 mg/d for 12 weeks reduced total body fat, 
visceral fat and subcutaneous fat in Japanese subjects.  EMIQ is classifed by [CONTACT_363298] (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe ( GRAS ). 
Thus, it should be considered a safe compound in order to investigate its 
potential biological activities in humans.   
III. Research Plan
A.Experimental Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.
B.Sample Size and Statistical Analyses
50 subjects will be required to complete this 12 week study (though 150 will be 
screened and 64 will be enrolled to ensure completion of 50 subjects). Subjects 
will be randomized 1:1 into either the treatment (EMIQ) or placebo group.  The 
study physician, [CONTACT_109193], will hold the code to the randomization which 
will be revealed upon completion of the study or if adverse event occurs.

While all measures to ensure confdentiality will be taken, it is an ever present 
possibility that it may be lost. Stored samples will be labeled with a unique 
number (code) that will not contain any private information such as name [CONTACT_363336].  There is no intention 
for allowing anyone other than the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_363280].  If [CONTACT_363338] turns this study over to a new principal 
investigator, he will give the key code to the new principal investigator.
During blood draws there may be a small amount of bruising and discomfort, 
and rarely infection.  Every efort will be made to minimize discomfort to 
volunteers. There may be discomfort associated with 12-hour fasting. Some 
subjects may experience dizziness during prolonged fasting.

Study Title: Body Fat Reducing Effect and Safety of Enzymatically Modified Isoquercitrin in Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452555] Participation
I. Overview
This study will be a double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Total of 50 
overweight and obese subjects with BMI: 26-37 will be randomly assigned into 
two groups: 25 subjects to placebo control group and 25 subjects into treatment
group. Subjects in both groups will be asked to consume their regular diet 
during the 12 weeks of the study period. Subjects in the treatment group will 
also be asked to swallow two capsules of 180mg each, totaling 360mg of EMIQ 
(enzymatically-modifed isoquercitrin) every day, one capsule at breakfast and 
one at dinner, for a period of [ADDRESS_452556] Level 
(NOAEL) of EMIQ is 489 mg/kg BW/day, and the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 
4.89mg/kg BW/day [13, 14]. This data was generated from several studies 
including: acute oral toxicity testing [15], 4 week oral toxicity testing [16], 13 
week oral toxicity testing [17-19], mutagenicity testing [20], and 2 year 
carcinogenic testing [13].
The goal of this study is to test the efect of EMIQ on body fat reduction in 
overweight and obese individuals. Thus we have selected a BMI range of 26-37 
kg/m2, assuming an average height of 1.72m (5’ 8”) and an average weight of 
94kg (207.2 lbs). 
To calculate the dose of 360 mg EMIQ/day that participants will receive, we 
used the dose administered in the previous human studies from Japan as a 
benchmark. We wanted the dose in our study to refect the greater average 
predicted weight of our participants compared to a person in the Japanese study
due to an increase in BMI range for our study.  The BMI range for the study 
completed in Japan was 24-31, while the range for this study is 26-37. Japanese 
study subjects weighed approximately 72kg while our prediction is that 
participants will average 94kg based on our database records. This % diference
(31%) is refected in the increase from 275mg/day to 360mg/day. 
6
Study Title: Body Fat Reducing Effect and Safety of Enzymatically Modified Isoquercitrin in Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452557] may 
be within the BMI range outlined in the study, but still not weigh enough to 
meet the ADI of 4.89mg/kg BW/day. A minimum bodyweight of 74kg should 
place participants in a safe range below the specifed ADI. We believe that a 
minimum body weight of 74kg should be a requirement for study participation.  
This rationale is demonstrated in the following calculation:
4.89mg/day *(x)kg=360mg 
(x)kg=360/4.89
(x)kg=73.62 (162.3lbs)
This study will be carried out after review and approval of the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) of Tufts University. Following IRB approval, a total of 50 
male and female volunteers will be recruited and admitted to the study. The 
scope and plan of the study will be described to the admitted volunteers and a 
written consent will be obtained before enrolling the subjects into the study. 
The study is planned to start in 2016 (i.e., begin enrollment) and volunteer 
activity completed within one to one and a half years. 
The admitted volunteers will be scheduled and asked to come to the Metabolic 
Research Unit (MRU) at Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on 
Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University at the beginning of the study for enrollment 
(visit 1), baseline (visit 2), 4 weeks after baseline (visit 3), a visit 8 weeks after 
baseline (visit 4), and the fnal visit after 12 weeks (visit 5) for a total of 5 visits. 
Overnight fasted blood samples will be collected at screening and visits 2, 3, 4 
and 5.  
In order to monitor adherence and safety of EMIQ intake over the 12 week of 
the study, volunteers will undergo electrocardiogram (EKG) testing as well as 
several hematological tests, liver functions tests and other biochemical tests 
(See below) carried out on the collected blood samples. In addition, volunteers 
will be asked to provide a spot urine sample during screening and visits [ADDRESS_452558].  Volunteers will complete three (3) 24-
hour dietary recalls over the phone at three time points: between visit 1 and 
visit 2; between visit 3 and visit 4 (around week 6 from beginning the 
supplement); and between visit 4 and visit 5 (around weeks 11-12) to estimate 
total caloric intake and intake of three major nutrient groups:  protein, 
carbohydrates, and fat. Volunteers will be asked to bring back unused EMIQ 
capsules and a compliance calendar during each visit to determine adherence 
to the supplementation schedule.  Volunteers will be asked not to change their 
regular physical activity, and will fll out a 7-day physical activity record at visits
2, 3, 4 and 5 to monitor this. To assess changes in adiposity following EMIQ 
intervention, the volunteers will complete whole body and segmental Dual X-ray
Absoprtiometry (DXA), skinfold thickness and hip to waist circumferences 
measurements at visit 2, i.e., before the intervention, and after 12 weeks of 
intervention, at visit 5, for total and segmental changes in body fat and fat free

mass. DXA data will be further subjected to computational analysis to obtain 
changes in abdominal, visceral and subcutaneous fats.   
Per policy number [IP_ADDRESS] of Tufts Department of Pharmacy Policy and 
Procedure Manual, any supplement returned from study subjects, or leftover 
upon completion of the study, will be destroyed “on-site” by [CONTACT_176793] a 
chemotherapy waste container for disposal using the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s system.
The following is a summary of the 6 total visits required by [CONTACT_363301] :
Screening : Volunteers that were pre-screened by [CONTACT_363302]. Volunteers will be asked to arrive 
fasted for [ADDRESS_452559] any of their questions answered to their satisfaction. Once their 
consent is given we will begin by [CONTACT_363303]’s vital signs, height, body
weight wearing a pre-weighted pair of scrubs, and BMI.  Blood samples will be 
collected for blood chemistry analysis. Women of childbearing potential will be 
subjected to a blood pregnancy test. The Beck Depression Inventory will be 
administered to assess for depression.  Additionally, study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and health history will be reviewed. Breakfast and a $25 
screening stipend will be provided once screening procedures are complete.    
All subjects will be mailed a copy of screening labs within 1-2 weeks following 
the screening visit. Volunteer’s enrollment eligibility will be determined based 
on meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subjects with abnormal 
hematologic parameters, as defned by [CONTACT_363304] (NEL) reference ranges, which are determined by [CONTACT_363305], will be excluded from study 
participation. At the discretion of the study physician, subjects will be alerted to 
abnormal results that warrant follow-up with their primary care physician. 
Subjects with abnormal hematologic values outside the NEL reference range 
that do not afect study outcomes will be included at the discretion of the study 
physician.  Note that data generated from blood draws at this visit will be used 
as baseline values in lieu of drawing additional blood at visit 2 for subjects that 
continue the study after screening.
Enrollment, Visit 1:   Volunteers that meet the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be invited to participate in the main study. Those interested will be 
asked to return to the HNRCA. Volunteers will be given a Main Study Consent 
Form  as well as an Optional Tissue Banking Consent Form . Volunteers will have 
an opportunity to read the consent forms and have any questions answered to 
their satisfaction. Once consent is obtained, MRU staf will assess any volunteer 
health, medication or eligibility status changes. The Dietary Assessment Unit 
(DAU) will dispense instructions for completing 24-hour dietary recalls by [CONTACT_363306] 3 dietary recalls by [CONTACT_363307] 1 and visit 2. A 
baseline visit will be scheduled. Subjects will be mailed a $50 check for 
completion of Visit 1.

Baseline, Visit 2:   Subjects will be asked to arrive at the MRU fasted for 12 
hours. Vital signs, and EKG measure of heart rhythm, scrub weight and height 
will be obtained. Changes to volunteer health, medication and eligibility status 
will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected and archived pending tissue 
banking consent.  Several baseline measurements will be performed during this 
visit including: lipid profle, insulin test, adiponectin, a urine dip stick, skinfold 
thickness and waist/hip circumference, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and DXA 
measure of total body fat. To perform RMR analysis, subjects will be asked to 
rest for [ADDRESS_452560].  Subjects will be 
escorted to The Body Composition Analysis Center (BCAC) of the Tufts 
University Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and 
Policy for a w hole body DXA scan to measure total and segmental body fats.  A 
three factor eating questionnaire, food craving questionnaire, and the Stanford 
7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) will be administered to assess volunteer’s 
dietary inhibition, restraint, hunger, cravings and physical activity level. EMIQ 
capsules, compliance calendar, and instructions will be dispensed to 
participants by [CONTACT_363308] 180mg capsules contained in blister 
packages at the quantity to last for 1½ months. A continental breakfast meal 
will be provided to the subjects. Subjects will be mailed a $[ADDRESS_452561] from heat and moisture. These 
instructions will also be attached to the study supplement in the form of labels.  
 
Week 4, Visit 3:     Subjects will be asked to return to the MRU 4 weeks (21 
week) from visit 2. This visit is required to monitor volunteer health and safety 
during EMIQ supplementation of 360mg/day for [ADDRESS_452562] meal will be 
provided to the subjects. Subjects will be mailed a $50 check for completion of 
Visit 3.   After visit 3 (around week 6), subjects will complete 3 dietary recalls by
[CONTACT_648].
Week 8, Visit 4:     Subjects will be asked to come to the MRU 8 weeks after visit 
2 or 4 weeks (21 week) after their previous visit. This visit is also required to 
monitor and ensure safety of EMIQ supplement intake at the dose of 360 
mg/day for 8 weeks. Subjects will be asked to arrive fasted for 12 h and bring 
their unused supplements as well their compliance calendar. Vital signs, scrub 
weight and changes to volunteer health, medication and eligibility status will be 
assessed. Blood samples will be collected to monitor liver and kidney function. 
The PAR will be administered. Compliance with supplement intake will be

Visit 4.  After visit 4 (around week 11-12), subjects will complete 3 dietary 
recalls by [CONTACT_648].
 
Week 12, Visit 5:  Subjects will be asked to return to the MRU approximately 
12 weeks from their baseline visit or 4 weeks (2 1 week) from their previous 
visit.  Subjects will be asked to arrive fasted for 12 hours and to bring back their
unused supplement and compliance calendar. Vital signs, scrub weight and 
changes to volunteer health, medication and eligibility status will be assessed. 
Blood samples will be collected and archived pending tissue banking consent.  
Final measurements will be taken during this visit including: routine health 
screening analysis, lipid profle, adiponectin, insulin test, a urine dip stick, liver 
and kidney function (SGOT, SGPT, BUN, creatinine, and calculated GFR), skin 
fold thickness and waist/hip circumference. Subjects will be asked to rest for 30 
min prior to measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressures and RMR analysis, 
which will be conducted by [CONTACT_205909].  After RMR and BP measurements, 
subjects will be escorted to the BCAC for a w hole body DXA scan to measure 
total and segmental body fats.  A three factor eating questionnaire, food craving
questionnaire, and the PAR will be administered to assess changes in 
volunteer’s dietary inhibition, restraint, hunger, cravings and activity level 
throughout the study.  Compliance with supplement intake will be determined 
by [CONTACT_363309].  A continental breakfast meal will be provided to the 
subjects. Subjects will be mailed a $305 check for completion of the fnal study

II. Registration
This study will be registered on http://www.Clinical Trials.gov.
III. Recruitment, Screening and Consent
Participants will be recruited from the general public using several 
recruitment strategies including local print and electronic media (such 
as advertisements in newspapers, craigslist, local newsletters, bulletin 
boards and diferent websites, [i.e., university jobsites at Tufts 
University, [LOCATION_011] University]), social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, 
LinkedIn)  as well as posting fiers in public places, with permission, 
such as local YMCAs, supermarkets, libraries, laundromats, local 
community organizations and health centers.  Additionally, the 
Metabolic Research Unit (MRU) resources include a roster of >20,[ADDRESS_452567] agreed to be contact[CONTACT_363311].  Subjects who do not 
wish to be contact[CONTACT_363312] (Protocol Manager) 
with “DO NOT CONTACT.” Previous subjects with this fag in their 
record will not receive any unsolicited recruitment materials, i.e., the 
letter to previous volunteers. All advertisements, fiers, and letters will 
be pre-approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
Although employees will not be targeted for recruitment and 
enrollment, employees of Tufts University and/or the HNRCA 
(employee-subjects) who voluntarily want to participate in the study 
will be eligible for screening and enrollment. In order to qualify for the 
study, employee-subjects must respond to IRB-approval advertisement
of their own accord and will not be directly approached by [CONTACT_363313]. Members of the 
research team, as direct-report subordinates of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_363281]-report subordinate to any of the research team members in 
any other capacity will not be eligible to participate in the study. If 
employee-subjects qualify to participate in the study, they cannot 
participate as volunteers during hours in which they are being 
compensated by [CONTACT_363314].  This includes 
use of vacation, personal days and sick time.
Interested subjects will be pre-screened by [CONTACT_756].  Potentially 
eligible subjects will be invited to screen in-person for the study in 
order to further determine eligibility.  During the screening visit, 
informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_363315]. The consent interview will take 
place in a private area in the MRU at the HNRCA. Once all of the 
participant’s questions and concerns have been addressed, the

Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452568] 1-2 weeks after 
screening.  Subjects with lab values that do not meet eligibility 
requirements, assessed by [CONTACT_363316], will be 
disqualifed and may be provided with a recommendation to see their 
physician.  Prior to study enrollment, subjects will be allowed to read 
the main study consent form. Once all of their questions and concerns 
are addressed, and they understand all procedures in the study, a 
designated staf member will obtain their informed consent using the 
main study informed consent form.
*Note: Non-English speaking individuals will not be enrolled in this 
study. The reasons being include the following: The HNRCA is not a 
health care facility, and does not have appropriate interpretive 
services to include non-English speakers. The standardized 
questionnaires have not been validated in other languages. This study 
will not directly beneft participants.
IV. Study Assessments

60mL (12.2 teaspoons) of blood and three separate urine samples from
each subject to measure the following: 
Hematological measures:  Complete blood count with auto-
diferential, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin 
(Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet (Plt), Mean corpuscular volume (MCV),
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC). WBC/Diferential includes: 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
 
Lipid profle:  Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, LDL-
Cholesterol.
Metabolic and hormonal markers:  Insulin, adiponectin in serum, 
and urine stick test (Includes: total protein, glucose, urobilinogen, 
bilirubin, ketone, pH, occult blood).

Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/2018
Electrolytes:  sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), 
magnesium (Mg).
Blood and Urine will be collected according to the following scheme:
Screening:  13mL (2.6 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn at this visit. 
5mL (1 teaspoon) will be drawn for complete blood count (CBC) with 
diferential, and another 5mL (1 teaspoon) for routine blood 
chemistries. CBC measures will be used as baseline values. 
Additionally, participants in the screening process will be required to 
provide a spot urine sample for urinalysis. A 3mL (0.6 teaspoons) blood
sample will be taken from women of childbearing potential at 
enrollment in order to conduct hCG testing. This test will determine 
whether the participant is pregnant, and thus ineligible for 
participation in this study.
Main Study: 
Visit 1, Enrollment: No blood will be drawn during this visit.
Visit 2, Baseline: A 10mL (2 teaspoons) blood sample will be drawn 
into red marble top tubes for liver and kidney function tests, insulin 
and adiponectin. An additional 7mL (1.4 teaspoons) of blood will be 
drawn into lavender top tubes for analysis of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. A spot urine 
sample will be provided for urinalysis. 
Visit 3, Week 4: A 5mL (1 teaspoon) blood sample will be drawn into 
a gold topped tube for liver/kidney function testing.
Visit 4, Week 8:  A 5mL (1 teaspoon) blood sample will be drawn into 
a gold topped tube for liver/kidney function testing.
Visit 5, Final: A 3mL (0.6 teaspoons) blood sample will be drawn into 
a lavender topped tube for CBC diferential analysis. A 10mL (2 
teaspoons) blood sample will be drawn into red marble top tubes for 
liver and kidney function tests, insulin and adiponectin. An additional 
7mL (1.4 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn into lavender top tubes for 
analysis of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. A spot urine sample will be provided for urinalysis.
*Note: Visits 3 and 4 will be used to monitor participant’s liver and
kidney function during the study. If the study physician determines
that liver function appears to be in jeopardy, subjects will be asked to
discontinue  the  supplement  and  to  take  medical  action  at  the
discretion of the study physician.

*Note: Abnormal lab values found at screening will be provided to the
volunteers in writing. Abnormal values for safety labs (those falling
outside  of  the  study  physician’s  predetermined  range)  will  be
repeated.  The  study  physician  will  be  notifed  and  determine  any
follow-up action.
Nutritional Intake and Physical Activity:
Subjects will receive a Food Amount Booklet and information about the
24-hour recalls at visit 1. The Dietary Assessment Unit will collect three
(3) 24-hour recalls by [CONTACT_648] (two weekdays and a weekend) between 
visits 1 and 2.  Three recalls will be collected by [CONTACT_363317] 3 and 4 (around  week 6,midway through the 12 week 
supplementation period) and between visits 4 and 5 (around weeks 11-
12).  Dietary intake data will be analyzed using Nutrition Data System 
for Research software version 2015, developed by [CONTACT_363318] (NCC), University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. 
Volunteers will be asked not to change  their regular physical activity;
unless, their total physical activity per week amounts to greater than 
150 minutes, in which case they will be asked to refrain from exercise 
30 days prior to participating in the study and to continue refraining 
from exercise until the end of the study. In addition, volunteers will be 
subjected to four PAR questionnaires to assess physical activity at 
visits 2, 3, 4 and 5.   Subjects showing drastic changes in physical 
activity will be consulted, monitored, and if necessary, will be 
eliminated from the study.
To assess changes in dietary restraint, disinhibition and hunger, the 
Three Factor Eating questionnaire will be administered at both visits 2 
and 5. In addition to this, general susceptibility to food cravings will be 
assessed using the Food Cravings Questionnaire  trait administered 
visits 2 and 5. 
Analysis of Whole Body Fat by [CONTACT_363319]: 
To obtain whole body and segmental changes in body fat and fat free 
mass including trunk, arms and legs, as well as visceral and 
subcutaneous fat, two (2) DXA scans will be performed, one at visit 2 
and another one at visit 5. 
Fasting Resting Metabolic Rate/Respi[INVESTIGATOR_363282]:   
Fasting RMR/RQ will be performed by a member of the study team at 
visits 2 and 5 to determine fat burning rate. 
 
Electrocardiogram (EKG): 
To ensure the safety and suitability of study participants, as well as of 
the supplement, two separate EKGs will be performed at visits 2 and 3.
EKGs will be performed to assess heart activity and any changes that 
may occur throughout the study.

be informed. The study physician will advise the participant to follow 
up with their primary care physician and also decide if the participant 
can continue with the intervention.
Participants will receive a compliance calendar used to track their 
supplement intake at visit 2.
Participants will be required to return any unused supplements and 
compliance calendar at visits 3, 4 and 5. Participants that miss a visit 
beyond the allowed interval (4 weeks 21 week from previous visit) will 
be instructed to discontinue their supplement, if they have not done so
already, and they will be removed from the study.

Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452572] room only available to designated research staf.  Upon
entry into the research study, the volunteer will be assigned a unique 
code number.  For storage, blood and urine samples will be identifed 
with this unique code number (not related to medical record number), 
date, laboratory generated login number and sample description (i.e. 
plasma, serum, urine).
All samples and data generated from the research study will be labeled
and/or recorded with a unique code number and no other identifer. 
The information that will allow the unique code number to be linked to 
the volunteer’s name [CONTACT_363337] a password-protected computer 
fle.  Samples will be stored until all analyses are complete.  If blood 
samples collected during the course of this research study are sent 
outside the HNRCA for analysis, they will be labeled in a manner that 
contains no information that can make it possible to trace the sample 
back to the volunteer as an individual.  At the conclusion of the study, 
the information fle that would allow linking of the volunteer’s 
identifcation information with the sample labels will be destroyed.  
After the research study is completed data and samples will be stored 
in a manner such that the identity will not be traceable.
Volunteers’ records will be fled in the Metabolic Research Unit’s 
Medical Records File Room located on the 11th Floor of the Human 
Nutrition Research Center.  Research records, including volunteer 
records, will be retained for a period of [ADDRESS_452573] access to the research records.
X. Alternatives
Participation in this study is entirely the participant’s choice. 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
Versions of the study supplement are available for purchase from 
vendors outside of the study.

XI. Payment
All stipends will be mailed to participants in the form of checks 2-3 
weeks after they complete each visit. Participants who are removed 
from the study or choose to drop out will be paid for their completed 
visits only, and will not be paid if they are removed or choose to drop 
out before the completion of any study visit . In the event of a 
government shutdown or any other emergency situation, stipend will 
be delayed until the shutdown or emergency has ended.  
F.Specifc Procedures Used Throughout this Study
Distribution and Storage of Dietary Supplement
Supplements and placebo will be labeled in a binary (e.g., A or B) 
fashion without study staf’s knowledge of which is which. Both 
supplement and placebo will be stored in locked cabinets at the MRU. 
The two will be distributed to participants, in accordance with their 
randomization scheme, starting at visit 2. Participants will receive an 
extra week’s worth of supplements at each visit wherein supplement is
distributed in anticipation of events that may keep volunteers from 
attending their next visit after 4 weeks. 
Weight and Height:
Body weight will be measured during each visit to the HNRCA, aside 
from visit 1. Participants will be asked to change into scrubs provided 
by [CONTACT_363322].
Height will be measured at each visit to the HNRCA except enrollment. 
Shoes and head dressings or ornaments will be removed. 
Measurements will be taken according to standard procedure.
Waist and Hip Circumference:
Waist and hip circumference will be measured at visits [ADDRESS_452574] portion of the buttocks with the 
tape parallel to the foor. These measures will be performed in 
duplicate and averaged. 
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR):
RMR measures will be performed only at the visits [ADDRESS_452575] for 30 min prior to measurement. Systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure will be measured.  Measures of VO 2 and VCO 2 will be made 
19

Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452576] gases of known 
concentration. Subjects will be instructed to relax and avoid fdgeting 
and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_363285]. Measures will be made under 
thermo-neutral conditions for 40 minutes. Rates of energy expenditure 
will be calculated from VO 2 and VCO 2 using Weir’s equation. Fasting 
oral temperature will be measured on days in which RMR is measured.
Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) :
DXA measurement will be performed only at the visits [ADDRESS_452577] 
remove shoes, and it may be necessary to remove skirts, slacks, 
brassieres, etc. If clothes are removed, a medical cotton gown will be 
provided during the scan. Subjects will be asked to lie down on the 
scan table without allowing their hands and legs to overlap while the 
scan is performed.  The analysis of each whole body scan will generate
values for total body lean, total BMC, total body fat, total body mass, 
trunk fat, trunk lean, total bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar BMD, 
upper extremity fat, upper extremity lean, lower extremity fat and 
lower extremity lean. To minimize error, each patient will be scanned 
on the same machine from baseline to fnal. Scans will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_363323].
Electrocardiogram (EKG):
An EKG will be performed by [CONTACT_363324] 2 and 3. Areas of 
participant’s chest, arms and legs will be rubbed with alcohol and [ADDRESS_452578], which 
takes approximately 20 minutes to administer.
Skinfold Thickness: 
To obtain more specifc subcutaneous fat measurements we will 
perform skinfold thickness tests. Tests will be performed at visit 2 and 
visit 5. Participants will be asked to remove their shirts in order to 
obtain the measurements. Skinfold thickness will be measured at four 
sites: subscapular, suprailliac, the biceps and the triceps. All measures 
will be performed on the participant’s right side unless it is not possible
to do so.  Sites will be identifed through anatomical landmarks and 
measurements. The skinfold site will be marked. The participants skin 
will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_363286] 1cm above the mark using the thumb 
and index fnger, and simultaneously pulled away from the underlying 
muscle to form the skinfold. While the pi[INVESTIGATOR_363287]

top of the hip bone. Triceps will be measured at the posterior midline 
of the upper arm, and biceps at the anterior midline of the upper arm.
Questionnaires:
The following questionnaires  will be administered:
Beck Depression Inventory:  this questionnaire will be administered 
by [CONTACT_363325] 5 to assess volunteer’s 
psychological state. If subjects score ˃ 20, they will be informed of 
the result and a recommendation will be made to follow up with 
their physician.  
Three Factor Eating Questionnaire : This questionnaire will be 
administered by [CONTACT_363326] 2 and 5 .
Food Cravings Questionnaire-trait:  This questionnaire will be 
administered by [CONTACT_363326] [ADDRESS_452580] 7-Day Physical Activity Recall : This questionnaire will be 
administered by [CONTACT_363326] 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Volunteer Consent and Safety:
The protocol will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_363327] (IRB), and written informed consent will be obtained 
from all participants. Study volunteers will be given the opportunity to 
read consent forms in a quiet area free of noise and distraction. 
Consent forms will be thoroughly reviewed with the volunteer and all of
their questions will be answered to the volunteer’s satisfaction. 
Comprehension of study information will be assessed by [CONTACT_363328]. Participants will be told they can decline participation 
at any time for any reason. Participant identifers will be kept in a 
separate fle from data. Data collection forms will not have participant 
identifers. The participant’s identity and records relating to the 
prescreening and screening procedures will be kept confdential in 
locked cabinets at all times at the Volunteer Recruitment Services, and
at the MRU, respectively, whether or not the participant qualifes for 
the study. The information kept may be used to invite the individual to 
participate in future studies at the HNRCA. If a participant chooses not

Obese Subjects
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_363277] 3/2/[ADDRESS_452581] access to participant 
identifying information, if needed; otherwise, only de-identifed data 
will be transferred to co-investigators. All data will be kept in secure 
fles and locked data cabinets. Identifers will not be destroyed at any 
point.
Participants and nursing staf will be able to reach the study physician, 
[CONTACT_109193], or a covering physician 24 hours/day. Specifc 
participant complaints will be addressed on an individual basis and 
appropriate referrals to primary care providers or other health care 
providers will be made. Participants’ health status will be assessed 
weekly through phone or email and will be updated by [CONTACT_363329].  While there is no evidence to suggest so, there might 
be some adverse efects from EMIQ’s efect on fat loss, or EMIQ itself. If
these problems are reported by [CONTACT_4317], the condition will be 
assessed to determine if these adverse events are potentially study-
related. Further, in the case of these and any other adverse event, the 
study physician will advise participants on the appropriate assistance 
or action to take, and then counseled to seek further appropriate 
assistance. 
Compensation will not be available for any research-related injury, and 
treatment may incur charges for the subject. The Nursing staf at the 
MRU is basic BLS (CPR) certifed and trained in the use of an automatic 
external defbrillator (AED). In all emergency situations, the MRU 
Nursing staf will provide immediate basic life support (BLS) response, 
call 911 and continue to provide emergency supportive care as needed
(e.g., monitoring, oxygen, airway maintenance) until emergency 
medical service (EMS) arrives. Their philosophy is to provide early 
access to the most appropriate and advanced care for treatment of 
study subjects. Treatment by [CONTACT_363330]/or the staf 
physician is provided at no cost to the participants. All additional 
treatment including the cost of an ambulance is charged to the study 
subject. There are no funds available for these costs to be paid by [CONTACT_363331]. This information is provided to participants 
prior to their signing an informed consent form.
A participant may be dropped from the study should a reported 
adverse reaction to the study supplement be considered severe.

Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:
As this study is low-risk, it does not have a Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). The PI, along with the IRB, will ensure that volunteer safety and data 
integrity are maintained through our Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. This 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlines the PI’s, [CONTACT_363340], role as follows:
[CONTACT_363341] will regularly monitor potential risks and procedures in order to 
protect participants from risk.
Will discuss any adverse events with the study physician on a weekly basis.
Will report any adverse events associated with participation in the study 
protocol and fle all required annual paperwork with the IRB.
Will evaluate the progress of the study including periodic assessments of 
data quality and timeliness, recruitment, enrollment and retention, protocol 
violations, unanticipated events, volunteer risk vs. beneft, and anything else 
that may have an impact on the study outcome.
Maintain vigilance of developments outside of the study that could afect 
participant’s safety.
Perform, at minimum, two reviews of the data per year to ensure safety and 
efficacy of the study.
Responsibility for all procedures performed. 
Reviews all data as it may relate to volunteer safety. This includes factors like
participant retention and reason for drop-out.
Reporting all serious adverse events regardless of their relation to the study 
protocol.
Provide the IRB with summaries of all adverse events.
At the discretion of [CONTACT_363341], the Co-I, [CONTACT_290381], or [CONTACT_170628], the 
study may be terminated at any time if the risks to study subjects are found 
to outweigh the potential benefts.
Additionally, no personal results will be communicated to study participants. 
However, participants will be informed of any necessary new fndings 
developed during the course of this research study. Written results may be 
given directly, or mailed, to participants if they are still in the study, or 
mailed to them if they have completed their participation in the study.
H.Outcome
Our goal is to assess the safety and efficacy of EMIQ as it relates to body fat 
reduction. We predict that there will be no changes in health, and that there 
will be a signifcant diference between change in total body fat between the 
treatment and placebo groups.

Optional participation in tissue banking is ofered during the informed 
consent process for participation in the main study.  All pertinent information 
regarding what will happen to the stored samples, how long they will be 
stored; their potential future use for research, etc. will be outlined clearly. 
Participants will be informed as to how they can withdraw their sample from 
the tissue bank if they choose to do so. Participants will be asked to take the 
time to think about their decision, and will be encouraged to ask questions. 
All questions and concerns will be addressed to the participant’s satisfaction 
to ensure the participant is giving informed consent.

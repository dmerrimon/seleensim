1.0 Research Introduction  
1.1 Purpose/Specific  Aims  
To characterize  the effect  of food supplemented with dietary fiber  on glycemic response in humans  
A. Objectives

Protocol Number: 18-074 
Version: #2; September 27, 2017  
PI [CONTACT_5627]: Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_422404]:  The effect of dietary fiber -
supplemented food on glycemic response in 
human: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  [ADDRESS_533448] of food supplemented with dietary fiber on postprandial blood  glucose levels. 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_422406] d ata to facilitate the development of a high dietary fiber dietary intervention 
for an upcoming study that aims at improving gut microbial profile and functions to improve glycemic 
control  in patients with type 2 diabetes .  
B. Hypotheses / Research Question (s) 
We hypothesize that food supplemented with dietary fiber will reduce postprandial glycemic response as 
compared to a standard meal tolerance test (white bread with 50 g of available carbohydrates). Further, 
the impact of supplemented food, although wit h the same amount of dietary fiber, will vary due to 
differences in cooking  procedures  and serving temperatures.   
 
1.2 Research Significance  (Briefly describe the following in 500 words or less ): 
The gut ecosystem has now been regarded as the foundation f or human health, with developi[INVESTIGATOR_422407]. D ysbiosis (an 
imbalance of beneficial and detrimental microbes) has long been associated with metabolic disease s, notably obesity 
and type [ADDRESS_533449] not been 
fully elucidated, but the literature po ints to short -chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production  from bacterial  carbohydrate 
fermentation  as a key microbial function that is essential for humans  and the deficiency of which  may lead  to 
deleterious metabolic sequelae . SCFAs confer direct benefits to humans, e.g. butyrate is the primary energy 
substrate for colonocytes and a wide range of SCFAs fu nction as signaling molecules that modulate inflammation 
and appetite r egulation (1). SCFAs also impact on the gut ecosystem per se . By [CONTACT_422422], SCFAs 
create  a selective pressure against acid -intolerant bacteria (notably opportunistic pathogens) and therefore an 
acidity -driven shift in o verall gut microbial structure (2).  
 
Dietary fiber is the primary source of fermentable carbohydrates for the gut bacteri a and thus dietary fiber 
supplementation is commonly used in microbiota -targeted dietary intervention s. There is some evidence for 
increased dietary fiber intake to positively impact on metabolic outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (3, 4) . A 
single dietary fiber type , however,  is unlikely to confer universal benefits. The human gut microbiota is hig hly variable 
across individuals,  with different capacities for fermenting dietary fiber of various physiochemical  properties . 
Accordingly, it is logical to tailor microbiota -targeted dietary interventions based on each individuals gut microbial 
functions (a separate project that we are currently pursuing). From a population health perspective, dietary fiber 
fortifica tion of everyday food products should consist of a broad range of dietary fiber types so that most individuals 
would be able to benefit from at least some of the ingredients.  
 
We have developed two  dietary fiber mixes, one consists  of different bran as so urces of insoluble dietary fiber 
(sorghum bran, corn bran, wheat bran and  oat bran ; Insoluble Mix) and the other  one consists of two soluble dietary 
fiber (in ulin and Fibersol -2®; Soluble Mix). The work proposed here will explore the effect of these two Mi xes on 
glycemic response in human. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_422408]/meal development for an upcoming study that will 
explore the effect of a gut microbiota -targeted dietary intervention program on glucose homeostasis in patients 
with type [ADDRESS_533450] 6 food items  (plus a control food for comparison)  with postprandial 
glycemic response monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system. The study will be conducted at the 
Cook -Douglass Student Health Center  and Harvest Café at New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition & Health (IFNH) . 
There will be an eligibility scre ening  and group assignment  visit, and 14 food testing visits over 4 weeks  (Figure 1) .

RECRUITMENT.  Prospective participants will be recruited through advertisements on Rutgers University website  and 
email lists (Attachment 3A ), and flyers on the Rutgers University  campuses  (Attachment 3 B). Interested i ndividuals  
will be asked to contact [CONTACT_422423] , during which a research officer will provide an overview of the 
study  and descri be the broad selection criteria. Prospective participants will be invited to attend  a screening visit  to 
establish eligibility.  The final selection will  be contingent upon the individuals  meeting all eligibility criteria and are 
deemed capable of complying with  the protocol.  
 
ELIGIBILITY S CREENING.  Prospective participants will attend the eligibility screening visit after an overnight fast  of 
at least 8 h . They will meet a member of the research team  at IFNH, who will provide a detailed description of the 
study, including the rationale, aim , expected outcomes and significance of the research, the experimental 
procedures, what is required from the participants, and the benefits and risks associated with the study. Written 
informed consent (Attachment 4 ) will be obtained prior to the eligibili ty screening process. All information collected  
during the screening process will be documented in the screening checklist (Attachment 7 ). Specifically a Research  
Officer will record medical history and current medications  and assess eligibility . Patients with type 2 diabetes who 
are receiving  nutritional management and/or oral hypoglycemic medications may be eligible for the study, however 
those who are receiving insulin treatment or other injectable prescription medication will be excluded.  A full list of  
inclusion and exclusion criteria  is available in Section 4.2 . 
 
GROUP ASSIGNMENT.  Upon confirmation of eligibility , the Research Officer will measure fasting blood glucose 
concentration (FBG) by [CONTACT_746] a finger prick test (ACCU -CHEK ® Aviva Plus, [COMPANY_002] Diabetes Care, Indianapolis, 
IN). Participants who are clinically diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes (diet -controlled 
and/or on oral hypoglycemic medications) will be assigned to the Prediabetes/Diabetes group irrespective of thei r 
finger prick test results. , For participants who are not diagnosed with diabetes, those with FBG < 100 mg/dL will be 
assigned to the Non -Diabetes  group, and those with FBG ≥ 100 mg/dL will be assigned to the Prediabetes/Diabetes 
group  based on classification guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (5). Participants will also be asked 
to sign up for one of the testing panels: 1) Panel A will test one control food (white bread) and six fiber -supplemented 
food (dietary fibe r mix in water, hot waffle, room temperature waffle, hot pancake , room temperature pancake  and 
muffin ); or 2) Panel B will test one control food (white bread) and six fiber -supplemented food (dietary fiber mix in 
water, sponge cake, crispbread, vegetable s moothie, fruit smoothie  and muffin ). Finally, t he Research Officer will 
collect information to complete the participant profile, including anthropometry measurements (height and weight), 
and demographics and contact [CONTACT_8972] .  
 
The eligibility screening and group assignment visit will take approximately  [ADDRESS_533451] 8 h. They will be required to consume all the study  food provided under supervision. The

 amount of white bread to be consumed will contain 50 g of available carbohydrates (3 -4 slices of bread), and the 
amount of fiber -supplemented  food to be consumed will contain 60 g of dietary fiber mix (approximately 2 wa ffles, 
2 pancakes, 2 slices of sponge cake, 2 serves of crispbread, 2 muffins or 300 ml of smoothies). Participants may leave 
the research facility after consuming the food, and they will be instructed to refrain from eating and drinking (except 
water) for  the next 3 h . Each food will be tested twice over two consecutive days , with all testing to be completed in  
4 weeks (Figure 1) . Each food testing session will take approximately 30 min to complete.  
 
Postprandial glycemic response will be assessed by [CONTACT_422424], to be monitored using 
a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM; FreeStyle Libre Pro, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda CA).  On the first 
day of food testing, a  sensor will be placed on the participant’s arm by [CONTACT_422425] (Abbott Diabetes Care).  The sensor  will stay on the participant’s arm 
until the end of the study (the sensor will be replaced after 14 days as per manufacturer instructions). Participants 
will be asked not to take the sensor below 3 ft (1 m) of water and not to submerge the sensor in water for more than 
[ADDRESS_533452] food item is consumed and the end of the week.  
 
SAFETY MONITORING.  All food ingredients will be sourced from local commercial suppliers and the dietary fiber 
mixes will be prepared in -house at the Food Innovation Center of Rutgers University (a facility that operates under 
constant USDA inspection). The dietary fiber mix es will undergo microbial count testing at EMSL Analytical 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_135997], NJ). All meals will b e prepared at Harvest Café of IFNH where all ma nagers are Serv Safe certified. CGM 
data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_422426], with written consent from the participants, will communicate 
directly with their primary healthcare provider (s) should th ere be a need for medical care adjustment.  
 
1.4 Preliminary Data  
Our research group focuses on using dietary interventions , primarily dietary fiber supplementation,  to restore and 
maintain a healthy gut microbiota as a key strategy to improve metabolic he alth. In a cohort of children with Prader -
Willi syndrome (a genetic form of obesity) (6), we showed that a diet enriched in non -digestible carbohydrates 
induced significant weight loss and metabolic improvements, a n effect associated with structural changes of the gut 
microbiota. Importantly, germ -free mice that received fecal microbiota transplantation derived from participants 
post -intervention exhibited a more favorable metabolic profile and glycemic control as compared to those animals 
that received pre -intervention fecal material, which  provide d direct evidence for the gut microbiota to causally 
contribute to the host glucose homeostasis .  
 
In two cohorts  that we have recently completed , a comparable 3-month high dietary fiber regimen w as able to 
significantly reduce HbA1c in adults with type 2 diabetes (under review with Nature). Below are the HbA1c data from 
the GUT2D (participants were institutionalized; Figure 2A) and the QIDONG studies  (participants were und er free -
living conditions; Figure 2B).

Figure 2. The effects  of a high dietary fiber  regimen on HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes in the GUT2D (A) 
and QIDONG (B) cohorts.  
 
In the GUT2D cohort, high dietary fiber intake induced shifts in the overall  structure of the gut microbiota (Figure 
3A) that was driven by [CONTACT_422427] a guild of acetate - and butyrate -producing bacteria (Figure 3B) . 
The dramatic reduction of fecal pH from 6.82 ± 0.07 at baseline to 6.36 ± 0.11 at the end of the 3 -month intervention, 
together with trended  increase  in overall fecal SCFA content, supported that a high dietary fiber regimen was 
effective in increasing bacterial carbohydrat e fermentation, and these we re associated with improvements in 
glucose homeostasis and overall metabolic profiles of patients with type 2 diabetes.

the Prediabetes/Diabetes group, for each of the test panel (i.e. a total of 20 comp leters). This sample size is 
comparable to those used in published pi[INVESTIGATOR_422409]. Steinert et al (7) used  10 participants ( healthy, 
overweight and obese) to examine the effect of oat bran on glycem ic response; Sheflin et al (8) used 7 participants 
(3 in control and 4 in experimental group) to examine the effect of heat -stabilized rice bran on gut microbiota and 
metabolites.

 Participants will be paid up to $ 60. The compensat ion is based on the amount of time that the participants 
is expected to  spent  in our research facilities  and is calculated according to the minimum wage in New 
Jersey in 2017.  They will have to successfully complete all food testing sessions to receive ful l compensation. 
The payment schedules are as follow:  
 
- $20 when they complete  Week 2  
- $[ADDRESS_533462] and the use of CGM sensor both involve pi[INVESTIGATOR_422412]. 
However infection i s rare.  
 
Participants may experience gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation or 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) when they consume the fiber -supplemented test food . These discomforts are common,  
however, these discomforts are minor and they s hould not last longer than a few hours .

the research team, they may report such a  need to  the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_422413] w ill be adjusted accordingly. P articipants will not be required to provide a reason if they 
desire not to do so. Should changing of the research personnel is not possible, the Prin cipal Investigator  will 
discuss with the  participants about alternative  solut ions.  
 
In order to ensure the protection of personal health information of the participants, there will be no 
identifiable information on any of the data collection instruments. Each participant will be assigned a unique 
identification code. A master code  identifier which links the identification code and personal information 
(name, date of birth and contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be maintained separately from the study data. Only the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422414] a specific ne ed for identifiable 
information  will have access  (e.g. Study Physician to communicate directly with participants and/or their 
primary physicians ; research student/staff to schedule appointments). All data and materials collected 
during this study are for r esearch purpose only, and the data will be kept in strict confidence. No 
information will be given to anyone without permission from the participants.  
 
I. Research Team Access To Subject Data  
A code will be assigned to every participant and the collected data will be recorded using the participant’s 
unique code for identification purposes. Only the Principal Investigator , Study Physician and research 
staff/student who schedule appointments will have access to the master code identifier and be able to re-
identify the participants if necessary.  Each member of the research team will only be able to have access to 
the subset s of study data  (in de -identified form)  that are  relevant to his/her scope of work.

 A. Data analysis plan : Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS Statistics Software Package. 
Analysis of variance with Tukey’s post -hot test (two -tailed) will be used for intra -and inter -group 
comparisons of postprandial blood glucose concentration (area -under -curve) . Independent -samples t test 
(two -tailed) will be used to analyze variations in other participant characteristics. Statistical significance will 
be accepted at p value < 0.05.  
  
B. Quality control : All research personnel will complete CITI training and be knowledgeable about  Good  
Clinical Practice (GCP) , relevant regulations and policies . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422415], regulatory requirements, GCP standards  at all times . Team meeting will be held on a 
regular basis to review adherence to st udy protocol, and to discu ss any incidents of failures of  protocol 
compliance , keepi[INVESTIGATOR_422416], and reporting of adverse events.  
  
C. Data handling:  The study data will include two key components: 1) a master code identifier that cont ains

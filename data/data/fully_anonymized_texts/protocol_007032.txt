DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.   Concomitant Medication:  A concomitant medication (con -med) is a  drug, other than a 
study drug, taken by a subject after initial dose of study drug.  Database Lock : The point at which all clinical trial data has been reviewed, queries resolved, 
and issues addressed, and the database can no longer be changed in any manner; a locked database is ready to undergo statistical analysis.  
 Double -blind Study : A study in which neither the subject nor the investigator nor the research 
team knows what treatment a subject is receiving.  
 Dropout:  A subject in a clinical trial who , for any reason , fails to continue in the trial until the 
last visit required of him/her by [CONTACT_4690].  eCRF:  Audible electronic record designed to record information required by [CONTACT_682710].  Efficacy:  The capacity of a drug or treatment to produce beneficial effects on the course or 
duration of a disease at the dose tested and against the illness for which it is designed.   Endpoint:  An indicator or outcome measured in a subject or biological sample to assess the 
safety, efficacy, or other objective of a trial. Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a trial.   p value:  The lowest level of significance at which a given null hypothesis can be rejected; that 
is, the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than that observed if the null hypothesis is true.   Prior Medication:  A prior medication is a drug  taken  prior to the initial dose of study drug.  
 Randomization:  The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce bias.  
 Serious Adverse event (SAE):  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in 
death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly /birth defect.

Statistical Analysis P lan: A statistical analysis plan is a document that contains a more 
technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the analysis described in the 
protocol, and includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data.   Statistical Significance:  State that applies when a hypothesis is rejected. Whether or not a given 
result is significant depends on the significance level adopted.   Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE):   An event that emerges during treatment, 
having been absent pretreatment, or worsens relative to the pretreatment state.  
 Withdrawal:  The act of reducing the degree of participation by a subject in a clinical trial. 
Subjects may withdraw permission for Sponsor use of data derived from study participation, privacy waivers, informed consent, or withdraw from active treatment component of a clinical trial but continue to be observed. Full withdrawal from participation in a study is called discontinuation.

methods specified in this document and the protocol, will be discussed in the clinical study 
report.  
The Biostatistician is responsible for updating the SAP throughout the life cycle of the study  as 
and when required.  However, the first version of the SAP should be signed off before the database (DB) lock and any further changes should be addressed by [CONTACT_682711](s) along with  rationale for those 
change(s) which are essential and w ould not compromise the quality and integrity of data or 
results. As this is a living document, changes will be made as needed.  The responsible  
representative at Actavis  will be required to review and approve all versions of the SAP.  
 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 2.1 Primary Objective  
 
Following are t he primary objectives  of this study: 
 (i) Bioequivalence of rifaximin 200- mg tablets (the test product) and Xifaxan® 200-mg 
tablets (the reference product) with respect to the clinical cure rate within a period of [ADDRESS_924750] dose  when administered 3 times a day (TID) for 3 days in 
subjects with Travelers’ Diarrhea (TD).   
Clinical cure is defined as either of the following:  
 No stools or only formed stools within a 48 hour period and no fever, with or without other enteric symptoms, OR 
 
 No watery stools or no more than two soft stools passed within a 24 hour period with no fever and no other enteric symptoms except for mild excess gas/flatulence.  
 
 
In addition, clinical deterioration by [CONTACT_995] 5 or failure to achieve formed stool in ≤ 3 days (i.e., within [ADDRESS_924751] dose) is a clinical failure.  
 
(ii) Superiority of test and reference products over placebo with respect to the clinical  cure     
rate within a period of [ADDRESS_924752] dose, in the treatment of TD, using the mITT population with LOCF. 
 2.2 Secondary Objective  
 
Following are t he secondary objectives of this study:

• To compare “Time to last unformed stool” ( TLUS) observed for rifaximin 200 -mg tablets 
and Xifaxan 200- mg tablets within a period of 120 hr. (last dose which is 72hrs, plus 
48hrs). TLUS is defined as the interval beginning with the first dose of study drug and 
ending with the last unformed stool passed till [ADDRESS_924753] dose .  
 
• To compare the microbiological cure rate of rifaximin 200- mg tablets and Xifaxan [ADDRESS_924754] of cure (TOC) visit.  Subjects are considered to have achieved 
microbiological cure if the patho gen identified at Visit [ADDRESS_924755] ( Rifaximin 200 -mg Tablets ) to Reference ( Xifaxan® 200- mg 
Tablets ) in the treatment of Travelers’ Diarrhea. 
 
ii. Superiority of test and reference products over placebo with respect to the clinical cure     rates within a period of [ADDRESS_924756] dose, in the treatment of TD, 
using the mITT population with LOCF. 
  Approximately six hundred eighteen (618) adult, non- indigenous travelers with naturally 
acquired acute diarrhea will be enrolled up to 40 sites . Subjects will be participating in the study 
for approximately 7 days and will be randomized  to receive rifaximin 200- mg 
tablets, Xifaxan 200- mg tablets, or placebo tablets, TID for 3 days, beginning not more than 72 
hours after the onset of diarrhea.   The scheduled study visits will include:   Visit I:   Screening, Randomization and Treatment Visit [Day 1 to Day 4]

f. In case stool sample collection not possible at visit 3, a rectal swab will be collected  
 
4. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
4.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
 
4.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
As per p rotocol , the primary efficacy endpoint is clinical cure rate on TOC Visit (Study Day 5, 
6 or 7). Clinical cure is defined as either of the following:  
 
 No stools or only formed stools within a 48 hour period and no fever, with or without other enteric symptoms, OR  
 No watery stools or no more than two soft stools passed within a 24 hour period with no fever and no other enteric symptoms except for mild excess gas/flatulence.  
 
In addition, clinical deterioration by [CONTACT_995] 5 or failure to achieve formed stool in ≤ 3 days  
(i.e., within [ADDRESS_924766] dose) is  a clinical failure.  
 As per FDA’s OGD guidance , the primary endpoint is clinical cure at the test of cure (TOC) 
visit on study Day 5, with a window period of +/ - one day . In line with OGD, the protocol was 
designed such that the TOC visit should occur [ADDRESS_924767]’s diary data from [ADDRESS_924768] 
dose when the drug is administered 3 times a day (TID) for 3 days in subjects with Travelers’ Diarrhea (TD). Accordingly, clinical cure is re-defined as either of the following:
 
 
 No stools or only formed stools within a [ADDRESS_924769] dose with no 
fever, and with or without other enteric symptoms, OR 
 
 No watery stools or no more than two soft stools passed within a [ADDRESS_924770] dose  with no fever and no other enteric symptoms except for mild 
excess gas/flatulence.  
 
This above decision was taken to standardize the data to be used for efficacy analysis and therefore there is no impact on the quality, safety & integrity of data due to the following reasons - 
  
1. The evaluation of primary efficacy endpoint will be based on patient reported data and not the visit dependent clinician’s evaluation.

2. This is a planned deviation for efficacy evaluation and will be applied to all the 
subjects.  
 
 4.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
 Secondary efficacy endpoints are the following:  
• Time to last unformed stool ( TLUS)  
TLUS is defined as the interval beginning with the first dose of study drug and ending with 
the last unformed stool passed within a period of 120 hr. (last dose which is 72hrs, plus 
48hrs). 
Mathematically, TLUS will be calculated as follows: 
TLUS (hours) = date/time of last unformed stool within 48hrs from the time of last dose – 
date/time of first dose  
 
• Microbiological cure rate  
Subjects are considered to have achieved microbiological cure if the pathogen identified at Visit [ADDRESS_924771] treatment arms and not considered as evidence of clinical bioequivalence. 
 4.2 Safety Endpoint s 
 The safety endpoints are:  
 
1. Number and proportion of subjects reporting adverse events 
2. Changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations from baseline  
3. Prior or Concomitant Medication 
4. Medical History  
5. Enteric symptoms

Version: 03, D ated: 19-APR -[ADDRESS_924772] one dose of study drug will form the Safety Analysis Set. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all analyses of safety, tolerability, and background characteristics.  
 
4.5 Modified intent -to-treat (mITT)  
 
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) is a subset of the safety analysis set consisting of all 
randomized subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, received at least one dose of study drug and provided efficacy and safety data after one dose of study drug.  The mITT set is the basis for  testing superiority of each active arm compared to the placebo with 
respect to primary efficacy endpoint i.e. clinical cure rate.  
 
4.6 Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The PP analysis set is the primary analysis set for the assessment of bioequivalence between the test and the reference products . 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects discontinued early for other reasons will be excluded from the PP population, 
but included in the mITT population, using LOCF.  6. HANDLING MISSING V ALUES  
 
LOCF will be used to impute missing efficacy data for the following situations.

imputed. However, for the purpose of summary, AEs with missing relationship to study drug assessment will be counted as “related”; AEs with missing intensity assessment will be counted as “severe”.  Missing intensity and relationship will be presented as is on the individual subject data listing.  
 7. STATISTICAL METHOD OLOGY  
 
Unless otherwise explicitly stated, descriptive statistics for continuous variables are: n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.  Descriptive statistics for categorical variables are: percentage, and the numerator (n) and the  denominator (N) used in the percentage 
calculation.

cure rate using Per -Protocol (PP) population. The hypothesis for testing equivalence is stated as 
below:  7.1.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
(i)    Hypothesis for Bioequivalence:  
H
0 : pT – pR < -0.20 or  pT – pR > 0.20 
Versus  
H1: -0.20 ≤ pT –pR ≤ 0.20  
 
Where pT = clinical cure rate of test treatment and pR = clinical cure rate of reference treatment.  
 

Protocol ACTA/RIFX/2015                        
Statistical Analysis Plan  
                                                          
 
Version: 03, D ated: 19-APR -[ADDRESS_924774] with Yates correction, each at the 0.05 significance level.  In practice, this is 
equivalent to constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference (test – reference) 
using a statistical model appropriate for the study design. If both intervals fall comple tely within 
the cut -off limits of [ -0.20, +0.20] for clinical cure rates in this study, then equivalence is 
declared.  Otherwise, equivalence is not declared.  
 
(ii) Hypothesis for Superiority:  
H0:  pT  =  pP 
Versus  
H1:  pT  ≠  pP 
Where pT = clinical cure rate of subjects treated with rifaximin or Xifaxan and pP = clinical cure 
rate of subjects receiving placebo.  
 
The objective of superiority test is to demonstrate that the test product and the reference product 
performed as expected (i.e. statistically superior to placebo) in the study. Hence, this null 
hypothesis serves as a validity to check the study sensitivity, after establishing the clinical 
bioequivalence between the test product and the reference product. 
The null hypothesis for superiority analysis will be evaluated based on the mITT analysis set 
with LOCF for the missing data using a two -sided Z -test test with Yates correction with a 
significance level of α=0.05.  Differences between the treatment groups and 95% CIs for the 
differe nce will be presented.  
 The tests for superiority will be conducted independently for test and reference products and superiority will be claimed if the two -sided p -value is found to be <0.05 at 5% level of 
significance for both, test and reference product s separately; and the clinical cure rate is higher 
for the active drug(s) when compared with the placebo arm.
 
 
7.1.2 Hypothesis for Other Efficacy parameters  
  
Difference between groups in other efficacy endpoints will be examined as 
supportive/confirmatory analysis base on the following null hypothesis: 
 For categorical variables:  
H
0 : P i = P j  vs H 1: Pi ≠ Pj 
Where P = proportion of subjects meeting the criteria, I and j = 1 (Test) , 2 (Reference), or  
3 (Placebo) and i ≠ j  
 For continuous variables: 
H
0 : µ i = µ j  vs H 1: µi ≠ µj 
Where µ  = group mean/median , i and j = 1 (Test), 2 (Reference), or 3 (Placebo) and i ≠ j

All tests will be two -sided and performed at the 0.05 significance  level.  No adjustments will be 
made for multiplicity testing since all secondary efficacy endpoints are supportive/ confirmatory.  
 
7.2   Sample Size Justification  
 
The sample size calculation for this study is based on the published literature (CDER statistical 
review of NDA submission 21- 361) and FDA’s current guidance (FDA Guidance, 2004) on the 
clinical endpoint bioequivalence study of Rifaximin 200 mg.  
 
  
 
Superiority to be concluded when the lower bound of 
the two -sided 95% CI is greater than zero i.e. the 95% CI does not contain zero.  
 
achieve at least 85% power to detect equivalence 
when the margin of equivalence for clinical cure rate extends from - 0.20 to 0.20 (i.e. ± 20%). 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, approximately 618 patient(s)  will be 
enrolled and randomized  
 
the overall dropout rate from the randomized patient population to mITT population does not exceed 15%.  
 
subjects in the PP population when the lower and upper 90% CI 
falls within [ -0.20, +0.20].   
 
1:1:1 Randomization  
 
  
   
  
  
 Thus, a total of 618  subjects need to be enrolled and randomized  
 
 
 assuming that the dropout rate from the randomized to mITT population does not 
exceed 15%.

Version: 03, D ated: 19-APR -[ADDRESS_924775] co mpliance will be primarily monitored by [CONTACT_682716]  (Visit 1) 
and returned (Visit 3) compared to diary entries. Compliance calculation will be based on 
number of tablets taken (as recorded in the study diary) vs number of tablets s ubjects are 
expected to take.  
 Total extent of exposure to study drug will be measured by [CONTACT_682717] 1.  Study drug compliance (%) will be calculated as number of tablets taken divi ded by [CONTACT_682718] 100.  Subjects are considered to have good compliance if the compliance (%) is within the range of ~75% to ~125%, corresponding to 7 to 11 doses.    
 
7.4 Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analyses are planned in this study.  
 
7.5 Efficacy Analysis  
 
The following primary and secondary variables will be investigated in the evaluation of efficacy:  7.5.[ADDRESS_924776] dose.    To evaluate the null hypothesis (i) i.e., test for equivalence, the proportion of subjects meeting 
the clinical cure criteria will be tabulated by [CONTACT_682719]*  
for missing data imputation.  The differences between the test product and reference product on the PP analysis set will be estimated and the 90% CIs for the difference will be  presented.  The 
90% CIs will be calculated using Z-test for proportion with Yates’ correction as presented below.    
L = (P
T – P R) – 1.645 se – (1/N T + 1/N R)/2 
U = (P T – P R) + 1.645 se + (1/N T + 1/N R)/2 
PT = C T / N T 
PR = C R / NR 
se = SQRT [P T*(1-PT) / N T + P R*(1-PR)/N R] 
 
Where C T and C R are number of subjects meeting the clinical cure criteria in the test product and 
the reference product arm respectively; P T, PR are the proportions of clinical cure from the test 
product arm and the reference product arm, respectively; N T and N R are total number of subjects 
in the analysis set from the test product and the reference arm product, respectively; se = standard error; SQRT = square root.   If the upper and the lower CIs are within the range of [ -0.20, +0.20], the null hypotheses for 
clinical bioequivalence will be rejected and it can be claimed that the test product and the reference product are clinically equivalent with respect to the clinical cure rates.

Reasons for clinical failure will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_682720].     
 
  
  
  
 
To evaluate the null hypothesis (ii) i.e., test of superiority, the proportion of subjects meeting the 
clinical cure criteria will be tabulated based on the mITT analysis set with LOCF for missing data imputation. The differences between each active arm (test and reference) and the placebo group will be tested separately using a two- sided Z -test for proportion using Yates correction; the 
estimated difference and 95% CIs will be presented.    7.5.[ADDRESS_924777], will be used for comparing the median TLUS 
difference between two treatment arms at 5% level of significance, without any adjustment for 
multiplicity.  Additionally, Hodges -Lehmann estimate of location shift and Moses 95% 
confidence intervals  will be calculated to assess the magnitude of median TLUS difference  
between two treatment arms at 5% level of significance . 
 For microbiological cure rate, summary tables will include number and percentage of subjects in each category; differences between groups (test vs. placebo, reference vs. placebo, and test vs. 
reference) will be derived along with the 95% CIs for the difference using the Z -test for 
proportion to test the difference between the treatment groups; the Yates’s correction will be applied for the calculation of 95% CIs.  7.6 Safety Analysis  
 
All Safety analysis will be summarized based on safety population and all safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  7.6.1 Adverse Events  
 
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded.  AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 18.1 or higher. Descriptions of

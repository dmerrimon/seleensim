 2.1 Objectives:  
This prospective, randomized, single -blind trial will randomize patients undergoing 
laparoscopic bariatric  surgery  to either deep (0 twitches, 1 -2 PTC) or m oderate 
(reappearance of T2)  neuromuscular blockade (NMB) .  Within each NMB group, 
patients the initial insufflation pressure will be either 10 or 15 mm Hg : 
 
Primary Endpoint:  
1. Surgeon initial satisfaction with operating conditions    
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Percentage of procedures that can be performed at low (1 0 mm Hg) versus high 
(15 mm Hg) insufflation pressures at each level of NMB  
2. Percentage of procedures requiring additional NMB  and/or insufflation pressures  
to achieve satisfactory intraoperative surgi cal conditions  
3. Quantification of postoperative pain medication requirements with deep versus 
moderate NMB  
 
2.1.1 Clinical Hypotheses:  
Primary Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize  that deep neuromuscular block (NMB)  
1. provide s better intra -operative surgical conditions than moderate NMB during 
laparoscopic bariatric surgery  
 
Exploratory  Hypotheses : 
We hypothesize that  deep neuromuscular block (NMB):  
1. allow s the use of  lower insufflation pressures during laparoscopic bariatric 
surgery  
2. decreases  postoperative pain and the need for  postoperative pain medication

 2.2 Background  & Rationale : 
 
Obesity affects more than [ADDRESS_1072853] ates and it is estimated that 
35% of the US population is obese (body mass index  ≥ 30) with the highest incidence 
(40%) in  women aged [ADDRESS_1072854] increased  comorbidity 
including an increased  risk for coronary heart disease, hypertension,  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] , type 
2 diabetes, and sleep apnea . The treatment of obes ity and its related comorbidities 
costs nearly  $[ADDRESS_1072855] ive in the treatment of obesity, 
but surgery results  in sub stantial long-term weight loss.3 As a result, more than 179,000 
bariatric procedures are performed in the US each year with the majority of these 
surgeries using  laparoscopic techniques.4  
 
Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is routinely used during laparoscopic surgery to 
optimize both intubating and operating conditions for the anesthesiologist and the 
surgeon, respectively. Recent research has shown that in laparoscopic abdominal 
procedures, deep NMB is associated with  superior operating conditions.5-[ADDRESS_1072856] conflicting goals for the level of muscle 
relaxat ion that should be maintained during many surgical procedures.    
 
The introduction of s ugammadex  (Bridion®, [COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme Corp., Oss, The 
Netherlands) , a new neuromuscular reversal agent with the ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_780455] -induced  NMB , will finally provide the anesthesia provider the 
opportunity to maintain deep neuromuscular relaxation throughout the entire surgery 
without compromising time to emergence and increasing p ost-operative complications.[ADDRESS_1072857] the hypothesis that deep NMB provides optimal surgical 
conditions during laparoscopic bariatric surgery in the morbidly obese patient.  In 
addition, we will determine if deep NMB allows the surgeon to utilize lower insufflation 
pressure and decr eases postoperative pain requirements after laparoscopic bariatric 
surgery.    
 
 
2.3 Study Design : 
Study design:  prospective, randomized, assessor -blind ed controlled trial that will be 
performed at a single academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  The surgeons, subjects, and individuals 
performing the postoperative assessments will be blinded to the study group 
assignment.  The anesthesia providers responsible for the clinical care of the patients 
will be aware of the rocuronium NMB treatment group  and NMB and insufflation sta tus 
throughout the surgical procedure .

 2.5 Study Procedures:  
I. Patient popul ation: this study will enroll 14 5 adults undergoing elective 
laparoscopic bariatric surgery.  Our aim is to randomize 140 patients and this will 
allow 5 subjects to drop out of the study after enrollment.  
 
II. Inclusion criteria:  
a. Age ≥ 18 years  
b. ASA I -III 
c. BMI ≥ 35  
 
III. Exclusion criteria:  
a. Inability  to obtain  written  informed consent  
b. Pregnancy or breast feeding  
c. Allergy to rocuronium , sugammadex,  or any anesthetic agents used in the 
protocol  
d. Known or suspected neuromuscular disorders  
e. Significant renal d isease with a serum creatinine ≥  2 mg/dl  
f. Significant liver disease  
g. A family history of malignant hyperthermia  
 
IV. Randomization:  On the day of surgery, patients will be randomized to one of four 
groups:  1. moderate  NMB  + 10 mm insufflation pressure (IP); 2.  moderate  NMB  
+ 15 mm IP; 3.  deep NMB  + 10 mm IP; or 4. deep NMB  + 15 mm IP.   
Rand omization will be stratified for  the four  groups so that obe se patients with 
BMI of 35 to 45  and those with a BMI >  45 are equally distributed between the 
groups.   
 
V. Blinding: The surgeon, operating room staff, patients, personnel in the 
postanesthesia care unit  (PACU)  as well as the investigators collecting the 
postoperative data will be blinded to the group allocation.  The surgeon will also 
[ADDRESS_1072858] monitors including ECG, 
non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, esophageal 
temperature, capnography, and a BIS® depth of anesthesia monitor.  
2. Muscle relaxant monitoring – neuromuscular function will be 
monitored using acceleromyography with the TOF -Watch® SX 
(Organon Ireland Ltd, a subsidiary of [COMPANY_006] and Co., Inc., Swords, 
Co. Dublin, Ireland ).  The TOF tracing will be stabilized after 
induction of anesthesia (prior to the administration of muscle relaxant 
drugs)  according to the manufacturer ’s recomme nded protocol .   
 
b. Anesthetic Technique – all patients will receive a standardized general 
anesthetic technique and all anesthetic medications  (with the exception of 
sugammadex)  will be dosed on the ideal body wei ght rather than actual weight .  
1. Premedication – midazolam , 1-2 mg iv in the holding area  
2. Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for a minimum of 3 minutes  
3. Induction – propofol, 2  – 2.5 mg/kg , iv and fentanyl, 2 -3 
micrograms/kg, iv.  A dditional propofol or fentanyl may be 
administered at the discretion of the anesthesia provider  
4. Intubation – succinylcholine ,1.5 mg/kg , iv after loss of consciousness 
to facilitate tracheal intubation  
9 
 5. Maintenance – ventilation with air/oxygen to achieve a FiO 2 = 0.6 and 
inhaled desflurane adjusted to  maintain a BIS® level of 40 -60,and  
fentanyl, 25 -50 micrograms iv as needed determined by [CONTACT_707649] .  The FiO 2 of oxygen can also be increase d if 
determined necessary by [CONTACT_42778].  
6. Maintenance of muscle relaxation  – after return of neuromuscular 
function  (return of twitches)  after intubation  with succinyl choline , 
patients will be dosed in accordance with their randomization 
assignment to achieve either moderate or deep NMB during surgery .   
c. The roc uronium dosing protocol  during the maintenance phase of anesthesia  
will be:  
1. Moderate  NMB group  [1-3 twitches  in the train of four (TOF)]   – 
rocuronium, 0.2  mg/kg iv, follow ed by a rocuronium infusion which will 
be started at the appearance of 1 twi tch and adjusted to maintain 1-3 
twitches throughout the procedure  
2. Deep NMB group  [0-1 posttetanic count (PTC)]  – rocuronium, 0.6  
mg/kg  iv, followed  by a rocuronium infusion at 10 mcg/kg/min. The 
infusion will be adjusted to maintain 0 -1 PTC throughout the 
procedure.  
 
d. Reversal of NMJ  blockade  - The rocuronium infusions will be continued until the 
fascia is closed.  At that point, the rocuronium infusions will be discontinued.  
The level of NMJ block will be assessed with the TOF watch and the patients will 
be reversed with sugammadex  (using actual body weight)  after assessment of 
the TOF ratio.  Reversal will be dosed as follows:  
1. Deep block (defined as a TOF count of [ADDRESS_1072859] -
tetanic counts ) will be reversed with sugammadex, 4 mg/kg , iv 
2. Moderate block (defined as the  reappearance of T 2 in the TOF ) will 
be reversed with sugammadex, 2 mg/kg iv  
 
10 
 e. Extubation:  Prior to extubation, patients will be following  verbal commands  
(opening eyes, head  lift) and will also manifest a sust ained tetanic response to 
ulnar nerve  stimulation using a standard neuromuscular stimulator.  The 
information in combination with the clinical judgement of the anesthesia provider 
will be used to determine the time of extubation.  The TOF ratio  will not be used 
to determine when to extubate t he patient but the TOF ratio  at the time of 
extubation will be recorded.   
 
VII. Postoperative Pain Management  
a. Acetaminophen, [ADDRESS_1072860] 24 – 48 hours after surgery.   
 
VIII. Perioperative assessments  
a. Surgeon satisfaction – the primary endpoint is the surgeon’s satisfaction with 
the level of NMB during surgery  at the start of the case (the initial score ).  The 
satisfaction level will be rated with a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 
(extremely poor ) to 5 (optimal conditions).  This scale is outlined in detail in 
table 1  (page 15 ) and is adopted f rom a previously published studies .6,    For 
each patient, the  first surgeon satisfaction rating during the procedure (prior to 
any rescue measure)  will be the primary outcome measure.   
 
b. During the laparoscopic procedure, the surgeon will score the surgical working 
conditions.  The first rating will occur when the NMB level is stable at either 
deep or moderate block (per randomization) and th e intra -abdominal pressure is 
either [ADDRESS_1072861] .  The surgeon will be 
blinded to th e insufflation pressure at this point.  If the conditions are rated as 
extremely poor or poor  (surgical rating of 1-2, Table 1), the following steps will 
be taken in an incremental manner .  The surgeon may also request rescue 
11 
 treatment if the surgical rating scale is 3 (acceptable), but he anticipates 
deterioration in the surgical condition during the procedure  : 
1. Increase the insufflation pressure to a maximum of 15 mm Hg –the 
surgeon will reassess the surgical field after the intra -abdominal 
pressure i s stable at 15 mm Hg for 2 -3 minutes.   At this point the 
insufflation pressure will remain at 15 mm Hg for  the remainder of the 
procedure.  
2. Additional muscle relaxation – if the surgeon r ates the working 
conditions as 1  (extremely poor)  or 2 (poor) after in creasing the 
insufflation pressure to [ADDRESS_1072862] 
additional muscle relaxant.  At this point the anesthesia provider will 
check the level of NMB.  If the patient is  in the moderate group and 
has 1 or more  twitches, the anesthesia provider will administer a 
bolus dose of rocuronium, 0.3 mg/kg iv.  If the patient has only 0 -1 
PTC, the anesthesia provider will administer an equal volume of iv 
saline .  The surgeon will rate the surgical working conditions at 2 -3 
minutes after the additional dose of medication.   
 
c. Intra-abdominal insufflation pressures and TOF ratio measur ements will be 
recorded every 15  minutes during the procedure.  
d. Surgeons will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the surgical field every  30 
minutes during the procedure.  
e. Perioperative variables will also be recorded including the duration of surgery, 
time from administration of NMJ reversal  (sugammadex)  to extubation, time from 
end of surgery to exit from the OR, time in the PACU , and leng th of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210]. 
f. Postoperative verbal pain levels (0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780456].   Patients will also be asked about 
the presence or absence of shoulder pain.  
12 
 g. Postoperative variables including the need for postoperative mechanical 
ventilation, re-intubation, residual paralysis, pneumonia, infections, and other 
adverse events during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The need for ICU admission and length 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780457] a lso be collected.   
2.6 Study Duration:  
The Missouri Bariatric Service at the University of Missouri -Columbia performs over [ADDRESS_1072863]/manuscript preparation.  
Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification:  
Data analysis will be based on an intent -to-treat approach.  The primary endpoint  will be 
the first surgeon satisfaction  rating  measured on  a five -point ordinal scale  (Table 1) . The 
experimental layout is a randomized two -factor design so the primary analysis will be 
the two -way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with interaction.  A statistically significant 
interaction will be followed by [CONTACT_780458] e comparisons to identify and estimate treatment 
combination differences.  The standard ANOVA assumes a normally distributed 
outcomes with homogeneous variances and so the robustness of the results will be 
checked against an aligned -rank test for the two -way layout.[ADDRESS_1072864] of pro portions will 
be used for that analysis.  
13 
  
Sample size – Sample size estimates are based surgeon satisfaction rating as this is 
the primary outcome.   Figure [ADDRESS_1072865] de viation of the surgeon satisfaction score  (σ 
= 1.1) .  Based on literature and clinical judgement we powered the study to have at 
least 80% power to detect statistically significant (p < 0.05) effects for the main effects 
and interaction term in a two -way a nalysis of variance assuming the following 
configuration of mean satisfaction scores and a common standard deviation of 1.1.  
  Pressure  
  10mmHG  15mmHG  
Block  Moderate  2.[ADDRESS_1072866] potential optimism in these calculations (actual variances could be larger 
or effects smaller) we intend to recruit [ADDRESS_1072867] per treatm ent combination for a total 
sample size of 140.  
 

14 
 Power calculations were carried out using GLMPOWER procedure in SAS v 9.3.    
Specific Drug Supply Requirements:  
The anesthetic agents utilized in this study (including rocuronium) are routinely used for 
this type of surgery and are acceptable patient costs.  However, sugammadex  just 
received FDA approval in December  2015 and  is not currently used for NMB reversal at 
our institution . We will receive  adequate supplies  of sugammadex from [COMPANY_006] &Co.  so 
that t here will be no charge to the patients for this medication.

 Table 1: The surgical rating scale£ 
 
1.  Extremely poor conditions;  the surgeon is unable to work because of coughing or 
because of the inability to obtain a visible laparoscopic field because of inadequate 
muscle relaxation.  Insufflation pressure  must be increased  and/or addi tional 
neuromuscular blocking agents must be given.  
 
2. Poor conditions:  there is a visible laparoscopic field, but the surgeon is severely 
hampered by [CONTACT_780459] (continuous muscle contractions, 
movements or both with the hazard of tissu e damage) or inadequate insufflation 
pressure (inadequate space in the operative field) or both.  Insufflation pressure  must 
be increased  and/or additional neuromuscular blocking agents must be given.  
 
3. Acceptable conditions:  there is a n acceptable visible laparoscopic field but muscle 
contractions, movements or both occur regularly causing some interference with the 
surgeon’s work.  The surgeon may request  an increase in the  insufflation pressure 
and/or additional neuromuscular blocking agents to prevent deterioration.  
 
4. Good conditions:  there is a wide laparoscopic working field with sporadic muscle 
contractions, movements, or both.  There is no immediate need for additional 
neuromuscular blocking agents  or an increase in the insufflat ion pressure  unless there 
is the fear of deterioration.   
5. Optimal conditions:  there is a wide visible lapar oscopic working field without any 
movements or contractions.  There is no need for additional neuromuscular blocking 
agents  or increased insufflation pressure .

Statistical Methods: 
Determination of Sample Size 
This study is designed to determine the long-term safety of 0.0 03% AR-[ZIP_CODE]. Approximately 270 subjects 
will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio  to receive 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] (1 80 subjects) or AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle (90 
subjects). Assuming a dropout rate of 40%, approximately 108 su bjects randomized to receive 0.003% and 
54 subjects randomized to receiv e vehicle are ex pected to reach  the Day 365 visit.   
With 108 subjects completing 1 year (365 days) on 0.003% AR-[ADDRESS_659668] 96% probability 
to detect adverse events that occu r at a true rate of 3% or gre ater. That is, with 108  subjects completing 1 
year (365 days) on the investigational product, if a specific a dverse event is not observed, then with 96% 
confidence, that adverse event occurs at a true rate of <3%. 
 
Analysis methods 
Frequencies and percentages of treatment-emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) will be su mmarized for 0.003% 
AR-[ZIP_CODE] and vehicle. 
Other safety endpoints including vital signs, endothelial cell counts, laboratory parameters (hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis), corr ected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, total ocular 
staining, IOP, and dilated fundoscopy will be summarized by [CONTACT_510347]. For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], each eye will be summarized separately.  
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters including AR-[ZIP_CODE] area under  the plasma concentration time curve 
(AUC), maximum recorded concentration (C max), minimum recorded concentration (C min), time of maximum 
concentration (T max) will be summarized. R Cmax and R AUC (where R represents an accumulation factor) will 
be calculated.

(TRPM8) that is being developed for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED).  
1.1 Background 
DED is a multifactorial diseas e of the ocular surface character ized by a loss of homeostasis 
of the tear film, and accompanie d by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface  inflammation and damage, and ne urosensory abnormalities 
play etiological roles ( Craig 2017). E pi[INVESTIGATOR_510320] 5% to 50% of the global population ≥ 50 years o ld, depending on the 
definition of DED that was used ( Baudouin 2014, Bron 2014, Rolando 2010, Smith 2007, 
Stapleton 2017,  Uchino 2013).   
DED is broadly attributed to eit her impaired tear film production or excessive tear film 
evaporation. Either of these ch anges to the tear film can compromise the healt h of the ocular 
surface with associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l damage, which can adversely affect visua l function. 
This can be experienced as blurred vision and ocular surface di scomfort, often described as a 
feeling of dryness, burning, itchiness, or a sandy/gritty sensation. 
Treatment of DED is mainly sympt omatic and very few specific ph armacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_510321] (Jones 2017). Ar tificial tear preparations  are generally the first therapy 
considered. Artificial tears are based on lubricating or viscos ity-increasing agents and there is 
limited evidence suggesting that any one type of artificial tea r is markedly better than others 
(Doughty 2009). With respect to pharmaceuticals,  various strategies exist fo r targeting the 
underlying ocular inflammation asso ciated with DED with two pro ducts (Restasis® [0.05% 
cyclosporine ophthalmic  emulsion] and Cequa™ [0.09% cyclosporine ophthalmic solution]) 
indicated for increased tear  production in patients with DED and a third, Xiidra® (5.0% 
lifitegrast ophthalmic solution), indicated for the treatment o f the signs and symptoms of 
DED. In addition, a novel choliner gic agonist, delivered nasall y (varenicline solution, nasal 
spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is approved for the treatment of sign s and symptoms of DED. 
The short-term application of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_510322]. In recent years, increased a ttention has bee n placed on the neuronal regulation of tear 
production. The trigeminal nerve provides the pathway for paras ympathetic stimulation of 
the lacrimal functional unit a nd sensory stimulation of the cor nea and conjunctiva is essential 
for initiating basal tear production (Belmonte 2015; Belmonte 2017 ). Reduced corneal 
neuron density and / or dysfuncti on of the corneal sensory nerv es have been hypothesized to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of DED. The functional types of sensory nerve fibers of the 
cornea are distinguished by [CONTACT_510349], each of which confers a specific sensitivity to mecha nical, thermal, or chemical 
stimuli. 
  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Stud y Protocol: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-LTSS Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
   
Confidential Page 15 of 63  
    Branches of the trigeminal nerve innervating the cornea and lids selectively express cold 
sensitive thermoreceptors, called TRPM8 receptors ( Belmonte 2017, Viana 2011 ). TRPM8 
receptors are associated with the  detection of ocular surface d ryness and are activated by 
[CONTACT_510350] o f tear production and blink 
rate (Belmonte 2017, Yang 2017, Yang 2018). In addition, agonists of TRPM8 promote a 
cooling sensation that may be bene ficial for reducing ocular di scomfort and pain. 
Taken together, TRMP8 agonists ma y have a dual role in the potential treatment of DED by 
[CONTACT_510351] ( Abelson 2013).

    1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment 
AR-[ZIP_CODE] has been used as a flavor ing agent or adjuvant in the food industry and as a 
cooling agent for chewing gum and candies for more than a decad e. AR-[ZIP_CODE] (FL-no. 
16.123) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a flavoring a
gent or adjuvant

    (USFDA/FEMA GRAS No. 4681 ) in or on human food products wit h no safety concerns at 
specified use levels ( EU/EFSA 2014; WHO/JECFA No. 2079). 
In vitro , in vivo  and ex vivo  studies have also been pe rformed on AR-[ZIP_CODE] to demonstrate 
safety, tolerability and negligib le systemic exposure and to ch aracterize the effective dose 
and the regimen of ocular adm inistration of AR-[ZIP_CODE] ophthalmic  solution. In addition, 
Aerie has conducted two good labor atory practice (GLP) 3-month repeated-dose topi[INVESTIGATOR_510323]- [ZIP_CODE] ophthalmic solution in rabb its on clinical formulations 
and higher dose regimens then ref lected in this Phase 3 study.  
DED represents a significant health care burden, contributing t o approximately 25% of visits 
to ophthalmic clinics (Gayton 2009, Reddy 2004, Yu 2011 ), and can significantly affect a 
patient’s daily activities and qua lity of life. Studies have sh own that DED interferes with 
reading, driving ability, computer use, work productivity and is associated with increased 
anxiety, stress, and depression ( Noor 2018).  
Currently there are few effective treatments for DED. Artificia l tears, which are comprised of 
various polymers and buffering excip ients are form ulated to soo the and lubricate the ocular 
surface and are usually the ini tial option for all DED patients . Artificial tears are generally 
palliative in nature and do not  halt disease progression. With respect to pharmaceuticals, 
various strategies exist for ta rgeting the underlying ocular inflammation associated with 
DED, but only one (5% lifitegrast [Xiidra®]), is indicated for the t reatment of the signs and 
symptoms of DED. In addition, a no vel cholinergic agonist, deli vered nasally (varenicline 
solution, nasal spray 0.03mg [Tyrv aya™]), is approved for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of DED.   
Thus, there is a significant unmet  need for an effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l ocular therapeutic to 
effectively treat the signs and s ymptoms of DED. This unmet nee d in combination with all 
pre-clinical and clinical data collected to date support contin ued development of AR-[ZIP_CODE] 
as a potential new treatment fo r DED with a high overall positi ve benefit-risk ratio to 
humans.

A screen failure occurs when a pa rticipant who consents to part icipate in the clinical study is 
not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure in formation is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of s creen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)  publishing requirements and to re spond to queries from 
regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography , screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and a ny SAEs. Individuals who do not meet  the criteria for participation in 
this study (screen failures) ma y be rescreened for eligibility up to one time if there is a 
reasonable possibility, in the I nvestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], that the  patient might meet  the eligibility 
criteria. It is encouraged for t he investigator to discuss potential rescreening with the 
Sponsor. Rescreened participants  should be assigned a new parti cipant number for every

The product formulation is adjus ted to a pH of approximately [ADDRESS_659697]. 5.2 Selection and Timing of D ose for Each Patient 
Subjects who qualify at the Base line visit will be randomized i nto two groups, in a 2:1 ratio 
within each site, as follows: 
 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] (n = 180) 
 AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle (n = 90) 
Subjects will be instructed t o instill 1 drop of their randomiz ed study intervention BID to 
both eyes as follows: 1 drop in e ach eye in the morning (from approximately 7:00h to 
10:00h) and 1 drop in each eye in th e evening (from approximate ly 19:00h to 22:00h). A new 
vial should be used for each adm inistration time (both eyes dos ed from one vial). 
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), a s well as all follow up visits (Day 14, 90, 180, 270 and 365), 
the morning dose of randomized s tudy intervent ion will be admin istered in clinic by [CONTACT_38992]. All other doses will be  administered by [CONTACT_423]. If a subject inadvertently doses

5.3 Method of Assigning Patients t o Study Intervention Groups 
All subjects will be centrall y assigned to randomized study intervention using interactive 
response technology (IRT). Before the study is initiated, the l og-in information and directions 
for the IRT will be provided to qualified personnel at each sit e. 
All qualified subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio within  each site to receive 0.003% 
AR-[ZIP_CODE] or AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle at the B aseline visit. The IRT will provide the site with the 
specific kit number(s) for each randomized subject at the time of randomization. Sites will 
dispense the study intervention a ccording to the IRT instructio ns and the Schedule of Visits 
and Assessments ( Appendix 1).  
5.4 Masking 
During the study, the investigator and site staff performing el igibility, safety, PK  
 assessments and the s ubjects will be maske d. Subjects will be informed 
that there is a 1 in 3 chance th ey will receiv e vehicle.

5.5 Unmasking 
Only in case of medical emergency or occurrence of adverse even ts that warrant unmasking 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_73829], will the study intervention  assignment(s) be unmasked and 
made available to the Investigat or and the Medi cal Monitor. In the absence of medical need, 
the randomization code will not b e available to the above perso nnel until after the study is 
completed and the database is locked. If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s  study intervention assignment 
after an emergency situation, the  Investigator should contact t he Medical Monitor or 
designee. The Medical Monitor wi ll decide whether the study int ervention for the subject 
should be unmasked. The study intervention assignment will be revealed on a subject-by-
subject basis, thus leaving the  masking on the remaining subjects intact.

    6.8 Safety Assessments 
6.8.1 Corrected Visual Acuity  
Logarithmic minimum angle of res olution (LogMAR) visual acuity in both eyes will be 
assessed at all visits using an ETDRS Series 2000 chart. Visual  acuity should be evaluated 
prior to ocular examinations as specified in the Schedule of Vi sits and Procedures 
(Appendix 1 ). Addition al procedural details can be found in the Manual of Procedures. 
6.8.[ADDRESS_659710] Corrected Visual 
Acuity (BCVA) will be assessed by [CONTACT_510359]. Subjects will have their visual 
acuity measured in a 4-meter lane under standard illumination b y a certified examiner 
reading a standard ETDRS chart. Subjects will undergo manifest refraction at each visit. 
The visual acuity lane will be certified, as will the visual ac uity examiner prior to study 
initiation. Specifications for the  visual acuity lane, illumina tion, charts, light box, refraction 
lens, and the technician certifi cation process are detailed in the Manual of Procedures. 
6.8.3 Specular Microscopy to Assess Corneal Endothelial Cell Counts  
Specular microscopy of the central  cornea will be performed at the Baseline and Exit visit.  
Three images of the central cor neal endothelium will be taken a t each of the specified visits 
for each eye.  Average cell dens ity for each image will be gene rated by a built-in algorithm 
and recorded in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  The overall average cell density of 
the central corneal endothelium will be calculated by [CONTACT_229110] c data capture (EDC) system.  
The presence or absence of abnormal cellular morphology (polyme gethism) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_31519] o f images and noted in the eCRF. See the Manual of 
Procedures for additional details. 
6.8.4 Biomicroscopy 
Slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed at all in-clinic stud y visits. Observations will be 
graded as Normal or Abnormal. A bnormal findings will be categor ized as clinically 
significant (CS; findings that may interfere with study paramet ers or otherwise confound the 
data as determined by [CONTACT_8647]) or not clinically signi ficant (NCS). The following will 
be examined:  
 Cornea  
 Conjunctiva 
 Anterior Chamber 
 Iris

applied to the right eye by [CONTACT_510360] d and touching the droplet 
from a moistened (2 drops of norma l sterile saline) strip onto the bulbar conjunctiva, 
releasing the droplet. The pape r strip must not  touch the bulba r conjunctiva. Repeat for the 
left eye with a new moistened s trip. To thoroughly mix the sodium fluorescein with the tear 
film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times ove r approximately 15 seconds. 
Approximately 3 minutes after ins tillation of sodium fluorescei n to both eyes, the entire 
corneal surface will be evaluate d for sodium fluorescein staini ng, starting with the right eye. 
The examination will be performed  with the slit lamp at approxi mately 16X magnification 
using the slit lamp’s cobalt blue  filter to illuminate the ocul ar surface and a yellow barrier 
filter placed directly in front of the objective lens of the slit lamp.  Grading of the resulting corneal staining will be based on the Oxford ocular grading scheme 
(cornea portion only) ( Figure 2), which grades the entire co rnea from 0 to 5. H alf (0.5) grade 
increments may be used. The upper eyelid may be lifted slightly  to visualize the entire 
corneal surface.  Following sodium fluorescein staining of the cornea, conjunctiv al staining with lissamine 
green will be performed as follow s. Care should be taken when using lissmaine green strips 
to avoid causing ocular surface  discomfort or irritation. 
The subject should be instruc ted to look up such that 1 drop of  lissamine green can be

left eye with a new moistened s trip. To thoroughly mix the lissamine green with the tear film, 
the subject will be instructed to blink several times over approximately 15 seconds. 
Approximately 1 minute after instillation of lis samine green to both eyes and starting with 
the right eye, grading of the res ulting conjunctival staining can begin. The 2 conjunctival 
regions (nasal and temporal) w ill each be grad ed (0 to 5) using the Oxford ocular grading 
scheme (Figure 2). Half (0.5) grade increments may be used. To grade the temporal zone, 
the subject should be instructe d to look nasally; to grade the nasal zone, the subject should be

    6.10.2 Adverse Event Definitions 
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
 Adverse event (AE): any untowar d medical occurrence associated with the 
administration of the study inter vention in humans, whether or not considered to be 
related to the study intervention.  
 Adverse reaction (AR): any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
administration of the drug caused t he AE. For the purposes of I nvestigational New 
Drug (IND) safety reporting, “reas onable possibility” means the re is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship betw een the administration of the drug and the AE. 
See Section  6.10.5.  
 Life-threatening AE or life-thr eatening AR: an AE or AR is cons idered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Spon sor, its occurrence places 
the subject at immediate risk of  death. It does not include an AE or AR that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death.  
 Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious adverse reaction (SAR): an AE or AR is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: Dea th, a life-threatening or sig ht-threatening AE, 
subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510339] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substant ial disruption o f the ability  to conduct normal life 
functions, or a congenital anomal y/birth defect. Important medi cal events that may 
not result in death, be life-th reatening, or re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate  medical judgment, they may  jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples  of such medical ev ents include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that  do not result in subject hospit alization, or the 
development of drug dependency or  drug abuse. Neither the condi tion, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], nor surgery are rep orted as a serious 
adverse event when the hosp italization or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510340] a preexisting condition.  
 Unexpected AE or unexpected AR: an AE or AR is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the IB or is not listed at the sp ecificity or sev erity that has been observed; 
or, if an IB is not required or a vailable, is not consistent wi th the risk information 
described in the general investig ational plan or elsewhere in t he current application, 
as amended. See Section  6.10.[ADDRESS_659715]

commencement of study medicati on, it should be recorded as an A E. Any change in the 
health status after commencemen t of study medic ation should be recorded as a treatment 
emergent adverse event (TEAE). Surgery should not be reported as an  outcome of an AE if the pu rpose of the surgery was 
diagnostic and the outco me was uneventful. 
[IP_ADDRESS] AEs and Prior Medical History  
Any medical condition present pri or to informed consent which r emains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. However, an AE should be 
recorded if the frequency, intens ity, or the character of a pre -existing condition worsens 
during the study period beyond what would be expected from the natural progression of that 
condition.  Symptoms and signs that are cons istent with the n atural history of DED are not considered 
reportable AEs. Such developmen ts are recorded but are not repo rtable AEs. Worsening of 
symptoms and signs of DED should be  recorded as an AE or SAE only if judged by [CONTACT_510362] y worsened in severity and/or frequency or changed in nature 
at any time during the study. When r ecording an unanticipated w orsening of DED, it is 
important to convey why the deve lopment was unexpected.   
If there is a question as to whe ther a medical development should be reported as an AE, 
the Investigator is recommended to contact [CONTACT_510363]. 
6.10.[ADDRESS_659717]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
1 = Mild: present and noticea ble, but not distressing, and no d isruption of normal 
daily activities 
2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfo rt sufficient to possibly red uce or affect 
normal daily activity 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform n ormal daily activity

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_659718] op date for the new severity. Fo r example, a change in severity 
may go from mild to moderate, or from moderate to severe. In ei ther case, the start and stop 
dates should be recorded. 
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations  (see Section 6.10.8 for further 
information on SAEs, SARs, and sus pected unexpected serious adv erse reactions 
[S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).  6.10.5 Relationship 
A relationship between the AE a nd the study intervention or study procedure will be 
determined by [CONTACT_737], as applicable, for each AE usin g these explanations:  
 Not Related: The event is clea rly related to other factors such  as subject’s clinical 
condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, or therapy administered to the 
subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the pro duct, device, or 
procedure.  
 Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_510364]’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay 
between administrati on and the onset of the A E is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there i s not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by 
[CONTACT_77425], device, or procedure.  
 Possibly Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequ ence from the time of 
study medication admin istration or study procedure and/or follo ws a known response 
pattern to the product, device or procedure but could have been  produced by [CONTACT_374983]’s clinical s tate, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy 
administered to t he subject.  
 Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a k nown response pattern to 
the product, device or procedur e and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_510365]’s clinical state , therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy 
administered to the sub ject, and either occurs immediately following study medication 
administration or procedure, or i mproves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears 
on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.

    6.10.6 Expectedness 
AEs or ARs are considered “unexpected” if they are not listed i n the Reference Safety 
Information section of the IB for AR-[ZIP_CODE] or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that 
has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, al so refers to AEs or ARs that 
are mentioned in the IB as occurr ing with this class of drugs o r as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of AR-[ZIP_CODE] and are not specifically  mentioned as occurring 
with the study drug.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be u nexpected (by [CONTACT_375853]) if the IB refe rred only to elevated hepatic e nzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexp ected (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the IB listed onl y cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected,” as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or  SARs that are mentioned in th e IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from th e pharmacological properties of the drug but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurr ing with the particular drug un der investigation. 
An Investigator must immediat ely (i.e., withi n 24 hours from time of awareness) report any 
SAE or SAR (see Section 6.10.2 for  definitions) to the Sponsor or its clinical research 
organization (CRO) representativ e, whether or not considered dr ug-related, including those 
listed in the protocol or IB (see Section 6.10.8).  6.10.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (oth er than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and 
clinically significant at study e xit and that are changes from Baseline values will be 
documented as AEs. 
6.10.8 Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Reactions or Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting SAEs or SARs  
An Investigator must immediat ely (i.e., within 24 hours) report  any SAE or SAR (see 
Section 6.10.2 for definitions) to  the Sponsor or its CRO representative, whether or not 
considered drug-rela ted, including those listed in the protocol  or IB. The Investigator must 
use the SAE report form and inclu de an assessment of whether th ere is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused t he event. The Investigator mu st report any SAE or SAR that 
occurs or is observed during the s tudy. In case of incomplete i nformation, the Investigator 
must provide follow-up informa tion as soon as possible, again u sing the SAE report form. 
The email or fax to submit the SAE report is f ound in Section 6 .10.8.3. 
SAE reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1689]. Regulator y authorities, IRB, and 
Investigators at each of the s tudy sites will be informed as re quired.

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_659729] the Sponsor  for clarification of inclusio n and/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject. The Sponsor or  their representative will 
document clarificati on requests and respons es. If a subject doe s not meet any of the 
eligibility criteria, that subj ect may not be enrolled into the  study. 
If the Investigator feels that i n his/her clinical judgment, it  is necessary to promptly 
implement reasonable alternatives  to, or deviations from, the p rotocol in consid eration of the 
safety of study subjects, the S ponsor is to be notified of thes e alternatives  and deviations, 
and the reasons for such changes are to be documented in the study records. The Investigator 
is to also notify his/her IRB of any such changes. If a significant protocol devia tion is identified by [CONTACT_510376] e .g., 24 or 48 hours (as per 
IRB guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation  and decide whether any of 
these non-compliances should be reported to the relevant compet ent authority as a serious 
breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant competent a uthorities’ requirements, 
the protocol deviation is not req uired to be reported immediately but is still required to be 
notified to the IRB, the specifi c protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress 
report. The Sponsor will review and designate all protocol deviations p rior to the database lock. 
10.11 Access to Source Documentation 
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized representatives of the  Sponsor, the governing 
IRB(s), the FDA, the Departmen t of Health and Human Services, E uropean Medicines 
Agency, other domestic government  agencies, and other foreign r egulatory agencies will be 
granted direct access to the st udy subject’s original medical a nd study records for verification 
of the data and/or clinical st udy procedures. Access to this in formation will be permitted to 
representatives of the aforeme ntioned organizations to the exte nt permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. 
10.12 Data Generation and Analysis 
A system of computerized data va lidation checks will be impleme nted and applied to the 
database on an ongoing basis. Query  reports pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies 
will be forwarded to the clini cal Investigator and the Sponsor for resolution. The study 
database will be updated by [CONTACT_510377], in accordance with the 
resolved query reports. All chan ges to the study database will be documented.

complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the Statis tical Analysis Plan. 
10.13 Retention of Data 
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all  records relate d to the study in 
compliance with ICH Good Clinical P ractices Guidelines E6 (R2) sections  4.9.4 and 4.9.5, 
and appliable local regulations. 
Archived versions of the database will be saved by [CONTACT_219838]  E6 (R2) section 5.5.11, complying  with whichever of the

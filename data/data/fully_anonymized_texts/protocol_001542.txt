3. Abstract:  
This study aims to analyze a novel approach for prophylaxis against  pruritis caused by [CONTACT_852947]. Neuraxial narcotics are commonly used in obstetric patients for cesarean delivery to help 
with pain control over the first 24 hours after the surgery. Slappendel demonstrated intramuscular 
promethazine (IMP) was an effective treatment for intrathecal morphine induced pruritis (ITMIP).[ADDRESS_1186843] -operative period.  
 
This study will use in -patients undergoing cesarean delivery at U F Health  Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852933], 
[LOCATION_012].  
 
4. Background and Significance:  
Intrathecal morphine given during cesarean deliverie s is one of the many ways providers currently help 
post-partum women with pain control. One major downside of intrathecal morphine is pruritus that 
occurs over the next [ADDRESS_1186844], Eldor and colleagues found 
intramuscular promethazine was effective at reducing the incidence and severity of pruritis induced by 
[CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_75427].6 Eldor conducted a randomized study among participants who had cesarean 
deliveries with epi[INVESTIGATOR_75427]. Those who received prophylactic IMP reported no pruritus while 
35% of the control group experience d pruritus necessitating rescue treatment. Slappendel 
demonstrated that IMP was very effective at treating ITMIP.[ADDRESS_1186845] IMP to treat pruritus 
after varying doses of intrathecal morphine in orthopedic patients. Only one patient out of 143 
subjects required escalation of therapy beyond IMP to treat ITMIP.1 The article has not been confirmed 
nor refuted. This study was not blinded to the physician or the patient as this was their sole initial 
treatment for pruritus.  Horta examined the potential of one of four different drugs to prevent ITMIP in 
patients undergoing cesarean delivery.7 In this randomized study, 300 women undergoing elective 
cesarean delivery were randomized to one of five groups (intravenous alizapride 100mg, propofol 20, 
droperidol 1.25mg, promethazine 50mg or saline control). Horta failed to find a prophylactic effect  of 
intravenous promethazine to prevent ITMIP. We would like to study IMP in post -partum patients that 
have just undergone a cesarean delivery in a blinded study to see if this is an effective  prophylaxis  for 
pruritus. This would benefit the mother to not itch while also allowing the morphine to continue with 
pain relief. 
In 2018, Vice O’Con et. al8 reviewed medications that were effective for treatment of post 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_852934]. They cited IV promethazine did not provide relief 
in this paper but could not find evidence for IM. Since very few medications actually work for this side 
effect, we would like to study IM promethazine in hopes to give another prophylaxis/ treatment option 
that would not reverse the intrathecal narcotic. This paper cited that anti -dopaminergic medications 
did help decr ease the pruritus but increased sedation in the forms given.  Promethazine has a small 
amount of anti -dopaminergic activity and should decrease pruritus if it is truly a dopamine receptor 
mediated process.  
 
5. Specific Aims:  (research question/objectives)  
Hypothesis : Prophylactic intramuscular promethazine does not decrease pruritus in post -partum 
females that received 100mcg intrathecal morphine.  
  
Alternate Hypothesis : Prophylactic intramuscular promethazine does decrease pruritus in post -partum 
females that received 100mcg intrathecal morphine.  
 
 
 Pruritus will be  quantified by [CONTACT_852948], developed and validated by [CONTACT_852949].9  
 
Secondary Analysis  
-Promethazine does not increase sedation compared to placebo (RASS scale)  
-Promethazine does not increase pain compared to placebo  (DVPRS scale)  
-Promethazine decreases nausea and vomiting  (rated as none, mild, moderate, severe)

DESIGN  
STUDY PROCEDURES  
Recruitment   

 
 Pregnant female patients already scheduled for a cesarean section  operative procedure , as described 
in this protocol, will qualify for this study. The surgical schedule will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_852958] , or one of the Co -I's, Drs., Lopez, Euliano, Andoniadis, or Mendoza as a part of their clinical 
duties . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I’s are all Department of Anesthesiology staff and routinely work in the obstetrics 
unit, therefore, they all have a direct clinical relationship with the potential patients in this study.  At 
least one of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I’s will be working the obstetrics unit at the time of recruitment . Investigators 
(directly involved in clinical care) will review the surgical schedule  and medical records of potential 
patients  (as part of their routine clinical duties)  greater than 1 day prior to surgery to more carefully 
evaluate the inclusion/exclusion for potential contra indications that could preclude or affect the 
patient's safety in the study. The extra step of oversight will help ensure potential patient safety prior 
to the surgeon approaching a patient to discuss the study.   
 
Greater than 1 day prior to their scheduled surgery, all potential study participants identified as above 
will be contact[CONTACT_103825]/or email if available by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I’s. At this time, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I’s will 
ask the patient if they are comfortable with a study coordinator contact[CONTACT_852950] a 
research study for which they qualify (phone script will be read ). If the potential subject is interested, 
they will be provided the ICF. On the m ornin g of surgery, additional questions and concerns  will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_54858]  (anesthesiologists)  participating in the study and ICF will be 
completed. After obtaining written informed consent, women will be randomized into one of two 
groups: control or promethazine group. Method of randomization will be discussed below.  
 
The hard copy consents  will be stored in the study binder.  
 
Patient typi[INVESTIGATOR_852935] (OB) pre -operative holding area where we will obtain her 
medical history, perform a physical exam and consent her for the cesarean delivery . The patient will 
have already spoken with a study coordinator and/or PI/Co -I more than one day prior to arrival 
regarding potential participation in the study. The patient will be approached by [CONTACT_852951] (anesthesiologists). We will review the consent form, explain ing that itching is a common 
side effect of the  intrathecal morphine and we are trialing a medication that would prevent the itching.  
If the patient agrees to participate, we will obtain signed consent, contact [CONTACT_852952] -procedure  and then obtain a blinded syringe from pharmacy for the 
treatment. [CONTACT_852959] will randomize the patient for the study to determine which medication the 
mother will receive  using a stratified randomization design generated with MAPLE softwar e. 
 The patient will then go back to the operating room  when it is her operative time, and we will 
perform the spi[INVESTIGATOR_852936], morphine and fentanyl , which is standard at our institution  (see 
standard of care medications below) .  Once the spi[INVESTIGATOR_852937], the surgical team 
will be called in to perform the procedure. Once the baby [CONTACT_852953], 
we will inject the blinded syringe of medication into the patient’s left thigh since she will still be numb 
from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304].  When the patient arrives to the PACU, we will assess the [ADDRESS_1186846]-op (+/- 2 hours) . 
All evaluations will be done in person or by [CONTACT_852954].  
If patients are still reporting pruritis that is not controlled, the rescue treatment will be 
butorphanol 1mg IV q3h , as this is the current regimen at our institution.  
 
 
 
  
 
Treatment/Therapy  
The treatment will consist of a blinded syringe of 1cc clear liquid (blinded to patient and physician – 
only pharmacist will know what it contains). This injection will be given in the left thigh after the 
cesarean delivery  is completed.  
 
Contents of syringe: (either)  
- 1cc 0.9% Sodium Chloride (placebo)  
- 1cc 25mg/ml Promethazine (study medication)  
 
Extra studies/procedures required  
It is standard of care for all patients  for this surgery  to have intraoperative  [ADDRESS_1186847] QTc evaluated on the anesthesia monitor . As part of the study,  rhythm strip s 
will be printed out and saved in study binder . Any patients with an already prolonged QTc (>500  ms) 
will be excluded from the study.

STATISTICAL METHODS, DATA ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION:  
Our plan is to recruit  50 patients for each arm of the study .  With 50 patients on placebo and 50 
patients on Phenergan, there will be a greater than 80% chance of detecting a significant difference of 
20% or more at a two -sided 0.05 significance level. This assumes that severe itch ing occurs  is in 50% of 
patients and Phenergan reduces this proportion to 20%.  
 
We will use Fisher’s exact test to compare groups on severity of itching. We will also use Wilcoxon’s 
rank sum test to compare groups on degree of itching as measured by [CONTACT_852957]. [CONTACT_852959], 
the study biostatisti cian, will perform all statistical analyses.  
 
DATA STORAGE AND DE -IDENTIFICATION PLANS:  
The original, hard -copy signed informed consent forms and rhythm strips  will be stored within the 
locked Anesthesiology research office and will remain with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_1186849] 7 years.  
 
Patients will be de -identified. No names, MRN’s, or other identifying information will be stored in the 
spreadsheet.  Pain, itching, sedation and nausea/vomiting will be collected at three intervals by a study 
coordinator and added to the de -identified spr eadsheet. Age group, medical conditions such as 
diabetes and pre -eclampsia as well as BMI groups, will be used to determine confounders in the data. 
None of this collected information will be used to identify the patients.  
 
7. Potential Risks:  
Subjects will be given clear verbal and written instructions to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wendling in the Department 
of Anesthesiology with questions or concerns regarding their study participation. If a patient 
experiences an injury that is directly caused by [CONTACT_15365], they will receive professional medical care at 
the University of [LOCATION_012]. No other  compensation is offered. Any adverse events will be reported to the 
 
 IRB using the standard adverse events reporting website and on continuing reviews (depending upon 
severity, as defined by [CONTACT_1201]).  
1. Sedation (study variable) . Promethazine can cause sedation which will be studied.  
2. Concern for QT prolongation on the ECG causing cardiac arrhythmias . QTc evaluated on patient 
monitor, rhythm strip to be printed off and saved in research binder with QTc labeled clearly.  
3. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]  
4. Painful injection site once spi[INVESTIGATOR_852938] . Patients will be given the injection while spi[INVESTIGATOR_852939].  
5. Tissue damage at site of injection  
6. There is the risk of loss of confidentiality.  The following procedures will be done to maintain 
confidentiality:  written, paper forms will be kept in the locked Anesthesia Research Office .  
Computerized and de -identified records containing personal health information will be stored on 
password -protected and encrypted computers.  
 
Routine medications that are provided to patients participating in the study may be provided to you. 
These are part of normal clinical care. The participant will be responsible for any deductible, co -
insurance, or co -payments. Some insurance companies may not cover costs associated with research 
studies or research -related injuries. If the participant is injured as a direct result of participat ion in the 
study, only professional services received from any University of [LOCATION_012] Health Science Center 
healthca re provider (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists or psychologists) will 
be provided without charge. Any other expenses, including Shands hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96375], will be billed to 
the subject’s insurance provider or the subject themse lves.  
Safety Endpoint  
During the study, we will log our adverse events. If the incidence for adverse events is greater than 
expected we will review the study design as a team to decide if we should proceed with the study or 
stop the study. If we have an increase incidence of se rious injection site reactions, we will review 
whether the medication or placebo is causing the injection site reaction. If any major adverse reactions 
occur we will have a meeting with the investigators to address if this was an unanticipated or 
potential ly expected event given the expected incidences.  
8. Potential Benefits:  
The potential benefit of this study would be to find a prophylactic treatment for intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_852940].  The patients would undergo minimal risk with an IM injection in attempts to decrease one of 
the major side effects of intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  The study will benefit future women undergoing cesarean 
section as we could give intrathecal morphine for post -op pain control with less side effects.  
 If the hypothesis were rejected, we could also perform future studies to see if the dose of 
morphine in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_852941].  This study could be also used 
outside the obstetrics realm and adopted for many different patie nts receiving intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_852942] -op pruritus.  
 
9.  Conflict of Interest:  
There are n o known conflicts of interest for the staff that will be working on this research proposal.

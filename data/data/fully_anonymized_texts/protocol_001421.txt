Principle Investigators:  Kevin R. Short, PhD ; Kenneth C. Copeland, MD ,  Section of Diabetes/  
Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics , University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center  
 
Funding :  NIH/NIMHD.  Project [ADDRESS_1258762] shown that paying adults for desired 
behaviors and/or health outcomes can be effective , but the use of financial incentives to shape exercise 
behavior in adolesc ents has not been reported.  We hypothesize that monetary incentives will encourage 
obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth to establish and maintain better exerc ise habits, ultimately 
resulting in better health.  We propose to provide transportation  for participants to the wellness centers and 
individually tailored instruction and oversight by [CONTACT_898012].   The provision of monetary incentives is designed to reinforce the frequency and duration of 
exercise.  Our strategy to accomplish these goals is outlined in the following Specific Aims:   
Aim 1:  To determine whether financial incentives will increase t he frequency of exercise sessions 
performed by [CONTACT_898013] a community fitness center .  Obese, insulin resistant American Indian 
adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of two groups for a 16 -week exercise program: Control 
($4/session, up t o 3 sessions/week, provided as compensation for time), or Incentive ($4, $10, and $[ADDRESS_1258763] session each week, respectively).  All participants will be provided transportation to and 
from the fitness center and professional instr uction and supervision for aerobic exercise training, but will differ 
only in the amount of money they are eligible to collect for their attendance.  A secondary goal of this Aim is to 
assess the association between exercise frequency and changes in diabet es-related risk factors, including 
insulin sensitivity, body composition, and blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
Aim 2: To determine whether financial incentives will increase the duration of exercise performed by 
[CONTACT_898013] a community fitness center .  Participa nts who complete Aim 1 will be re -randomized 
to one of two groups for a second 16 -week period of exercise: Control ($4/session, up to 3 sessions/week), or 
Incentive ($4, $7, or $10 for 20 -, 40-, or 60 - minute sessions, respectively, up to 3 sessions and $3 0/week). 
Transportation and professional supervision will remain the same as in Aim 1.  A secondary goal is to assess 
the association between exercise duration and changes in diabetes -related risk factors.  
Aim 3: To determine whether ongoing incentives are  required for maintenance of  fitness center utilization 
established with financial incentives .  Participants who complete Aim [ADDRESS_1258764] 16 -week exercise 
period  with diminished monetary incentives.  Each person will be re -randomized to one of two incentive 
structures:  a) Ramp -down, with financial incentives diminishing to zero by 8 weeks, or b) Raffle, with monetary 
prizes awarded through a draw ing in which  chan ces of winning are dependent on frequency and duration of 
exercise.  We hypothesize that exercise behavior will remain above zero even after financial incentives decline 
and that the Raffle approach will reinforce the best exercise behavior maintenance.  C linical diabetes risk 
outcomes will be measured as in Aims 1 and 2.  
Aim 4: To measure the impact of physical activity and physical fitness on circulating biomarkers of 
metabolic disease risk.   Normal weight American Indian youth with either low  physical ac tivity and fitness or 
high physical activity and fitness will be studied on a single occasion.  Serum/plasma concentrations of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
amino acids, and related markers of inflammation, and oxidative and vascular stress will be compared among 
the normal wei ght participants and the overweight/obese youth enrolled in Aims 1 -3. 
This study will clarify how specific  incentive structures can be used to promote exercise in a population of 
adolescents at exceptionally high risk for diabetes and cardiometabolic disea se.  The study will also provide 
needed insight on the volume of exercise needed to elicit changes in clinical outcomes.  These results will be 
used to develop better lifestyle intervention strategies for American Indian youth . 
 RESEARCH STRATEGY : APPROACH  
Design:  Specific Aims 1-3 will follow a  single prospective , randomized trial design , with 105 participants  
enrolled and 80 -90 entering the exercise program  (Fig 1 ).  The 
individual  Aims are distinguished by [CONTACT_898014] ( Fig 2  and 3).  Aim 4 is a cross -
sectional comparison between overweight/obese participants 
entering the main trial and two groups of normal weight youth (up 
to 40 participants per group) with either low physical activity and 
fitness or high physical activity and fitness (up to 40 participants 
per group).  
Participants:  Male and female American Indian youth 11 -21 
years old will be recruited from the Choctaw Health Ser vice Area 
of SE Oklahoma.  For the primary exercise incentives study, the 
eligibility criteria include BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age - and sex -
specific norms based on growth charts from the Centers for 
Disease Control, maturation level ≥Tanner Stage 2 for breasts 
(girls) or genitalia (boys), family history of T2D, and recent history 
of low physical activity.   Low physical activity, defined as attaining 
<30 minutes of structured moderate -to-vigorous intensity exercise 
on ≤ 3 days/week over the preceding 3 months, will be confirmed 
through questionnaires and objective monitoring as described 
below.  For both normal weight comparison groups in Aim 4, 
eligibility will include BMI greater than 20th and less than 85th 
percentile, m aturation level ≥Tanner Stage 2 for breasts (girls) or 
genitalia (boys) , and recent history of  either a)  low physical 
activity  (same as  the overweight/obese group ) or, b) high physical 
activity (>30 minutes of structured moderate -to-vigorous intensity 
exercise on >3 days/week over the preceding 3 months .  T2D 
family history will be recorded but will not be an inclusion criterion 
for the normal weight groups.   Fitness level  and physical activity  
will be determined through testing, described below.   Additional 
enrollment and retention eligibility criteria are: lack of  diabetes or 
other potentially con founding metabolic disorders, able to safely 
exercise, willingness to complete the testing and pa rticipation 
schedule, and not  on medications known to im pact the stated 
outcomes.  A medical history and physical exam will be performed 
to assure suitability for the study  during the initial screening .   
Protocol :  All overweight/obese participants will follow the same 
protocol.  After an initial screening to ensure eligibility, a standard 
set of clinical outcome assessments wil l be performed at baseline 
(Pre-test), after completing 16 -weeks of e xercise training in Aim 1 
(Post -test 1), again after completing the second 16 -week exercise 
period  in Aim 2 (Post -test 2), and once more after completing the 
16-week exercise period  in Aim 3 (Post test 3).  Normal weight participants enrolled into Aim 4 will complete 
only the screening and baseline tests; they will not continue with the incentivized exercise program.  
Screening:   During th is visit, informed written consent/  assent of participants and their parents will be 
obtained in accordance with I RB guidelines.  A medical history and physical exam will be performed.  Each 
child and a parent/guardian will be  interviewed to educate them on  their child’s health status, the importance of 
physical activity as a component of a healthy lifestyle, and the p otential improvements in  clinical outcomes that 
may occur in response to increased exercise behavior.  The inte rview will also be used to assess potential 
barriers to change.  This may include, but is not limited to several identifiable personal and environmental 
concerns that could interfere with the child’s ability to complete the study, such as family employment  
demands, income and education status, transportation and food availability, social structure, and competing

 time demands .  A comprehensive, individualized plan will be developed to reduce  barriers.  A motivation 
assessment questionnaire  with established v alidity and reliability  (62, 73, 91) and adapted for a rural 
community  will be used to  evaluate preferred  types o f exercise, social support, and perceptions of barriers to 
exercise by [CONTACT_898015] .  Community  and environmental barriers to exercise  will also be assessed .  The 
Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma offers several social service programs designed to eliminate distress , including  
academic tutoring, mentoring, organized activities, housing assistance, nut rition classes, and counseling.   
Many of the se services are located near the Wellness Centers.  The  interviewer will be responsible for  linking 
the family to these services when appropriate  and performing follow -up to address new and existing barriers.  
The goal of this  effort is to insure that a de cision by [CONTACT_730068] d or family to discontinue the study  is due to choice 
and not due to barriers  that can be reasonably addressed . 
Baseline pre -training testing : The baseline tests may be combined with the screening visit.  Baseline 
tests will be comprised  of measurements of daily physical activity, aerobic fitness, body composition, and 
insulin resistance.  D aily phy sical activity will be objectively measured with  a step -activity monitor worn f or [ADDRESS_1258765].  
Body comp osition and exercise tests will be performed as described below . 
Exercise training: The [ADDRESS_1258766] free membe rship to the Wellness Center s as a benefit provided to Certificate Degree of I ndian Blood 
(CDIB) cardholders .  Free transportation will be arranged through a shuttle service already in place for medical 
visits.   Fitness professionals at each center will pr ovide instruction, supervision, and ongoing guidance to 
assure that exercise sessions are completed safely and effectively.  Participants and their parent/guardian will 
be instructed that the exercise goal throughout the entire 48 -week study is to achieve 60 min/day of moderate -
to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), consistent with current guidelines for children (13, 31, 90).  MVPA is 
defined as continuous exercise that elicits a  heart rate ≥ 7 0% of peak heart rate.   Each participant will  be able 
to choose the frequency of visits to the wellness center and the length of time engaged in MVPA , since the 
purpose of the study is to test the effect of incentives on exercise behavior .  Several types of exercise can be 
selected, including walking, running, cycling, stair steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], aerobic dance or other activities.  Instructors will 
advise a gradual increase in exercise intensity and duration as tolerated over the first [ADDRESS_1258767] strap transmitter that outputs to a computer for quantification and data storage.  These d ata will be used 
to document training sessions .  To provide backup in the eve nt of technical failure, training sessions will also 
be recorded in an exercise log by [CONTACT_898016].  Exercise will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_35043] (sessions per week), duration (length of sessions), and total volume (M etabolic 
Equivalent of Task -hours, MET -h, a measure of intensity relative to resting x activity time).  
After completing Aim [ADDRESS_1258768], all participants who  completed an average of  ≥ 1 
exercise session per week will be eligible to conti nue on to Aim 2.  The only difference between Aims 1 and 2 
will be t he financial incentive scheme ; the overall exercise goals , and provision of t ransportation and 
professional oversight will remain the same .  Similarly, after completing Aim [ADDRESS_1258769] averaged ≥ 1 exercise session per week in Aim 2 will be eligible to continue on to Aim 3.  
No changes will be made to the exercise goals or availability of transportation and facilities in Aim 3.   
To allow for po tential schedule conflicts and missed sessions (e.g., illness, travel) participants will be 
allowed to “catch -up” by [CONTACT_898017] [ADDRESS_1258770] -training testing:   After each of the [ADDRESS_1258771] other staff, including  nurses  and chemistry lab staff , will not know group 
assignments , so the potential for bias is expected to be low.  The fasting blood sample will be acquired 2 days 
(38-48 hours ) after the last exercise session  in order to assess exercise adaptations that are distinct from the 
residual e ffects of the most recent training session.  The exercise fitness and body composition tests will  also 
be repeated at the end of each study phase . 
Group assignment:   Within each Aim, participants will be assigned to one of two groups u sing a randomized 
stratified block design that was selected to reduce the potential for baseline variability among the groups.  
Participants will be assigned to blocks of 2 (duos) matched for age and sex.  A participant who is not yet 
matched on the two factors will determine the age and sex for a newly established duo. The next participant to 
meet those matching criteria will be assigned to that duo.  Each duo will have one participant in each of the 
intervention groups, but the group to  which each participant in a block is assigned will be pre -determined by a 
unique random permutation.  
Incentive programs  
Overview and r ationale:   Each participant will receive $ 50 for completing the initial screening visit and 
baseline set of clinical and fitness tests.   Normal weight participants in Aim 4 will stop after completing the 
baseline tests.  Overweight/obese participants who continue into the exercise program will also receive and 
$50 each  time they complete the end -of-phase set  of clinical  and fitness tests  ([ADDRESS_1258772] -tests  after each 16 -week 
study phase ).  These payments are similar to amounts used in our recent and ongoing studies of children that 
have  similar procedures and time requirements.  The payment schedules for exercise sessions are detailed in 
each o f the separate Aims sections below.  We set the payment levels for Aims 1 and 2 based on our 
experience with exercise studies for adolescents.  Payments  were selected to be  commensurate with the time 
commitment of participants, as well as the need to creat e a distinctly higher payment in the incentivized groups 
so as to elicit the targeted high adherence.  The total time for testing and exercise sessions  per participant  is 
~164 hours over ~50 weeks, not including transportation time to and from the  participant ’s home or school  and 
the wellness  and testing sites .  Depending on group assignment, the range of total compensation to 
participants who complete all assigned stud y visits will be $716 -1,292, or ~$4.40 -7.90 per hour of involvement.  
We deemed this to be an appropriate compensation/  incentive  without inducing undue influence.   Payments for 
screening  and baseline test will be arranged at the time of completion  using a  reloadable debit card provided at 
no charge to the participants .  Thereafter, p ayments for completed exercise training sessions  and Post -
exercise tests  will be provided every 2 weeks  for as long as the participant remains in the study . 
Aim 1:  This aim will test  the hypothesis that the frequency of exercise sessions at the wellness center will 
vary wit h the amount of money offered for the number of 
sessions per week .  Participants will be assigned to one of 
two groups that only differ in the payments  for completi ng 
their exercise sessions.  For both groups, payment will be 
provided for the number of sessions performed, up to 3 per 
week.  As shown in Fig 2, the Control group  can earn  up to 
$12 per week  at a flat rate of $4 per session,  while those in 
the Incentive group can earn up to $[ADDRESS_1258773] be ≥  20 minutes /session  of MVPA  during the 
first 3 weeks , increasing to ≥ 30 minutes/  sessio n of MVPA 
in weeks [ADDRESS_1258774] breaks, t he activity time 
can be accumulated rather than continuous.  The plan for 
recording sessions and making up missed sessions is 
outlined in the Exercise Training section .  By [CONTACT_898018]  48 exercise sessions p articipant s can earn 
a maximum of $192 (Control)  or $480  (Incentive) for exercise in this Aim.  Aim 1 payments, exercise sessions/week:

Values are payments per visit and weekly 
maximum . 
 Aim 2:   This aim will test  the hypothesis that exercise time per visit will vary with the amount of money 
offered for the length of exercise sessions .  In this aim , as in Aim 1, the  Control group will earn $4 per session 
for up to 3 sessions per week.  The Incentive group can earn up to $30/week, with a payment structure based 
on the length of time for each exercise session  (Fig 2).  The incentive is meant to encourage at least 60 
minutes of MVPA  per exercise session, consistent with the daily activity recommendations for youth.  As  in Aim 
1, this study phase is 16 weeks so completion of  all 48 targeted exercise sessions will result in payments of 
$192 (Control)  or $480  (Incentive).  
Aim 3:   This aim will determine if exercise behavior 
developed during the preceding  32 weeks will continue 
when payments for exercise are diminished .  
Participants will be randomized to either the  Ramp -down 
or Raffle  group .  Maximum payments for t he Ramp -
down group will begin at $20/ week , through a payment 
structure that incentivizes exercise time, as in Aim 2, 
with a bonus for completing 3 sessions in a week ( Fig 
3).  The weekly payments will be decreased over 8 
weeks, reaching $0 for weeks 9 -16.  The Raffle group 
will earn chances to win prize money based on the 
number of fitness center exercise sessions and time 
spent exercising each week.  The number of raffle 
entries earned for each session will vary from 1 -16 per 
participant each week ( Fig 3).  Random draw ings will be 
conducted to determine winners, with the total value of 
the weekly prize pool set to ~$7 per person.   All 
participants will continue to receive the same 
transportation and Wellness Center access as before.  
Total potential payment fo r exercise in Aim 3 will be 
~$112 per participant , though the actual amount for 
Raffle group members will vary according to chance.  
Clinical outcome tests  
Insulin sensitivity:  Fasting i nsulin sensitivit y will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_898019] - 
Insulin Resistance  (HOMA -IR), calculated as : [fasting insulin (µIU/m l) x fasting glucose (mg/d l)/405] .  
Anthropometry and blood pressure :  Height, body mass, and waist and hip circumference will be 
measured by [CONTACT_423087] .  As regularly per formed by [CONTACT_95205], t otal body and regional fat and lean tissue will 
be measured using bioelectrical  impedance  analysis  at each of the pre - and post -training visits.  Blood 
pressure will be measured in duplicate after the child has rested quietly for 15 minutes using an appropriate ly 
sized  arm cuff.  
Fitness testing : Bicycle ergometer tests with increasing workloads will be  used to measure maximal 
aerobic work output, peak rate of oxygen consumption  (VO 2peak)  and heart rate , and the workload 
corresponding to a heart rate of 170 beats/min (48, 77).  Submaximal stages will be used to establish 
relationships among heart rate and power and used to assess work economy.  Continuous measurements of 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_898005] a facemask and metabolic measurement cart and heart rate with Polar 
heart rate monitors.   For normal weight participants , the cut point  for fitness level (low versus high) will be a 
VO 2peak of 46 ml/kg/min for boys and 37 ml/kg/min for girls.  This threshold was identified as a marker of 
elevated metabolic risk, based on a c omposite of standard clinical outcomes such as blood pressure, glucose, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and waist circumference , in a cohort of more than 2,000 adolescents (age ~15 y) , who performed a 
standard bicycle fitness test (4). 
Physical activity assessment :  Free -living daily ambulatory activity will be measured with accelerometers  
worn on the waist  (Fitbit Zip, Fitbit Inc .) throughout the day , recording data each minute for [ADDRESS_1258775] or ankle -worn accelerometers . Aim 3 Ramp -down payments:

 Plasma/serum analysis:  In addition to measurements of glucose and insulin performed to measure insulin 
resistance , blood will be collected for measurement of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], inflammatory and related diseas e risk markers.  
All planned assays are established on campus or in our laboratory.  Lipid analyses include t otal-, HDL - and 
LDL-cholesterol  and non -esterified fatty acids ( colorimetric assay, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA).  Pro -
inflammatory biomarkers ass ociated with obesity and insulin resistance include oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and HDL 
(oxHDL), high-sensitivity C -reactive protein, myeloperoxidase,  high-molecular weight adiponectin, visfatin , and  
the soluble vascular -derived molecules, intercellular cell adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM -1) and vascular cell 
adhesion molecule -1 (VCAM -1), measured with ELISAs from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, R&D Systems and 
Millipore.  Additionally, we will measure the plasma  concentration of a panel of amino acids and their 
metabolites (particularly isoleucine, leucine, valine, and adiptic acid), and a panel of fatty acyl CoA’s , that have 
been reported to be increased in children and adults with diabetes, and have been shown to predict the future 
onset of diabetes  (2, 3, 8, 16, 39, 57, 64, 74, 75, 83, 101, 104, 105).  Hemoglobin A1c will be measured to 
assess recent history of glycemic regulation and diabetes risk ( Choctaw Nation Health Clinic ).   Blood 
collection, sample analysis and destruction of unused samples will adhere to NIH, IRB and Choctaw Nation  of 
Oklahoma  guidelines.  
Data analyses :  Since group assignmen ts will be balanced for age and sex, the groups are expected to  be 
similar at baseline.  Additional comparisons will be performed to identify demographic or other variables on 
which the groups might differ (e.g., weight loss) that could affect the primary outcomes.  Subsequent analyses 
will adjust for these potentially confounding variables.  Regression models, which adjust for modifier (or 
confounding) variables identified in initial data exploration, will compare between -group differences in the 
primary o utcomes.  Since  we anticipate that the number of fitness center visits, which is the primary outcome in 
Aim 1, will follow a Poisson distribution typi[INVESTIGATOR_898006], we will explore a multivariable Poisson regression 
model to analyze that aim.  To assess Aim 2, a more conventional regression model  will analyze the primary 
outcome , which is the total time that pa rticipants engage in exercise .  The effects of exercise training on 
secondary outcomes will be analyz ed similarly, using multiple linear regression .  Analysis of Aim [ADDRESS_1258776] explain the 
change in exercise volume and clinical outcomes over the final phase of the study.  Residuals generated from 
regres sion models will be inspected for normality and data will be log-transformed or subjected to non -
parametric testing as appropriate.   Aim 4 is a cross -sectional study design so the main effects of  physical 
activity (high versus low), fitness  (high versus low)  and body size (normal weight versus overweight/obese) on 
biomarkers of metabolic disease risk will be initially determined using an analysis of variance approach, with 
Bonferroni tests to make  pairwise comparisons between groups.  A multivariate modeling approach, similar to 
that used in Aims [ADDRESS_1258777] sets of predictor variables for specific  biomarker s.   A P

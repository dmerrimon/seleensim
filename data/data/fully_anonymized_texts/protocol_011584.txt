Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_862824]-
steroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) in the treatment of postoperative rhinoplasty pain.  This study 
will also evaluate potential contributing factors affecting the efficacy of these  pain control method s.   
Background    
With the  rise of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_862825] U nited States and its adverse consequences, limiting or 
eliminating narcotic prescriptions  after outpatie nt surgery should be a priority for all surgeons.  In 2012 , 
4.2 billion prescriptions were written in the [LOCATION_002], 289 million (6.8%) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]1, and of which  
hydrocodone was the number one most prescribed medication 2. It is believed there are 3.[ADDRESS_1202923] and facial 
plastic surgeons with generally  low complication rates.  There is little data describing a patient’s post-
operative  pain course. The majority of these procedures are performed at outpatient surgical centers  or in 
an ambulatory hospi[INVESTIGATOR_862826] . Otolaryngol ogist s routinely 
prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_862827] ’ requirement s for pain 
medications.  This leads to overprescribing and eventual left-over narcotics.  A recent study found 67% of 
patients had surplus narcotics from the initial prescription and 91% of those patients kept that medication 
at home following urological surgery5. Additionally, another study found that patients after upper 
extremity surgical procedures relating to soft tissue only requir ed a mean 5.[ADDRESS_1202924] practice to prescribe >[ADDRESS_1202925] procedures ; however , there  are no guidelines or  criteria to assist in managing 
our patient s’ post-operative pain medication s.  
 
Study Design   
The study is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial enrolling patient s undergoing rhinoplasty or 
septorhinoplasty with  [CONTACT_862836], [CONTACT_862837] or [CONTACT_862838] in the Department of

Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery at [LOCATION_001] Univer sity. The length of  the study participation 
will be approximately 1 week for each patient.   
The randomization process will involve using Microsoft Excel rand() function, which generates and 
evenly distributed random decimal x between 0 and 1.  If 0 < x < 0.5 , the patient wi ll be randomized to 
the NSAID  group.  If 0.5 <= x < [ADDRESS_1202926] obstruction or choose 
to undergo a rhinoplasty for cosmetic purposes. All patients who are recommended a rhinoplasty will be 
offered participation in this randomized clinical trial.  After their surgery, all patients will be disc harged 
home.  Patients will be randomized into the opi[INVESTIGATOR_862828] l. The control arm will be 
prescribed 20 tablets of Hydrocodone 5mg -Acetaminophen 325mg (Norco) and the test arm  prescribed 
Ibuprofen 400mg for post-operative pain. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_862831] -operative day  [ADDRESS_1202927]-operative  day 7 to evaluate the patients . Each 
patient will be asked regarding their level of comfort or discomfort, and how effective they feel their pain 
regimen t is. Outcome measure will be both objective and subjective.  A pain scale  from 0 -10 will be 
utilized to assess a patient’s pain objectively. Additionally, each patient will be asked if they felt their 
pain was subjectively controlled  (yes/no) .  In each arm, a survey will be used to assess  the frequency of 
usage, the dose, timin g and amount of the specific analgesic  consumed . Patients within the NSAID arm of 
the trial will have the ability to speak with their surgeon to escalate their level of analgesia if their pain is 
unable to be controlled on any post-operative  day. This will  be recorded in the result s. Additional 
outcome measures will be recorded such as  open vs closed rhinoplasty, use of osteotomies, concurrent 
septoplasty or turbinate reduction. Adverse effects , complications and demographics will also be 
examined.

Methods and Procedures  
Methods and Procedures  
The rhino plasties and surgical techniques involved will be performed at the surgeons’ discretion , utilizing 
either an open or closed approach. Incis ion types, cartilage grafts, techniques and correction methods will 
be determined by [CONTACT_862833] . Nasal splints may be used in the patient’s nose based on the procedur es performed.  All 
patients post operatively will have a n aquaplast nasal splint placed over the bridge of their nose  in the 
standard fashion.  Patients will then be given and instructed on pain medication use depending on the 
treatment arm in which they w ere placed. The narcotic group will be given a prescription for twenty 
Norco tablets (5mg hydrocodone - 325mg acetaminophen) and be told to take for pain every 4-[ADDRESS_1202930] of care within the department and follows the manufacture r 
labeling for pain management  The NSAID treatment arm will be instructed to take 400mg Ibuprofen

they feel that their pain is not well controlled. On POD7, the patients will be given a survey to document 
the total number of doses of pain medication taken (1 Norco tab vs 400mg Ibuprofen), number of days 
requiring pain medicat ion, need to call for a prescription and side effects noted . The study for each patient 
will be concluded at that time point.  
Data Analysis and Data Monitoring  
Data analysis will be performed with the help of Binhuan Wang, a biostatician at NYU affiliated  with the 
Department of Otolaryngology. He will not have any access to PHI, and will only be given de -identified 
patient data.  The primary outcome to be compared will be the overall pain control based on the pain scale 
using a two-sample  proportion test. We will also compare complication rates, necessity of a patient phone 
call, and subjective pain control.  
Data Storage and Confidentiality  
Data storage will be kept in a REDCAP database file.  This ensures patient confidentiality.  Any 
presentations or papers will not include any protected health information (PHI).  Patient information 
entered into the database will include demographic information as well type of surgery performed, any 
complications, and survey results.  Only [CONTACT_6321], [CONTACT_862839], [CONTACT_98706] and [CONTACT_862840] will be granted 
access to entering information into this database file.  These individuals will have access to the linking 
key. 
 
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Subject Safety  
Patients will be monitored for safety by [CONTACT_862834]. They will see their 
patients in the postoperative period based on current standard of care, and will address any complications 
that their patients may have. Complications will be treated with the current standard of care.  
Any patient within the treatment arm requiring higher levels of pain control will be allowed to have a 
prescription called by [CONTACT_862835] , as needed . These patient s’ data will be included and used as 
a secondary outcome measure to compare.  
Risks  
NSAIDs are known to cause an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events  including bleeding, 
ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines. Additionally,  other adverse reactions include 
heartburn, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting.  
Norco, as wit h all opi[INVESTIGATOR_563932] a risk associated with addiction, abuse and misuse . 
Additionally,  they can cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. The acetaminophen within Norco has been associated 
with liver failure.

Version Date: January [ADDRESS_1202932] -operative bleeding, infection, significant 
gastrointestinal illness related to NSAIDs such as bleeding, ulceration or perforation or events of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_862829]. Any adverse events will be recorded in the 
patient ’s chart and within the REDCAP database. Safety information will be collected at the postoperative 
clinic visits  (POD0, POD1, and POD7) . Reportable Adverse events will be reported wit hin 48 hours of 
their occurrence.  
Interim analysis of the data will be conducted every 2 months  to assess safety and/or identify whether a 
treatment arm demonstrates superiority in efficacy . The treatment outcomes , as well as complications , 
will be routine ly analyzed at these intervals. If, after a minimum of 15 subjects in each arm, one treatment 
arm is statistically significant in pain control on the objective pain scale of 1 -10 (based on a t -test 
comparing two means), the study will be closed early. Addi tionally, if it is determined that the risk of a 
major complication is significantly higher in one arm compared to the other (based on a Fisher’s exact 
test), the study will be closed early. . A major complication would be respi[INVESTIGATOR_862830], significant bleeding event, or a reaction related to the pain medications requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The reason for the minimum number of subjects as stated above is to avoid statistical 
error due to sample size.  
These interim analyses of data safety monitoring will be communicated to the IRB via email.

1.0 OBJECTIVES 
Primary objective: 
a. Determine the overall response rate of eltrombopag in patients with CLL and 
thrombocytopenia. 
 
Secondary objectives: 
a. Determine the time-to-response and duration of response. 
b. Determine time to CLL progression requiring leukemia treatment. 
c. Assess tolerability and toxicities of eltrombopag in patients with CLL. 
d. Assess pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag and thrombopoietin levels in patients 
with CLL. 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
Rationale: 
Eltrombopag (Promacta) is a thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonist that triggers a 
cascade that induces proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone 
marrow progenitor cells1,2.  It received FDA accelerated approval for the treatment of 
chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in November, [ADDRESS_1198038] 
thrombocytopenia, which may be the result of reduced numbers of megakaryocytes 
resulting from infiltration of the bone marrow by [CONTACT_859720]; 
reduced function of megakaryocytes resulting from prior chemotherapy; or from 
Idiopathic Thombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). Among 2300 treatment-naive patients with 
CLL who presented to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) as new patients between 
2000 and 11/2009, 102 had platelet (PLT) count 51-100K/µL, 21 had PLT count 21-
50K/L, and 6 had PLT count 20K/L.  The incidence of thrombocytopenia is higher for 
previously treated patients.  Indeed, among 1370 previously treated patients with CLL 
who presented to MDACC as new patients during the same time period, 236 had PLT 
count 51-100K/µL, 120 had PLT count 21-50K/ L and 66 had PLT count 20K/L.  
These numbers do not include patients on routine follow-up with the Leukemia Service 
who develop thrombocytopenia at some point during their follow-up. 
 
Thrombocytopenia in patients with CLL is associated with morbidity and mortality from 
bleeding complications and significant limitation in administering chemotherapy for 
active, progressive CLL. Identifying an active agent to treat thrombocytopenia in 
patients with CLL would be a significant advance in managing these patients. 
Eltrombopag is an ideal candidate to evaluate as treatment for thrombocytopenia in 
patients with CLL, owing to the previously mentioned mechanism of action and the 
demonstrated activity in treating patients with chronic ITP. This trial will evaluate the 
activity of eltrombopag in treating thrombocytopenia in patients with CLL and PLT 
50K/L. 
 
In this study, patients will be stratified into 2 groups according to physician-assessed 
etiology of thrombocytopenia, those due to prior treatment or disease and those due to 
ITP.  Physicians will use available data to make this determination including, CLL

treatment history, history of thrombocytopenia, complete blood count, and bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_859717].  This determination and stratification will be declared at the time of 
initiation of eltrombopag. 
 
The overall objective of this phase II study will be to determine the PLT response rate 
with eltrombopag in patients with CLL and thrombocytopenia (PLT 50K/L). 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION   
Eltrombopag (Promacta) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment 
of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic 
purpura who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or 
splenectomy.  Eltrombopag is available in 75mg, 50mg and 25mg tablets.  Also, 12.5mg 
tablets are available for clinical trial only. For this study, eltrombopag will be supplied by 
[CONTACT_35316] ([COMPANY_004]), Collegeville, PA, [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
Eltrombopag is being evaluated both in several [COMPANY_004]-sponsored trials and in 
investigator-initiated studies supported by [CONTACT_23983].  Eltrombopag has been evaluated in 
healthy volunteers at a dose of up to 200 mg daily for 5 days and for treatment of 
thrombocytopenia related to immune thrombocytopenia, hepatitis C virus infection, 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in 
cancer patients.  Eltrombopag is currently being evaluated in multiple trials with the 
following dose escalation schema:  the starting dose is 75 mg/day and dose may be 
escalated as follows: 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg given daily for 10 days after completion 
of chemotherapy; continuous dosing is used in the MDS/AML trials.  The maximum 
dose that is currently being considered for all eltrombopag studies is also [ADDRESS_1198039] tested safe dose of eltrombopag, 
either in interrupted dosing (with chemotherapy) or continuous dosing.  Therefore, the 
dose escalation schema in this protocol is consistent with [COMPANY_004]-sponsored trials with 
eltrombopag and dose-modification parameters are consistent with those recommended 
by  [CONTACT_859721]. 
 
In ITP, the recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is [ADDRESS_1198040] Asian ancestry such as Chinese, Japanese, 
Taiwanese, or Korean, it is recommended to initiate eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 
25 mg once daily.  For all ITP patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, 
initiate eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily. 
 
Eltrombopag should be taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal).   At least a 4-hour interval between eltrombopag and other medications (e.g., 
antacids) should be allotted, calcium-rich foods (e.g., dairy products and calcium 
fortified juices), or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, 
aluminum, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. 
 
Protocol 2010-0123 
December 10, 2010 
Version 3 
Page 4 
In patients with ITP, after initiating eltrombopag, the dose should be adjusted to achieve 
and maintain a platelet count ≥50 K/µL x 10K/ L as necessary to reduce the risk for 
bleeding.  
 
Clinical hematology and liver tests should be monitored regularly throughout therapy 
with eltrombopag and modified based on platelet counts as outlined in the package 
insert for Promacta.  Recommendations for monitoring are as follows:  during 
eltrombopag therapy assess CBC, including platelet count and peripheral blood smears, 
weekly until a stable platelet count has been achieved. Obtain CBC, including platelet 
counts and peripheral blood smears, monthly thereafter. 
 
Safety Considerations: 
Summary 
Common side effects (occurring in 3-20% of patients): 
 Dermatologic: skin rash 
 Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting 
 Hematologic: bleeding including heavy menstrual bleeding, low platelets 
requiring transfusion 
 Hepatic: abnormal liver function  tests (possible liver damage) 
 Musculoskeletal: pain in arms and or legs 
 Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy 
 
Potentially serious side effects (occurring in fewer than 3% of patients): 
 Hematologic:  bruising, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], conjunctival hemorrhage, bone marrow 
reticulin formation, worsening thrombocytopenia, 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications (such as in the liver or other 
symptoms) 
 Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy 
 Ophthalmologic: cataracts or worsening of existing cataracts 
 Other:  hematological malignancies, progression of malignancies and non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
 
Liver toxicity 
Eltrombopag administration may cause hepatotoxicity. In the ITP controlled clinical 
studies, one patient experienced Grade 4 (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] toxicity scale) elevations in serum liver test values during 
therapy with eltrombopag, worsening of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and 
death. No patients in the placebo group experienced Grade [ADDRESS_1198041] abnormalities. In 
controlled studies, elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and indirect bilirubin 
were observed more frequently on the eltrombopag arm than placebo.  Overall, serum 
liver test abnormalities (predominantly Grade 2 or less in severity) were reported in 11% 
and 7% of the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. In the controlled studies, 
four patients (1%) treated with eltrombopag and three patients in the placebo group 
(2%) discontinued treatment due to hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities.  Eighteen of 
the patients treated with eltrombopag in the controlled studies with hepatobiliary 
Protocol 2010-[ADDRESS_1198042] abnormalities (predominantly 
Grade 1) resulting in discontinuation of eltrombopag in one patient. In the ITP extension 
study, one additional patient had eltrombopag discontinued due to liver test 
abnormalities (all Grade 3) . 
 
Serum ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin should be measured prior 
to initiation of eltrombopag, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and 
monthly following establishment of a stable dose. If bilirubin is elevated, perform 
fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. 
If the abnormalities are confirmed, monitor serum liver tests weekly until the 
abnormality(ies) resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline levels. Permanently discontinue 
eltrombopag if ALT levels increase to 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) and are: 
 progressive, or 
 persistent for 4 weeks, or 
 accompanied by [CONTACT_218080], or 
 accompanied by [CONTACT_859722]. 
  
Exercise caution when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic disease. Use 
a lower starting dose of eltrombopag in patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
disease and monitor closely  
 
Bone marrow fibrosis 
Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO-receptor agonists 
may increase the risk for the development or progression of reticulin fiber deposition 
within the bone marrow.  
  
In the ITP extension study, seven patients had reticulin fiber deposition reported in bone 
marrow biopsies, including two patients who also had collagen fiber deposition. The 
fiber deposition was not associated with cytopenias and did not necessitate 
discontinuation of eltrombopag. However, clinical studies have not yet excluded a risk of 
bone marrow fibrosis with cytopenias. 
  
Prior to initiation of eltrombopag, examine the peripheral blood smear closely to 
establish a baseline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. Following identification 
of a stable dose of eltrombopag, examine peripheral blood smears and CBC monthly for 
new or worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g., teardrop and nucleated red blood 
cells, immature white blood cells) or cytopenia(s). If the patient develops new or 
worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s), discontinue treatment with 
eltrombopag and consider a bone marrow biopsy, including staining for fibrosis.  
 
Worsening thrombocytopenia following discontinuation 
Discontinuation of eltrombopag may result in thrombocytopenia of greater severity than 
was present prior to therapy with eltrombopag. This worsened thrombocytopenia may 
increase the patient's risk of bleeding, particularly if eltrombopag is discontinued while 
Protocol 2010-0123 
December 10, 2010 
Version 3 
Page 6 
the patient is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. In the controlled ITP clinical 
studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels lower than baseline were 
observed following discontinuation of treatment in 8% and 8% of the eltrombopag and 
placebo groups, respectively. Serious hemorrhagic events requiring the use of 
supportive ITP medications occurred in 3 severely thrombocytopenic patients within one 
month following the discontinuation of eltrombopag; none were reported among the 
placebo group.  
  
Following discontinuation of eltrombopag, obtain weekly CBC, including platelet counts 
for at least 4 weeks and consider alternative treatments for worsening 
thrombocytopenia, according to current treatment guidelines  
 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications  
Eltrombopag may increase the risk of thrombotic/thromboembolic events. In the 
controlled ITP clinical studies, four thrombotic/thromboembolic complications were 
reported within the groups that received eltrombopag and none within the placebo 
groups. Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications have also been reported in the ITP 
extension study.  
 
In a placebo-controlled double-blind study (ELEVATE) of 261 patients with chronic liver 
disease who were undergoing an elective surgical procedure, the risk of thrombotic 
events was increased in patients treated with 75mg eltrombopag. Six thrombotic 
complications were reported within the group that received eltrombopag and one within 
the placebo group. All of the thrombotic complications reported within the eltrombopag 
group were of the portal venous system. Four of the 6 subjects receiving eltrombopag 
also had a tumor (2 hepatocellular carcinoma; 1 lymphoma and 1 brain tumor).  Tumors 
are known to increase the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a thrombotic/thromboembolic event.  The 
ELEVATE study has been terminated and remains blinded.  Eltrombopag is not 
indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease. 
 
Caution should be used when administering eltrombopag to patients with known risk 
factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid 
syndrome and portal hypertension).  
 
Malignancies and Progression of Malignancies 
Stimulation of the TPO receptor on the surface of hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_556999]. Across the ITP clinical program, 
hematologic malignancies were reported in one eltrombopag patient and one in placebo 
patient.  
 
Cataracts  
Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents (see Non-
clinical Information). To date, there is however, no evidence that eltrombopag increases 
the incidence nor progression of cataracts in patients who have received eltrombopag.  
In the three placebo-controlled ITP studies, 7% of patients in both the placebo and 
Protocol 2010-[ADDRESS_1198043] an appropriate 
ophthalmologic evaluation.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This is a phase II, open label study. The primary efficacy endpoint is overall 
response rate (OR), which is defined as the composite of complete response 
(CR) and major response (MR).  CR is defined as an increase in PLT count to 
≥100K/µL for at least 4 weeks.  MR is defined as an increase in PLT count from 
<20K/µL to ≥20K/µL and by [CONTACT_2669] 100% for at least 8 weeks; or for patients 
starting with >20K/µL platelets, absolute increase in PLT count of ≥30K/µL for at 
least 4 weeks: or PLT transfusion independence (no PLT transfusion) for at least 
4 weeks). Overall response will be the best response achieved according to 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_1198059] 3 months of treatment. 
 
The objective is to demonstrate a 30% Overall Response Rate (ORR) for the 
cohort of patients with CLL and ITP and 30% ORR for the cohort of patients with 
disease-related thrombocytopenia.  There will be a total of 36 patients enrolled in 
this study and with an average enrollment of 1-2 monthly, total enrollment is 
anticipated to take 15-20 months.  Simon’s two-stage optimal design will be used 
in this study for the 2 different cohorts, separately.  
 
In each of these cohorts, a total sample size of 18 is chosen to differentiate 
between a desirable ORR of 30% and a poor response rate of 10% at the 
significance level of 0.10 with 80% power. Specifically, [ADDRESS_1198060] stage. If there are no responders, the trial will be terminated due to 
lack of efficacy; otherwise an additional 11 patients will be treated resulting in a 
total of 18 patients. If there are 3 or fewer responses among 18 patients, the 
treatment will be concluded ineffective. The probability of early termination due to 
futility is 0.48.  
 
Safety monitoring will be based on a beta-binomial distribution.  The probability of 
toxicity will be monitored based on a beta-binomial model, assuming a priori that 
p = Prob(toxicity) ~ beta(1, 1).  The trial will be terminated if Prob(p > .15 | data) > 
.9. This rule will stop the trial if [# patients with toxicity]/[# patients evaluated] > 3/7, 4/12, 5/17, 6/22, 7/27, 8/32.  Toxicity events, for purposes of safety 
monitoring, will be defined as eltrombopag-related, grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1198061] longer than 1 week despi[INVESTIGATOR_859719]/or dose 
reduction. The operating characteristics for toxicity are summarized in Table 2 .

Efficacy will be analyzed separately for each cohort.  The proportions of subjects 
with overall response (CR+MR) will reported together with exact confidence 
intervals.  All other response categories (minor, response, sustained response, 
failure) will be summarized using frequency counts and percentage.  The 
denominator will include all subjects who received eltrombopag. 
 
Continuous data including eltrombopag and thrombopoietin levels will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, sd, median, range).  Graphical, 
histograms, or box-plots will be used where appropriate.   Descriptive statistical 
analysis will be used to explore the data, including histograms or box-plots, 
proportions, means, standard deviations. The Fisher’s exact test or Chi-square 
test will be used for the univariable analysis on categorical variables (response 
variable with Yes versus No, for example). The t-test or Wilcoxon test will be 
used for continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to 
estimate overall and event-free survival over 36 months. 
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the extent of exposure to 
eltrombopag. The number (%) of subjects with adverse events, serious adverse 
events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be reported.  Adverse 
events toxicity will be reported by [CONTACT_24975], frequency and severity.  Laboratory 
parameters will also be summarized by [CONTACT_16750]; 
laboratory toxicity will be summarized using frequency counts. 
 
Sample size determination: 
Simon’s optimal two-stage design will be used to test the null hypothesis that the 
proportion of subjects with overall response is <=0.10 versus the alternative that 
it is >=0.30 (i.e., Po<=0.10 vs. Pa>=0.30) at alpha=0.10 with 80% power.  It has 
an expected sample size of [ADDRESS_1198062] stage, the trial will be terminated if 
0 respond. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 18 patients will be 
studied.  If the total number responding is less than or equal to 3, the null 
hypothesis is not rejected.

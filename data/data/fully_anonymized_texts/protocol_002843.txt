CLAN STUDY METHODS  
 
BEFORE THE STUDY VIS IT  
 
Recruitment  
 
You can recruit subjects via word of mouth or any of the IRB approved recruitment methods (fliers, 
postcards, email). The easiest method will likely be via word of mouth from your clinic schedules.  
Fliers have not been very helpful  but can be used. Post cards seem to work. If you want to use this 
method, you will need to contact [CONTACT_827067] a list of subjects who have been seen in our clinic in the 
last six months (patients with diagnosed myopia or hyperopia without astigmatism); Keri can then 
print the post cards for you using the patient contact [CONTACT_827068]. Email 
works well. If you us e email, you should consider contact[CONTACT_827069], dentistry, medicine, and 
nursing  (not on the same day) . Once you have found subjects, you should then screen them with the 
phone screen survey  (can be done in person) . If they pass, you need to make sure that they can 
come in three weeks in a row on the same day of the week (+/ - 1 day).  You al so need to tell them to 
bring in their glasses prescription. If you pull it for them from Compulink, you need to record that you pulled it on the records review form in the main documents folder.     
 Rooms  
 
You should open each room and setup the rooms prior to each visit  (make sure things turn on) . Room 
452 has the autorefractor and Baily -Lovie eye chart; you can use other autorefractors or logMAR eye 
charts if they are more convenient for you. Don Mutti or Kimberly Shaw can open this room for you. Room  446 has the Keratogr aph 5M (TMH and bulbar redness), and Room 546 has the Medmont 
(NITBUT). You should coordinate with Matt ( [EMAIL_15737]
) and Erin to schedule to use 
these rooms; they can also you help you open these rooms. You will conduct the rest of the study 
visit in the pre -clinic area (2nd Floor Fry). Make sure that you have a study folder prepared for the 
subject (all documents are up to date). Use an old folder as a reference.  
 STUDY VISIT  
 Informed Consent for Study Participation (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
The phone screen questionnaire should be used again to verify that the subjects are still eligible to 
participant in the study before they can be enrolled into the study.  A study representative should then 
discuss the study with the patient and give him/her an opportunity to answer questions.  Consent will 
be documented when the patient and investigator have both signed the IRB approved consent form. 
Make sure everything is signed and dated at the visit. It is an ethics violation if you do not do this! The 
subject should be given  a copy of the signed consent form.  Consent should be obtained prior to 
completion of any of the study surveys  or clinical test. If the patient is younger than eighteen years 
old, they will need to sign an IRB approved assent form, and their guardian will need to sign the IRB 
approved parental permission form. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_827055]. The subject should then be asked to sign a HIPAA f orm. After these forms are done, testing 
can begin.    
 Assignment of Subject ID Number  (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
Once consent has been obtained, the study investigator will assign the subject a unique ID number ranging from 301 to 330.  These numbers should be given out consecutively.  
   
 
Habitual Spectacle Prescription (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
The subjects will be asked to provide a valid spectacle prescription at the start of the study. The potential subject will be asked to reschedule their exam if they are unable to provide this information.  
 
Questionnaires (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
Subjects will be asked to complete the OSDI questionnaire at the start of each visit.  They will also be asked to complete the CLDEQ at the start of the second and third study visits . You should enter the 
subject’s ID number into the form for them, so we know for sure that the ID number is entered 
correctly. The questionnaires will be administered electronically; however, paper forms may be used if 
Internet access i s not available. All paper forms must be entered electronically within one day of the 
study visit  by [CONTACT_827070]  (really, just make sure the online version works) .

CLDEQ Link:  https://survey.qualtri cs.com/SE/?SID=SV_3pA88YmNqnBLX4V  
 
Note that you may want to have these links on the computer desktop, and you should check to make 
sure that they work before the visit. Also, just tell patients to answer the questions to the best of their 
ability.  
 Visua l Acuity  (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
1. The subject will be comfortably seated and asked to wear their habitual spectacle correction.  
2. The examiner will then have the subject read the B ailey-Lovie eye chart (LogMAR).  The 
examiner should encourage the subject to do their best while performing the test.  Habitual 
room lighting conditions are acceptable for this study.  
3. The examiner should then record right and left eye visual acuity (LogMAR & Snellen Equivalent).

NITBUT – Medmont  (Masked Examiner)  
 
1. Comfortably seat participant with their head supported by [CONTACT_827071].  
2. The instrument has a keratoscope unit that produces concentric rings of light, which are reflected off the cornea and imaged in a CCD camera.  
3. Ask the participant to look  at a fixation light at the center of the concentric rights of light.  
4. Ask participants to blink 3 times before each measurement.  
5. NITBUT can be determined by [CONTACT_827073] e concentric ring pattern.  
6. Measure the time (in seconds) for the tear -film to rupture (and thus distort the rings) using a 
stopwatch, to the nearest 0.1 of a second (phone or stopwatch  in box ). 
7. Three measurements should b e taken of each eye and recorded on  the exam sheet. Make 
sure to pull the instrument back between each measurement in order to allow the subject to have a break between readings  (~10s) . 
8. The mean values obtained in both eyes will then be averaged and used for data analysis.  
 
Anterior Segment  Assessment  (Masked Examiner)  
 
1. Position the slit lamp (white light) at the cornea using medium magnification.  
2. Assess for the presence or absence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_827056]/pterygium, lid notching, and corneal scarring.  
If corneal scarring is present, draw location of scar in the designated area of the data collection 
sheet.  
3. Assess/grade blepharitis using the scale provided in the data collection sheet.  
4. Assess/grade corneal vascularization using the scale provided in the data collection sheet.

excess solution.  
2. Wait for 3 seconds to ensure that the fluorescein in particles dissolve before applying the strip.  
 
3. Instill a small amount by [CONTACT_827074]; make sure to avoid touching 
the eyelids with the strip.  
4. Instruct participant to blink several times.  
5. Staining w ill be evaluated 2.0 - 2.5 minutes following fluorescein dye instillation  (use the 
stopwatch).  
6. This procedure should be conducted at a magnification of 8X to 12X using cobalt blue 
illumination. A yellow barrier filter should be used.  
7. Use a 0- 4 scale (0.5 increments) to grade the type of staining, and a 0- 4 scale (1.0 increment) 
to grade the extent/area and depth of staining.  Make sure to have the subject blink to verify 
that staining is truly present. The grades for staining should be standardized to the C CLRU 
grading scale.  There is a better explanation of the back of the grading card.  
8. Record staining, type and extent in the [ADDRESS_1147421] 1 (Masked Examiner)  
 
1. Prepare the strips in the package by [CONTACT_360021], approximately [ADDRESS_1147422] the participant to gently close their 
eyes (both eyes tested at same time) . 
4. Leave the strips in place for 5 minutes (stopwatch). The subjects will be instructed to lightly 
close their eyes during the tes t to make it more comfortable. The measurements should be 
made to the nearest millimeter.  Subjects are allowed to stop the test early if they completely wet the strips.  
5. Record values for each eye.  
 
Contact [CONTACT_353705] (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
Contact [CONTACT_827075]’s  spectacle prescriptions (compensated for 
cylinder) and Ks.  Ks flatter than 44.[ADDRESS_1147423] lens clinic; you may want to get the contacts before the start of the visit. All prescriptions 
greater than ± 4.[ADDRESS_1147424] lenses will be assessed 
(centration, movement, coverage). The alternative BC lens may be used if it allows for improved fit.  
All trialed lenses should be recorded on the last page. You can use the back of a page if needed.    
 
Contact [CONTACT_827076] & Removal Training (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
The subject will then be taught how to use their contact [CONTACT_13276], and they will be provided with care 
information.  The participant must demonstrate that they c an remove the lens at least [ADDRESS_1147425] Randomization, Scheduling, and Take Home Materials  (Unmasked Examiner)  
 
Fully qualifying subjects will then be randomly placed into one of two groups (only subjects who have 
completed I&R and still want to try the contact [CONTACT_13276]) . One group will consist of gradual wear 
participants, and the other full -time wear participants. The randomization will be done by [CONTACT_827077]. Randomization will be done in a closed room away from the masked examiner. 
All questions about the treatment will be answered at this time. If it is the patient’s first visit, then their 
second visit should  be confirmed at this time . The next visit w ill be scheduled one week from the first 
visit (+/- 1 day) . If the patient is at their second visit, then their third and final visit will be conformed 
and scheduled for the following week ; an additional visual analog diary will be given at this time. Upon 
leaving the subjects will be provided with their prescribed contact [CONTACT_13276], a contact [CONTACT_240407], 
solution, a visual analog survey to complete throughout the week, and wear schedule directions . 
Subjects should be paid $10/visit and offered a parking pass. Subjects need to sign a payment form 
at each visit after receiving their money. If a parking pass is given, it should be noted on the payment 
form.    
 
FUTURE VISITS   
 
The subject will be asked to return for two follow up visits. The subject will provide us with their visual 
analog survey  at each follow up visit, and they will complete the OSDI and CLDEQ surveys  again at 
each visit . The following testing will also be completed during each follow up visit: visual acuity, 
NITBUT, TMH, bulbar and limb al redness,  anterior segment  (all slit -lamp  tests even if they are 
unlikely to change)  assessment, fluorescein corneal staining, and S chirmer’s test. When the masked 
examiner arrives to the room, they should explicitly say that they are the masked examiner. They 
should also tell the patient that they cannot know which study group they are in. Scheduling will be done as described above. Subjects completing their third study visit will be released from the study 
and will be provided with a contact [CONTACT_827078]  (paper prescription) . If a prescription is released, it should be 
recorded in the chart.

decision should be agreed upon by [CONTACT_206581].  Touch -up 
treatment will not be performed if the subject has a disease or condition described in the 
exclusion criteria, or an ongoing treatment -related AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_162878] a touch -up.  It is recommended that the dose should not 
exceed 1.5 mL in each lip (including vermillion, vermi llion border and cupid’s bow) per 
treatment session. The study  product may  also be injected for optimal correction of the upper 
perioral rhytids, philtral columns, and/or oral commissures.  The recommended maximum 
injected volume per subject and treatment is 6mL (i.e. 3 mL for lips and 3 mL for perioral 
area).   
Subjects will have in-clinic follow up visits at 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48weeks after the 
last injection.    If a touch-up is performed, a second 2-week and 4-week follow -up visits
should be scheduled.  At the 48-week visit after all study  procedures for the visit are 
completed, subjects can receive an optional additional treatment if optimal aesthetic 
improvement is not maintained with Restylan e® Kysse . If re-treatment is performed, a second 
2-week and 4-week follow -up visitsshould be scheduled.  In addition to the clinic visits, 
phone visits will also occur as specified in the study flow chart below.

5.Subjects
5.[ADDRESS_246442] information and informed consent
The Investigator or his/her authorized designee must alway s use the IRB-approved subject 
information and informed consent form and it must not be changed without prior discussion 
with the Sponsor and approval from the applicable I RB.
It is the responsibilit y of the Investigator or his/her authorized designee to give each subject 
prior to inclusion in the study , full and adequate verbal and written information regarding all 
aspects of the clinical study  that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participa te 
throughout the study , e.g. explain the purpose and procedures of the study , the duration and 
number of expected participants, possible risks involved, and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100].  The 
subject shall be informed that the participation is confidential and voluntary  and that the 
subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without any effect on his/her 
future medical care, treatment or benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  The 
information shall beprovided ina language clear lyandfullyunder standable tothesubject. 
The subje ctshall begiven sufficient time to read and understand the informed consent form 
and to consider participation in the study .  Before any study-related activities are performed, 
the informed consent form shall be personally  signed and dated by [CONTACT_206582]/her authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent 
process.  
All original signed informed consent forms shall be filed in the Investigator file.  The subject 
shall be provided with a copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form and any other 
written information.
The Investigator shall ensure that important new information is provided to new and existing 
subjects throughout the study .
5.[ADDRESS_246443] meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study :

Page 58of 758.[ADDRESS_246444] 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in subjects, users or other persons1, 
whether or not related to the study  product. 
This definition includes:
a)events related to the investigational product or the reference product
b)events related to the procedures involved
8.7.2 Definition of a serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
a)led to death,
b) led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in
1.a life -threateni ng2illness or injury , or
2.a permanent impairment of a bod y structure or body function, or
3.in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]3, or
4.medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury  or 
permanent impairment to a body  structur e or a body  function, 
c)led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality  or birth defect
An AE does not need to be recorded as a SAE if it only represents a relapse or an expected 
change or progression of the condition that was the cause of the treatment, without the 
development of new s ymptoms and signs.
In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should be a 
predisposition to report as a SAE rather than not report as such
8.7.[ADDRESS_246445] should be questioned about AEs at each study  visit following the 
screening visit.The question asked should be: “Since your last clinical visit have you had 
any health problems?” Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms 
detected during each examination.  
                                                
1For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational product.
2The term “life -threatening” in the def inition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe. (Source: ICH -E2A clinical safety data management :definitions and standards for expedited 
reporting ).
3Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206579] a pre- existing condition, o r a procedure required by [CONTACT_150894] P, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).

Page 59of 75When an AE is related to a device deficiency  including technical device malfunction, the 
AE should be recorded in the AE eCRF and technical complaint should be reported 
separately  on the study  complaint form.  
Investigators, or other study  site personnel, shall record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology  and avoiding abbreviations)
b)Description of event and affected area 
c)Start date (first day  with sy mptoms)
d)Stop date (last day  with sy mptoms)
e)Intensit y (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
g)Causal relationship to study  product or study  product injection procedure (y es or no)
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non-medication treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE(ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ 
stable, not recovered at the end of the stud y)
The pre -define d, expected post-treatment events shall be assessed separately . These events 
shall be collected b y subjects in a diary  used daily  for 30days after the treatment .
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity
Intensit y will be recorded for each reported AE. The following definitions of intensity  are to 
be used:
Mild : Awareness of s ymptoms or signs, but easily  tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity  (disturbing) 
Severe: Incapacity  to work or to do usual activity  (unacceptable) 
If the intensity  changes within one day, the maximum intensity  of the AEduring that day 
shall be recorded.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causal relationship and seriousness
Each AE, serious as well as non-serious, shall be assessed by [CONTACT_206583](the injection procedure) and for seriousness
(Yes or No)of the event . 
A two -point scale (Yes or Noresponse ) shall be used for the causality assessments . The 
Investigators shall be asked to indicate aresponse to each of the following questions in the 
eCRF :
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the study product ?”,and 
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the device injection proce dure?”
If any of these questions is answered ‘Yes’, the AE is considered related.

Page 63of 75management, data entry  and verification, data validation, and documentation of the 
performed activities including information of discrepancies in the process. The data 
management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry  screens and program will be designed in accordance with the CI P 
and the eCRF. Data validati on will be performed by [CONTACT_132155]. Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug and medical dictionary  for regulatory  activities (MedDRA) dictionaries as 
specified in the DMP. SAEs in the clinical database will be reconciled against the data in the 
safet y database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in 
the database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study  
data will be transferred to SAS datasets which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical 
analyses will be generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.

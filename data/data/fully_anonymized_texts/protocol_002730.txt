8 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Optimization of TEA Modalities for Treatment of IBS -C: 
A Phase I 25 Study participant  Clinical Trial of Transcutaneous 
Electrical Acustimulation (TEA) in Study participant s with IBS -C 
Précis: This study aims to discern whether Transcutaneous Electrical 
Acustimulation (TEA)  at acupuncture points ST36 and/or PC6 will 
relieve the abdominal pain associated with IBS -C.  Each study 
participant  will have 5 research visits at the Michigan Medicine GI 
physiology lab. During these visit s, they will undergo  a procedure 
similar to Anal Rectal Manometry performed by [CONTACT_193472]. TEA  is similar to this procedure as it is uses the barostat device 
and is performed  by [CONTACT_193473].  This device has a 
rubber catheter that will be inserted 5- 15 cm into the rectum of the 
study participant. Then the GI physiology staff will inflate the 
catheter. They will ask the study participant when they can sense the 
catheter. Then the GI physiology staff will continue to inflate the catheter and the study participant s feel discomfort  (described as the 
'urge to defecate'). Then the study participant  will be asked to pass 
the balloon (like they  would pass a bowel movement).  
The difference between AR M procedure and the study procedure is 
that there will be stimulation of acupuncture point ST36 which is below the knee cap or stimulation of acupuncture point PC6 which is 
just above the wr ist. 
At each visit there will be stimulation of only one of the points at 
either 100Hz or 25Hz.   These are the potential combinations: ST36 
100Hz, ST36- 25Hz, PC6- 100Hz, PC6- 25Hz, Sham- TEA.  
The frequency  and position combination (or sham visit) is randomly 
assigned. The randomization determines the order in which the study 
participant  moves through the study. Every study participant  will, in 
the end, complete one visit at each frequency and a sham visit. The 
study participant  will also complete surveys at the appointment. 
Study participant s will be compensated for their participation and 
given a parking pass.  
Objectives:  
 Primary:  Determin e the best stimulation point and frequency  for 
relieving  the abdominal pain in study participant s with IBS -C. 
Secondary:  Collect measurement s of visceral hypersensitivity in 
study participants with IBS -C. 
Population: 25 study participant s, male and females , age ≥18 years , IBS-C 
satisfying Rome IV criteria  
Phase:  1

Participation Duration: Each visit will be 120 minutes long. There will be 5 visits total. The maximum amount of time between visits is 3 weeks. The minimum 
amount of time between visits is  1 week  
Description of Intervention: The device being studied, the Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation (TEA ) will give stimulation similar to electro 
acupuncture at two specific acupuncture points (ST -36 and PC -6) 
known to impact pain perception. The study team would like to 
access if TEA is safe for study participants and will impact the pain 
perception in study participants with IBS -C.

11 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
• In this project, we will use a novel transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) device for 
treatment of chronic abdominal pain in  study participants with  Irritable Bowel Syndrome with 
Constipation (IBS -C).  This is a device that  has stimulating electrodes. The electrodes are placed on 
acupuncture points that previous studies demonstrate relieve pain  related to constipation.   
• This therapeutic strategy is called Neuromodulation . The process of preforming acupuncture via 
electrical stimulation in place of traditional acupuncture methods is called electroacupuncture, EA .  
The two acupuncture points, acupoints, that have been found to 
improve autonomic functions impaired in animal models of IBS  are 
points ST -36 and PC6.  
• In the human PC6 is three finger widths above the wrist. In the 
human ST-36 is four finger widths below the knee . 
• The motivation behind this study is to access the impact of TEA on pain and motility in study participant s with IBS -C.  If successful, 
TEA could serve as a non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_193461] -
C. 
• The barostat  is a FDA approved device (K99 1288) used in 
clinical practice and research to study the function and activity  
of the motor and sensory functions of the gastrointestinal tract. 
This is a common method used to measure gastric  motility (or   
the movement of food from the mouth through the pharynx (throat), esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines and out of the body).  It can monitor volume changes while 
maintaining a set constant pressure and deliver controlled distensions of gastrointestinal organs.  The controlled distension 
is completed by [CONTACT_8121]’s ability to inflate at the tip of the catheter.  In this study, the device will be used in the rectum.  
This device does not use electricity to stimulate the rectum.  
• This device is not being studied. Rather it is used to collect measurements.   In this case, we will use the barostat device to 
monitor the activity in the rectum. The rectum of the GI track thought to be have abnormal activity in study participant s with 
IBS-C, contributing to their symptoms.  
2.2 Rationale   
• The aim of the study is to determine the best TEA stimulation 
point and parameters for treating the abdominal pain in study 
participant s with IBS based on a well -established measurement of motility, the barostat and the study 
participant ’s survey responses.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
12 2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1  Potential Risks  
The immediate risks involved with barostat  inflation and subsequent rectal distension include:  
• Discomfor t during the balloon insertion  
• Sensation (discomfort) with the balloon inflation which is a variable of the study. The likelihood of 
this risk is common, up to 100% of participants will experience discomfort. The study team will 
make the study participant  aware of this before consent ing to the procedure. The study 
participant  has the right to stop the procedure at any time.  
• Bleeding at the site of balloon inflation (in the rectum). The likelihood of this risk is rare, approximate incidence of <1%.  
 However, the duration of rectal distention is brief and the distention can be immediately terminated upon  
intolerable pain or discomfort.  
 The long range risk  of barostat inflation is:  
• Perforation of the rectum into the peritoneal space, the likelihood of this risk is rare, approximate 
incidence of <1%.  
 
The risks of electrical stimulation via TEA are:  
• Possible allergic reaction to the stimulation electrodes and sensation of electrical stimulation. 
The likelihood of this risk is rare, approximate incidence of <1% . 
However, the stimulation output will be set at a level that is well tolerated by [CONTACT_2299]. In very rare  
occasions, the participant might experience rash or minor infection at the stimulation point that can be  
treated locally if needed.  
 
The risk involved with the ECG recording: 
• Allergic reaction of ECG electrodes.
 The likelihood of this risk is rare, approximate incidence of 
<1% 
 The researchers will try to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_193475]. The study investigators and our GI Physiology lab  
staff are well versed in doing these type of procedures. In addition, one of gastroenterologist -physician  
study investigators will be present/perform the studies or will be readily available on site for  
consultation/evaluation in case of any study complications or questions.  
 
The rationale behind these risks is that the risks are unlikely and the study participant  would receive care  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_229988] this data without study participant s 
enduring  the risks.  Alternative procedures would not provide the same understanding of the influence 
of TEA for  IBS-C study participant s.  
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
A potential benefit for study participant  is a reduction in pain related to their IBS -C. 
3 Objectives  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The objectives of this study are as follows:  
• To understand  the impact of TEA on study participant s with IBS -C (reduction of pain related to IBS- C) 
• Access the safety of TEA in study participant s with IBS -C 
• Refine which (if any) TEA stimulation and location combination delivers the greatest reduction in pain 
associated with IBS -C 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
The barostat device and study participant  survey responses will  measure the study outcomes.  
3.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
The barostat device will measure the volume changes in the rectum during controlled distension of the gastrointestinal organs. If the TEA is successful, the study participant’s maximum tolerance should 
increase after TEA compared to their first maximum tolerance of the visit. This will be defined by 
[CONTACT_193476].  
3.2.[ADDRESS_229989] a change in their 
symptoms.  
4 Study Design  
This is a placebo- controlled trial.  The placebo is the sham- TEA visit. The study will recruit 25 study 
participant s with IBS -C. These study participants will be recruited from the UM Health Research 
Recruiting Registry (UM HealthResearch.org) , Michig an Bowel Control Program (MBCP), Functional 
Bowel Disease (FBD), and the study team will screen the gastroenterology clinic schedules via MiChart.  
This is a phase 1 trial. This is study will only occur at the University of Michigan. There is only one 
group/arm of study participants.  The study team plans to complete enrollment within 12 months of 
beginning to the study. Study participant  participation will be at a minimum 5 weeks (1 week between 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
14 visits) and at a maximum 15 weeks (3 weeks between each visit).   The test agent is the novel TEA 
device.  
4.[ADDRESS_229990] visit which 
will include the informed consent process. At visit one, the study team will randomly generate the 
stimulations schedule unique to each study participant ; this is the order of locations and currents by [CONTACT_2329] 
a random generator.  For example, ST36- 100Hz, ST36 -25Hz , PC6-100Hz , PC6-25Hz  and Sham- TEA. 
 
48 Hours prior to the visit : The study participant s will no t take any medications known to affect the gut 
or pain perception.  
 8:00 pm on the night before the visit : The study participant s begin fasting for their visit the next day. 
Study participant s can still drink water. Study participant s cannot drink coffee, tea, juices or eat any food 
items.  
 Day of the Visit :  
Study participant s will come to the study location, the Gastrointestinal Physiology Lab in University of 
Michigan. The visit will take place in one of the private rooms within the lab.  If the study participant  is a 
women of child bearing potential: She  will complete a pregnancy test provided by [CONTACT_3476].  If 
her pregnancy test is positive, she will be excluded from further participation in the study and will not 
complete the visit.  
 Rome IV Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome : Upon arrival for every visit , the study participant  will 
complete the Rome IV Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome  survey.  
 
Enema : The study participant  will be given a rectal enema to clean the rectum. Then the study 
participant  will undress from the bottom down and be given a gown and sheets for  comfort and privacy.  
 
Position the study participant : The study participant  will be asked to lie down on the medical 
examination table  on one side and bring his or her knees up to the  chest, similar to the fetal position. 
The table has rails that will protect the study participant  from falling.  The staff may use pi[INVESTIGATOR_193462].  
 
Electrode Placement : The GI physiology laboratory staff will place two electrocardiogram (ECG) 
electrodes  from of the TEA device  on the subject’s skin, one on the  wrists at location PC6 and the other 
on upper leg below the  knee at location ST36.  These two electrodes 
will be used for delivering weak electrical current stimulation.  The 
electric current and stimulating electrode location is determined by 
[CONTACT_193477] ’s randomized stimulation schedule.  Electrodes 
will be placed at both locations at each visit.  
Fig.1: Locations of PC6 and 
ST36.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
15  
 An a dditional three ECG electrodes  connected to the ECG 
machine  will be placed on the study participant ’s skin, one 
on the manubrium of sternum , one above the breastbone 
and one on the study participant ’s right chest. These three 
electrodes will be used for recording the ECG. Before the placement of each of the  5 electrodes, the skin area where 
the electrodes to be placed will be carefully cleaned using skin-prep materials.   
  
Baseline data collection with the Barostat :  
The Barostat is a n FDA-Approved device that measures pressure in the rectum. The device has a thin 
and flexible polyvinyl catheter (PVC) will be placed 5 -15 cm into the study participant ’s rectum. Once  
placed, this catheter will be in the rectum for the reminder of the visit.  
 
Rest - [ADDRESS_229991], baseline data will be collected for 15 minutes.  
 
Inflation with the Barostat : 
The GI physiology lab staff will inflate a small balloon at the tip of the catheter and ask the study 
participant  to assess the sensation. During this period, the study participant  will be asked to take a note 
of their first sensation, urge to defecate and maximum tolerance; meanwhile, the study participant  will 
also be asked to report the scale of pain or discomfort during the process of the balloon distention. The 
study participant  will complete  the Visual analog Scale Pain Score during inflation.  
 Maximum Tolerance : 
Once the maximum tolerance is reached, the inflation will stop and the air will be removed.  
 TEA – 15 minutes  
One of the randomly assigned TEA methods (or sham -TEA) will be performed for 15 minutes.  
 Inflation with the Barostat and TEA :  
Then the inflation process described above will be repeated while applying the TEA. The study participant  may sense the weak electrical stimulation.  If the stimulation intensity is uncomfortable for 
the study participant , the sti mulation will be set a level where  the study participant  feels comfortable. 
This will be noted in the visit summary.  The study participant  will complete  the Visual Analog  Scale Pain 
Score during inflation.  
During the entire period, the ECG signal will be recorded from the three chest ECG electrodes .  Once the 
inflation with barostat and TEA is completed , the study participant’s visit will end .

• Are unable to provide informed consent  
5.3 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Recruitment : Co-i nvestigators, Drs. Chey, Owyang and Nojkov, and physician colleagues seeing 
study participants at Michigan Bowel Control Program (MBCP) and Functional Bowel Disease (FBD) will refer potential study participant s to the study team.  MiChart schedule screening may also be 
used for identifying possible study participants.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_229993] the study on clinicaltrials.gov.  
Retention: T he study team hopes to retain study participants in the study by [CONTACT_17155] a flexible time 
period between visits; as short as one week and as long as [ADDRESS_229994] visit , the order of TEA stimulation at the visits will be randomly assigned to each study 
participant . Every study participant  will undergo every TEA combination (For example, ST36- 100Hz, 
ST36 -25Hz, PC6 -100Hz, PC6- 25Hz and Sham- TEA).  
5.4.2 Reasons for Withdrawal  
A study participant  will be discontinued from participation in the study if:  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other medical condition 
or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of 
the study participant . 
• The study participant  meets any exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) . 
Study participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request . 
5.4.3  Handling of Withdrawals  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12440], there is 
sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study termination, will be 
provided to the investigator or sponsor by [CONTACT_51272].  
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to study participant s. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the TEA device. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor will promptly inform the 
investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority(ies) of the termination or suspension and the 
reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  The IRB/IEC will also be informed promptly and provided the 
reason(s) for the termination or suspension by [CONTACT_171372]/institution, as specified 
by [CONTACT_8146](s).  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
18 6 Study Intervention/Investigational Device  
6.1 Study Device  Description  
The TEA device is about 4x3cm. It is similar to a TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit 
that is classified by [CONTACT_193478]  a non- significant risk device.  For this study, two regular ECG electrodes will 
be placed on the skin surface on the preferred location as shown in Fig.[ADDRESS_229995] study visit.  
7.2 Visit Schedule of Events  
see section 4.1 Schedule of Events for Each Visit  and Appendix A for a Table Describing the Schedule of 
Events   
7.3 Visit Compensation   
Subjects in this study will receive $200.00 per visits 1-3 and $350.00 per visits 4 and 5.  
This totals to $1,300.00 once all study activity is completed.  
The compensation is set at such a high value based on the lengthy duration of the study visits (120 
minutes), the strong likelihood of discomfort due rectal dilation (the balloon inflation with the barostat 
procedure) and the sensitive nature of the study.   
The additional payment in visits 4 and 5 is to encourage study participants to complete all five visits.  It is 
crucial to the study design that the study participant completes all five visits.

beginning of every visit.  The study participant  will complete the Visual Analog Scale Pain Score 
twice, once during both  inflation s, at every visit.  
9 Assessment of Safety 
9.1 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
9.1.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event:   AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant  or clinical 
investigation study participant  administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship 
to the study treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal 
(investigational) product.  The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during 
study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions will be captured on the appropriate CRF.  Information to be 
collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis, which would include 
MD, DDS, DMD, PA, Nurse Practitioner , or DO), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event.  All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationshi p.  All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the study participant  is screened will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE.  If a pre- existing condition or illness,  which is not  expected to 
exacerbate or worsen, deteriorates at any time during the study it should be reported as an AE.  
All AEs must be graded for severity and relationship to study product.  
Severity of Event:  All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_19811] a protocol defined grading system.   
For events not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
quantify intensity.  
• Mild: Noticeable to the study participant , but does not interfere with study participant’s expected daily 
activities, usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of the study.  
• Moderate : Interferes with the study participant ’s expected daily activities, may require some 
additional therapy or intervention but does not require discontinuation of the study . 
• Severe:  Extremely limits  the study participant ’s daily activities and may require discontinuation of 
study therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention to resolved.   Severe events are usually 
incapacitating.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
20 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of intensity to be performed.  
Relationship to Study Products:  The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to test article 
(study drug) is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not 
reported in the study.  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should  
be reported.  All AEs must have their relationship to study product assessed using the terms: associated 
or not associated.   To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
• Associated  – The event is temporally related to the administration of the study product and no other 
etiology explains the event.  
• Not Associated  – The event is temporally independent of study product and/or the event appears to 
be explained by [CONTACT_11693]. ”=

the ECG electrodes during the study.  
9.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions:  
• Death during the period of protocol -defined surveillance 
• Life-threatening event (defined as a study participant  at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event)  
• An event requiring in study participant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193464]  
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the study participant  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in study participant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse/overdose or cancer . 
All SAEs will be:  
• recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form and CRF  
• followed through resolution by a study clinician. The study clinician for this study is [CONTACT_193488]. The PI [CONTACT_832] a PhD. And not an MD. As an MD, [CONTACT_193488] will serve as the emergency contact 
[CONTACT_193479]. He is the lead of the GI physiology lab.  
• reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician.

21 9.1.4 Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
study participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria:  
• unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the study participant  population being 
studied;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (in the guidance document, possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests that the research places study participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
An incident, experience, or outcome that meets the three criteria above generally will warrant consideration of substantive changes in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of study participant s 
or others.   Examples of corrective actions or substantive changes that might need to be considered in 
response to an unanticipated problem include:      
• changes to the research protocol initiated by [CONTACT_193480] s 
• modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified risks  
• implementation of additional procedures for monitoring study participant s  
• suspension of enrollment of new study participant s 
• suspension of research procedures in currently enrolled study participant s 
• modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks  
• provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled study participant s. 
Unanticipated problems will be recorded and reported throughout the study.  
9.2 Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Serious Adverse Events  
The study will comply with IRB and FDA reporting requirements and guidelines.  
9.2.2 Regulatory Reporting for Studies Not Conducted Under IND  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported to the University of Michigan IRB Med.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
22 9.2.3  Other Unanticipated Problems  
Incidents  or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the completion of an 
unanticipated problem report form.  OHRP recommends that investigators include the following 
information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an 
unanticipated problem to the IRB:  
• appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name, 
and the IRB project number;  
• a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an unanticipated problem;  
• a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. ” 
9.2.[ADDRESS_229997] (DSMB)  
The first DSMB meeting will occur one month after recruitment begins. In addition to reviewing Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs), the first DSMB meeting will focus on over all safety of the trial an d study agent 
and will make a determination as to whether or not the study should proceed.  The DSMB will then meet once every 6 months  throughout the remainder of the study and at any time during the study in which an 
unexpected and possibly related SAE occurs.  
The DSMB will be composed of the following members:  
 
Irene Sarosiek, MD : a Gastroenterologist and Professor of Medicine from the Division of Gastroenterology,

24 10 Statistical Considerations 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to investigate the dif ference in each of the outcomes 
among 4 different sessions. Tukey’s test will be used for study the differences in each of the 
measurements between two stimulation points (same stimulation parameters) and between two stimulation parameter sets (same stimulation points). The Pearson corre lation analysis will also 
be performed to investigate the correlation between each of HRV parameters and the pain score or sensation threshold  
. 10.1 Study Hypotheses  
TEA at acupoints ST36 (a point below the knee cap) or PC6 (a point in the wrist) will be effective in 
reducing abdominal pain induced by [CONTACT_193481]-C.  This hypothesis is based on 
published literature and our [CONTACT_193493]’s experience with EA and TEA at the Johns Hopkins.   [CONTACT_69763]’s previous experience with EA and TEA includes:  animal studies in which electrical acupuncture at 
ST36/PC was shown to reduce abdominal pain in a rodent model of IBS and functional dyspepsia and preliminary clinical study in patients with IBS -C showing the reduction of overall symptoms of IBS, 
including abdominal pain.   
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The study team plans for a 20% participant dropout or incompletion rate. For this reason, they will enroll 
25 study participants  when in actuality they need 20 study participants  to complete the study.  If 20 study 
participants  complete the study and there are still 5 active participants, the active participants will still 
complete the study.  
This is not a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the therapy for the treatment of IBS -C. Instead, this 
is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_193465] (4 different modalities and 1 placebo) is more effective 
in treating  abdominal pain in patients with IBS- C by [CONTACT_193482]’ sensation to rectal distention with 
different methods of treatment. The findings of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_193466] a future clinical trial. No preliminary data are available for the calculation of the sample size. The 
simple size stated in this study was based the PI’s experience in other neuromodulation studies  involving 
methodological optimization.   
10.2.1 Safety Review  
Study enrollment and/or study visits will halt to at if the study team feels the study is unsafe.  This would 
include if study participants  are experiencing serious adverse events. The DSMB will meet every 3 
months during the study enrollment/study visit period. If needed, the DSMB will meet more frequently to 
monitor the study.  
This is an acute study  involving 5 sessions on separate days.  No treatment or intervention will be given in 
between sessions.  
The risks involved in the study include rectal distention  (a clinically approval procedure)  and delivery of 
weak electrical current via skin surface electrodes. Any acute study session will be terminated if the patient is not tolerable to the procedure or decides to withdraw . If the safety is a concern, the remaining 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_229998] . The study enrollment wil l be halted if serious 
adverse events are reported.  
Safety out come measures will include 1) pain/discomfort level during rectal distention, 2) any si gns or 
symptoms of possible perforation or rupturing of the rectum during insertion of the rectal catheter and 
during rectal balloon distention, 3) any side effects due to weak electrical stimulation, such as rash or 
discomfort in the area of stimulation.  
10.2.2 Efficacy Review  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_193467].  
The study outcomes include rectal sensation and pain during rectal distention, autonomic functions 
noninvasively assessed from the ECG.   
10.3 Final Analysis Plan  
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to investigate the difference in each of the outcomes among different sessions. Tukey’s test will be used for study the differences in each of the measurements 
between two stimulation points (same stimulation parameters) and between two stimulation parameter 
sets (same stimulation points). The Pearson correlation analysis will also be performed to investigate the 
correlation between each of autonomic function parameters and the pain score or sensation threshold. 
11 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
 Only members of the study team will have access to source data.  This includes:  all information, original 
records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.   
 
12 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
• The study team will be present for each visit and follow the visit CRFs. The study team will go through the procedures  with the GI physiology lab staff members to ensure that there is adherence to the 
protocol.

 The study will be reviewed for IRB approval. The study will not begin until IRB approval is granted.  
13.3 Informed Consent Process   
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues  throughout the individual’s study participation.  Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of this therapy will be provided to the study participants and their families. Consent forms (written in non- technical language) describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and 
risks are given to the study participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
starting intervention/administering study product.  Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the study 
participant  will be asked to read and review the document.   Upon reviewing the document, the study team 
member  will explain the research study to the study participant  and answer any questions that may arise.  
The study participant  will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study.  The study participant s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with 
their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  The study participants may withdraw 
consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.   A copy of the informed consent document will be 
given to the study participants for their records.  The rights and welfare of the study participant s will be 
protected by [CONTACT_34693] . 
13.4 Exclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)  
This study will exclude women who are pregnant. This is for their safety  and the safety of their fetus(es) .   
The study also excludes children. This is because the population being studied are adults with IBS -C.

28 15 PUBLICATION POLICY  
Following completion of the study, the investigator is expected to publish the results of this research in a 
scientific journal.  The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have 
adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all clinical trials 
be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov *, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_118702].  Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies.  For grants and 
cooperative agreements, it is the Institution’s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable registry.   
In addition,  NIH Public Access Policy  r equires the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_193469] .  
T
he ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human study 
participant s to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause- and-effect relationship between a 
medical intervention and a health outcome.  Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study 
pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (e.g., Phase I trials), would be exempt from registering trials in a public 
registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

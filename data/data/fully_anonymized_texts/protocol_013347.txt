2. Introduction 
 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) rem ains the leading cause of death , disability, and healthcare 
expense in the [LOCATION_002] and is also a major medical proble m worldwide.  It is well known 
that elevated plasma levels of  cholesterol and triglyceride on lipoproteins are major risk 
factors for CVD.  Dietary lipid s by [CONTACT_909636] a profound 
effect on CVD risk. Unlike pro-athe rogenic saturated fatty acid s, numerous animal and human 
studies have shown that regular  consumption of unsaturated fish  oils have favorable effects on 
serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], as well as on endothelial function, inflammation,  thrombosis and arrhythmia.  
Most of these beneficial effect s have been attributed to omega- 3 fatty acids, such as the long 
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  eicosapentanoic (EPA, C20:4) and docosaehexanoic (DHA, 
C22:4)1,2.  Fish oils, however, also contain varying amounts of other un usual types of fatty 
acids that are not commonl y found in other food sources.  For e xample, oils derived from 
saury3, pollock4, capelin5, and sprats6, as well as from marine mammals, such as seals and 
whales7, are all enriched in long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (L CMUFA; i.e., C20:1 
and C22:1 isomers combined).  LCMUF A are defined as fatty acids  that are at least [ADDRESS_1277141] establis hed a link between o mega-3 fatty acid consumption and CVD 
protection also showed a possible be neficial role for LCMUFA in  promoting cardiovascular 
health8,9. Studies on the association betw een red blood cell fatty acid levels, a marker of fatty 
acid dietary consumption, and incid ent coronary artery disease in the Physician’s Health 
Study also showed a strong inverse association between LCMUFA c onsumption and CVD, 
even after adjusting for o mega-3 fatty acid levels10.  Recently, we showed in various mouse 
models11,12,13,14 that ingestion of LCMUFA lowers  total cholesterol and reduces 
atherosclerosis (Table 1).

 Saury fish (Cololabis adocetus) are widespread in the surface w aters of the Eastern Pacific 
and are considered to be a pelagic, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_909611] .  It is widely consumed in 
Asian countries, and unlike more commonly eaten fish, such as s ardines, which contain large 
amount of EPA (Table 2), Saury fish contains a very high level of LCMUFA, particularly 
20:1 n-11 (cis-9-eicosenoic acid  or gadoleic acid) and 22:1 n-1 1 (cis-9-cetoleic acid).  Except 
for one past study, which examined the effect of Saury fish con sumption on post-prandial 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_442093]15, no previous  studies have investigated the  effect of long-term 
supplementation of fish oil produ ced from Saury fish on plasma lipoproteins or other 
cardiovascular risk markers.

  [ADDRESS_1277144] approved a Qualified Health Claim for 
olive oil stating the followi ng: “Limited and not conclusive sc ientific evidence suggests that 
eating about 2 tablespoons (23 gram s) of olive oil daily may re duce the risk of coronary heart 
disease due to the monounsaturat ed fat in olive oil. To achieve  this possible benefit, olive oil 
has to replace a similar amount of  saturated fat and not increa se the total number of calories 
you eat in a day.” 21. 
  
      The mechanisms involved in phy siological effects of benef icial fatty acids, such as 
EPA, oleic acid and LCMUFA are  only partially understood. For e xample, Omega-3 fatty 
acids (EPA) are known to be natura l ligands of several nuclear receptors that regulate gene 
expression, including PPAR, hepatic  nuclear factor , liver X rec eptors, and retinoid X 
receptors.  They also alter expres sion of transcription factors , such as sterol regulatory 
element binding-protein and car bohydrate response element bindi ng-protein (ChREBP) 22, 
which may contribute to the physio logic effects of omega-3 fatt y acids on lipid metabolism 
and inflammation. Omega-9 fatty a cid, such as oleic acid, decre ase cholesterol ester transfer 
protein (CETP) levels, a protein m ediates the tr ansfer of chole steryl esters from HDL to 
apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins23. The isoenergetic replacem ent of a high-saturated 
fatty acid diet by a MUFA or a  high-carbohydrate low-fat diet h as been shown to decrease the 
CETP concentration in young, hea lthy, normolipi[INVESTIGATOR_772652]24. In animal studies, 
LCMUFA-rich diet improved the a dipocytokine profile, and result ed in favorable changes in 
triglycerides and LDL-C and in t he expression of several genes involved in glucose/lipid 
metabolism and inflammation (Fig. 1)11, 13, 14. The mechanism for the similar and differential 
effect of EPA, oleic acid and L CMUFA on LDL-C and other lipopro tein changes, however, is 
not fully understood nor whether these differences in lipoprote in metabolism relate to the 
pathogenesis of cardi ovascular disease.

omega-3 fatty acids, 400 mg of tot al MUFA, and 380 mg of oleic acid from the mixture of 
sardine fish oil and olive oil. Each capsule of LCMUFA-rich fis h oil (LCMUFA) contains at 
minimum 220 mg of omega-3 fa tty acid, 330 mg of total MUFA, and  240 mg of LCMUFA 
from saury fish oil.  
The participants will be instructed to take the supplements equ ivalent to a total of 
approximately 3g per day of omega -3 fatty acid, and 5g of total  MUFA in three divided doses 
(4 capsules, 3 times a day after meals in a total of 12 capsule s a day). The dosing is 
comparable with earlier c linical trials on fish oils21-25. They will also be advised to take the 
supplements after meals, as the y are better absorbed with fat.

8. Monitoring of Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of 
Subjects   
8.1  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107660] 
 A single epi[INVESTIGATOR_909616] 
 Moderate gastrointestinal symptom s that persists for more than [ADDRESS_1277156] wi th the investigator 
 Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
 Anaphylactic reaction due to cons umption of the fish oil supple ment

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_107659], M.D. Date: May 2, 2019  
Version: 5.0 (Amendment D) 
  18 
  New onset atrial fibrillation/flutter 
 Major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (CT CAE 4.0 grade III or IV) 
 Subjects taking irregular use of  fish oil capsules that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_909617]. 
 Any other severe symptoms relate d to the study and as determine d by [CONTACT_909643]. 
 Subjects who are found to be pregna nt or wish to breastfeed dur ing the study will 
automatically be withdrawn. A pregnancy screening will be done for all female volunteers at 
the first visit and subjects will be excluded from the study if  pregnant.  It is not known 
whether the oils used in this study are secreted in breast milk . It is therefore  not advisable for 
any breastfeeding woman to partic ipate in this study. However, if a subject becomes pregnant 
during this study, monitoring of the  pregnancy will continue un til conclusion of the 
pregnancy.   
 Unlikely but possible adverse eff ects of omega-3 supplements ma y include atrial 
fibrillation (risk less th an one in a hundred persons).
 Patients that develop symptoms of atrial 
fibrillation (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rapi d heart rate, fai nting, shortne ss of breath, etc.) will be instructed 
to visit the emergency room and s eek treatment immediately.  In  order to prevent any future 
events, participants with atrial fibrillation will be withdrawn  from the study.  Individuals that 
develop an allergy to fish or she llfish may experience an anaph ylactic reaction from the 
supplement and will also be instructed to visit the emergency r oom immediately and will also 
be withdrawn from the study (ris k believed to be less than one in a thousand persons not 
known to have fish or s hellfish allergy).  
9. Analysis of the Study 
The primary outcome measures of this study will be  differences  between randomized 
groups in differences between tre atment periods in changes from  baseline to end of period in 
the plasma total cholesterol. S econdary outcome measurements wi ll be changes in proteomics, 
lipoprotein particle number, HDL  functional test (i.e. efflux s tudy) composition and size. Each 
subject will serve as their own control.  
9.[ADDRESS_1277157] size of the LCMUFA-rich 
fish oil supplement for a possibl e future larger clinical trial . The sample size requested in this 
study is based on our experience on o ther studies, such as the Omega-3 Fish Oil study. We are 
requesting to enroll up to 100 subj ects to obtain 20* evaluable  subjects that complete the 
whole study, and will perform an interim analysis after [ADDRESS_1277158] completed both arms 
in the study. The proteomic an alysis makes this study practical  and innovative. Based on the 
information gathered from othe r studies and on the NHLBI proteo mics core experience, the 
analysis of ten subjects is a re alistic number to meet our scie ntific goals. The interim analysis

  19 
 will be performed only for proteomi c changes, and the magnitude  of proteomic change will 
result in the decision of study c ontinuation. This will allow u s to gather sufficient data to 
estimate changes that could justify a larger study. 
 
* evaluable subjects are subjects  that have compl eted the full time-line of the study (Figure 2) , have collected stool specime ns 
and thru the analysis of red cel l membrane omega-3 fatty acids (RCM) are found to have taken and absorbed the 
supplement.*   
9.2  Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be c alculated for all variables. A student’s t-test will be used to 
compare the difference in mean changes between the baseline and  the end of each arm period 
while accounting for period and group effects. Data of proteomi cs will be analyzed by [CONTACT_909644]’s t-test to identify prot eins with statistically signif icant (p < 0.05) changes in 
normalized spectral counts, and an at least 1.3~1.5-fold will b e considered as a 
physiologically meaningful change  to continue the study. The st udy will be stopped if the 
changes are not statistically sig nificant or the changes is sma ller than 1.3-fold.   
10. Human Subject Protection 
10.[ADDRESS_1277159] Selection 
 
Subjects of all genders will be c onsidered for inclusion in thi s study.  There will be no 
racial, ethnic, or gender discri mination.  Cognitively impaired  and institutionalized persons 
will not participate in this s tudy.  Criteria for exclusion or withdrawal from the study are 
based on the presence of other dis ease processes that may inter fere with the interpretation of 
our results or situat ions that may be harmful to the health of subjects. 
10.2     Rationale for the Exclusion of Children

The most common side effects of  fish oil include taste perversi on, and eructation (belching).  
Participants will be notified of t hese effects in the informed consent document. Any subject 
exhibiting symptoms such as pa lpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rapid heart rate, or shortness of breath will 
instructed to go to the emergenc y room immediately and be withd rawn from the study. 
Individuals with an unknown alle rgy to fish or s hellfish not di sclosed at screening may 
experience an anaphylactic react ion, which will also be instruc ted to go immediately to an 
emergency room and will require withdrawal from the study.  In rare cases, fish oil 
supplement can trigger allergic  reactions. Symptoms may include  difficulty breathing, 
swelling of the face, fever, or flu -like symptoms and a skin ra sh.  Some studies reported 
consumption of omega-3-fatty aci ds is associated with a prolong ation of bleeding time. 
However, the prolongation of bleed ing time has not been shown t o surpass normal limits and 
did not result in clinically s ignificant bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]33,34. Any  patient currently treated with 
an anticoagulant will be e xcluded from this study.  
 Oleic acid-rich olive oil, commercially available olive oil supplements have minimum risk to 
subjects.  
 
Blood Draw: Subjects may feel lightheaded o r dizzy after having blood drawn .  There may be 
pain at the vein puncture site  and a slight risk of bruising.  To minimize this risk,  the routine 
blood-drawing protocol will be fo llowed and pressure will be ap plied to the area. 
 
The protocol will follow the NIH  Clinical Center MAS policy M95 -9 guidelines for limits 
of blood drawn for research purpose in the Clinical Center. For  adults, no more than 10.5 
mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is sma ller, will be drawn for resear ch purposes over any 8-week 
period. 
 Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI): Inflation of blood pressure cuffs may cause 
transient discomfort. Subjects w ith fragile skin may suffer min or trauma (as per ABIs, related 
to usual BP measurements). This procedure involves the use of a  VaSera VS-1500N system; 
an FDA approved vascular screening system. 
 EKG:  Up to [ADDRESS_1277165]’s arms, legs and/or 
chest. Some skin irritation can occur where the electrodes are placed. Once the electrodes are 
placed, the test will begin. After  the test, the electrodes are  removed. The subject may have 
minor discomfort, similar to r emoving a bandage, when the elect rodes are removed. Rarely, a 
reaction to the electrode adhesive  may cause redness or swellin g where the patches were 
placed.

a. the research risks that are de scribed in the IRB-approved resea rch protocol and 
informed consent document; Invest igator’s Brochure or other stu dy documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subj ect population be ing studied; an d 
2. related or possibly related  to participation in t he research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than w as previously known or recogniz ed. 
 Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event :  An unanticipated problem that does 
not fit the definition of an adve rse event, but which may, in t he opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
involves risk to the subject, aff ect others in the research stu dy, or significantly impact the 
integrity of research data.  For e xample, report occurrences of  breaches of confidentiality, 
accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for stu dy drug.  This may be a 
protocol deviation(s) a nd/or non-compliance. 
 Reporting:  Serious UPs will be reported to t he IRB and Clinical Director a s soon as 
possible but not more than [ADDRESS_1277173]  been well tolerated and are 
unlikely to increase morbidity and mortality in subjects meetin g the inclusion criteria of the 
study. 
 
Protocol Monitoring   As per ICH-GCP 5.18 and 21 CFR 312.50 c linical protocols are re quired to be adequately 
monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. The  monitoring of this study wi ll be conducted by [CONTACT_405176] (CRAs)/Monitors employed by [CONTACT_909654]. The objectives of a moni toring visit will be: 1) to 
verify the existence of signed i nformed consent form (ICF) and documentation of the ICF 
process for each monitored subj ect; 2) to verify the prompt and  accurate recording of all 
monitored data points, and prompt  reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted 
information with individual subj ects’ records and source docume nts (subject’s charts, 
laboratory analyses and test res ults, physicians’ progress note s, nurses’ notes, and any other 
relevant original subject infor mation); and 4) to help ensure i nvestigators are in compliance 
with the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that 
regulatory requirements (Office fo r Human Research Protections- OHRP), FDA and 
applicable guidelines (ICH-GCP)  are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the

 16. APPENDIX A: NIH INFORMATION SHEET ON STAFF 
RESEARCH PARTICIPATION (April 2016) 
As an NIH employee, contractor, Special Volunteer, Guest Resear cher, or trainee, you may 
participate in intramural research studies unless it is prohibi ted by [CONTACT_107698] (IC), or if 
you are excluded by [CONTACT_909658] w ant to enroll. The inclusion of NIH 
staff in a particular protocol must also be approved by [CONTACT_1201] . You may be motivated by [CONTACT_107699], a 
commitment to research in your own or related fields, or want a ccess to clinical trials of potential 
direct therapeutic benefit. When deciding, you should make an i nformed decision about 
participation. This information sheet offers some points to con sider for NIH staff who are 
considering research participation at NIH.  
First, similar to any individual who is considering research pa rticipation, you should seek adequate 
information about the study pur pose, what is required of you in  terms of procedures, interventions and 
time, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. Fo r more information, see the NIH Clinical 
Center’s public website “Are Clinical Studies for You?” at http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/studies.shtml .  
When you are thinking about par ticipation in a research study t hat is being conducted by [CONTACT_284806], or others with whom you work closely in your labora tory, branch, or unit, you should 
consider some additional factors:  
A. Possible bias : Are you confident that you can be unbiased about reporting an swers, side effects, or 
other information that could influence the study outcome or ris k to you?  
B. Confidentiality : Has the principal investigator (PI) spoken about what informa tion will be 
collected from you as part of th e study? Has the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909634] w hat information will be available to 
those within, and outside, the study team? If applicable, are y ou comfortable sharing your medical 
history (including, for example , mental health history or STDs)  and your social history (e.g. substance 
use) with study investigators who may be your coworkers, or wit h the possibility of them discovering 
something about your health during the study (e.g. pregnancy st atus or a new diagnosis)? Although 
every effort will be made to pro tect your information and keep it private and confidential, your 
information may, depending on the nature of the protocol, becom e available in medical records or to 
authorized users outside of the study team. Discuss any concern s with the PI. 
 
C. Pressure : Do you perceive any pressure o r expectations from your superv isor or colleagues 
regarding participa tion? Could that pressure influence your dec ision or make it difficult for you to 
choose whether or not to participate? Remember that it is your choice whether or not to participate 
and that your decision to participate or not should not have an  effect, either beneficial or adverse, 
on your position at NIH.  
D. Time and Compensation : Can you take time off from work to complete the study require ments 
or participate solely during non- duty hours? Can you receive co mpensation for your participation in 
this study? Will your supervisor give you permission to partici pate during work hours? See the NIH 
Policy Manual 2300630-[ADDRESS_1277178] Policy for NIH Employees Partic ipating in NIH Medical Research 
Studies .

 E. Consent Process: Is the person obtaining your consent for the study your supervi sor, a subordinate, 
or co-worker? If so, is there an independent person monitoring the consent process? If the study PI [CONTACT_832] a 
supervisor and intends to obtain  consent from you, an independe nt person (e.g., through Bioethics or 
the NIMH Human Subjects Protections Unit [HSPU], or others as a pproved by [CONTACT_1201]) must monitor 
the consent process. If the person obtaining consent from you i s a co-worker then an independent 
person (e.g., through Bioethics or  the NIMH HSPU, or others as approved by [CONTACT_1201]) may be 
required to monitor the consent process, as determined by [CONTACT_941] I RB for the specific study.  
If you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinic al Center and you have any questions or 
concerns, please contact [CONTACT_167907] (OHSRP) at 301-402-
3444 and/ or the Patient Represen tative if you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinical 
Center on [PHONE_2331]. If you are at a NIH site outside the Cl inical Center then please contact [CONTACT_909659].

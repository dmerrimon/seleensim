Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 3 of 39   A. SPECIFIC AIMS Purpose: Elevated skin temperature after closure of a chronic ulcer is predictive of ulcer recurrence due to aberrant and persistent inflammation resulting in tissue destruction 1-3. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test a patient-directed self-monitoring/self-management intervention (MUSTCOOL) with respect to its ability to prevent recurrence of chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) while improving symptoms, physical activity, and quality of life. This will be achieved by: 1) monitoring newly healed ulcer skin temperature with a non-invasive hand-held dermal thermometer; and, 2) modifying the local skin environment (i.e., elevated temperature) by [CONTACT_548242] a cooling “pack” noted for its anti- inflammatory properties 4-6. Negative impact of chronic ulcers: Chronic ulcers affect 6.[ADDRESS_717670] ulcers of the legs and feet related to diabetes, vascular and/or neuropathic disorders. These ulcers represent a substantial portion of the health and cost burden of those chronic illnesses 7-9. For example, in 2008, the National Institute of General Medicine Sciences reported ~$[ADDRESS_717671] on physical activity and quality of  life 10,11. Dollar and human suffering costs are increased when ulcers become chronic and recalcitrant to treatment. Unfortunately, incidence and prevalence of leg and foot ulcers are expected to increase as a result of the growing aging population suffering with diabetes and obesity 12. High recurrence rates: VLUs and DLUs show extremely high recurrence rates: 70 – 96% of VLUs recur within 2 to 3 months of healing 13,14 while the five-year cumulative DFU recurrence rate is 66% 15,16. If even half of these recurrent ulcers could be prevented, $10 billion in savings on expenditures for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548217]. Our prevention intervention: Our prior research supported and refined MUSTCOOL, a self-management prevention model for VLUs (Drs. Kelechi & King) and DFUs (Drs. Bharara & Shibuya)2,3,17-19.  This collaborative team will extend MUSTCOOL’s ulcer prediction (monitor for elevated skin temperature) and prevention (cooling pack therapy) intervention by [CONTACT_548243] a chronic VLU or DFU three times weekly during the immediate and intermediate post healing remodeling phase (closure to 6 months) will prevent ulcer recurrence, reduce pain, enhance physical activity, and improve    quality of life. Specifically, for a skin temperature increase 2°F above baseline for two days in a row, a bolus dose of cooling for 5 consecutive days will be implemented. Enhancements to intervention: For this RCT, we have made several technical and methodological refinements to MUSTCOOL. First, we will use an extremely low cost infrared camera to map temperature gradients of the healed leg and foot skin to identify any “hot spot(s)” which will visualize overall tissue health and will be monitored by [CONTACT_548244].  Second, a user-friendly cooling pack (local cooling) will be used instead of the cuff (regional cooling) based on acceptability data from our ongoing RO1 study participants. Third, we will quantitatively measure physical activity using state of the art accelerometry. Finally, we will test a new data-driven temperature-monitoring schedule, targeting the skin of newly healed chronic ulcers that took longer than 12 weeks to heal. In 180 patients with a newly healed chronic ulcer, 90 patients will be randomized to receive the experimental cooling pack + standard of care (compression, elevation or footwear) or control placebo pack + standard of care to apply to the affected “hot spot” in the presence of elevated skin temperature.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_483731], VLU versus DFU (n=90 in each group).  During the 6-month study period, this trial aims to: 1. Test the MUSTCOOL intervention (cooling pack) compared to control group (placebo pack) on: outcome of incidence of ulcer recurrence; and, impact on pain, physical activity and quality of life.  
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 4 of 39   2. Assess the implementation self-management process measures including: a) appropriate use of thermometer, b) application of pack to the “hot spot” for 5 consecutive days for 30 minutes (fidelity to self-management), c) utilization of supportive reinforcement, d) reactions/satisfaction of participants, and e) staff ratings and perceptions for replicability.  Impact: Our preliminary data suggest significant improvements in health outcomes: a reduction in leg ulcer development, improved pain, and higher quality of life. However, analysis of monthly data from our ongoing RO1 has found a non-sustained reduction in skin temperature during [ADDRESS_717672] modified MUSTCOOL’s cooling delivery to be based on skin temperature elevation above an individual’s baseline and have participants prophylactically cool the affected skin at home under real-life conditions.  B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE This study addresses morbidity and quality of life issues with a very challenging population with chronic ulcers. It addresses an RFA priority, the purpose of which is to test a self-monitoring/management strategy that can be implemented in community settings, chiefly the home.  Chronic ulcers cause pain and suffering, negatively affecting physical activity and quality of life. Populations with chronic ulcers, such as individuals with chronic venous disease, and/or diabetes and/or neuropathy have major life-style issues.  They are often obese and plagued with multiple co-morbid conditions such as hypertension and arthritis.  Many have experienced multiple ulcers in their lifetimes that take months, even years to heal. Additionally they are physically inactive leading to significant mobility problems 11. Chronic ulcer patients who are physically inactive suffer disproportionately; many experience prolonged ulcer healing and other complications such as amputations 16. They are physically de-conditioned, some able to take only a few steps at a time, are much less active, have poor balance, slower walkers, and experience pain 20,21. Our MUSTCOOL leg and foot ulcer prevention intervention, while a self-care approach, may be viewed by [CONTACT_548245] a means by [CONTACT_548246]. Unfortunately they are poor candidates for surgical or pharmacologic intervention due the severity of the disease process or co- morbidities, or they have failed these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_548218].  C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES We have conducted and published preliminary work in the area of pain and physical activity. First, we developed a conditioning activities for lower leg function (CALF) intervention combined   with a behavioral component, motivational enhancement communication (MECALF), delivered by [CONTACT_548247]. It was found to be feasible and acceptable by [CONTACT_444223] 22. Signals of significance were found in leg function, in particular in pain reduction (p = 0.04) in the lower legs of leg and foot ulcer patients over the course of the six-week study compared to patients who received an exercise handout only. Secondly, in another study, the CALF intervention was delivered by a exercise sciences coach through online face-to-face Internet sessions via Skype® and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in ankle dorsiflexion and leg strength (both p = 0.03) 23. Patients had a history of leg ulcers and participated in three daily doses of CALF. The face-to-face Internet interactions were feasible, even for patients who lived in subsidized housing. While the goal of this study was to test the feasibility of the physical activity program, we observed a very high level of patient satisfaction with being able to initiate contact [CONTACT_548248]® and signals of efficacy in improvement in function even with small daily doses. Finally, in a recent randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of two offloading modalities for diabetic foot ulcer healing we demonstrated the need for objective physical activity assessment ([CONTACT_548295], manuscript in progress). Our data suggest while walking may delay healing, unprotected standing may be an even more unrealized and sinister culprit for 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 5 of 39   chronic non-healing ulcers and recurring ulcers in individuals with diabetes.  The remodeling phase of healing (final repair process) of chronic ulcers is prolonged, has inflammatory components, and elevated skin temperature. Healing normally proceeds through four programmed stages: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. The remodeling phase overlaps with other phases of wound healing and is highly regulated by [CONTACT_548249] 24. In acute wounds, wound healing progress requires precise integration of multiple physiology events including cell migration, cell infiltration, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition 25. In chronic non-healing ulcers, however, defective remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to prolonged inflammation is observed 25. Factors intrinsic to underlying metabolic disease, such as diabetic hyperglycemia, or increased hydrostatic pressure associated with venous disease, can enhance and perpetuate the inflammatory response 26. Studies have shown differences in cellular infiltration and extracellular matrix composition of chronic diabetic and venous ulcers versus acute wounds 27. These non-healing wounds fail to progress through the normal phases of wound repair, instead, they remain in a chronic inflammatory state characterized by [CONTACT_548250]-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-b, IL-  1, IL-6, and TNF-α 26,27. Furthermore, studies in diabetic transgenic mice also indicate that prolonged persistence of neutrophils and macrophages during the late phase of repair impairs wound healing 28. The persistence of inflammatory cells promotes an inflammatory environment and stimulates the production of tissue-degrading proteinases 29. It has been hypothesized in many studies that such an excessive or prolonged inflammatory response results in increased tissue injury and that an unbalanced inflammatory response may continue after the tissue has closed 30-33.  This is particularly notable in chronic ulcers after closure 34-36 as evidenced by [CONTACT_548251] 37.  Drs. Bharara’s and Kelechi’s science underpi[INVESTIGATOR_548219] 2,17  and leg 38  in “remission” could provide insights into the remodeling phase of ulcer healing. Preliminary work: Our science has advanced the field by [CONTACT_1541] a mechanism by [CONTACT_548252]. This proposed study builds on the landmark research of skin temperature elevation’s measurement suitability in predicting diabetic/neuropathic foot ulcers after healing in high-risk patients 1,39-41.  [CONTACT_187293] has demonstrated temperature elevation in  lower leg skin inflamed by [CONTACT_548253] 3,42. Drs. Bharara and Shibuya continue to advance the field in diabetic foot ulcer populations by [CONTACT_548254].  Taken together, our work in the field over the past [ADDRESS_717673] demonstrated that infrared and thermal technologies are well established as validated and reliable instruments to measure skin temperature of chronically inflamed skin 44-50  and skin affected by [CONTACT_145037], such as neuropathy 51,52.  1.1. Cooling (cryotherapy) reduces tissue metabolism and prevents tissue destruction, thus has the potential to prevent leg and foot ulcer recurrence. While the specific physiological mechanisms associated with cooling chronically inflamed skin are poorly understood, cooling causes an initial vasoconstriction in skin blood vessels, which results in decreased local blood flow to the area. Cooling also prevents localized fluid leakage from the microcirculation and thus reduces inflammation (i.e., edema, redness, eczema). Used for centuries as a treatment modality for musculoskeletal injuries and acute inflammatory conditions 53  cryotherapy reduces the metabolic rate of tissue, and impedes the destruction of otherwise uninjured adjacent tissue by [CONTACT_548255] 54. It has been shown to prevent diabetic foot ulcers from becoming inflamed 55. Skin heats up before it breaks down (skin temperature is increased by [CONTACT_3450] 1.8 C in venous-affected skin and spi[INVESTIGATOR_548220]) 38, and 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 6 of 39   prophylactically cooling a focal or localized area of affected skin reduces the risk of skin changes and ulceration by [CONTACT_548256], vessel permeability and tissue metabolism 55. Preliminary work. The preliminary findings from our cryotherapy R21 suggested a signal of efficacy in reducing tissue metabolism (blood flow), pain reduction and ulcer prevention 19. Cooling the skin significantly reduced blood flow on average by 6 perfusion units (PU), from 15 to 9 PU (normal is 3 – 5 PU) after four weeks of cooling 18. We also found that vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow can persist for greater than one hour after removal of cryotherapy, even in the presence of skin rewarming at room air 56.  We developed this proposed study’s protocol based on principles of heat transfer, microcirculatory thermoregulation, studies of cryotherapy and healthy skin, and pathophysiologic mechanisms of venous disorders, supplemented with consultation with [CONTACT_548296], and additional preliminary work conducted post R21.In regards to pain, cryotherapy offers an analgesic effect that can be realized within [ADDRESS_717674] the efficacy of a sequenced cooling regimen over a 9-month period for patients with venous disease, damaged skin and/or a history of healed venous ulcers. The ongoing study is evaluating efficacy on pain, ulcer occurrence and quality of life (in year 4).  While we are in the last year of the study and will analyze data to determine  outcomes on ulcer prevention, first month data (§Figure 1) suggest that an initial acute daily cooling regimen, compared to a placebo, demonstrated a clinically, but no statistically significant difference in skin temperatures measured daily (cyrotherapy cuff treatment + leg elevation versus  placebo cuff + leg elevation.)  There was a non-significant trend towards lower skin temperatures in both groups.  These  findings suggest that an acute cooling  period is  unnecessary and that a reduced frequency (three times weekly for 30 minutes based on our preliminary data) could be adequate as a maintenance dose to keep the skin temperature “in check”.  These findings are further supported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bharara’s inflammation proof of concept work in diabetes [ADDRESS_717675].

These centers and practices serve a large proportion of urban and rural residing, racially and ethnically diverse patients with leg and foot ulcers. The study will be conducted at the Research Nexus (CTSA) on the campus of the Medical University of South Carolina, at the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System’s Wound Healing Center, and at East Carolina University, NC.   D.5 Sample eligibility criteria: English speaking adults age 18 years-of-age or older with a healed VLU or DFU will be invited to participate (§Table 2).

Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717679]. Kelechi’s experience as the director of recruitment of MUSCs CTSA, we expect to enroll [ADDRESS_717680] for every 5 approached and screened (#1 reason for not enrolling is an abnormal ankle brachial index). The goal is to enroll ~6 subjects per month for 3 1/2 years, accounting for an expected attrition rate of ~25% (nature of the chronically-ill population with frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]).  Our recruitment plan includes referrals from centers and practices (25% of subjects will be referred). However we anticipate using other recruitment methods that we have found particularly successful including television, radio and billboard advertisements, use of our CTSA’s SCResearch.org website, and our community based participatory research advisory groups. At MUSC, a chart review will be conducted for the identification of potentially eligible patients per the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and recruitment purposes. Potentially eligible patients, that have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_548259]. All other identified patients will be initially approached and contact[CONTACT_548260], if the provider feels the study is appropriate.  Additionally, we will create an online REDCap survey that will be accessible through a PI [INVESTIGATOR_548221]-page (https://www.musc.edu/nursing/initiatives/researchoffice/currently_active_studies.htm) on MUSC secure servers that will allow potentially eligible individuals to self-prescreen through yes/no questioning and have the researchers contact [CONTACT_548261]. We have budgeted for these strategies accordingly, based on our current experience with our ongoing R01. There is a need to incentivize center and practice referrals and to that end, we will provide $20 for every enrolled participant in the form of a “credit” gift card that can be used for whatever purposes deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_517533]. We also have implemented a very successful contingency management approach for retention at one of   our study sites (a drawing from a fish bowl at each visit with the opportunity to win from $1 to $100). The attrition rate for this site is ~17% compared to 30% (average of other sites’ attrition rates).  We will include this same strategy in the proposal study.  D.7 Randomization, masking and allocation concealment: A permuted block randomization  strategy developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mueller will be used to assign newly healed VLU and DFU patients to treatment or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_548262], VLU or DFU. The research assistants, PI [INVESTIGATOR_548222] (masked) to treatment assignment. To minimize the likelihood that the mask will be broken, e.g., the next treatment assignment can be guessed, the block size will be varied. At baseline, a research assistant will consent, determine eligibility, enroll, collect baseline data, (i.e., demographics, physical activity, pain and quality of life), instruct participants on treatment procedures and provide all study supplies, except for the pack. Both groups will receive identical instructions via a 3-minute videotape shown during the baseline visit. They will complete a 5-item verbal test to demonstrate understanding of procedures. To ensure allocation concealment, after the participant has been successfully instructed on the protocol (100% passing on test), another researcher will randomize participants within the study REDCap database to receive the cooling pack treatment or placebo, and will give the appropriate pack to the participants. Researchers conducting study visits, collecting measures and performing data entry will remain blinded to treatment during return visits 1 – 4.  D.[ADDRESS_717681] 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717682] >90% power to detect a difference in proportions with an odds ratio for recurrence of VLU/DFU of 3.0, assuming 25% of subjects experiencing a recurrent ulcer in the cooling group compared to 25% in the placebo group,   = 0.05 (Type I error rate), two-sided test. To account for drop-out immediately after randomization, and the dilution effect of intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we inflate the sample size by 25% to obtain a final sample size of 120 subjects randomized to each group (N=240) for ITT analysis. For the analysis of continuous efficacy outcome measures (change from baseline in quality of life and pain) we will have 85% power to detect a difference of 0.45 s between the groups assuming   = 0.05 (Type I error rate), two sided; independent sample t-test comparison of means; equality of variance between groups. Based on our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_548223]-cooling to leg elevation short term this effect size is equivalent of a raw effect size of 1.3 units on the VEINES Quality of Life scale (assuming s=2.8) and a raw effect size of 1.1 units on the visual analog pain scale (assuming s=2.5). D.9 Protocol Aim 1: Test the MUSTCOOL intervention (cooling pack) compared to control group (placebo pack) on: outcome of incidence of ulcer recurrence; and, impact on pain, physical activity and quality of life. Intervention components – The self-monitoring and self-management strategies in the MUSTCOOL intervention are identical for both groups. The only difference is the material composition used in the placebo is developed from cotton. Participants will agree to standard of care: VLU will wear compression stockings and DFU will wear diabetic footwear. Pre-intervention temperature mappi[INVESTIGATOR_548224] “hot spots”.  After participants are enrolled, the skin site of the recently healed VLU or DLU will be imaged (photographed) with an infrared camera (Scout® by [CONTACT_548263], Indianapolis, IN) by [CONTACT_3462]. These thermal images and participant data (including: subject ID#, skin thermal characteristics, and study visit date) will be instantaneously uploaded via the internet and stored on WoundVision’s HIPAA compliant secure servers. Images will be taken at baseline, months 1, 3 and 6.  The “hot spot” or area that has the highest temperature reading will be marked with a dermal ink pen, the site where participants will take daily skin temperatures at home. They will be instructed to remark the same spot each day or after bathing/showering. We will track whether the marked “hot spots” have changed in size or location. Camera software analyzes % change in Benchmarks for success: surface area that will be compared at each study visit. The affected skin of the cooling patch group, compared to the placebo, will have smaller and fewer “hot spots” at each visit and at the end of the study.  In accordance with HHS OHRP Guidance on Engagement of Institutions in Human Subject Research B(7) (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/engage08.html) WoundVision will not be considered engaged in human subject research as they will be unable to readily ascertain the identity of participants from the data they will be hosting (subject ID#, skin thermal characteristics, and study visit date) from each of the participating sites. WoundVision will not have access to any keys that link subject names and/or address, telephone numbers etc. to their study ID#. MUSC and WoundVision LLC will enter in a service agreement for the provision of data hosting services and protection of data confidentiality. At the end of the study WoundVision will provide the MUSC researchers with a copy of all study data, and delete all hosted study data from their HIPAA compliant secure servers. Self-monitoring with infrared thermometer. Participants in both groups will be instructed to self-monitor the marked “hot spot” daily prior to getting out of bed in the morning with a non-contact [CONTACT_548264] (IRT730K, General Tools & Instruments, NY, NY ) (§Table 2). The thermometer has a laser pointer that targets the marked area and automatically stores the last 100 readings for recall.  The handle of the thermometer has a “trigger” that when pulled, emits a laser beam at the marked spot and when released, records the temperature. The thermometer will be programmed at the second visit to automatically sound an 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 11 of 39   alarm when the temperature rises 2°F above the mean temperature. The mean will be calculated by [CONTACT_548265] [ADDRESS_717683] with an attached pen at the start of the study. This “back up” log will be available in the event of a mechanical error with the thermometer. It is also a reliability/validity measure of participant self-report which may be important to future dissemination studies.   Self-management with cooling pack – Participants in both groups will apply the pack (cooling or placebo) at a consistent time each day (e.g. 7 PM) to the affected leg or foot skin “hot spot”, both prophylactically (maintenance) and preventatively (bolus dosing) (§Table 2). The rationale for using cooling packs compared to cuffs or wraps is based on exit interview comments from participant experiences in our ongoing cyrotherapy R01 in which a lower leg cooling cuff (regional cooling of the lower leg) was used. Some of the user comments include: “I felt cold all over when using the cuff”, “why do we need to cool so much skin when it’s just that one area that has the problem?”, “that cuff was too heavy and weighed down my leg”, and “the nurse worked so hard to make it fit but it didn’t feel right on my leg”. In response, the proposed study will use readily available small packs, applied only locally (versus regionally) to the “hot spot” on the leg or foot (§Table 3 for refinements to study protocol). The topi[INVESTIGATOR_548225] (Therapy Pack, Elastogel, Southwest Technologies, Kansas City, MO) to be used in the cooling treatment group is a flexible glycerin-based sheet hydrogel that does not freeze to a solid state and is available in various sizes.  We have conducted extensive safety testing of the material prior to our previously conducted R21 and have had no adverse events (e.g., skin injury) reported during the R21 and the ongoing cryotherapy R01. The placebo pack has a cotton filing (manufactured by [CONTACT_548266] R01). Both packs have the same feel and look and are covered with a protective polyethylene covering that can be laundered. Both packs will be stored in the      freezer (will give subjects freezer thermometers to make sure freezer temperature is maintained at 0°F) and  will be applied to the affected site only.  Once removed from the freezer, the placebo pack warms to room temperature within [ADDRESS_717684] the date and times they apply the packs to the skin (three times each week for maintenance and 5 consecutive days for bolus dosing) on the “back up” log.        There are two approaches to the self-management strategy (§Table 3): Maintenance prophylactic dosing: Participants in both groups will be instructed to apply the pack to the affected skin site of the previously healed ulcer three times each week for 30 minutes with both legs elevated on pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (we will show the proper height during participant instruction). In preliminary data analysis from our ongoing R01, this dosing regimen has been found to be safe and acceptable.  We cannot fully analyze our R01 data to determine outcomes on ulcer prevention until the study is completed.

Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 12 of 39    Bolus preventative dosing: If the temperature is 2°F above the mean temperature, calculated as the average of the first 30 days of cooling, for 2 consecutive days, an alarm will sound from the thermometer, and participants in both groups will be instructed to initiate the bolus cooling dose for 30 minutes over 5 consecutive days. They will resume the maintenance cooling 3 days later. Benchmarks for success: The cooling pack group compared to the placebo will required fewer preventative bolus dosages over the course of the 6-month study.  Participant instructions: We will develop a 3-minute YouTube video and DVD of study procedures (self monitoring, self management) that will be shown to participants during the baseline visit in order to standardize the instruction.  This technique was rated as highly useful by [CONTACT_548267] R01. An example of instructions includes showing how the pack should be applied directly to the leg or foot affected skin, anchored with retention net, while reclining in a recumbent position with both legs elevated. The flow of information for both groups is as follows: • Wear the compression stockings and/or diabetic footwear during the day. • Measure skin temperature of marked “hot spot” with the infrared thermometer each morning before getting out of bed to control for the effects of diurnal patterns, eating, drinking caffeinated or alcohol- containing beverages, and exercise, which influence skin temperature during the day. Thermometer, “back up” log sheet and clipboard with pen will be provided. • Apply the pack (cooling or placebo) to the lower leg or foot skin and anchor with stretchy net at a consistent time each day (e.g., 7 PM). Participants in the control group will be instructed to remove the pack from the freezer and use after it has been exposed to room air for 2 minutes. The pack material (cotton) is unable to retain the cold. • Lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_548226] [ADDRESS_717685] difficulty with the supi[INVESTIGATOR_548227], use pi[INVESTIGATOR_548228]. • After the treatment, participants will place packs in accompanying plastic storage bag and return to the freezer. Freezer temperature should be set at 0°C, the industry standard. All participants will receive a freezer thermometer to make sure temperatures are kept at 0°C. If returning the pack to the freezer immediately after cooling the leg or foot is difficult for participants who prefer to do the procedure in the bed, they can replace the pack the next morning without affecting its temperature, which requires 4 hours in the freezer to achieve maximum coldness. Freezer thermometer will be provided. • If bolus preventative cooling dose is required, participants will do the treatment (cooling and placebo) for [ADDRESS_717686] dates on “back up” log. • Re-mark the skin site with the dermal pen (provided) after bathing or showering. • Wear wrist accelerometer each day during waking hours to monitor physical activity. Benchmarks for success: Both groups will score 100% correct on the 5-item post-test administered after the instruction.  Outcome measures for Aim 1: Incidence of leg ulcers - we will track any ulcers that develop during the course of the study using supportive phone calls, logs and participant reports during return visits at months 1, 3 and 6.  These data will be entered into REDCap. During month 1, supportive phone calls will be made weekly and then monthly by [CONTACT_21171], who will inquire about new ulcer development. Leg and foot skin will be assessed during each visit.  Participants will be instructed to call the research assistant in the event an 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717687] of cooling on ulcers is unknown and could pose a safety risk. Benchmarks for success: Although it is difficult to precisely predict the effect of cooling on ulcer incidence during the study in these two groups, we view a 50% reduction in the incidence of a leg ulcer in the cooling pack group compared to placebo 7,9.  Impact on pain, physical activity and quality of life – pain will be assessed using a visual  analog scale (0.99 interrater reliability) 63  and the Brief Pain Inventory (Cronbach’s 0.88) 64, physical activity with an accelerometer (Basis Smart Watch, Basis Science, Inc., San Francisco), a user-friendly activity monitor  http://www.mybasis.com/and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (pooled Spearman R 0.81) 65, and quality of life with the VEINES QOL/sym Questionnaire (internal consistency 0.87; test-retest reliability 0.86) 66, the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) (internal consistency 0.82), the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the SF-[ADDRESS_717688] accurate in terms of energy expenditure, we are working with an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_548229]-type accelerometer sensors found  in (i.e.,Bodymedia Fit, and Fitbit Zip), may not be feasible. Thus, we have selected a wrist accelerometer based on data that suggest this design may be better suited for chronic populations; results revealed acceptable agreement between the Basis watch and indirect calorimetry found in hip sensors 67. Basis captures resting movements, is less easy to misplace/lose than hip accelerometers, has multiple-sized wrist bands, and numerous programmability options. These three outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and months 1, 3 and 6. Benchmarks for success: Compared to the placebo group, the cooling pack group will have lower pain scores (lower VAS and IPAQ scores), increased physical activity (e.g., more steps taken and participates more frequently in activities,  and higher ratings on the SF-12), and improved quality of life (higher ratings on VEINES or NPQ, and GDS).  Analysis plan for Aim 1 The primary efficacy outcomes are recurrence of ulcers, both venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, since enrollment into the study (categorical), and changes in pain, quality of life and physical activity from baseline to the three subsequent visits at 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_717689]-baseline (continuous). In primary analysis we will compare differences in proportions of participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a VLU/DFU over the entire study period between the cooling pack and placebo groups using chi-square analysis. We will obtain odds ratios for the categorical outcome measure recurrence of VLU/DFU adjusted for putative covariables such as demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, job category and area of residence) and clinical (time since last ulcer, and wearing compression stockings or footwear [yes/no]) characteristics using logistic regression modeling (LRM). Modeling will be carried out in a sequential fashion. For example a first model will contain recurrence of VLU/DFU (yes/no) as response variable, treatment (cooling vs, placebo) as primary variable of interest and time since last ulcer as adjustment variable. The model will be further adjusted using sets of putative predictive covariables such as demographic and clinical characteristics as well as secondary outcomes pain, quality of life and physical activity (step counts). We will examine effect modifications of covariables through inclusion of a covariable-by-treatment interaction term in the multivariable models. Analyses will be repeated within the ulcer subgroups (VLU and DFU) as appropriate.  Survival distributions for recurrence of VLU/DFU will be obtained for each group using the Kaplan-Meier 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717690] 63, 64, 65. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (PHM) will be used with time since last ulcer to recurrence of new ulcer as the dependent variable and treatment (cooling vs. placebo) as the primary independent variable. Additional covariables and interaction terms will be added as described above for LRM analyses.  In analysis of the continuous efficacy outcome measures, we will compare unadjusted mean differences in pain and quality of life total scores from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months via paired t-tests (or equivalently non- parametric Wilcoxon Signed-rank test) between the (cooling vs. placebo) groups. We will use a general linear models (GLM) approach to compare mean differences for the change from baseline outcome measures adjusted for putative predictive covariables. Modeling will be carried out in a sequential fashion for each outcome variable individually analogous to the modeling described above. Using quality of life as example, the first model will contain change in quality of life from baseline to 6 months as response variable, treatment (cooling vs. placebo) as primary variable of interest and baseline quality of life as adjustment variable. This procedure will be repeated for pain measures as well as the accelerometer step counts/physical activities. For the accelerometer, baseline will be established by [CONTACT_548257] 30 daily step counts/activities; change from baseline will be assessed at 6 months as described above.  In additional analyses, to examine pain (or analogous quality of life and step counts) change over time, the longitudinal profile of pain (quality of life, step counts) will be compared over the active treatment period using mixed effects models (MEM) analyses. These analyses will estimate the average change in pain (quality of life, step counts) within each group (cooling vs. placebo) and individual change in pain (quality of life, step counts) for each participant. MEM analyses allow for missing data, measurement of study subjects at different time points during the study, and time varying covariates. MEM can also take into account the effect of clustering, i.e. correlation of repeated pain (quality of life, step counts) measurements within one subject. The efficacy variable pain (quality of life, step counts) will be used as the dependent variable with treatment status (cooling vs. placebo), time (visit) and time-by-treatment interaction as primary independent variables. In a second step, additional covariables will be included in the models to adjust for putative predictive variables such as demographic and clinical characteristics as well as secondary outcomes as appropriate. Effect modifications of covariables will be examined through inclusion of a covariable-by-treatment interaction term in the multivariable models. MEM methods (e.g., generalized linear mixed models, GLMM) for binary, count, or ordinal outcomes will be applied where appropriate. Further, we will determine frequency distributions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs for the two groups and compare proportions within categories of AEs for cooling vs. placebo via chi-square analyses.  Methods for handling missing data: The research staff will make every attempt to keep participants in the study and to obtain required measurements in order to ensure the completeness of the study data. If study visits are missed to minimize potential bias due to missing observations, participants will be contact[CONTACT_548268]. Participation will only be terminated due to developi[INVESTIGATOR_548230] (we will continue to monitor via phone calls), safety reasons, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. Several approaches to handle missing data in the ITT analysis set will be employed. For the primary categorical outcome recurrence of venous leg or diabetic foot ulcer every attempt will be made to obtain information from participants who dropped from the study. If a participant’s status for recurrence of VLU/DFU’s cannot be established we will carry out sensitivity analysis, i.e. assign “developed a VLU/DFU” to all participants with missing information (worst case) and compare the results of this 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 15 of 39   analysis to the complete analysis (including only participants with complete information for the primary outcome variable). For continuous variables using a single end-of-study value (e.g. change from baseline), multiple imputation methods will be used. For analyses of longitudinal outcome data, we will use longitudinal methods (e.g. mixed models) that are capable to deal with missing data.  Aim 2: Assess the implementation self-management process measures including: a) appropriate use of thermometer, b) application of pack to the “hot spot” for 5 consecutive days for 30 minutes (fidelity to self-management), c) utilization of supportive reinforcement, d) reactions/satisfaction of participants, and e) staff ratings and perceptions for replicability. Process and fidelity model: Our energetic interdisciplinary team has significant experience with rigorous process standards that will be enacted to educate participants in the protocol, provide reinforcement, and monitor fidelity, adherence and satisfaction with the treatment protocol in our highly supportive CTSA environment. We have created a feasibility/fidelity model 68,69  for our previous studies that also includes: recruitment, reach, retention, adherence, documentation, satisfaction, drop-out proportions, safety, and side effects. These will be collected by [CONTACT_548269]: a) Use of thermometer and b.) pack application: Participant treatment forms/checklist. These forms have been designed to assist participants to implement the intervention according to directions.  The forms will undergo cognitive pre-testing and revision early in the award period prior to their use. These forms will help investigators answer the following questions: What was adherence to the protocol by [CONTACT_3038]? What were the challenges and problems to adherence? The design includes check-boxes for missed applications and reasons to discourage lack of disclosure for lapses. We are cognizant of potential bias due to social desirability. During the instructional session research assistants will stress the need for participants to be honest, rather then feel they cannot report lapses in adherence.   c.) Reinforcement and d.) participant reactions: Retention telephone, email, and in-person reinforcement logs. Contact [CONTACT_548270]. Contact [CONTACT_548271] (§C.6.) or emails will also be used to determine whether there  are difficulties with adherence, the presence of any side effects, safety, tolerability, comfort, concerns about the study, or problems with the disease process. Data pertinent to the operations of the trial, participant follow up, and the selection of the efficacy outcomes and measures will be evaluated during the treatment phases and at the conclusion of this study. Retention strategies include phone contact [CONTACT_548272]. After completion of the intervention and control protocols, participants will be asked to complete a brief report form as part of the exit interviews by [CONTACT_548273]. This survey will assess their views of the ease or difficulty with the treatment, as well as their satisfaction. Participants will be asked what did or did not meet their expectations and asked for suggestions on what could be done better if the study were redone. Participants will be asked about visits to physicians or other providers during the study and asked to report if the study was discussed with them.  e.) Staff observation:  Rating logs and scale. [CONTACT_187293] and the project director will observe 10% of the participant education sessions on the treatment protocol to monitor fidelity to the participant visit protocols (screening, enrollment protocol, and DVD instruction conducted by [CONTACT_21171]).  Other: Participant identification, recruitment, reach and attrition logs. These logs will be kept   using standardized forms completed by [CONTACT_21171]. These logs will be used to track the 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717691]. Kelechi and the study coordinator will routinely check logs for completeness and follow-up, with additional orientation as needed if issues with participant identification and recruitment arise.  We will also assess reach (e.g., how far away does participant live from study site, how did he/she learn about the study).  Data management logs. These logs will assess feasibility problems and document reasons for incomplete instrumentation and missing data.  Aim 2 analysis:  To assess feasibility/fidelity study outcomes we will report the number of contacts with participants through telephone and email, the proportion who terminate the study early (drop-outs), proportion who are adherent to the study protocol, and proportion who report issues with tolerability and are satisfied with the treatment. Participants will complete a researcher developed exit end-of-study satisfaction survey at the final visit. Differences of fidelity outcomes will be compared between the two groups using chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate (or equivalent non-parametric methods).  Data collection time points:  There will be four study visits at which time study personnel will collect data on both participant groups. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_548231].  Baseline visit  - demographic information (i.e., age, race, gender, co-morbid conditions, body mass index, number of previous ulcers, length of healing time, location, medications taken) and questionnaires on pain, physical activity and quality of life will be collected, affected leg or foot skin at the site of the newly healed ulcer to identify the “hot spot” will be imaged, procedural instructions for using the accelerometer given, protocol for self monitoring of temperature and self management of temperature elevation will be shown via DVD and written instructions given, and a test will be administered to assess understanding.  Similar to our other studies, we will produce a YouTube video and take-home DVD of these instructions for standardization. Supplies include: thermometer, pack and freezer bag (given by [CONTACT_548274]) to be kept in freezer at all times except during treatment, a freezer thermometer to ensure temperatures are kept at O°F, skin marker, study logs and clipboard with attached pen for recording daily temperatures/maintenance and bolus cooling (times, dates)/freezer temperature, and timer (for 30 minutes of cooling). Baseline questionnaires to be administered include: VAS, BPI, IPAQ, SF-12, GDS, and the VEINES Qol or NPQ (as applicable).  Visit 1 – (month 1) - the daily month 1 temperature readings taken over 28 – 31 days (depending on the month) with the thermometer will be downloaded using a software program and averaged to establish the mean skin temperature.  These data will be recorded in REDCap. The infrared thermometer will be programmed to sound an alarm when the readings are 2°F above the mean. Also at this visit the skin site will be imaged with the infrared camera and uploaded for comparison against the baseline reading. Data will also be uploaded from the accelerometer to assess physical activity. Any changes in demographics such as taking new medications will be evaluated, and the pain scales will be administered. Process measures will be collected including ease of use of thermometer, problems with study procedures, and fidelity to self-monitoring assessed (e.g., through downloaded temperature readings). Visit 1 questionnaires to be administered include: VAS, BPI, IPAQ, and the VEINES Qol or NPQ (as applicable).  Visit 2 – (month 3) – the daily months 2 and 3 temperature measurements and accelerometer 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 17 of 39   information will be downloaded, the skin site imaged, and demographic (i.e., changes in co-morbid conditions, new medications taken) and pain questionnaires administered. Process measures will be collected. Visit 2 questionnaires to be administered include: VAS, BPI, IPAQ, and the VEINES Qol or NPQ (as applicable).  Visit 3 – (month 6 final visit) – the daily months 4 – 6 temperature measurements and accelerometer information will be downloaded, the skin site imaged, demographic, pain and quality of life questionnaires administered. Process measures will be collected. Visit 3 questionnaires to be administered include: VAS, BPI, IPAQ, SF-12, GDS, and the VEINES Qol or NPQ (as applicable). During this final visit, an exit satisfaction survey interview will be conducted to ascertain information about overall feasibility, problems encountered, satisfaction, recommendations for changes to procedures, likelihood of maintaining/sustaining.  Ongoing supportive phone calls: Calls will be made to both groups 24 hours after the start of the study, weekly during weeks 1 – 4, and then monthly by [CONTACT_21171]. We will provide reinforcement of study procedures, solicit information about problems encountered, adherence, side effects, and leg temperatures and answer any questions (§Table 4).  Study staff:  We will elicit feedback using a rating scale we have developed for our ongoing R01 that assesses the perceptions of staff, their beliefs regarding the sustainability of the intervention, likelihood of implementation into practice, and dissemination potential.  Relevant literature in support of or in disagreement with the potential results on pain: We have elucidated the literature in support of monitoring and managing skin temperature, and our preliminary work with physical activity suggests a possible benefit (§Significance). The literature is replete with the beneficial effects of cooling injured tissue after acute trauma, orthopedic procedures, and dermatological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], however, less is known about the analgesic effects of cooling the skin on chronic ulcer pain 58,70-72,  and in particular, about pain reduction of newly healed skin after prolonged healing. We are collecting data in our ongoing R01 to determine if cooling reduces pain, but are unable to analyze the data until the study is completed.  If cooling provides pain relief, it may also positively influence physical activity and quality of life.  Unfortunately, there is limited research to suggest reduced pain/discomfort from cooling previously ulcerated skin positively influences physical activity and quality of life in chronic populations. This study seeks to establish this role.  Timeline: Table 4 illustrated the time line for study activities.

Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717692] and overall potential problems: In response to RFA-NR-15-001 Chronic Wounds:   Advancing the Science from Prevention to Healing (R01), this study will elucidate the impact of cooling newly healed chronic venous leg and diabetic foot ulcers. Results of several studies, published in a meta-analysis 73, provide evidence that increased skin temperature predicts foot ulcers in patients with diabetes. Our research findings suggest increases in lower leg skin predicts VLUs 3.  We have studied self-monitoring skin temperature using hand-held infrared thermometers. These patient-centered approaches have received considerable attention over the past 20 years for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers 2,61 and for the monitoring of venous leg ulcer-affected skin 3,42,43,50.  This study will further progress skin temperature’s role in the self-management to prevent ulcer recurrence. We recognize that there are unmodifiable risk factors for ulcer recurrence such as diabetes, cardiac disease and older age 74, however, we emphasize that this study addresses a modifiable risk factor, persistent inflammation in the remodeling phase of healing. An efficacious cooling intervention that could reduce ulcer recurrence by 50% will reduce unnecessary health care utilization by [CONTACT_548275] $10 billion.  Safety: There have been no reported adverse events associated with our cooling treatment. We do recognize that some patients experience neuropathic-type pain (i.e., burning, tingling) and will be cognizant of the potential for the cooling therapy to exacerbate these symptoms. Usability: The thermometer selected for this study has a memory and thus, we predict that   keepi[INVESTIGATOR_548232].  We will also assess acceptability of the accelerometer for physical activity monitoring. We will ask participants to record temperatures on logs in the event of a malfunction. Our experience with clinical trials, and in particular, being able to refine our study procedures for this trial, has allowed us to scrutinize our protocols to reduce the potential for unanticipated problems. Retention: We will compensate participants $250, will offer a successful contingency management plan that includes drawings for additional compensation, and will conduct frequent supportive phone calls.   Our long-term goal is to offer an innovative and feasible clinical practice approach for the management of   newly healed chronic VLUs and DFUs that are at high risk of ulcer recurrence.  Prevention of these complications in a highly challenged population could result in less recurrence, fewer days lost from work, less use of pain medications, and improvements in physical activity and quality of life.  E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS Participants, [ADDRESS_717693] be   able to communicate in English. The study will include both genders and to ensure diversity, participants from various racial backgrounds representative of the area (~30% black/African-American, ~70% white, ~1% Hispanic/ /other) will be invited to participate. There are minimal risks for injury related to MUSTCOOL. There have been no reports of skin injury associated with the cryotherapy (cooling) intervention used in our ongoing R01, which is the same intervention that will be used in this proposed study to reduce inflammation (skin temperature). We have taken more precautions regarding avoidance of frostbite or other cooling related injuries (e.g. skin irritation) by [CONTACT_548276], from regional (cuff applied to entire lower leg) to only a small, localized area of the foot or lower leg. Participants will be instructed to report symptoms such as tingling, prickling, and other sensations if noted during cooling. The informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability forms assure confidentiality of all information obtained during the study. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any effect on the care they will receive in the future. Informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_396510], will be obtained by [CONTACT_548277].  E.1. RISKS TO THE SUBJECTS 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717694] the preventive cooling intervention applied to newly healed skin of healed venous leg and diabetic foot ulcers. The goal is to prevent leg or foot ulcer recurrence. We will invite potentially eligible individuals to participate after screening them for adequate blood flow using an ankle brachial index (ABI). The healed area will be imaged with an infrared camera to capture a skin temperature “map” of the affected skin. Participants will then self-monitor the skin temperature of the highest area or “hot spot” with an infrared thermometer daily at home and apply a cooling or placebo pack (self-management) to the affected area for 30 minutes, three times each week. If an elevation is noted above baseline, they will apply the pack using a bolus-dosing regimen for 5 consecutive days. The study will be conducted over 6 months and require 4 visits including baseline, then months 1, 3 and 6. At each study visit, participants will complete the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) instrument. Participants with Total GDS scores greater than “5” (suggestive of depression) will be provided with 3 referrals to local area mental health care providers by [CONTACT_464]. Study staff will document the referral process in the participant’s REDCap study eCRF. Process and safety monitoring data will be ascertained during weekly phone calls during the first month, then monthly. We will also inquire about safety and tolerability during phone calls and during study visits to include adherence (fidelity), side effects, comfort, and any other problems noted during the study. Both groups (cooling pack and placebo), during the baseline visit after eligibility is determined, will watch a DVD for the sole purpose of standardizing the instructions they receive. Participants will then be quizzed on their knowledge of the study procedures, and will demonstrate self-monitoring with the thermometer, self-managing skin temperature elevation with the pack, when to report problems, and the frequency of return visits. Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table  Total Planned Enrollment: 180  TARGETED/PLANNED ENROLLMENT: Number of Subjects Ethnic Category Sex/Gender Females Males Total Hispanic or Latino 1 1 2 Not Hispanic or Latino 107 71 178 Ethnic Category: Total of All Subjects* 180 Racial Categories  American Indian/Alaska Native 0 0 0 Asian 0 0 0 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 0 0 0 Black or African American 31 21 52 White 77 51 23 Racial Categories: Total of All Subjects* [ADDRESS_717695] Characteristics. Eligible men and women, 18 years of age and above will be approached, invited to participate, and screened to recruit a sample size of 180; 90 participants with venous leg ulcers will be randomized to receive the cooling pack or placebo and 90 participants with diabetic foot ulcers will be randomized to receive the cooling pack or placebo. The health status description of the population is based on the PIs previous experience with study participants from 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 20 of 39   previous studies and the demographics of South Carolina. It is anticipated that 95% will have at least one co-morbid chronic condition such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or arthritis, and approximately 60% will be obese. It is anticipated that the average age of the population will be 68 years old, 60% female, 40% male. We anticipate< 1% of the population will be Hispanic, 30% black/African American, ~70% white, which reflects the ethnic make-up of the recruitment area. We will include English speaking individuals only due to limited resources and the special needs of bilingual and culturally relevant protocol/materials. We will include individuals with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Those with vascular conditions such as peripheral arterial disease will be excluded.  INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES Women and underrepresented minorities will be included in the study within the available population.  Although in this study race/ethnicity is not believed to have a direct impact on any of the research aims, special efforts will be made to recruit eligible underrepresented minority participants. The sites from which we will recruit participants have been selected because the underrepresented minority patient populations are 50% or higher. In the investigator’s preliminary studies, minority participation ranged from 30–80%, and equal numbers of men and women, both black and white were easily recruited for inclusion. Due to the seasonal work issues related to the Hispanic population, it is anticipated that ~1% of the patient pool will be recruited for this study. The latest U.S. Census Bureau figures show that 15.1% of rural Americans are living in poverty. The national average is 13.2%.  The poverty rate in South Carolina is 17.0%. INCLUSION OF CHILDREN Although vascular disorders appear as early as the first decade of life, venous leg and diabetic ulcers rarely occur in children, and therefore, children under 18 will not be recruited.  E.1.b. Sources of Materials. Materials obtained from the human participants include demographic data, circulation status (ABI), skin temperature mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], physical activity with an accelerometer, and   questionnaires that will be recorded in an electronic documentation web-based data management system (REDCap), from laptop/tablet computers. In the event of a failure to access REDCap, paper source documents have been created. All paper data will then be entered into the system as soon as possible. These documents will then be stored in the PIs office in a locked file. Demographic data about gender, age, ethnicity and pertinent medical history will be collected from the participants by [CONTACT_6270]-report in order to describe the sample. These data will be used for research purposes only. REDCap is password protected and will only be accessible to select members of the research team, including the PI, project director and biostatistician.  E.1c. Potential Risks. After informed consent is obtained, screening data collected, and eligibility established, [ADDRESS_717696] to remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_73414] 20 minutes during the study to ascertain the ABI.

Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717697]. Kelechi’s experience as the director of recruitment of MUSCs CTSA, we expect to enroll [ADDRESS_717698] for every 5 approached and screened (#1 reason for not enrolling is an abnormal ankle brachial index). The goal is to enroll ~6 subjects per month for 3 1/2 years, accounting for an expected attrition rate of ~25% (nature of the chronically-ill population with frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]).  Our recruitment plan includes referrals from centers and practices (50% of participant will be referred), however we anticipate using other recruitment methods that we have found particularly successful including television, radio and billboard advertisements, use of our CTSA’s SCResearch.org website, and our community based participatory research advisory groups. We have budgeted for these strategies accordingly. There is a need to incentivize center and practice referrals and to that end, we will provide $20 for every enrolled participant in the form of a “credit” gift card that can be used for whatever purposes deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_517533]. Retention: We also have implemented a very successful contingency management approach for retention at one of our study sites (a drawing from a bowl at each visit with the opportunity to win from $1 to $100). The attrition rate for this site is ~17% compared to 30% (average of other sites’ attrition rates).  We will provide packets of information about the study to referral sources that will provide information about calling a designated number to learn more about the study. Our study team will contact [CONTACT_220792], discuss study details, and if interest is expressed in participating in the study, and the baseline study visit appointment will be arranged. The study will be conducted at the Research Nexus (CTSA) at MUSC, the Spartanburg Wound and Healing Center, and at East Carolina University. We will visit the referral sites on a regular basis to evaluate participant identification strategies and to assess the potential for selection bias.

Protection Against Risk In the event of an unexpected medical or other event, the patient will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_17033]. Based on the experience of the PI, it is anticipated that the risk of adverse events (AEs) will be acceptably very low. In the event of an AE, it will be recorded, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450600], and submitted to the IRB according to institutional procedures. All AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_548233]. Maximum efforts will be undertaken to ensure the safety of all participants. Study personnel will receive extensive training and orientation on procedures and protocols. Participants will be instructed on how to access the PI [INVESTIGATOR_548234] a study-related question. In the event of study-related illness or injury, participants will be instructed on how to access health care. Although we do not anticipate any problems, we will address any that might arise such as reports of uncomfortable sensations in the leg or foot during or after pack application or the development of new leg or foot ulcers. This information will be recorded and if deemed as an AE by [CONTACT_5051], institutional procedures will be followed for reporting them. An order from the primary health provider is not required for participation in this study as there is oversight by [CONTACT_88003], [CONTACT_8675] and [CONTACT_548297] at the Research Nexus. The accelerometer used to measure activity is small and does not pose any problems with being anchored to clothing.  Safety and side effects. There has been considerable attention given to the selection the cooling pack used   in this study. We have refined the protocol, as noted in the overview to cool less surface area, targeting the “hot spot” only. We have taken precautions to use a cooling approach that does not aggressively or quickly reduce skin temperature, rather, the material used in the gel wrap does not freeze into a solid state, thus does not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_548235]. It is also enclosed in two polyethylene covers to prevent sticking to the skin. The pack will be anchored with a stretchy net “tubing” that can be pulled onto the foot or lower leg. In the event that the participant falls asleep or forgets to remove the pack during the procedure, the pack does not continue to transfer heat from the skin after approximately 15 minutes. There are minimal risks for injury to the skin using the methods of measuring skin temperature with the thermometer.  E.3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  Conditioning the lower legs may improve some of the symptoms associated with leg ulcers such as pain and discomfort. The use of the accelerometer and Smartphone for providing patient feedback and giving reminders, involves patients in their own care and may help them feel empowered to reduce the negative effects of having a chronic disease. The long-term effects of having better conditioned lower legs may provide protection for ulcer relapse in high risk groups of patients, and could lead to greater health improvements if the potential to engage in more aerobic forms of physical activity is reached. This study involves minimal risk as a non- invasive study. The benefits outweigh the slight inconvenience to the patient in terms of anticipated new knowledge gained from the study. 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717701] an intervention that could potentially improve outcomes in participants vulnerable to lower leg and foot ulcer recurrence. The science of using infrared technology has led to advancements in ulcer prevention measures for both venous and foot ulcer participants.  Non-pharmacotherapeutics (i.e., sequential compression devices, temperature mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) have contributed to significant improvements in self-management of venous disease and diabetic foot complications. However, there has been little attention directed toward ulcer prevention strategies for chronic ulcer recurrence that incorporate an intervention that includes patient self-managing of signals of tissue damage such as inflammation. We propose to “re-invent” an old, yet effective cooling method that has negated the effects of inflammation associated with acute tissue injuries. This simple, inexpensive method, using a small pack, could improve current guideline-guided usual care by [CONTACT_548279], using maintenance cooling, and then bolus doses for elevations noted outside of the baseline “normal” temperature. This approach is novel in that it targets newly healed chronic ulcers. Finally, if the intervention is valid and reliable in this high-risk ulcer population, we envision our strategy will become a mainstream practice standard for the prevention of ulcer recurrence in the future.   
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717702] SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan) The study has a well-developed DSMP that has undergone NIH/NINR SRG review and approval.

An application will be submitted to the MUSC IRB if/when this project is approved and funded by [CONTACT_4289]/NINR. Assurances include the following safety-related agreements, signed and dated by [CONTACT_978]. 3) Protecting Confidentiality of Participant Data Participant Screening and Enrollment. All data from participants screened for the study will be entered into electronic study database. Designated research staff will collect, gather, and enter required data (written informed consent, HIPAA Authorization, medical history and demographics) onto study data forms. Screened patients who do not meet study eligibility will have specific screening data entered into the study database. The collected data will be helpful in examining the patient population and feasibility of enrollment criteria and will include gender, age, race and reason for exclusion. All dates will be shifted and other Personal Health Information (PHI) will be removed from the study database upon study completion. All data obtained from this 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 27 of 39   study will be used for research purposes only and will comply with Federal HIPAA regulations.  Master Screening and Enrollment Logs will be maintained by [CONTACT_548282] [INVESTIGATOR_199889]. Case Report Forms. All proposed study specific case report forms (source documents) for data collection will be designed by [CONTACT_548283] [INVESTIGATOR_187225], and transferred by [CONTACT_548284] (eCRFs) for use in the study’s REDCap database. These study specific eCRFs source documents (study logs for correspondence, contact [CONTACT_187279], compensation and other forms such as pre-eligibility screens) will be coded by [CONTACT_2299]’s unique study ID# for all data collected including study instruments will be maintained in the participant research record and/or their electronic medical record that will be made accessible to study monitors. Completed instruments that require signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a paper CRF will be scanned and uploaded into the study database to all for remote electronic safety monitoring as well as maintained on file in accordance with MUSC policies and applicable Federal Regulations for the Conduct of Human Participant Research.  Binders. The PM will prepare and maintain a participant-specific binder for each participant containing all non-eCRFs records. A regulatory file will also be maintained to include the IRB-approved Protocol, original Informed Consent documents, HIPAA forms and other study-related regulatory documents. All paper research records and CRFs will be maintained in a locked file cabinet, stored in a room for research files that is accessible only via a password protected entry system that features security cameras, within the College of Nursing. Access to the research records, study database and PHI’s will be restricted to study personnel as approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187212]. As with all studies conducted at MUSC, this study is also eligible for a random audit by [CONTACT_187266]. Data Processing. This study will use Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for data capture and management. REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for the electronic collection and management of research and clinical trials data. REDCap provides secure, web-based, flexible applications, including real-time validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of data entry. Exports are made available for several statistical packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Excel. The study-specific REDCap electronic database will be designed and developed by [CONTACT_548285].  The provision of REDCap is made available through the South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research (SCTR) Institute at MUSC with NIH Grant awards UL1RR029882 and UL1TR000062.  Data Security. Ensuring data security, compliance with [ADDRESS_717705] Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure a high level of data security while coordinating electronic and paper data management activities for clinical research trials. The REDCap study database will be hosted in the Biomedical Informatics secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on campus, and includes firewall, redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The secure data center has strict access control; only authorized core personnel may access the facility un-escorted. Only authorized users are allowed to connect to the network, and the security of the network is actively monitored.  Power and environmental controls have several layers of backups, from interruptible power supplies to alternate and redundant feeds to the local utility company. The REDCap system administrator contributes to the maintenance of institutional disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  Load balancers and a highly fault tolerant SAN infrastructure contribute to high availability.  The REDCap system itself has several additional layers of protection including password protection. Access to the data and its security is managed institutionally by [CONTACT_187267] a Shibboleth login with an MUSC issued NetID and features a user account management filter that controls who can access the data and to what degree. All personnel must pass an employment background check before being issued an ID. Password complexity, history and expi[INVESTIGATOR_187213]. Access to individual REDCap projects and their data is managed by [CONTACT_187268]. All transactions are securely delivered to the application using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL – SHA-1 with RSA Encryption; 2048-
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 28 of 39   bits). It is then transmitted internally (behind the firewall) to the database server. All transactions are logged at the server layer (httpd logging), application layers (REDCap logs activity to a database table), and the database layer, using both query and binary logging. This feature provides audit trails for all changes, queries, data exports and reports. MUSC Information security policies are available at: https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/security/policy/  Data Entry. Only MUSC IRB approved study personnel that are authorized to have access to the REDCap study database will be granted password access. Study personnel using computers that are connected to the Internet will directly enter data into the remotely housed database. As such, no electronic study data will be stored on hardrives and/or any portable electronic devices. Additionally, all personnel with access to the database will have current University of Miami CITI training in the Conduct of Human Subject Protections, and their respective institution’s HIPAA and Information Security trainings that are completed annually. Each participant will be assigned a unique study identifier, all PHIs will be masked, and data exports will be limited to the PI, the PM and the BS for generating reports and the conduct of statistical data analysis. Data Monitoring. Ongoing quality control procedures will be implemented for data collection, storage and processing. The PM will conduct monthly monitoring of the study database and generate a report for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163633]. Standing agenda items for these meetings will include participant recruitment and retention, AE’s, protocol deviations, data integrity and overall study conduct. The PM will work to resolve and validate discrepant data. Discrepancies that warrant clarification will be sent to appropriate parties for review and resolution. All data entry and changes made in the study database by [CONTACT_187269], and provide a transparent visible audit trail for reviewers.  SECTION C.  Procedures for Identifying, Reviewing and Reporting Adverse Events 1) Identifying. Potential minimum risks identified for participants are outlined in the Protection of Human Participants and will also be outlined in the IRB-approved informed consent document. Additional unknown risks may occur and, if so, will be identified through diligent monitoring by [CONTACT_548286]. During the informed consent process, participants will be advised of the potential minimum risks of participation as identified in the IRB-approved informed consent document and reminded throughout the study that the researchers should be promptly informed about any concerns regarding potential side effects, adverse events, or clinical deterioration. Participants will also be instructed to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designee of any suspected adverse events immediately if possible. Throughout the course of study enrollment, at each study visit, the researchers will elicit information about experienced AEs and monitor participant progress. The PM will maintain an electronic record of all reported adverse events and notify the PM and SP of all reportable events as they occur. The SP will have real-time access to the study database to review and monitor all SAEs that were reported as related to the intervention. The PM will generate and provide de-identified semi-annual administrative human participant safety reports for the DSMC to review participant progress, accrual and attrition rates. Additionally, the BS will generate semi-annual safety reports for the DSMC to provide for the monitoring of the frequency of all reported side effects and AEs. 2) Reviewing. Adverse events will be assessed and evaluated by [CONTACT_548287]’s IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/research/ori/irb/HRPP/HRPP%20Guide%20Section%204.7: • Expected/Anticipated—Identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. 
    
Version 10.0          07/23/18   Page 29 of 39   • Unexpected/Unanticipated—Not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. • More Prevalent—Occurs more frequently than anticipated or at a higher prevalence than expected. • Serious—Results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187227], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, cancer, overdose, or causes a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The relationship of adverse events to study participation will be determined by [CONTACT_187283]: • Unrelated—There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been  caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention. • Possibly Related—The adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device, or  intervention, however there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of this possibility. • Related—There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention. 3) Reporting. All reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems experienced by [CONTACT_187272]/NINR and MUSC IRB in compliance with their Adverse Event Reporting Policy requirements, using the IRB's password protected on-line secure server adverse event reporting system. Within 24 hours after a reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem has been reported by [CONTACT_2299], it will be initially graded by [CONTACT_187273], forwarded to the study’s SP for review and approval, and then will be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187218]. The Institutional Official(s) will review the event and discuss the report with the IRB Chair and the Director of the Office of Research Integrity. After IRB review and acknowledgement, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187219], and the PM will forward a copy of the reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem and IRB acknowledgement letter to the NIH/NINR Program Officer through MUSC’s OSRP. The activities will be reported to the NIH/NINR within 72hrs. In addition, all cumulative reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems included in the ISM reports will be submitted to the NIH/NINR in the PI’s Annual Progress Reports. 4) Examples of Potential Reportable Adverse Events: In accordance with MUSC IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy, an AE is reportable is it meets all of the following criteria: 1) is unexpected 2) is related and/or possibly related, and 3) is serious and/or suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized. Additionally, per MUSC’s policy all participant deaths, protocol deviations, complaints about the research, and breaches of confidentiality are reportable events. From our previous work among this comorbid population, an example of an AE would be the appearance of edema of the lower extremities that is related to the participant’s underlying chronic venous insufficiency. Depending on the severity, the possible steps to be taken include referral to a medical provider, and/or withdrawing the participant from the study and inviting him or her to restart after acute symptoms subside. An example of an SAE would be the death of a participant from acute renal failure, which although would be viewed as unexpected and unrelated to the intervention is nonetheless a reportable serious event. No further steps would be taken except to review, grade and report the event to all applicable agencies. An example of an unanticipated problem would be the participant strains his or her back while taking their temperature of the ulcer “hot spot”. The steps in this case would be to withdraw the participant from the study and invite him or her to restart the study after the strain has resolved. These events and problems will be reported in accordance with the IRB and NIH/NINR policy as noted in Section C.3.  
    
Version 10.0          07/23/[ADDRESS_717706] to the risk benefit ratio study and/or safety of study participants.  SECTION F. Interim Analysis Based upon our prior extensive research in this field among this same population and the minimal risk associated with the intervention, there is no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_401930]. Accordingly, interim futility analysis will not be performed. However, the BS and PM will generate semi-annual qualitative interim analysis reports on a) adverse events; and b) data obtained during phone call and returned end-of-study surveys to understand issues related to the uptake, usability, and adoption of the cooling protocol among this population. We will evaluate the screening and enrollment procedures, barriers to participation and retention, including, safety, adherence, acceptability, technology problems (thermometer malfunction) encountered if any, and user feedback from the participants. The information gained from this structured process will inform the design for an implementation/dissemination study aimed to facilitate the use a leg and foot ulcer prediction/prevention standard of care.

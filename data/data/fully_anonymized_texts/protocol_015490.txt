 2 Study Title: Leveraging Home Health Aides to Improve Outcomes in Heart Failure: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_781543]: Madeline Sterling, MD, MPH, MS Funder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (K23HL15060)  VNS HEALTH – Research Protocol  Background: Heart failure (HF) affects 6 million people in the U.S. and costs over 30 billion dollars per year. There are 1 million HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22331], and 25% of Medicare beneficiaries admitted for HF are readmitted within [ADDRESS_1074570] had mixed results, perhaps in part because they did not involve home health aides (HHAs). After a HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a third of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged home with home care services, which may include support from HHAs. Unlike physicians or visiting nurses, HHAs are with patients on a near-daily basis, sometimes up to 24 hours per day. However, my prior qualitative research suggests that HHAs do not receive HF-specific education and are not confident caring for HF patients. In addition, my prior work has shown that HHAs experience difficulty reaching their supervising nurses (at their home care agencies) when they have questions or need help managing patients in the home. As a result, HHAs often resort to calling 9-1-1 and subsequently bringing their patients to the emergency department (ED). While some ED visits may be clinically appropriate, many may be avoidable. Interventions that can optimize and improve the experience of HHAs caring for the HF patients have the potential to improve HHAs own self-efficacy but also patient outcomes.   To that end, we have developed a HF intervention for HHAs comprised of a) remote classroom education on HF and b) an mHealth app containing HF educational content and a messaging application that connects HHAs and their nurse supervisors. This intervention requires feasibility testing, as well as preliminary testing of its acceptability and effectiveness among HHAs.   Study Purpose and Specific Aims: To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) of the intervention among HHAs caring for adults admitted to home care with a primary diagnosis of HF, to determine its feasibility and its effect on HHAs (HF knowledge and caregiving self-efficacy), and to explore its effect on HF patient outcomes (ED visits and 30-day readmissions). If successful, the result of this project will be a novel and scalable intervention that has the potential to improve HHAs’ ability to care for HF patients and reduce ED visits and 30-day readmissions.  Study Design: PI [INVESTIGATOR_781544] a 2-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_781545]’s licensed home care agency (Partner’s in Care) under the guidance of [CONTACT_241976] (VNS Health-Site PI) and Margaret McDonald, MSW(VNS Health-Co-I) and leaders at Partners in Care. [CONTACT_528582] ([CONTACT_471705]’s Primary mentor at Weill Cornell Medicine, expert in pragmatic clinical trials), [CONTACT_603404] ([CONTACT_471705]’s Co-mentor at Weill Cornell, expert in care coordination, including measuring the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve care coordination) will guide her throughout the study. In addition, [CONTACT_781589] (adviser in health technology) will advise her. Over a two-year period, 104 HHAs will be enrolled in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_17371] 52 will be randomly assigned to the enhanced usual care arm (HF training course alone) and 52 to the intervention arm (HF training course plus mHealth app [Partner’s in Care’s Care Connect 
 3 app with new features]). Four nurses will also be recruited to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Because withholding education from the control arm is not favorable to HHAs and since educational interventions alone are unlikely to affect outcomes, we will not have a usual care arm. Each HHA will be followed for [ADDRESS_1074571] or penalize hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781546]. A VNS Health staff member will help coordinate the trial and attend team meetings, assuring that the agency’s priorities are integrated. The study will occur in a 24-month period.    An overview of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_781547]. After being consented, all HHAs will attend a virtual orientation session and virtual HF training course. Prior to the course, all HHAs will complete a baseline questionnaire (see attached survey document) and be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (T1). The training course will be conducted via Zoom and led by [CONTACT_781557]. After taking the course, HHAs in both arms will take a short post-course questionnaire (to assess the two primary outcomes; knowledge and HF caregiving self-efficacy). HHAs randomized to the enhanced usual care arm will receive a just-in-time course refresher via their Care Connect app (self-driven educational content) prior to caring for their HF patient. HHAs randomized to the intervention will receive a just-in-time course refresher as well as an app training session from a Weill Cornell Medicine research assistant (overseen by [CONTACT_781558], PhD in computer science). HHAs in this arm will be encouraged to use the app when they have questions about their patient, want to access HF-related content, or need to communicate with the nurse. To reinforce their use of the use of the application chat features, they will receive “do not reply” text based notifications reminding them that the feature is there and can be used. Following the care of their first patient, HHAs in both arms will take a follow-up questionnaire. Each HHA will be involved in the study for 90 days. During that time, if the HHA is assigned to a new HF patient, they can continue participation although they will remain randomized to their original treatment arm to avoid contamination. De-identified data on HF patients cared for by [CONTACT_781559] (demographics, clinical conditions, ED visits; 30-day/90-day readmissions; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; functional status; and quality of life) will be retrospectively collected by [CONTACT_781560]/referral data and OASIS. HHAs will receive $100 for participating; they will receive $25 at trial start, $25 following the completion of the heart failure training course and survey 2, $25 following the 45-day (mid-study) interview, and $[ADDRESS_1074572] efficient use of their time; it is also more feasible since we do not plan to collect additional data from nurses (demographics, outcomes, etc.,). As such, it was felt there would not be a need to build a separate e-consent project in REDCap for the electronic consent of nurses, nor will this be feasible within our allocated staff time. Nurses in the trial will respond to alerts and messages from HHAs using the app. Nurses will also receive an orientation to the Care Connect messaging features prior to the start of the trial from the WCM/Cornell Tech team. At the end of the trial, nurses will receive $100 for participating.   
 4   Evaluation and Outcome Measures: There are three main outcomes for this study:  1) Feasibility 2) Acceptability 3) Effectiveness  To assess feasibility we will assess: the reach of the intervention by [CONTACT_781561]; the effectiveness through baseline and follow-up assessments; the adoption by [CONTACT_781562] (both arms), participated in app orientation session (intervention arm), and completed the trial (both arms); the implementation through intervention fidelity (mHealth app usage, educational content accessed [both arms], Care Connect messaging with nurses [intervention arm], underlying reasons for Care Connect messaging between HHAs and nurses [intervention arm]). This feasibility data will be extracted from the mHealth app by [CONTACT_781563] (lead, Mike Gelman) and [CONTACT_781589]. Acceptability will be assessed with exit interviews with HHAs, nurses, and agency staff from both trial arms. Additional exit interviews will be conducted with a subset of patients from both trial arms. Effectiveness will be assessed for two primary outcomes: 1) HF knowledge; 2) HF caregiving self-efficacy and two secondary outcomes: 1) job satisfaction and 2) intention to leave (See Table). Patient outcomes (ED visits; 30-day/90-day readmissions; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; functional status; and quality of life) will be assessed in exploratory analyses (See Table 1).     1:1 RandomizationEnhanced Usual Care (N = 52)Training courseIntervention (N =52)Training course +mHealth AppCompleted (N = )T1: 0 days Home Health Aide

The questionnaire will be completed online using a link provided by [CONTACT_781564] (REDCap), a web-based, secure, data storage program at Weill Cornell Medicine (see document attached). Nurses will not complete a survey. A sub-set of participants (HHAs, nurses, patients) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_781550] [ADDRESS_1074578] a $[ADDRESS_1074579] for the patient to the VNS Health researcher for distribution to patients for their participation in the interview.   Procedures for Recruiting Study Subjects: The VNS Health staff member will screen HHAs for eligibility and contact [CONTACT_781565] a pre-written script (see recruitment template). This will be done over the phone, where participants will provide an initial verbal consent. Additionally, the VNS Health staff member may reach out via email or text according to the aide's preferences, to potential aides to invite them to in person informational sessions about the study. In a post-Covid era, this may be an important mechanism to engage and educate potential participants. The goals of these information sharing dinners are two-fold; 1. To introduce the study team and the rationale behind the study, as well as to provide information about study logistics 2. To enhance comradery among the workforce, which has been hit particularly hard during Covid (social isolation, increased risk to personal health, etc.) An email invite will be used to communicate with potential study aides about the event. Attending this event will in no way constitute consent or intent to participate in the study, it will strictly function as a means of sharing information with potential study participants. If following verbal consent by [CONTACT_781566]-person information providing event the aides are found to be eligible and agreeable, the HHA will provide electronic informed consent via REDCap when they attend the trial orientation session.

In order to participate, you must: be a home health aide at Partners in Care with more than [ADDRESS_1074582] is voluntary.   Important Information about the Research Study   

 11 Things you should know:  • The purpose of the study is to improve the experience of home health aides (like you) who care for adults with heart failure.   • This study will test how well a program designed for home health aides will work. The program has three parts. The first part is a heart failure training course, the second part is a mHealth app with information about heart failure that you learned from the course, and the third part is a messaging tool within the mHealth app.  • If you choose to be in this study, you will be asked to do an orientation session and a heart failure training course. The orientation session and the heart failure training course will take place on video via Zoom. You may also be asked to use a mHealth app (your Care Connect app) in addition to the heart failure training course. Our goal is to find out if these things help you understand heart failure and make it easier for you to communicate with your supervising nurse, while caring for your client with heart failure. • We do not expect any risks from this research.   • We cannot be sure that you will receive any direct benefits from this study. • You will be given $100 after finishing the study.  • Taking part in this research project is voluntary. You don’t have to participate and  you can stop at any time.  Please take time to read this entire form and ask questions before deciding whether to take part in this research project.  What is the study about and why are we doing it?   The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention among home health aides caring for adults admitted to home care with a primary diagnosis of heart failure at VNSHealth’s Partners in Care. We hope to explore the interventions’ effect on your own heart failure knowledge and confidence caring for clients, as well as on the client’s overall health (visits to the emergency department and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394]).   Our goal for this project is to determine if the intervention improves your ability to care for heart failure clients and in doing so, improves clients’ overall health.      What will happen if you take part in this study?  
 12  If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to participate in a heart failure training course. Some participants will also be asked to use an mHealth app while caring for a client with heart failure. If chosen, we will provide you with instructions on how to use the mHealth app. The mHealth app will provide heart failure-specific education and allow you to report clinical observations and ask supervising nurse(s) questions in real-time. You will be asked to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaire (electronically) 4 times during the study: beginning of the study; after the training course; after your first heart failure client; after [ADDRESS_1074583] your participation to take 90 days in total. Information about your client (whether or not they went to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781551] 90-day period) will be assessed.    How could you benefit from this study?   There is no immediate benefit for participating in this study. However, you may learn more about heart failure from the heart failure training course and/or the mHealth app. This knowledge may improve your understanding of the disease course, its symptoms and how to better care for your clients. If you are chosen to use the mHealth app, you may further benefit from having on-demand access to heart failure materials and the ability to contact [CONTACT_781568].   What risks might result from being in this study?   The risks from participating in this research are minimal.   Potential risks of participating include: a) distress from learning how to use a mHealth app, b) distress of integrating the mHealth app into your caregiving routine and c) feeling worried that you may not be able to answer all of the questions that we ask you about heart failure in questionnaires correctly. These risks are minimal, however, and will be lessened with support from the study team. Please know that there are no repercussions for information about quality of care. We encourage you to answer all questionnaires (that are part of this study) honestly. Your answers will be completely confidential from your employer and they will not affect your job standing.

 19 Data to be Collected and Analyzed: The questionnaire (see attached document) will be administered using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a web-based, secure, data storage program at Weill Cornell Medicine at several time points during the study. A research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine will export the de-identified data that is collected in REDCap to STATA, a statistical software package, for analysis. A data analyst at Weill Cornell Medicine will analyze this data under PI [CONTACT_496659]’s supervision (IRB at WCM to safeguard this aspect of the project). App usage data from the mHealth app (intervention arm) will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dell (Scientific adviser/collaborator from Cornell; health technology). After [ADDRESS_1074591] team (that works with Partner’s in Care) and transferred and stored on a secure server on a password-protected computer at Weill Cornell Medicine which is monitored by [CONTACT_781571]. This data will be analyzed by a data analyst at Weill Cornell under PI [CONTACT_496659]’s supervision. Finally, data on the HF patients cared for by [CONTACT_781572] (demographics, clinical co-morbidities, and outcomes [ED visits and 30-day readmissions, functional status]) will be extracted by [CONTACT_781573]’s clinical records and administrative data. This type of data collection is part of the agency’s ongoing quality improvement activities and falls under the agency’s routine admissions procedures with patients. Like many studies at VNS Health, the clinical outcomes will be extracted from the Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). Data will be de-identified and analyzed at VNS Health, under Site-PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Feldman’s supervision. All OASIS data will be analyzed at VNS Health. At the end of the study, under [CONTACT_471705]’s supervision, trial participants (HHAs, nurses) will be interviewed to assess their experience with the training course and mHealth app. Additionally, short, telephone-based interviews will be conducted with a sub-set of patients by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sterling. These interviews will focus on their perspectives towards their HHAs, not about their medical care or their health, and will not last more than [ADDRESS_1074592]. Sterling will oversee the qualitative data analysis.   Brief Overview of Analytic Methods:  Baseline analyses: For each baseline characteristic in the questionnaire (see attached document), we will examine the distribution and outliers. We will test whether baseline characteristics are balanced between intervention arms using parametric or non-parametric bivariate tests as appropriate. All tests will be conducted at α=0.05.  Outcome analyses: Feasibility measures (described above) will be characterized with descriptive statistics (frequencies and proportions) using STATA statistical software. To assess the acceptability of the intervention and trial among study participants, [CONTACT_471705] will conduct a series of exit interviews with HHAs and nurses in the trial, as well as with VNS Health staff. The effect of the intervention among HHAs will be assessed for two primary outcomes: 1) HF knowledge; 2) HF caregiving self-efficacy and two secondary outcomes: 1) intention to leave and 2) job satisfaction (See above Table); alongside other specified outcomes of interest including communication practices (and preventable 911 calls). Finally, the effect of the intervention on two patient outcomes (emergency department [ED] visits; 30-day readmissions; functional status) will be assessed in exploratory analyses. To determine the effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes, we will compare HF knowledge and HF caregiving self-
 [ADDRESS_1074593] of randomization on the change in scores, using mixed linear regression models. Mixed-effects included a fixed effects categorical variable for time point (baseline/post-course/90 day), an indicator for study arm (control/intervention), a study arm by [CONTACT_781574]-specific random intercept. Primary analyses will be conducted using intention-to-treat, when appropriate. We will examine HHA characteristics across trial arms and adjust for covariates that are imbalanced (p<0.10). We will conduct the same analyses for the secondary outcomes (burnout and job satisfaction). For patient outcomes, we will perform exploratory analyses to determine the effect of the intervention on ED visit rates and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]; and functional status, using Poisson mixed effects regression models to account for clustering of patients within HHAs. To measure what would have occurred with usual care (e.g. without enhanced usual care or the intervention), we will assess ED visit rates and 30-day readmission rates among HHAs 90 days before vs. 90 days after randomization, adjusting for clustering of patients within HHAs, and stratified by [CONTACT_781575].   Power and Sample Size: To detect minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for both outcomes (a 1-point change in mean score on the Dutch HF Knowledge Scale; an 8-point change in mean score on the HF caregiving self-efficacy), with 80% power, a at 0.05, and conservatively allowing for 15% attrition, we will need 104 HHAs (52 per arm). The overall a at 0.05 enables testing of two hypotheses using Bonferroni’s method. Consistent with the goals of this study (to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and obtain preliminary effectiveness estimates on primary outcomes), we have not powered our study on secondary outcomes or on patient outcomes. These calculations were done in Stata v13, College Station, TX.  Statement of the Risks/Benefits for the Study Subjects:   There are minimal to no risks involved with participating in this study (attending a HF training course and/or using a mHealth app with HF educational content and a messaging application to contact [CONTACT_781576]). The questionnaires that HHAs will be asked to complete are de-identified, minimizing confidentiality risks. The mHealth app is Care Connect, which is HIPAA compliant and the standard of care app used at Partner’s in Care for regular HHA work and patient care, thereby [CONTACT_781577]. Potential risks of participating include: a) distress from learning how to use the mHealth app, b) distress of integrating the mHealth app into their caregiving routine and c) HHAs feeling worried that they may not be able to answer all of the questions that we ask them about HF in questionnaires correctly. These risks are minimal, however, and will be lessened with support from the study team and an orientation video. There will be no disruption to standard clinical care at VNS Health during this study. HHAs will not face any repercussions for information about quality of care. If any risks are reported by [CONTACT_781578], PI [INVESTIGATOR_781553], the IRB, and the patient’s primary care physician.  There is no immediate benefit for participating in this study. However, HHAs in the trial may learn about HF (from the HF training course and/or the mHealth app). This knowledge may be reinforced by [CONTACT_781579], its 
 [ADDRESS_1074594] their supervising nurse quickly (without using a telephone and waiting on hold, which is the current standard of care).   How Privacy, Confidentiality, and the Rights of Human Subjects will be Protected:  The HHAs will receive a HF training course and will perform routine caregiving tasks while caring for HF patients in this study. Those in the intervention arm, will also have the opportunity to engage (electronically) with their supervisors to ask clinical questions, rather than usual care (trying to reach them by [CONTACT_648]). The questions will be asked via a secure, HIPAA protected function on the mHealth app (Care Connected) (monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dell, adviser in health technology, and the Care Connect team) and no identifying information will be used. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at [ADDRESS_1074595]; and to link a home health aide to a specific patient for intervention workflow processes. The outcome file that will be shared with Weill Cornell study staff will include a Study ID, the age of the patient, and information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781554] [ADDRESS_1074596] access to the communication (via the Chat feature in Care Connect) between the home health aide and the supervisory nurses. It is possible that patient name [CONTACT_781588]. At both sites all data will be secured in password protected, HIPAA secured data systems. Sharing of data across sites will be done through the VNS Health approved email encryption process and/or through the approved MSTeams application. For the entire study, data will be reported in aggregate form only. PI [INVESTIGATOR_781555]. Rules for handling confidential data and security of patient information will be strictly abided by [CONTACT_781580].  Participation by [CONTACT_781581].  • At the start of the trial, during the kickoff session, nurses will provide informed consent verbally. During the kickoff session, the study team will thoroughly explain the study details to the nurses. Upon agreeing to participate, nurses will provide verbal informed consent. We are submitting a waiver of written informed consent documentation for nurses because we are not collecting additional data from them. As such, the study team 
 [ADDRESS_1074597] for electronic consent for nurses.  • At the start of the trial, HHAs will provide informed consent twice. First, HHAs will provide informed consent verbally over the phone at the time of screening and eligibility assessment, by [CONTACT_781582]. At the time of recruitment into the study (orientation session, before HF training course), HHAs that are eligible and agree to participate will provide electronic signed informed consent. For all participants who meet eligibility criteria, the VNS Health staff member and WCM research assistant will explain the study protocol and discuss the risks and benefits of participating. The staff member will explain that the decision to participate will not affect the care that they provide to patients or their job at the agency. There will be many opportunities for questions about the study to be answered. As per the Institutional Review Board, the informed consent form will provide a section explaining what comprises protected health information (PHI) and how this study will not collect this type of information; it will also explain how participants’ data will remain confidential and protected. The informed consent form will also provide the contact [CONTACT_29073] [INVESTIGATOR_781556]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_225988] (Feldman). Note, because this study (and the intervention) is focused on HHA and nurse behavior, patients will not be initially consented. The intervention is non-intrusive and includes information-based strategies that do not require HHAs or nurses to do anything other than provide care that they view as appropriate in light of information provided by [CONTACT_334369]. In fact, participation in the implementation of interventions with a research component is part of the VNS Health’s contractual agreement with employees. With respect to patients (who are not the primary focus of this study), only a Waiver of Patient Authorization will be required by [CONTACT_781583]. To understand their perspectives towards the HHAs in the trial, we will ask a sub-set of patients to participate in a one-time, virtual (telephone or zoom)-based interview at the end of the study. This will take 30 minutes and will be conducted by [CONTACT_574742] a topic guide. In order to recruit patients to participate, only their socio-demographic data will be needed. From this, a VNS Health research assistant will screen the participants using a pre-written script and obtain verbal consent.   Telephone Recruitment Script for Recruiting Patients:   Hello [insert name [CONTACT_198833]]:  My name [CONTACT_832] _______ from ________. I am working with [CONTACT_781590], a primary care doctor from Weill Cornell. I am contact[CONTACT_781584]-funded research study. We would like to interview you about your experience receiving care from the HHA, who was trained about heart disease (heart failure) and given resources (like a smartphone app) to help care for you.   We are inviting you to participate in a brief interview, so our research team can learn more about your experiences working with home health aides. Our ultimate goal is to improve the health of adults with heart failure (like you), so we are interested in learning about what worked and what didn’t with respect to the care you received at home.

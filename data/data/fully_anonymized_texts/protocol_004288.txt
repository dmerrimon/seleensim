• For survivors of severe COVID -19, overcoming the virus is just the beginning o f an uncharted 
recovery path. As the number of confirmed COVID -19 cases exceeds 27 million globally and 6 
million in the US, the number of patients who experience persistent symptoms during recovery is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_8320]. In COVID -19 patients, common acute symptoms include cough, fever, dyspnea, 
musculoskeletal symptoms (myalgia, joint pain, fatigue), gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
anosmia/dysgeusia [1,2]. Clinicians and researchers have focused on the acute phase of COVID -19, 
but continued monitoring and trea ting of persistent symptoms is urgently needed. Recent studies [3, 
4]assessed persistent symptoms in patients who were discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651860] -19. None of the patients had a fever or any of the other signs or symptoms associated
with acute illness. Nevertheless, decreased quality of life was observed in 44.1% and fatigue was
reported by 53.1% [3] and 71% [4] of patients. Furthermore, persistent fatigue following COVID -
19 infection is common and independent of severity of in itial infection (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153632] -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]) [5]. In addition to the characteristic laboratory findings and lung compute d
tomography (CT) abnormalities [6], it has been recently reported that patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_874921] neurological ma nifestations [7 -9]. Wu et al. [8] found that viral infections have detrimental
impacts on neurological functions and can even cause severe neurological damage. Their st udy
showed that coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_651861] 2 (SARS -
CoV -2), exhibited neurotropic properties and may cause neurological diseases with severe fatigue
symptoms. Another recent case report has also indicated reduced glucose uptake
([18F]flurodeoxyglucose (FDG); measured with positron emission tomography (PET)) in diverse
brain areas [9], which may contribute to these neurological manifestations. Therefore, there is a
critical need to develop inexpensive, effective, and rapid treatments for the persistent fatigue
experienced by [CONTACT_651881] -[ADDRESS_874922] current stimulation (tDCS) [10]. tDCS uses weak
currents applied  to the scalp to alter the excitability of cortical neurons by [CONTACT_651882]. It also has a favorable safety profile and only transient adverse side effects.
Studies in patients with neurological disorders have shown that tDCS over  the primary motor
and/or sensory cortex (M1/S1) consistently and significantly improves fatigue [11 -13]. M1 tDCS
represents an easy, cost -effective candidate for treating persistent fatigue in recovered COVID -19
patients.
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")  
  The objective of this application is to investigate the short - and long -term effects of multiple 
sessions of 4 mA M1 tDCS on fatigue and brain activity in recovered COVID -19 patients using 
established measures of perception of fatigue, performance fatigabi lity, and cerebral glucose 
uptake. Our central hypothesis is that tDCS will improve fatigue short - and long- term, and thus will 
improve quality of life (QOL) in recovered COVID -19 patients and that these changes will be 
associated with alterations in brain  activity.  
 
Aim 1: Determine the short -term effects of multiple sessions of M1 tDCS on fatigue, and the 
subsequent influence on QOL, in recovered COVID -19 patients.  
Hypothesis 1: Fatigue and QOL will significantly improve immediately after five consecutive  
sessions of M1 tDCS.  
 
Aim 2: Determine the long -term effects of multiple sessions of tDCS on fatigue and the subsequent 
influence on QOL, in recovered COVID -19 patients.  
Hypothesis 2: The improvements in fatigue and QOL of recovered COVID -19 patients will be 
present at 3 - and 6 -week follow -ups. 
 
Aim 3: Determine the association between cerebral glucose uptake and changes in fatigue/QOL 
measures in recovered COVID -19 patients.  
Hypothesis 3: Changes in cerebral FDG uptake will be correlated with improved fat igue and quality 
of life.  
 
Aim 4: Determine the effects of multiple sessions of tDCS on vascular function (arterial stiffness, 
endothelial function), baroreflex function, and cognitive function in recovered COVID -19 patients.  
Hypothesis 4: Improvements in vascular function (arterial stiffness, endothelial function), 
baroreflex function, and cognitive function immediately after five consecutive sessions of M1 
tDCS, and at 3 weeks and 6 weeks.  
  
I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.  
(do not  indicate "see protocol")  
  As of August 2020, the total number of COVID -[ADDRESS_874923] been over 
47,000 cases, 900 deaths, and 35,000 recoveries. Currently, the immediate effects of COVID -19 are 
more emphasized than the long -term effects, such as fatigue and deconditioning. Certainly, it is 
important that healthcare providers monitor and manage the acute effects of COVID -19; but they 
should also ‘‘urgently prepare for. . . the more long -lasting aftershocks of the pandemic’’ [14]. 
Even after active COVID -19 cases dissipate, we may experience long -term h ealth consequences for 
upwards of 12 years [15]. It is highly expected that the needs of COVID -[ADDRESS_874924] been associated with long- term symptoms like muscle 
weakness, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, pulmonary function impairment, vocational problems, 
and reduced quality of life [16 -18]. Similarly, COVID -[ADDRESS_874925] on physical, 
cognitive, mental, and social health, even in patients with mild disease presentation [19]. As acute 
symptoms improve and patients are exiting quarantine, they may be classified as hemodynamically 
stable and infection -free. Yet, many may still exhibit the physical (i.e., dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, 
pressure ulcers), cognitive (i.e., delirium), and emotional (i.e., depression) consequences of 
prolonged bed rest and quarantine, also known as post -intensive care syndrome [19]. These 
complications may lead to limited mobility, decreased independence in activities of daily living, re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and poor quality of life, all of which may be mitigated by [CONTACT_651883] [20]. 
These lasting effects are also evidenced by [CONTACT_651884] [3,4] that assessed persistent symptoms in 
recently discharged COVID -19 patients and reported that decreased quality of life was observed 
among 44.1% and fatigue was still reported by 53.1% [3] to 71% [4] of patients. Importantly, both 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410934] d non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651862] -19 
infection [5].  
 
Fatigue is “the decrease in physical and/or mental performance that results from changes in central, 
psychological, and/or peripheral factors” and significantly redu ces one’s ability to participate in 
activities of daily living [21]. Many of the current treatments of fatigue, including pharmaceuticals, 
are only mildly effective and are often very expensive. Thus, a practical, inexpensive, and effective 
adjunct treatme nt is urgently required. One possible modality that fulfills these requirements is 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [22]. tDCS is a non -invasive means of increasing the 
excitability of targeted brain regions [9] and has been successfully used  for several years in healthy 
populations [23] and in patients with neurological disorders to treat fatigue [24 -27]. Recent studies 
have shown that tDCS intensities up to 4 mA are safe, tolerable, and do not elicit any serious 
adverse effects [24,28,29]. A dditionally, tDCS can feasibly be delivered outside of a clinic setting 
[30], which may be of particular importance during a pandemic.

VI.14  Provide an estimate of the total number of subjects that would be eligible for inclusion in each of your 
study populations (include your control population if applicable)  
  A patient search was completed using TriNetX. On 2 Sept 2020, there were 42,530 registered COVID -19 
patients at UIHC. Given that previous research has indicated that 53% - 71% of recovered patients still 
experience persistent fatigue, our potential subject  pool would consist of 22,500+ people, of which we will 
only seek to recruit 100. The control subjects will likely come from the student and employee pools from 
UI and UIHC. Our experience indicates that recruiting [ADDRESS_874952] access to each of your study populations in sufficient number to meet your 
recruitment goals.  
  Prospective participants will be recruited from the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059], Iowa City, IA, 
via advertisements thro ughout the university campus and community, mass email to the university staff, 
faculty and alumni (>35,000 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]), and from the ‘volunteer research’ link on the clinical trials 
webpage on the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651868] (https:// uihc.org/clinicaltrials/). Other 
main recruiting tools will include advertisements in local newspapers (Iowa City Press Citizen, Cedar 
Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_651869]) and Noon News publications in the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] & Clinics daily 
newsletter, which is avail able to the public and patients at various locations in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Drs. Bryant,

• Describe the steps that will b e taken by [CONTACT_651890]  
•   Prospective participants will be recruited from the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (Drs. Kamholz 
and Bryant), through advertisements on UIOWA Campus (including mass emails), and via individual 
emails (see attached template). Consent and enrollmen t procedures will be performed in the INPL 
(Director: Thorsten Rudroff, PhD, FACSM). Interested individuals will perform an initial phone screening 
via questionnaires. Contact [CONTACT_651891]. After completion of the phone screening, INPL personal 
will schedule the participants’ first visit.  
 
During the first visit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_651877]. Subjects will be allowed to review the documents at their leisure and research 
personnel will answer all questions asked by [CONTACT_11275]. The potential subject will be informed of 
all potential risks before signing the consent  document. Subjects will in no way be coerced to sign the 
consent form and will be informed that it is their choice whether to volunteer for this study. Even after 
subjects sign the consent, they are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reas on. Consent may 
also be obtained via Zoom meeting or phone call prior to the Visit 1. After participant has been deemed 
eligible to participate in the study, research staff will conduct a zoom or phone call to walk through the 
study design and consent, as well as answer any questions the participant may have. Participants will then 
schedule their first five visits. After participants confirm their visit dates/times, they will be sent a 
confirmation email with detailed information about their visits, as well  as a link to the consent form. 
Participant may then sign the consent document at the end of the Zoom or phone call and either scan email 
a copy or bring the signed consent with them to Visit 1.

except the subjects will not repeat the MRI scan, strength testing, or receive tDCS.  
 
LONG -TERM EFFECTS OF tDCS: Three - and six- weeks following Day 5, participants will repeat the 
testing battery conducted on Days 1 and 5.  
 
BLOOD DRAW: Sessions [ADDRESS_874992] 5 mL of blood at the start of each session (total volume collected per participa nt: 5 * 2 = 10 mL) for 
interleukin -6 assays. After blood is collected, the participants will go to the Iowa Translational Vascular 
Physiology Lab ([CONTACT_301745][INVESTIGATOR_651871]) in C204 GH for non -invasive measurements of arterial stiffness, 
endothelial function and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity(see below). Then, the participants will go to the 
INPL to proceed with stimulation and testing. After the assays are complete, the blood samples will be 
disposed of following standard Pathology procedures and eventually i ncinerated.  
 
VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. Brachial artery flow -mediated dilation (FMD) using a 8 -14 
MHz linear transducer and ultrasound (Logiq 7, GE Healthcare) will be performed as a measure of 
vascular endothelial function. Briefly, while supi[INVESTIGATOR_651878] s ubject's arm will be abducted and positioned 
comfortably on a side table and a pediatric cuff will be secured on the upper forearm (i.e., below the 
antecubital fold). After selecting a segment of the brachial artery ~[ADDRESS_874993] (i.e., end -diastolic) ultrasound images 
and Doppler flow velocity of the artery will be a cquired in duplex mode (B Mode/Pulsed Doppler) 
simultaneously for [ADDRESS_874994] 30 seconds of the cuff occlusion and for two minutes after the release of the cuff. A commercially 
available software package (Vascular Analysis T ools 6.0, Medical Imaging Applications, LLC) will be 
used to acquire and analyze ECG -gated brachial artery diameters. Images will be digitalized and stored for 
later analysis on a personal computer. Brachial artery dilation will be determined as the % chan ge and mm 
change from baseline. FMD is dependent upon the post -occlusion increase in hyperemic blood flow or 
shear stress.  
 
ARTERIAL STIFFNESS. Carotid -femoral, carotid -brachial, and carotid -radial PWV will be measured 
non-invasively by [CONTACT_651893], femoral, brachial and radial artery pressure waveforms sequentially 
with an applanation tonometer (Non -invasive Hemodynamics Workstation, Cardiovascular Engineering, 
Inc.). Pressure waveforms are gated to the ECG R wave in order to calculate the transit ti me (t) between 
the foot of the carotid and the respective peripheral (femoral, brachial, radial) waveforms. The carotid -
femoral transit distance (CFTD) is estimated between the 2 anatomical sites as the difference between the 
suprasternal notch (SSN) to ca rotid (SSN -C) and femoral (SSN -F) sites. Thus, the CFTD is calculated as 
CFTD= (SSN -F) - (SSN -C) and PWV calculated as CFTD/t. Next, carotid artery compliance and beta-
stiffness index will be determined noninvasively by [CONTACT_5019] -resolution ultrasonography (Logiq 7, GE 
Healthcare) of the right common carotid artery and contralateral assessment of carotid artery blood 
pressure via non -invasive carotid artery applanation tonometry respectively. Carotid artery diameters are 
measured ~2 cm proximal to the carotid bu lb with the transducer placed at a 90° angle to the vessel by [CONTACT_78150] -
line analysis of DICOM images with image analysis software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC). 
Maximal diameters (i.e. systolic expansion) and minimal diameters (i.e. diastolic relaxation) are measured 
in sync with carotid artery blood pressure waveforms. Carotid blood pressure waveforms are calibrated 
using diastolic and mean brachial artery blood pressure obtained from standard brachial artery cuff blood 
pressure.  
 
CARDIOVAGAL BAROREFLEX S ENSITIVITY. Baroreflex sensitivity will be determined by [CONTACT_651894] -to-to beat finger blood pressure (Finapres, AD Instruments Inc.) and heart rate 
using 3 lead ECG continuously for 15 minutes supi[INVESTIGATOR_651879].  
 
COGNITIVE TESTING: You will complete three cognitive tests, called the NIH Cognitive Battery 
Toolbox, that will assess your executive function, working memory, and processing speed. All tests will be 
completed using an iPad provide d by [CONTACT_651895] 15 minutes total.  
 
1-100 SYMPTOM SCALE: You will be asked to fill out a survey rating each of your COVID -[ADDRESS_874995] pain, chills, diarrhea, 
dizziness/verti go, dry cough, dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue, fever over 100.3*F, headache, lack of appetite, 
loss of smell/taste, muscle or body aches, nasal congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, shortness of 
breath, sore joints, and sore throat. These scores will  be totaled and averaged for overall symptom severity.  
 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Participants will be asked to fill out short survey called the International physical 
activity questionnaire (IPAQ) to quantify job -related and leisure- time physical activity and sitting time 
over the past 7 days.  
 
SLEEP QUALITY: Participants will fill out the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_11475] (PSQI) survey to determine 
sleep quality over the past month.  
 
STRENGTH TESTING:  
Knee extension/flexion will be performed in a sitting position. The range of motion will be between 100° 
and 0° of flexion. The axis for extension/flexion is assumed to be a horizontal line through the femoral 
condyles. The subject will be secured with Velcro bands to help isolate the knee joint. The isokinetic 
measure ments will be performed with 3 maximal extension/flexion repetitions at 30º/s. In addition, three 
repetitions of isometric tests performed at 65° (extensors) and 30° (flexors) of knee flexion will also be 
obtained. All testing will be completed on both leg s and the highest torque obtained from the three 
repetitions will be used to determine the weaker leg. The M1 that controls the weaker leg will serve as the 
anodal brain target for tDCS.  
 
ISOKINETIC FATIGUE TEST: Subjects will perform 40 consecutive repeti tions of isokinetic 
concentric/concentric flexion and extension of the knee on the stronger leg at 120º/sec. The weaker leg 
fatigue task will be completed in the same manner immediately after the stronger leg.  
 
[ADDRESS_874996] (6MWT): The subjects will be led to a cordoned -off hallway to perform the 
walk. Subjects will be instructed to walk at their normal, usual pace back and forth between two points 
separated by 30 m for 6 min. Gait characteristics and distance walked will be calculated and recorded.  
 
tDCS TREATMENT PROTOCOL: A tDCS device (Soterix) will deliver a small direct current through 
two sponge surface electrodes (5 cm × 7 cm) soaked with ~15 mL of NaCl saline. The positive electrode 
(anode) will be placed over the M1 representation of the weak er leg (as determined by [CONTACT_651896]), 
and the return electrode (cathode) will be placed above the eyebrow on the opposite side of the head.  
 
tDCS BLOCK: The participants will receive tDCS for 20 min while seated comfortably and quietly in a 
room. Th e intensity will start at 0 mA and will be incrementally increased to the target intensity of 4 mA 
over the initial 30 seconds. At the 20 -minute time point, the current will be gradually reduced to 0 mA over 
30 seconds.  
 
SHAM BLOCK: During the sham block, stimulation will ramp up over [ADDRESS_874997] 
blinding integrity.  
 
Brain activity PET Imaging with [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG): A subset of [ADDRESS_874998] be less than or equal to 200 mg/dL in order to proceed with the imaging. 
FDG (5 mCi ± 10% IV) will be administered and tracer uptake will take place in a quiet, darkened room 
with eyes open and ears unplugged. Attenuation correction imaging (either  AC-CT or transmission 
imaging) will be performed with emission imaging equivalent to that used in the ADNI -3 protocol.  
 
FDG PET Image Processing: FDG images will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8544] -of-interest (VOI) based on the 
individual’s structural MRI (maximum pro bability atlas of Neuro Tool of PMOD Biomedical Image 
Quantification, version 4.1, PMOD Technologies, Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland) as well as using currently -
available software tools designed specifically for the analysis of FDG images (e.g., NeuroQ (Synterm ed, 
Inc.), PALZ (PMOD Technologies, LTD), MIM6, Neuro tool (v.6.6, MIM Software, Inc.). Partial volume -
corrected image data will also be analyzed. Global metabolism will be determined by [CONTACT_651897] -weighted average of the standardized uptake va lues (SUV) of the intracerebral pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463]. Mean, 
median and partial volume -corrected mean SUVs will be determined for each tissue type (GM, WM), lobe, 
and region using the Neuro Tool (PMOD).  
 
MRI: MR imaging will be conducted on a GE 750W 3T scanner using a 3 2-channel head coil. Anatomical 
images will include volumetric sagittal T1 MPRAGE (TI=900ms, TE=3.2ms, TR=8.5ms, flip angle=8%;, 
FOV=256x256x192mm, matrix=256x256x192, bandwidth= 250Hz/pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070], acceleration=2) and sagittal T2 
CUBE (TE= 60ms, TR= 2500ms, echo  train length=140, FOV=256x256x192mm, matrix=256x256x192, 
bandwidth=500Hz/pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070], acceleration=2) scans acquired using prospective motion correction (PROMO) 
and a 1.0 mm isotropic spatial resolution.  
 
Questionnaires and physical testing (e.g., strength/fati gue) will be performed in the INPL. PET scanning 
will either start in PET Imaging Center (height/weight measurements, glucose/pregnancy testing, IV 
insertion) and then walk/wheelchair the subjects to PBDB (FDG administration, uptake, and PET 
scanning), or be exclusively performed in PBDB (to accommodate any potential UIHC research 
restrictions) at the discretion of PET Imaging staff. MRI scans always take place in the research dedicated 
3T MRI scanner in PBDB.

tDCS/SHAM sessions: $15 e ach visit ($60 total).  
 
Subjects who are part of the asymptomatic group will be compensated $35 for their time and effort 
upon completion of visit one.  
 
VIII. Risks  
 
VIII.1  What are the risks to subjects including  
- emotional or psychological  
- financial  
- legal or social  
- physical?  
  tDCS safety (only applicable to symptomatic participants): tDCS is a non -invasive brain stimulation 
technique in which a very weak electrical  current is applied to the scalp. tDCS has been conducted on 
humans and animals for many years and no evidence has emerged to suggest that it is harmful or has ever 
induced a serious side effect. However, the safety of tDCS is dependent on current strength , electrode size, 
and stimulation duration. Accordingly, these parameters have been investigated to establish safe and 
effective stimulation parameters for tDCS applications in research involving human subjects. The only side 
effects that have been reporte d when proper guidelines are followed are a temporary headache, skin 
redness under the electrodes, and/or tingling, itching, and burning sensations in some subjects. For 
example, a [ADDRESS_875004] recently 
been reported in research and review articles (Nitsche et al. 2 008; Hummel et al. 2008). Physiological 
studies have also assessed the safety of tDCS when applied within the aforementioned stimulation 
guidelines. For example, there was no neuronal damage as measured by [CONTACT_152635] -specific enolase 
(Stagg & Nitsche, 20 11 ) or MRI measures of edema using contrast -enhanced and diffusion- weighted MRI 
measures following administration of tDCS (Nitsche et al. 2004). Furthermore, tDCS did not negatively 
alter measures of neuropsychological function and EEG activity (Iver et a l. 2005). Accordingly, rat studies 
using tDCS models emulating tDCS applied to humans (Liebetanz et al. 2009 ) showed that the current 
density needed to induce tissue damage or lesions was about 1429 mA/cm^2, whereas the current densities 
used in human stu dies are between 0.04 and 0.08 mA/cm^2 and in this proposal is 0.011 mA/cm^2. In 
conclusion, the probability is very unlikely that harm may occur (see above). Based on the available 
literature a slight headache should be the worst possible negative effect and should be very rare. In this 
case, non -prescription medication should relieve the headache within 1- 2 hours.  
 
Risk of Blood Draw: Subjects may experience some discomfort/bleeding from the blood draws. Other risks 
include bruising and infection. To mini mize these risks, all blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_651899][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Carotid -femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and flow -mediated dilation: There are no known or 
foreseeable risks associated with the use of carotid -femoral pulse wave velocity or flow -mediated dilation. 
ECG electrodes may cause minor irritation to the skin.  
 
Risks of performing motor tasks: There is potential for injury (muscle strain) resulting from the strength, 
fatigue, and walking tests . There is a 0.01% chance of death (in people who have heart problems), a 0.02% 
risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require the subjects to go to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in people with heart 
problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in blood pressure. Foll owing participation, subjects may 
experience some muscle soreness. Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not 
exercised recently. Other risks may include feelings of anxiety and/or stress induced by [CONTACT_152644], 
which can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  
 
PET Imaging: This study involves the administration of a PET radiopharmaceutical, 
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG has been used at the University of Iowa and throughout the world 
for a variety of conditi ons. There have been a few reports of relatively rare side- effects involving 
temporary low blood pressure and allergic reactions. As a result of participating in this research, each 
subject will receive a dose of radiation equivalent to approximately 15% o f the dose that a medical 
radiation worker can accrue yearly. FDG dose = 5 ± 10% mCi. Radiation dose = 110 mrem/mCi = 605 
mrem + [ADDRESS_875005] = 730 mrem = ~15% of dose for medical radiation worker. Although there are 
no proven harmful effects from the l evel of radiation exposure in this study, long -term effects on a 
subject’s health cannot be ruled out with certainty. Pregnancy is a contraindication to PET imaging. Thus, 
all women of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test before PET imaging . Injection of tracers 
will require the placement of an intravenous catheter. As in any procedures involving catheters placed in 
veins, there are several risks, including infection, clotting, or continued bleeding. There may also be 
bruising, skin irritati on, and a dull ache at the site of injection. The subject will be asked to fast for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_875006]. 
 
Risks of MRI:  
Participants may be uncomfortable inside the MR I scanner if they do not like to be in closed spaces 
(“claustrophobia”). During the procedure, they will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker 
system. Participants can stop the scan at any time.  
 
The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noi se, which has produced hearing loss in a very small 
number of patients. Participants will be given noise -canceling headphones to reduce this risk. A metal 
object flying through the air toward the magnet and hitting the participants presents the greatest ri sk 
associated with MRI. To reduce this risk, we require that all people involved with the study remove all 
metal from their clothing and pockets. No metal objects will be brought into the magnet room while 
participants are inside the room. In addition, the  door to the room will remain closed throughout the study 
so that no one can accidentally bring a metal object into the room.  
 
There are no known risks associated with limited exposure to magnetic fields. Magnets of this strength 
have been in use for medic al imaging for over [ADDRESS_875007]  
There is a risk of mild discomfort on the forearm when the blood pressure cuff is inflated and a mild 
temporary sensation of “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” in the forearm and hand. This feeling is co mpletely reversed 
within several minutes after the cuff is released with no permanent discomfort.  
 
Risk Cardiovagal Baroreflex Sensitivity test  
There are no known risks associated with the use of this test.  
 
Although the risk is minimal, there is a risk fo r breach of confidentiality.  
  
VIII.[ADDRESS_875008] you done to minimize the risks?  
• If applicable to this study ALSO include:  
o How you (members of your research team at Iowa) will monitor the safety of 
individual subjects.  
o Include a description of the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might require as a consequence of participating in this research and how 
referral will occur if necessary (e.g. availability of emergency medical care, 
psychologi cal counseling, etc.)  
   All risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_364468], well -established procedures and strict monitoring of each 
experimental session. Study staff will be in close proximity to each subject to help prevent/minimize fall 
risk and muscle strain.  Furthermore, risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_651900], within international guidelines, and within the range of those used in hundreds, if not thousands, 
of studies (see above).  
 
The venous catheter will be inserted b y an individual from the PET Center that is qualified, trained, and 
experienced at inserting venous lines.  
 
Because the subject will be asked to fast for a minimum of [ADDRESS_875009] is found to be 
hypoglycemic at that time, glucose will be administered orally (e.g., juice) or by [CONTACT_651901]’s level and symptoms.  
 
To minimize these risks involved in drawing blood, all blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_651899][INVESTIGATOR_15166]. As pointed out by [CONTACT_651902], 
this is a physically minimal risk study and the main expected risk would be fainting from a blood draw. 
The safet y plan is to have a registered nurse/phlebotomist there at all times during the blood draw. This 
RN/phlebotomist will position the participant for the blood draw in a seated or recumbent (lying) position. 
The nurse/phlebotomist will monitor for signs of fa inting during the blood draw, such as dizziness, 
confusion, pallor, nausea and/or sweaty palms. If present, the nurse/phlebotomist would stop the procedure 
assist the participant to try to get their legs above their heart or lie down with legs elevated. In  the event of 
a fainter, the nurse/phlebotomist would follow basic first aid put them in a laying position with their legs 
above their head and loosen any constrictive clothing. The participant would be monitored for pulse and 
breathing. Any other events w ould be unexpected and handled as deemed appropriate, by [CONTACT_651903].

XI. Data Analysis  
 
XI.1 Describe the analysis methods you will use, including, if applicable, the variables you will analyze  
  The generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework will be utilized to assess changes over time in 
fatigue and quality of life measures. An interaction  term between time and treatment will allow us to test 
the within - and between -treatment differences over all time points. Using histograms, variable distributions 
will be assessed to decide which link function to specify when modeling each outcome. To acc ount for the 
inherent correlation that occurs in repeated measures data, we will cluster on subject ID. In addition to 
examining the unadjusted relationship between the time -treatment interaction and each outcome, we will 
consider the addition of control v ariables, which will reduce the likelihood of unaccounted confounders. 
The control variables being considered for inclusion in the adjusted models are age, sex, and disease 
duration. For each outcome, models will be fit for all possible combinations of con trol variables. The 
predictor set that yields the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) will be considered the optimal 
control variable set to adjust associations between the main predictor and the outcomes. Statistical 
significance will be assessed at the &#945; = 0.[ADDRESS_875014] size of this difference = 0.91 (Cohe n’s d). With alpha fixed at 0.05, we would need 20 total 
subjects in each group (tDCS and SHAM; details below) to achieve 80% power in a two -tailed independent 
samples test. Therefore, to account for 20% data and subject attrition, we will recruit 25 subje cts per group 
(150 total).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  17  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is tasked with, 
among other things, promoting and supporting the development of strategic medical countermeasures (MCMs) for the [LOCATION_002]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this effort involves supporting novel 
drug development up to Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval and inclusion into the 
Strategic National Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829]. However, in the event of widespread nerve agent (NA) poisoning, 
pre-deployed MCMs are likely to be inadequate due to limited availability of community caches 
(Chempack), logistical challenges in bringing the resource s to the site of treatment, depletion of 
the resources before all patients needing treatment receive it, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_413217]/or preferred delivery devices (auto- injectors).
1  
In response to this challenge, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is investigating the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of an alternative (sublingual [SL] ) 
route of administration of a tropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s ulfate ophthalmic s olution (1%) compared with  the 
reference, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s ulfate injected  intramuscularly ( IM).

Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413218]-threatening muscarinic effects, symptomatic bradycardia, and to dilate the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_413219]. 
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413220], as well as the treatment of some (muscarinic) mushroom toxicity. Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413221], intravenous 
(IV) injection, and as ocular drops. The ocular drop formulation is also given off- label SL for 
excessive drooling in multiple contexts , including maintenance of perioral hygiene in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413222], to alleviate hypersalivation caused by [CONTACT_413293], to manage oral 
secretions/reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia risk in mechanically ventilated patients, and 
for excessive drooling in developmentally dis abled children.
3-6 
This randomized, open-label, two -period, two-sequence, phase 1 study is designed to assess the 
bioequivalence, bioavailabi lity, and PK  of SL administered Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] S ulfate Ophthalmic 
Solution, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia ( USP) 1% (1 mg; test)  compared to Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] S ulfate 
Injection , USP  administered IM (1 mg; reference) in healthy adult volunteers. 
5.2. Study Rationale  
Nerve agent toxicity requires the rapid administration of antimuscarinic MCMs to mitigate life -
threatening bronchorrhea and seizures. Rapid administration of centrally acting doses of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413223] [ADDRESS_520713], the  IM route of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413224] a very high dose before 
central antimuscarinic effects are seen, and the onset of action is delayed. Further, stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_413225] (Chempack), containing drugs administered by [CONTACT_331437]- injector, are 
insufficient to treat large numbers of NA -poisoned patients in a timely manner. Ophthalmic 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413226] a rapid, available source of effective medication in the event of an emergency.

means of delivering a rapid therapeutic dose of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413227].  
The purpose of the current study is to assess the bioequivalence, bioavailability , and PK  of SL

5.3. Previous Clinical Studies  
Prior to conducting study BP-C-[ZIP_CODE] (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED])8, BARDA 
conducted an extensive literature review and identified 110 published English language articles 
involving the administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413228], nasal, and oral routes. Eighteen studies were selected based on their relevance to the proposed clinical study and are summarized in 
Appendix 1. Included among these reports are 6 wherein hyoscyamine, the levo-enantiomer of 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], was the active agent. A total of 470 participants were exposed to varying doses and regimens of SL atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], including the ophthalmic formulation, or hyoscyamine in these reports. 
In several reports, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413229] a regular regimen versus the single dose per timepoint as proposed in this study. No severe adverse reactions were reported, and the side effects observed were consistent with known anticholinergic effects previously observed with 
oral or parenteral adm inistration, e.g., dry mouth. In one study of children in Brazil with cerebral 
palsy and drooling, side effects occurred in 4 of 33 (12%) patients. These side effects and their 
respective frequency were as follows: fever and flush (1), irritability (1), flush and irritability (1) 
and flush and angioedema (1).

study, 1064 person-doses of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413231] (AEs).3 
A study of SL injection of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413232] a useful evaluation of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413233], 
and the atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413234]-fold greater than the 1 mg dose to be used in the current 
study. Rajpal et al. evaluated 9 healthy male volunteers (mean age 20.8 ± 4.7 years, mean weight 59.67 ± 4.76 kg) administered a single SL injection of 2 mg atropi[INVESTIGATOR_52339] (in 0.1 mL).
7 Three 
of the participants had 99mTc- labeled diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid added to their 
injection to monitor the release r ate of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_52339]. Within 10 minutes, 85% of the injected 
dose was released from the SL site of injection. This compared to only 24% released at 10 
minutes from one participant who received IM atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The remaining six participants 
underwent blood sampling for PK and clinical monitoring for signs of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413235] (heart rate, 
pupil diameter, and mouth dryness). The peak serum concentration of SL atropi[INVESTIGATOR_99666] 20 ng/mL 
at 15 minutes compared to peak serum concentrations of 6 to 8 ng/mL at 30 minutes following 
IM administration. All volunteers who received atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413236] 10 minutes with peak intensity at 30 minutes and persistence of symptoms for 
nearly 60 minutes. The authors concluded that atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413237]. Adverse events were 
not reported in this trial.

7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, open -label, two -period, two-sequence, crossover study to assess the 
bioequivalence, bioavailability , and PK of a single dose of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413243]. Approximately 46 healthy male and non-pregnant female volunteers 
will be enrolled to obtain approximately 36 evaluable participants  in the per protocol population. 
Additional participants may be randomized if participants are withdrawn prior to receiving one 
or both doses of study drug. Eligible participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive one 
of two treatment dosing s equences (A or B) as depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071]  3.

Figure 1 presents a diagram of the overall study design. Volunteers will be screened for study 
participation  from Days -14 to -3. After Screening on Day 1, eligible participants will be  enrolled 
and will be randomized to one of two treatment dosing sequences as presented in Table  3. Once 
randomized, each participant will receive 2 doses of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413210] a wash out period of 6 ±1 days. During Visit 1 (Day 1 ) and Visit 2 (Day 8 ), participants will be administered SL or IM 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], according to the ir randomly assigned dosing sequence. At each dosing visit, blood 
samples for PK will be collected at time 0 (pre -dose) and at [ADDRESS_520716] during dosing visits. On the day of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413244], 
site staff will review eligibility  criteria with each participant  (except  for those criteria specified 
as only being applicable at S creening; see Section  8.1). In addition to meeting eligibility criteria, 
participants will not be dosed with study drug until they  meet the  following pre-dose 
requirement s:  
1. Have fasted from  food and  drink for [ADDRESS_520717] that has the potential to interfere with SL 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413245] (e.g., candy, chewing gum, mints, etc.) for 2 hours prior to study drug 
administration . 
Following administration of study drug, participants:  
1. Will abstain from food and  drink through [ADDRESS_520718].  After 2

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  23  • Participant  experiences an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], makes further 
dosing inadvisable because the AE causes functional impairment or because the AE 
requires a medical intervention or observation for safety.  
• Participant  no longer meets eligibility criteria in such a way that, in the judgment of 
the investigator, the safety of the participant may be compromised by [CONTACT_413295] ’s subsequent study data are likely to 
be significantly compromised.  
Once a participant has been reviewed by [CONTACT_413296]/or BARDA Medical Officer , they will recommend to either (1) 
continue dosing per the protocol or (2) discontinue further dosing of the participant.   
Participant s who do not complete both study drug doses for any reason will continue to be 
followed for safety for at least six days following the last dose. If a  participant reports an AE 
judged at least possibly related to study drug, the event will be followed to resolution (with or 
without sequelae) or until considered stable by [CONTACT_093] (in consultation with the medical 
monitor in situations of uncertainty ).  
The reason for early discontinuation of dosing will be captured in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ).   
7.4.2. Study Pausing Rules  
If the following criterion is met, further dosing of all participants will be paused.  
• Two or more participants experience a grade 3 or higher AE in the same Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class deemed at least 
possibly related to the study drug by [CONTACT_413297]. 
• One grade 5 AE (death) deemed at least possibly related to the study drug by [CONTACT_413298].  
At that time, the medical monitor, and the BARDA Pharmacovigilance SME  and/or BARDA 
Medical Officer will convene to discuss and review these cases. The site investigator may be present at these meetings to provide additional information. After this review, it may be decided 
to either continue to pause dosing pending review of additional data, resume dosing as specified in the protocol, modify the study, or terminate the study. As the trial sponsor, BARDA will make 
the final decision.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Suspension or Termination  
BARDA retains the right to suspend, modify, or terminate  the study at any time. In case of 
premature termination or suspension and safety review of the study, Allucent will promptly 
inform the investigator of the termination or suspension of the study and the reason for termination or suspension, and the clinical site will inform the institutional review board (IRB).  
This study may be prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause, including but not limited to:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  35  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be evaluated utilizing the assessments defined in this section. If deemed clinically 
necessary, additional safety assessments not currently specified in the protocol may be performed at the discretion of the site investigator in consultation with the medical monitor and 
BARDA.  
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
In order to define a baseline for potential AEs, the demographics and medical history of each 
participant  will be collected at the Screening Visit.  
12.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements, including oral temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (after the participant  is seated for at least 5 minutes), will be 
collected at Screening, Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose), and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose) prior to any blood 
draws. Post- dose automated blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be recorded on the 
opposite arm from blood collection every 15 ± [ADDRESS_520727] hour, every 20 ± 5 minutes 
for the second hour, and every 30 ± [ADDRESS_520728] and fourth hours and thereafter as 
deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_413307]. Vital signs may be repeated at an Unscheduled or Early Termination (ET) Visit per the investigator’s discretion.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], if regular, may be assessed over 30 seconds and doubled, but in no case will it 
be assessed over a period of less than 30 seconds. If the respi[INVESTIGATOR_413254], it will be 
assessed over 60 seconds.  
12.1.3. Weight and Height  
Participant ’s height and weight will be measured at the Screening Visit . Body mass index (BMI) 
will be derived  automatically  from height and weight measurements in the electronic data 
capture system.  Participant’s weight will be assessed  again at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 
2 (Day 8 Pre-dose). Weight may be measured at an Unscheduled or ET Visit per the 
investigator’s discretion.  
12.1.4. Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit to assess and confirm 
eligibility. The examination will include a general assessment of the skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, 
throat, neck, oral cavity, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal 
system/extremities, and a neurological (cranial nerve examination, including pupi[INVESTIGATOR_413255], eye movements, and deep tendon reflexes) examination. A symptom-based physical examination 
may be performed at dosing visits, or at an Un scheduled or ET Visit per the investigator’s 
discretion.  In general, clinically significant abnormal findings are expected to be associated with 
an item recorded in the participant’s medical history (when detected at Screening) or as an AE (when detected after Screening).

repeated as needed  during Visit 1 (Day [ADDRESS_520729]-dose) and Visit 2 (Day [ADDRESS_520730]-dose) . ECGs may 
also be performed at an Unscheduled or ET Visit per the investigator’s discretion. ECGs will be 
reviewed by a medically qualified indi vidual to verify whether any abnormalities are clinically 
significant. In general, clinically significant abnormal ECGs are expected to be associated with 
an item recorded in the participant’s medical history (when detected at Screening) or as an AE 
(when detected after Screening).    
12.1.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
At the Screening Visit, v enous blood and urine will be collected for all participants for Screening 
laboratory a ssessments. All clinical laboratory assessments provided in this section  will be

Concomitant medications will also be reviewed during the Follow-Up telephone contact [CONTACT_413308].  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered drug related [21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 312.32(a)]. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (Integrated Addendum 
to International Council for  Harmonisation [ICH] E6[R1]: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
[GCP] E6[R2]).  
Laboratory results and vital sign excursions of any magnitude will be defined as AEs if they are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_6962]. A lab or vital sign result should generally be considered clinically significant and an AE if, regardless of degree out of range, it 
has a reasonable probability of reflecting or contributing to a disturbance of homeostasis or 
pathological pr ocess or outcome.  
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the dr ug and the AE. A SAR implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a 
drug [21 CFR 312.32(a)]. 
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the package inserts for the study 
drugs or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the site investigator or  BAR DA, it 
results in any of the following outcomes [21 CFR 312.32(a)]: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse event that in the view of the site investigator or BARDA, places 
the participant at immediate risk of death. This does not, however, include an event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413257]. 
Emergency room visits and observational admissions of under 24 hours, in themselves, 
do not qualify as SAEs. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
HHS/ASPR/BARDA   SABER  
Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February  2024 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  39  • Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience, when based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant, or the participant may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
12.3. Collection, Recording, and Grading Severity of Adverse Events 
12.3.1. Collection of Adverse Events  
Adverse events of any type described above may be discovered through a variety of methods: 
• Observing the participant 
• Questioning the participant with standard nonleading questions to elicit any medically 
related changes in their well -being (e.g., Have you been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any 
accidents, used any new medications, or changed any medications [both prescription and OTC]?)  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant 
• An abnormal value or result from a clinical (e.g., vital signs) or laboratory evaluation  
12.3.2. Recording Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will record AEs on the eCRF. SAEs must be reported to Rho pharmacovigilance personnel within 1 business day of the site’s awareness of the event. For 
the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the participant ’s condition after signing 
informed consent and up to completion of the follow- up period after the last administration of 
study drug (i.e. , through Follow-up [ Day 15]) will be considered an AE and must be recorded. 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as A Es occurring after the participant receives at least one 
dose of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. AEs will be followed per the below criteria: 
• AEs judged at least possibly related to study drug will be followed to resolution (with or without sequelae) or until considered stable by [CONTACT_093] (in consultation with the 
medical monitor in situations of uncertainty ).  
• AEs judged unrelated to study drug will be followed to resolution (with or without 
sequelae) or, if not resolving, until considered stable by [CONTACT_093] (in consultation 
with the medical monitor in situations of uncertainty ), or until the end of the participant’s 
study participation, whichever comes first.  
12.3.3. Grading Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded as defined by [CONTACT_413309]- CTCAE 
Manual Version 5.0. AEs will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following 
standards in the NCI -CTCAE manual:  
Grade 1 = mild AE 
Grade 2 = moderate AE  
HHS/ASPR/BARDA   SABER  
Protocol BP-C-24-[ADDRESS_520733] be submitted to Rho using the SAE reporting procedures 
described in Section 12.3.2.  
12.7. Reporting Other Safety Information  
Site investigators should promptly notify Rho, Allucent, BARDA, and the IRB when an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others, which is not otherwise reportable 
as an AE, is identified.

PK analysis population will be used for all PK analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol population will include all participants who are randomized, receive atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413260], and have PK 
samples collected for both periods. In addition, participants with major protocol deviations may 
be excluded if it is determined that the deviations affect the integrity of PK data. Each 
participant ’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of administration  for the 
applicable period . Primary and secondary analys es will be repeated in the per protocol 
population if it differs from the PK analysis population. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 
study drug dose. Each participant’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of 
administration for the applicable period.  The safety population will be used for all safety 
displays.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Analyses  
No exploratory analyses are planned. 
13.2. Sample Size Considerations  
The target sample size for randomization for this study is approximately  46 participant s, 
allowing for a 20% dropout rate that would result in approximately 36 evaluable participant s 
(approximately 18 per dosing sequence) within the per protocol population. Additional participants may be randomized if participants are withdrawn prior to receiving one or both 
doses of study drug (Section  8.2.2).   
The sample size was determined for an equivalence test of the ratio of means using two one-
sided tests on data from a two -period cross-over design. In the previous PK study of SL 
administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BP -C-[ZIP_CODE]),
[ADDRESS_520735] deviation for the dose-adjusted log10 
difference in high (1.0 mg) versus low (0.5 mg) SL dosing for AUC ∞ and C max were 0.[ADDRESS_520736] deviations we re conservatively multiplied by a factor of 
1.25 to determine power and sample size for this study. Corresponding coefficients of variance were estimated as 0.212 and 0.304 for AUC
∞ and C max, respectively. A sample size of 36 
achieves greater than 99% power to test bioequivalence for AUC ∞ and 86% power for C max at the 
0.05 significance level when the true ratio of means is 1.0 and the equivalence limits are 0.80 and 1.25. Even if the true ratio of means are within ±5% of 1.0, the study still maintains 96% and 
77% power for AUC
∞ and C max, respectively.  
13.3. Statistical Considerations  
13.3.1. Covariates 
Due to the small sample size and cross-over design of this study, analyses adjusted for additional 
covariates beyond those specified for the primary analysis are not planned. 
13.3.2. Multicenter Studies  
This is a single center study  thus study data will be analyzed as a whole.  
13.3.3. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  
HHS/ASPR/BARDA   SABER  
Protocol BP-C-24-[ADDRESS_520737] procedures will be used to ensure that the data are as complete and accurate as possible. 
All descriptive summaries will be based upon all available data, and no imputation will be done. 
13.4. Procedures for Documenting Deviations from Planned Analyses  
The principal features of the design of this study and of the plan for statistical analysis of the data are outlined in this protocol. Additional details will be included in the SAP before initiating 
analyses. Any changes to that plan will be documented in  the final clinical study report and will

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  47  15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QU ALITY ASSURANCE  
Quality assurance (QA) includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to 
ensure that the clinical study is performed , and the data are generated, documented (recorded), 
and reported according to International Council for  Harmoni sation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) and local/regional regulatory standards.  
To ensure the reliability of study data, the participating site(s) will have a plan in place to 
describe:  
• routine internal quality control (QC) and QA activities for the purposes of measuring, 
documenting and reporting study conduct, protocol adherence, human subjects’ 
protections, and reliability of the protocol- driven data collected;  
• a process for addressing in a timely manner any data quality issues (i.e., collecting, 
recording and reporting data), systemic issues (i.e., protocol conduct, non-
compliance, human subject protections), and implementation of corrective and preventative action ( CAPA) procedures.  
A quality assurance representative from BARDA (or designee), who is independent of and separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arrange audits of the clinical study by [CONTACT_46389]. These audits may include on site or remote 
audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required for the purpose of 
these periodic audits.  
15.1. Data Quality Assurance  
Data collected at the study site will be entered accurately and contemporaneously by [CONTACT_367201] a 21 CFR 11-compliant, internet- based, remote data entry system, which is backed up 
nightly. Data will be provided using the participant’s unique identification number, not name [CONTACT_224203]; Rho will not collect personally identifying information such as the participant’s name [CONTACT_53266]. Participants will provide demographic information such as biological sex 
at birth, race, ethnicity, and age . All elements of data entry (e.g., time, date, verbatim text, and 
the person performing the data entry) will be recorded within the remote data entry system’s audit trail to allow all data changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations. Data collected by [CONTACT_413317] s ecure data transfer procedures. The analysis 
datasets will incorporate data from both sources. Data col lected by [CONTACT_413318]. 
Clinical data management and data cleaning procedures (e.g., resolving errors and 
inconsistencies in the data) will be performed in accordance with applicable Rho and/or BARDA 
standards and validation plans to ensure the integrity of the data. Adverse events (including 
SAEs) and concomitant medication terms will be coded using the MedDRA and the World Health Organization  Drug dictionaries, respectively.  
After study monitors verify the data and prior to the final study analysis, the investigator must sign each eCRF at the participant level to confirm the integrity of the  data recorded.

15.2. Study Monitoring  
Site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well- being of trial participants are 
protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct 
of the trial is in compliance with the currently IRB/IEC ap proved protocol/amendment(s), ICH 
GCP, and applicable regulatory requirement(s). Clinical monitoring also verifies any critical 
study procedures are completed following specific instructions in ancillary documents referenced 
in the protocol. 
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_175043]’s authorized representatives at Allucent . 
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a monitoring plan. The monitoring plan 
describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, 
at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to, review  of regulatory files, accountability 
records, eCRFs, ICFs , medical a nd laboratory reports, site study drug storage records, training 
records, and protocol and GCP compliance. Site monitors will have access to the participating site facilities , study personnel, and all study documentation according to the monitoring plan. 
Study monitors will meet with site investigators to discuss any problems and outstanding issues, and will document site visit findings and discussions. 
15.3. Protocol Deviations 
15.3.1. Protocol Deviation Definition  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the IRB-approved study protocol, ICH GCP guidelines, or protocol- specific M anual (s) of P rocedures (MOP s). Any deviation that affects the 
rights or safety of the participant or the integrity of the data will be considered a major protocol 
deviation. Prospective permission to deviate from protocol requirements , also known as protocol 
waivers or exemptions, will not be granted for this study.  
15.3.2. Reporting and Managing Deviations 
The site investigator has the responsibility to identify, document, and report deviations. Protocol 
deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study 
conduct review. All deviations, regardless of the cause, must be docum ented in accordance with 
GCP . Documentation at a minimum, will include the date the deviation occurred, the date it was 
identified, a description of the deviation, whether the deviation resulted in an AE or SAE , and 
documentation of a corrective action plan. In addition, the site investigator will report noncompliance to the IRB /IEC , as applicable.  
Rho, Allucent, and/or BARDA may request discussion with the site investigator to determine the effect of any major protocol deviation on a study participant and his/her further study 
participation, the effect of the deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.

16.3. Written Informed Consent 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial and continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation. Before any study procedures 
are performed, informed consent will be obtained and documented. P otential participants will 
receive a concise and focused presentation of key information about the study, verbally and with 
a written consent form. The key information about the purpose of the study, the procedures and 
experimental aspects of the study, study interventions, study drugs , probability for random 
assignment to dosing schedules, risks and discomforts, the expected duration of the participant’s 
participation in the trial, any expected benefits to the participant, and alternative treatments and procedures that may be available to the participant. The explanation will be organized and 
presented in lay terminology and language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate.  
Participants will receive an explanation as to whether any compensation and any medical 
treatments are available if injury occurs, and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained. Participants will be informed of the anticipated financial expenses, 
if any, to the participant for participating in the study, as well as any anticipated prorated 
payments, if any, to the participant  for participating in the study. They will be informed of whom 
to contact (e.g., the site investigato r) for answers to any questions relating to the research project.

 a Washouts of 6 ±  [ADDRESS_520755] prior to each dose of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], unless the criterion is specified as only being ev aluated at Screening.  
d Weight only will be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose). Weight may also be measured at an ET or U nscheduled Visit per the 
investigator’s discretion.  
e All participants  will undergo a physical examination at Screening. The examination will include a general assessment of the skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, 
neck, oral cavity, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities, and a neurological (cranial nerve examination, 
including pupi[INVESTIGATOR_413255], eye movements, and deep tendon reflexes) examination . 
f At Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose), Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose), ET, and Unscheduled visits, the investigator may perform symptom -based physical examinations at their 
discretion.  
g Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be obtained prior to each dose of study drug . Post -dose automated blood pressure 
and heart rate measurements will be recorded on the opposite arm from blood collection every 1 5 ± [ADDRESS_520756] hour, every 20 ± 5 minutes for the 
second hour, and every 30 ± [ADDRESS_520757] and fourth hours , and thereafter as deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_413321]. Vital signs may also be performed at an Unscheduled  or ET Visit per the investigator’s discretion.  
h At Visit 1 (Post- dose) and Visit 2 (Post- dose), an ECG may be performed for any complaints of chest discomfort, lightheadedness, and/or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_413288]’s discretion and repeated as needed . 
i An ECG will be performed at an ET or Unscheduled Visit if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
j Urine drug screen will include tests for amphetamines, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  
k Clinical laboratory assessments performed at the Screening Visit will include CBC with differential (red blood cell, total and differential white blood cell, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count), Chem 7 panel (blood urea nitrogen, total carbon dioxi de, creatinine, glucose, chloride, potassium, sodium), liver 
function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin ), and TSH  with reflex to T4 .  
l Clinical laboratory assessments may be performed at an ET or Unscheduled Visit per the investigator’s discretion .  
m A urine POC  pregnancy test will be conducted for all women of childbearing potential at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose). Results from 
all tests must be negative to proceed with dosing.  
n A urine POC  pregnancy test may be performed on females of childbearing potential at an ET or Unscheduled Visit if pregnancy is suspected.  
o Participants  must have fasted from food and drink for [ADDRESS_520758] that has 
the potential to interfere with SL atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413289] (e.g., candy, chewing gum, mints, etc .) for 2 hours prior to study drug administration .  
p Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at time 0 (pre -dose) and at [ADDRESS_520759]- dose at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 4, 6, and 
8 hours.

Protocol BP-C-24-[ADDRESS_520760] (PREP Act) and the Declaration issued by [CONTACT_293368] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under that Act. Under the PREP Act and the 
Declaration, covered persons (such as manufacturers, distributers, program planners, and other 
qualified persons who prescribe, administer or dispense study drug) are immune from liability from the administration, or use of a covered countermeasure, s uch as atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . The PREP Act 
provides immunity for covered persons from liability, unless the injury was caused by [CONTACT_154389].  
The PREP Act also established the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to  
provide compensation for serious injuries or death that occur as the direct result of the  
administration or use of certain countermeasures. Any requests for compensation must be filed  
within one year of the administration or use of the covered countermeasure. Requests for 
Benefits must be made to the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Countermeasures 
Injury Compensation Program ( http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/) by [CONTACT_154390] a Request for Benefits Form 
and all required medical records and supporting documentation. Additional  information on filing 
a Request for Benefits is available on the CICP’s website at  http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/. 
Compensation may then be available for reasonable and necessary medical benefits, lost wages and/or death benefits to eligible individuals for certain injuries in  accordance with regulations 
published by [CONTACT_154391] (found at 42 CFR part 110). 
If an individual suffers a serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a  
covered countermeasure in this study, the individual, the individual’s legal or personal 
representative, the administrator/executor of a deceased individual’s estate, or certain survivors  
may request benefits from the CICP. A serious physical injury means an injury that warranted  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (whether or not the person was actually hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or that led to a significant loss of function or disability. The CICP is the payer of last resort. This means that it only covers  
expenses or provides benefits that other third- party payers (such as health insurance, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, or Workers’ Compensation programs) do not have an obligation to pay. 
If the Secretary of HHS does not make a final determination on the individual’s request within  
[ADDRESS_520761] is reduced by [CONTACT_92229]’s 
compensation available to the injured indi vidual. Awards for non- economic damages, such as 
pain, suffering, physical impairment, mental anguish, and loss of consortium are also limited. If 
the individual accepts compensation, or if there is no willful misconduct, then the individual does 
not have a tort claim that can be filed in a US Federal or a State court.

Approach & Methods  
D1. Study Overview  
The overall goal of this  randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a culturally and 
linguistically modified , individually  tailored  lifestyle intervention to reduce excess gestational weight gain 
(GW G), increase postpartum weight loss, and improve maternal metabolic status among 
overweight/obese Hispanic women. Specific aims are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on 1) GWG and postpartum weight loss, 2) pregnancy and postpartum biomarkers of insulin resistance (i.e., glucose, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA, leptin, adiponectin), 3)  postpartum biomarkers of cardiovascular risk (i.e., blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], blood 
pressure), 4) of fspring outcomes (i.e., anthropometric measures and biomarkers of insulin resistance), and 5) to 
evaluate the cost -effectiveness of  the intervention per average incremental improvement in the outcome 
variables. Overweight/obese Hispanic women will be recru ited in early pregnancy ( around 10 wks gestation) 
and randomly assigned to a Lifestyle  Intervention (n=150) or a Comparison Health and Wellness (control) 
Intervention (n=150). The intervention will  utilize exercise (R01NR011295) and dietary intervention ma terials 
(R18DK067549) culturally adapted for  Hispanics and shown to be efficacious in our previous controlled trials 
in this ethnic group. Multimodal contacts  (i.e., in -person, telephone counseling, and mailed print -based 
materials) will be used to deliver the intervention  during pregnancy ( ~12 wks gestation to delivery) continuing 
into postpartum ( ~6 wks to 6 mos postpartum);  follow -up will continue for one year  postpartum. Targets of the 
intervention are to achieve Institute of Medicine  Guidelines for GWG  and postpartum weight loss; ACOG 
guidelines for physical activity through increasing  walking and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a more active lifestyle; and 
reduction in total calories by [CONTACT_43638] a balanced healthy diet in compliance with American Diabetes Association guidelines. The intervention draws from Social  Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model 
and includes strategies for partner and/or family support to  address the specific social, cultural, and economic 
challenges faced by [CONTACT_632402].  Measures of compliance will include actigraphs and 
Hispanic food frequency questionnaires. The proposed project builds upon the expertise of the investigative team in conducting randomized controlled trials of  exercise interventions among Hispanic pregnant wom en 
(R01 DK074876) and dietary interventions among low -income Hispanics with type 2 diabetes (R18 
DK0658850) and can readily be translated into clinical  practice in underserved and minority populations.  
  
D2. Study Population & Eligibility Criteria  
The study will be based at the ambulatory obstetrical practices of Baystate Medical  Center, a large 
tertiary care facility in Western [LOCATION_005] that serves a socioeconomically diverse population; 4,300 infants are delivered annually, 57% are Hispanic (predomin antly from Puerto Rico with ~58% having income <$15,000 
per year). Eligible women will be Hispanic, overweight or obese  (BMI >25 kg/m2), and 16- 45 years of age. We 
will exclude women with 1) prepregnancy BMI<25 kg/m2, 2)  history of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or 
chronic renal disease, 2) contraindications to participation in moderate physical activity or to a low -fat/high -
fiber diet (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis), 3) inability to  read English or Spanish at  a 6th grade level, 4) 
<16 or >45 yrs of age, 5) > 20 wks gestation, 6) current  medications which adversely influence glucose 
tolerance, 7) not planning to continue to term or deliver at the  study site, or 8) pregnant with twins or triplets.  
Women who have a very early preterm birth  (<34 wks ), a miscarriage, or a still birth  after enrollment or a 
stillbirth will be excluded  Women who become pregnant again in the year following delivery will be censored 
at the time of their positive pregnancy test.  
   
D3. Recruitment, Baseline Assessment, and Sample Size  
Bilingual (Spanish and English) and bicultural health educators will recruit women at the first prenatal 
care visit (~10 wks gestation). Women will be informed of the aims/procedures of the project, sign an informed  
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 3 of 35   consent, and complete a screening form to determine eligibility. The baseline assessment  will be collected via  
standardized questionnaire and the pregnancy blood sample will be taken (see Figure 1).  Expectations for the 
study and a  contacts schedule (face -to-face meeting, mailings, booster telephone calls) will be reviewed. Each 
assessment  and interview  completed is associated with a gift card for a total of up to  $360, to be handed out 
after completing the study component. 
Based on observed rates in our 2 trials (R01DK074876 and ASPH /CDC S3948), we conservatively 
expect to [ADDRESS_844284] 10% of  women to leave the New England 
area,  deliver elsewhere, or withdraw during pregnancy, and therefore expect 300 participants (150 in each 
intervention ar m) at the time of delivery. W e calculate that 4%  of women will be excluded for very early 
preterm birth  (<34 wks), miscarriage, or stillbirth resulting  in [ADDRESS_844285] that  an additional 8% of women will be lost to follow -up due to withdrawal or 
movement out of the New England area. Women who become pregnant again will be censored. Therefore, we 
expect 264 women and children at  1 yr postpartum.  
Bilingual (Spanish and English) and bicultural hea lth educators will recruit women at the first prenatal 
care visit (~10 wks gestation). Women will be informed of the aims/procedures of the project, sign an informed  
consent, and complete a screening form to determine eligibility.  
The recruitment sites will include the Wesson Women’s Clinic, Baystate Midwifery and Women’s 
Health, Baystate Maternal -Fetal Medicine and the Baystate Perinatal Diagnostic Center.  Screening is done 
prior to the patient’s visit by a research assistant.  A Centricity appointment report is reviewed which provides all women with OB appointments in the above locations. This report has the patients’ name, medical record number, date of birth, ethnicity, last menstrual period, appointment reason, appointment time and location.   
Based o n information from the Baystate nutritionist and the Centricity roster, the research assistants will 
develop a potential participant list. This list will be maintained as a project on the UMASSMED  REDCap 
server. This project will only be accessible to Bays tate IRB approved staff. The pre -screened patients are then 
approached to determine if they are interested in participating in the study.  If they are not eligible, the research 
assistant enters their status and/or reason for ineligibility.  If women are e ligible and interested, they will be 
informed of the aims and procedures of the project, sign an informed consent and HIPAA release, and the research assistant will initiate study procedures. If this cannot be completed in person, it will be completed over  
the telephone.   
One purpose of the potential participant list is to create a "Do Not Approach" report which recruiters would 
be able to review prior to approaching subjects. Prenatal patients have frequent visits and there are several recruiters for this  study.  A REDCap report will be produced which will be compared with the daily 
appointment report, so that recruiters can avoid re -approaching subjects who have already been recruited, have 
refused or have been determined to be ineligible, thereby [CONTACT_54950] g potential participant burden.  In addition, at 
the conclusion of the study the data from this the potential participant list will be used to provide counts of subjects approached but found ineligible and their reason for ineligibility. The purpose for th is data is to better 
describe the non -participants which will help determine any potential selection bias in this study.  After the de -
identified counts are tallied, the results will be sent to UMASS and the potential participant list will be destroyed. Only the Baystate PI [INVESTIGATOR_632383]. Identified data from this list will never be sent outside of Baystate.

D.4. Ret ention   
 
V3 – June [ADDRESS_844286] of retaining participants. Central to our retention strategy are 
bicultural/bilingual health educators that can build rapport with participants as well as materials that are 
culturally congruent (developed based on focus groups among Hispanic women, 3R01DK074876, R21NR009864, DK0658850). To further ensure retention, prior to randomization, the health educators clearly delineate the requirements of the study. Continued contact [CONTACT_632403] (e.g., telephone calls, mailings, and assessments) also improves retention. In addition, the proposed study design facilitates high retention:  1) Enrollment occurs prior to delivery, a time period during which we have a track r ecord of succ ess in 
recruitment.  
2) the postpartum face -to-face meeting takes place at the routine 6 wk  postpartum visit and adherence is 
facilitated by [CONTACT_632404], cafeteria vouchers, and the 2006 Mass insurance reform law providing free health care insurance for residents earning <150% of the federal poverty level. However, if a woman does not intend to attend this visit, the health educator will meet the women at locations outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with consideration for the participant’s and the health educator or assessors level of comfort (i.e., their pediatrician’s office, their home, a community center). Locations will be selected for privacy (for example, an unused exam room at a pediatrician’s office) and only staff who have experience making home visits will be permitted to complete home visits.  
3) The  6 mos and 1 yr postpartum assessments will be conducted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371228] a location outside the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632384]’s and the health educator or assessors level of comfort  
4) Approxim ately 5% of participants in our prior pregnancy cohorts left the Springfield area after delivery; 
however, travel funds are budgeted for assessors to travel to the broader tri -state area (MA, NY, CT)  if 
necessary.  
5) Delivering the intervention does not rely upon women remaining in the immediate area during the postpartum year as it is based upon tested mailed print -based materials and telephone contacts. In  addition to 
providing home/cell/work numbers, women will be asked to provide the contact [CONTACT_19297] a  person close 
to them. Pre -paid cell phone time will be provided as an additional incentive. 
 D.5. Randomization  
Immediately prior to randomization  (~12 weeks GA) , participants will be evaluated for study inclusion by 
[CONTACT_632405]. If they answer yes, their 
medical records will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Markenson (Co -Investigator, and Director of Maternal/Fetal Medicine 
at Baystate). Eligible patients will be randomized into either the Lifestyle Intervention vs. the Health and Wellness Comparison Group. Randomization will be  stratified based on age (<30, >30 years) and pre -
pregnancy BMI (overweight >25- <30 kg/m2 vs. obese >30 kg/m2). Within each strata, a blocked randomization 
will b e used such that both treatment groups will be  assigned an equal number of times in each set of [ADDRESS_844287] resulted in short and long term weight loss.
122, 123 The interve ntion is based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)124 and the Transtheoretical 
Model (TTM)125 and includes strategies for partner and/or family support to address the specific social, cultural, 
and economic challenges faced by [CONTACT_632402]. Based on findings from our research group, 
the intervention addresses culture -specific beliefs concerning safe and  appropriate foods, physical activity 
during and after pregnancy and how family may influence adherence to recommended gestational weight gain guidelines.
107,126-128. The intervention begins in early  pregnancy (~ 12 weeks gestation) and continues through a  
year postpartum. It consists of 3 in-person sessions, 9 phone calls and 14 mailings (see Figure 1).  
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 6 of 35   Overall Goals: are to achieve IOM Guidelines f or gestational weight gain, postpartum weight loss, and 
improve maternal metabolic status by [CONTACT_632406] 1) gestational weight gain within  guidelines 
based on pre -pregnancy BMI;75 2) postpartum weight reduction to pre -pregnancy weight if  pre-pregnancy BMI 
was in the normal range, or achieve a 5% reduction from pre -pregnancy weight if  pre-pregnancy BMI was 
overweight/obese, 3) at least 150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity such as brisk walking, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_22448],129 and 4) reduction in total energy intake by [CONTACT_43638] a  balanced healthy diet as 
recommended by [CONTACT_203292].130 
 
 D.7. Theoretical Framework  
The intervention draws from Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model and takes into account 
findings by [CONTACT_632407], cultural, economic, and environmental resources as well 
as challenges faced by [CONTACT_632408].  
 The Transtheoretical Model was originally developed by [CONTACT_430281]. to help understand how and 
when individuals make behavior change.
111 According to this model, individuals adopting a new behavior move 
through a series of stages: Precontemplation (not intending to make changes), Contemplation (considering a 
change), Preparation (making small changes), Action ( actively engaging in the behavior) and Maintenance 
(sustaining the change over time). Also included in this model are processes of change which constitute 
strategies that individuals use to help make changes in their behavior.   
 Theory- driven interventions using the Stages of Motivational Readiness for Change Model and Social 
Cognitive Theory have been shown to be effective for exercise adoption and dietary change.13 Interventions 
matched to the individual’s stage of motivational readiness for physical activity adoption have been 
recommended and utilized106, [ADDRESS_844288] been found to be more effective than non- targeted interventions.15  
Using Social Cognitive Theory, the intervention will target patients’ perceptions/beliefs as well as their 
behavioral pat terns. Central to Social Cognitive Theory is the construct of self -efficacy, an individual’s belief in 
his/her ability to perform a specific behavior in a specific situation (e.g., selecting low -fat food for lunch during 
a stressful day). Social Cognitive Theory posits that individuals develop self -efficacy for specific behaviors 
through their own ability to perform the behavior in a given situation (mastery experiences), watching others 
perform the behavior in specific situations (modeling), and by [CONTACT_632409].  
Our intervention will provide a variety of opportunities for mastery experiences, modeling and verbal 
persuasion to enhance self -efficacy for self -management.  
 
 
D.8. Inter vention: Pregnancy  Phase (~12 weeks gestation –  delivery ) (Figure 1)  
The intervention will start with a face -to-face session building upon the usual prenatal care received by 
[CONTACT_632410] (see “Usual Care”  below). Goal setting will emp hasize strategies to mobilize 
family and social support. As one example, themes identified in focus groups among Latinas  identified the need 
for partner support and, in response, our print -based materials incorporate partner and/or  family negotiations 
strategies from the marital therapy field.
131, 132 The session includes administration of  questionnaires that 
facilit ate tailoring the intervention. T he session will target knowledge and attitudes regarding gestational weight 
gain, physical activity and nutrit ion during pregnancy, with the goal of moving women over the continuum of 
pre-contemplation to  contemplation and preparation. Women will be advised in accordance with the IOM  
guidelines for gestational weight gain, ACOG guidelines for pregnancy physical ac tivity, and ADA guidelines 
for diet. This session will be followed over the remainder of pregnancy (Figure 1) by [CONTACT_632411], 
individually -tailored, motivationally targeted Mailed Print -Based Intervention Materials and Booster Telephone 
Counseling Sessions which will address gestational weight gain management . Each mailed component is in 
Spanish and English and is written at a 6th grade reading level. Quality control procedures ensure that stage of 
change and social cognitive constructs are  consiste ntly represented in all intervention materials. Systems created 
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 7 of 35   in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], “Estudio V IDA,” ensure  that all mailings (i.e., physical activity and dietary intervention 
materials) are synchronized such that  participants receive them at the same time . Telephone sessions facilitate 
review of progress toward the weight gain goal and provide 1) motivationally -based individualized feedback 
(i.e., problem -solving of  challenges such as balancing caregiver/household responsibilities, cultural norms of 
self-sacrifice, social support, partner/family negotiation, and neighborhood safety), 2) review of weight gain 
grids and activity and dietary logs to evaluate progress toward behavioral goals, and 3) new goal setting. At ~34 
wks gestation a face to face session, with the goal of preparation for the Postpartum Phase, will target 
knowledge and attitudes  regarding postpartum weight loss and type 2 diabetes prevention. 
 
 D.9. Intervention: Postpartum  Phase ( ~6 wks postpartum  - ~7 months postpartum ) (Figure 1)  
The pos tpartum  phase will start with a face -to-face session. Counseling will include the development of 
individualized postpartum weight loss, physical activity, and dietary goals as described above. This session will be followed by [CONTACT_632411], individua lly-tailored, motivationally targeted Mailed Print -Based 
Intervention Materials and Booster Telephone Counseling Sessions. Each mailed component is in Spanish and English and is written at a 6th grade reading level. Quality control procedures ensure that s tage of change and 
social cognitive constructs are consistently represented in all intervention materials. Systems created in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], “Estudio Vida,” ensure that all mailings (i.e., physical activity and dietary intervention materials) are synchronized such that participants receive them at the same time. Telephone sessions facilitate review of progress toward the weight loss goal and provide 1) motivationally -based individualized feedback (i.e., 
problem -solving of challenges such as balancing care giver/household responsibilities, cultural norms of self -
sacrifice, social support, partner negotiation, and neighborhood safety), 2) review of weight loss grids and activity and dietary logs to evaluate progress toward behavioral goals, and 3) new goal se tting.  
  
D.10. Curriculum  
At the outset of the intervention, the health educator will set a gestational  weight gain goal based on pre -
pregnancy BMI and explain the importance of meeting weight gain guidelines. The weight -based curriculum 
will focus on pe riodic weight monitoring, graph ing and education. Participants will  be provided with a digital 
scale and be encouraged to weigh themselves at home daily and chart their weight  on a grid weekly. Emphasis 
will be placed on using the scale as an important feedback and learning tool for  how to better regulate personal 
diet and exercise behaviors. The postpartum weight loss goal of a 5%  reduction from pre -pregnancy weight if 
pre-pregnancy BMI was overweight/obese is based on a modified version of the D iabetes P revention 
Program
[ADDRESS_844289] 
this postpartum weight loss goal by [CONTACT_342310] a reduction of 1- 2 lbs/wk. The health educator will  utilize a 
checklist of motivators for w anting to lose weight specific to new mothers to highlight benefits of weight  loss 
and reinforce engagement. Mailed Stage Matched Manuals and Tip Sheets during the postpartum period include 
strategies to elicit family and social support for weight loss and  tips for managing fluctuations in weight  loss 
motivation over time.  
Physical Activity Change will be targeted via individualized week -by-week physical activity goals which 
focus on increasing, by 10%, the time spent in moderate activity as well as steps. Women will choose what  form 
of safe activity they enjoy the most or can most readily fit into their lifestyle, from dancing to walking in a  
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_632385]. The accumulation of short bouts (i.e., 10 min epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) will be encouraged. Mailed 
Stage -Matched Manuals matched to the participants’ current level of motivational readiness for change focus on 
the benefits of exercise, building social support for new behavioral patterns, and strategies for overcoming 
barriers to exerc ise specific to Hispanic  women . Based on responses to the tailoring questionnaires, 
individually -tailored computer Expert- System Feedback Reports98, 99, 101, 135 draw particular messages from a 
library of approximately 296 messages regarding motivation, self -efficacy, and cogniti ve and behavioral 
strategies for exercise adoption. Mailed Tip Sheets include topi[INVESTIGATOR_20188] “We all need a little support”, and 
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 8 of 35   “Stretching and exercising with baby” (e.g., wal king while pushing a stroller) . Pedometers (Omron) and activity 
logs are provid ed for women to as a motivational tool to increase their activity. Prior studies support the use of 
pedometers as a motivational tool for walking.[ADDRESS_844290] and based upon the woman’s caloric  
intake, breastfeeding status (during the postpartum period), and stage of change for a variety of dietary changes. 
Calories are targeted through the  identification of high -calorie, high- frequency food items in the  woman’s diet. 
Participants are provided with a Food Calorie Guide  for culturally relevant foods . Actionable behavioral 
substitutions will emphasize what to eat and what not to eat, and steps  to trying healthier  methods for preparing 
traditional ethnic recipes. Mailed Tip Sheets cover the range of eating triggers in this  population and strategies 
to manage these challenges, tips on meal planning, healthy recipes and grocery  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_285821], food label 
reading instructions with attention to cultural preferences. Participants will be  provided with measuring cups 
and instruction in tracking caloric intake on a dietary log. The primary focus  during pregnancy will be on 
decreasing high fat foods through limiting intake of energy dense foods (i.e., fast  food, high- fat snacks and 
sugar -sweet beverages) and substituting them with healthier alternatives (e.g., fruit  and vegetables). Women 
will be encouraged to decrease saturated fat intake while maintaini ng a balance of  monounsaturated fats (up to 
20% of calories) and polyunsaturated fats (up to 10% of calories); increase fiber through increasing whole 
grains, adding bran, nuts, seeds, and fruits and vegetables; replace refined grain products with whole gr ain 
products; and control portion size as recommended by [CONTACT_632412].130 The primary focus 
in the postpartum period is reduction in total caloric intake via reduced  consumption of popular calorie dense 
foods (e.g., fast food, high fat  snacks, fried foods and sugar -sweetened  beverages), reduced portion size, 
appropriate modifications in ethnic recipes, and higher fruit and vegetable  intake, as recommended by [CONTACT_23319].130 
   
 
D.11. Comparison Health & Wellness In tervention   
To ensure retention and to control for contact [CONTACT_5586], the  Comparison Health & Wellness arm receives mailed 
materials and telephone booster calls on the same  schedule as the Lifestyle Intervention arm  (Figure 1) . In this 
way, we control for conta ct time, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_632386]. These booklets 
represent high- quality, standard, low -cost, self -help material currently available to the public which focus on 
non-exercise and non- dietary topi[INVESTIGATOR_632387]. These include the ACOG  series of 
informational booklets on general issues related to health and  wellness during pregnancy (e.g., Alcohol and 
Drug Use during Pregnancy, Easing Back Pain)  and the American Academy of Pediatrics booklets on parent 
resour ces (e.g., Parenting your Infant). Hispanic control -arm participants in our prior studies  (R01DK074876, 
R01NR011295, R21NR009864) reported that these materials were of interest149 and differential dropout did not 
occur between study arms.

the informed consent form). Quality control for specimen handling will be performed monthly by [CONTACT_632413]. Samples will be assayed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nader Ri fai (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Harvard 
University) at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011], MA.  
Fasting Glucose (FG) will be measured enzymatically on the [COMPANY_002] P Modular system using [COMPANY_002] 
Diagnostics reagents (Indianapolis, IN).
155 Glucose at the concen trations of 90 and 312 mg/dL are determined in 
[CONTACT_632441]’s laboratory with a day -to-day variability of 1.7 and 1.6%, respectively. Fasting Insulin (FI) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_632414] E Modular system. The lowest detection limit of this assay is 0.2 uU/mL and the day- to-day imprecision values at concentrations of 6.36, 20.9 and 747 
uU/mL are 2.6, 2.8 and 2.5%, respectively. HOMA: Homeostasis model assessment will be calculated as [(FI x FG)/22.5] on a scale of 1- 8. The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) determination on the [COMPANY_002] P Modular system will 
be based on turbidimetric immunoinhibition using packed red cells. The day- to-day variability at values of 5.5 
and 9.1 are 1.9 and 3.0%, respectively. Total Adiponectin (Multimeric)  will be measured using an ELISA 
method from ALPCO Diagnostics Inc. (Salem, NH); day -to-day variabilities at concentrations of 9130 and 3930 
are 9.8, 10.2%, respectively. Leptin will be measured by [CONTACT_377483] -sensitive ELISA assay, an enzymatically 
amplified  "two -step" sandwich- type immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); day- to-day variability at 
concentrations of 65.7, 146 and 581 pg/mL are 5.4, 4.2 and 3.5%, respectively. Lipoprotein Profile: will be simultaneously performed on the [COMPANY_002] P Modular syst em. [CONTACT_632441]’s laboratory is certified by [CONTACT_30222]/NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program.
156 Total Cholesterol will be measured enzymatically.157 At 
cholesterol concentrations of 132.8 and 280.4 mg/dL, the day -to-day reproducibility are 1.7% (SD=2.4 mg/dL) 
and 1.6%, respectively. Triglycerides will be measured enzymatically with correction for endogenous 
glycerol.158 Triglycerides at concentrations of 84.0 and 201.8 mg/dL have a day- to-day reproducibility of 1.8% 
(SD=1.6) and 1.7% (SD=3.5), respectively. The concentration of High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol will be 
determined using a direct enzymatic colorimetric assay.159 HDL -C at the concentrations of 27.0 and 54.9

Lipoprotein Cholesterol will be determined by a homogenous direct method;160 day- to-day variabilities at 
concentrations of 90, 106, and 129 mg/dL are 3.01, 2.34 and 2.18%, respectively. The concentration of High Sensitivity CReactive Protein (hs CRP) will be determined using an immunoturbidimetric assay on the [COMPANY_002] P 
Modular system using reagents and calibrators from DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN); day -to-day variabilities of the 
assay at concentrations of 0.91, 3.07 and 13.38 mg/L are 2.81, 1.61 and 1.1%, respectively.  
 
 
D.12.2. Child Anthropometric Measures  
Child anthropometric measures will be obtained within [ADDRESS_844292], and s ubscapular  
(SS) and triceps (TR) skinfold thicknesses.  We will calculate fetal growth as birth -weight -for-gestational -age z-
score and ponderal  index (PI) as birth weight (g) x 100/birth  length (cm)3. Ponderal index in neonates is  closely 
correlated with es timates of total body  fat and thus may indirectly reflect neonatal adiposity.161 We will evaluate 
change from 0 to 6 mos and from 0 to 12 mos in weight -for-length z score (WFL -z), weight -for-age z  score 
(WFA -z), and length -for-age z score (LFA -z). We will calculate age - and sex- specific scores using U.S. 
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 10 of 35   national reference  data (National Center for Health Statistics,  CDC Growth Charts). We will use the sum of 
skinfolds (SS+TR) to estimate overall adiposity, and the ratio of skinfolds (SS/TR)  to estimate cen tral adiposity. 
These anthropometric factors correlate strongly  (r=0.84) with estimates using total body electrical 
conductivity.[ADDRESS_844293] menstrual period (LMP), date the first fetal heart beat was heard with a stethoscope,  and fundal 
height. Pregnancy weight is measured prospectively from all participants at each prenatal visit and  postpartum 
weight will be measu red by [CONTACT_632415] 0.[ADDRESS_844294] clinical 
scales using a standardized protocol. Gestational weight gain will be  calculated as the difference between 
maternal weight at delivery and pre -pregnancy weight. Rat e of weight  gain will be calculated as the difference 
between maternal weight at delivery and pre -pregnancy weight, divided by [CONTACT_632416]. 
Compliance with IOM weight gain guidelines will be  calculated by [CONTACT_632417] 2009 IOM Guidelines75 at that gestational age. Compliance will be specified as a continuous variable 
(percent of 2009 IOM Guidelines met)  or as a categorical variable: inadequate, adequate, and excessive. Finally, 
we will measure the area  under the  gestational weight gain curve (AUC) since the time of randomization.154 The 
AUC incorporates in a single  statistic not only the final weight but also the trajectory to reach it and has been 
found to be a predictor of  birthweight outcomes.154 Postpartum weight loss will be calculated as: 1) absolute 
weight change at 6 and 12 mos postpartum according to pre -pregnancy BMI, 2) percentage who retain a specific 
amount of weight over  pre-pregnancy weight, and 3) proportion whose BMI category changes fro m pre -
pregnancy BMI category as have others.59- 61 
 
 
D.12.4. Covariates  
We will consider the following factors as covariates: Social Support for diet and exercise will  be measured 
via the Social Support for Exercise (SSE). The SSE has three subscales (Famil y, Friends, Rewards/ 
Punishments) and acceptable internal consistency (alphas .61 -.91) and criterion validity.1 Clinical 
Characteristics of the Current Pregnancy: will be abstracted from the medical record utilizing customized  
software developed in our pre vious studies. Variables include: degree of abnormality on glucose tolerance  
testing during pregnancy defined as: 1) normal results on the screening 50 -g OGTT; 2) failed screening test 
with normal results on the diagnostic 100- g test; 3) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) defined as failed  screening 
test and exceeded <[ADDRESS_844295]; and 4) GDM defined as failed 50- g test and  exceeded [ADDRESS_844296];163 treatment for abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy  (e.g., diet , oral 
hypoglycemic and/or insulin); other pregnancy complications (e.g., hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, 
infection, cesarean delivery, NICU admission, Apgar score). Medical History: will include: personal history of 
GDM, family history of diabetes,  previous infant with anomalies, still birth, or macrosomia, infertility, and 
parity. Sociodemographic Factors: will include income, level of education, and health insurance; acculturation 
via the Psychological Acculturation Scale,164 language preference, and generation in the U.S. Smoking and 
Substance Use: Alcohol consumption, smoking, and drug use will be collected via questions from the 
Pregnancy Assessment Monitoring System.165 Sleep:  Pregnancy and postpartum sleep will be collected via The 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI).166 Depression: Pregnancy and postpartum depression will be assessed 
via the Edinburgh Postpartum  Depression Scale167 validated in Hispanics.168 Breastfeeding: History of 
breastfeeding and frequency and  duration of current breast feeding (i.e., exclusive breast feeding, % of mixed 
breast and formula feeding, exclusive formula feeding), timing of introduction of solids, and other breastfeeding 
behaviors and beliefs will  be assessed via the validated Infant Feeding Questionnaire.169 Postpartum Urine 
 
V3 – June [ADDRESS_844297] and  Postpartum Diabetes Screening (using ADA diagnostic criteria163) will occur at each 
postpartum assessment.  
 
 
D.12.5. Measures of Adherence  
Measure of Adherence with Exercise: Women will wear the ActiGraph GT3X -plus activ ity monitor 
(Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) on the wrist for a 4 day period at each of the 3 prenatal and 3 postpartum 
assessm ents (42 days total) . The GT3X -plus actigraph is currently being used to measure activity among 
pregnant women in NHANES and provides activity counts, steps, MET -min/week, time  in sedentary behavior, 
patterns of active and sedentary behavior, % wear time, subject position, and periods  when the device has been 
removed. Pregnancy cutpoints will be based on our prior studies.137-[ADDRESS_844298]  reported reasonable validity 
under laboratory conditions among pregnant women140 as well as under free living  conditions.141,6, 7 Assessors, 
blinded to study arm, will also administer the Pregnancy Physical Activity  Questionnaire (PPAQ) at each of the 
3 prenatal and 3 postpartum assessments. The PPAQ was developed  and validated by [CONTACT_632418] (NIH -NICHD R03 -[ZIP_CODE], PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_632388] -Taber) and recommended for use in 
pregnancy and postpartum.138 Activity -specific measures will be summed to arrive at total daily energy 
expenditure in MET -hrs/wk and categories of activity type and intensity.  
Measure of Adherence with Diet (24 -Hour Diet Recalls): Assessors, blinded to study arm, will conduct 3 
24-hour diet recalls during each assessment period.  
 
 
D.13. Measures of Acceptability/Feasibility  
 After study completion, the assessor will administer a Satisfaction Surve y which will assess a variety of 
factors relevant to the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. For example, women will be asked what 
attracted them to the study, what barriers/facilitators enabled them to continue to participate, their response to 
the intervention materials, their perspectives on the assessment materials as well as the number of measures. Women who drop out of the study will also be contact[CONTACT_5365] a similar discussion which will include asking women what we could have done to ke ep them more engaged and barriers to participation. At the end of the 
study, staff feedback will also be queried using structured satisfaction surveys.   D.14. Staff Training and Quality Control  
Recruitment, health education, and telephone assessments will  be conducted by [CONTACT_511732] 
(English/Spanish) health educators and assessors. We have built a training course based upon staff feedback and quality control during previous studies ( Estudio PARTO, The B.A.B.Y Study and Estudio VIDA) with an 
accompany ing manual which includes instruction on motivational interviewing techniques, role -playing, 
specific study protocols and scripts. Regular quality assurance and quality control reviews will include 
observations of the health educator. The observations will  be done by [CONTACT_632419] a contact. The recordings will be scheduled so that the same day as the contact, the study coordinator will be available to review the interaction with the health educator, assess the quality of th e interaction, and use 
the time as an opportunity to re -train the health educator as necessary. Assessors will be monitored in the same 
way. The audio recordings will be (audibly) identified with the participant’s study ID and contain no PHI. The recording s will be destroyed once they are reviewed. When not in use, the recorder/memory card will be kept in 
a locked container in a locked room at Baystate. If a staff person is observed departing from standard protocol, feedback and recommendations for retraini ng will be provided. The assessor will be blinded to the treatment 
assignment. The health educator will be blinded to the results of the assessor’s assessments. The medical record abstractor will be trained using the Medical Record Abstraction Manual and t raining program developed as part 
of our prior studies. The medical record abstractor will be blinded to the treatment assignment.  
 
V3 – June [ADDRESS_844299] abstraction will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_632420] 10% of the medical records twice. The abstractor will be retrained based upon the findings from this assessment. Monthly staff meetings will be attended by [CONTACT_632421], healt h educator, medical 
record abstractor, data analyst, laboratory technician, Project Manager and the Principal Investigator.  
  
D.15. Data Management  
All participants will be assigned a Study Identification code (sequentially numbered) which will be used f or 
identification purposes.  
Study personnel will have access, on an as -needed basis, to a password protected and encrypted linking file 
(stored on the network at Baystate and a secure server at the School of Public Health and Health Sciences (SPHHS) at UM ASS Amherst) which will allow for the identification of participant by [CONTACT_632422], data collection dates, date of last menstrual period (LMP), and blood specimen locators. This is necessary to allow for women to be identified and approached for follow -up visits and meetings, as well 
as to be assessed over the phone, and for chart review. 
No participant data will be individually identified or released to anyone other than the study investigators.  
Data collection, including medical record abstraction, will take place using a dedicated REDCap project on 
the UMASSMED REDCap server. This project will be controlled and maintained by [CONTACT_21124]. Only individuals on the approved Core Data form will have access to the REDCap projec t. Only the UMass Project 
Manager and UMass PI [INVESTIGATOR_632389]. As required, the UMass Project Manager or PI [INVESTIGATOR_632390] a study ID to allow for processing and storage in the secure UMass study database (see below). To enable data management the exported data will include dates, LMP or 
delivery date, for instance, however there will be no additional identifying information such as name, MRN, or address exported to the UMass database. Note: the REDCap  project will not contain data from biomarker 
testing or activity monitor readout; these data will be merged with data exported from REDCap by [CONTACT_632423].  
Research staff at University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD) will analyze coded responses from 
participants’ tailoring questionnaires using states of change analysis from the transtheoretical  model. They will 
then provide UMass Amherst with the tailored intervention that is most appropriate for the participant. The communication between UMass Amherst an d UCSD will be via email. UCSD research staff will not have 
access to any identifiable data.  
[CONTACT_632442] of Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632391].  [CONTACT_632443] 
will send results to [CONTACT_632444] -Taber’s team at UMass Amh erst via email.  [CONTACT_632444] -Taber’s team will store 
the lab data on secure School of Public Health and Health Sciences server with access restricted to the study team and will later merge the lab data with the data export from REDCap for analysis.    
Data from Activity Monitors is downloaded at UMass Amherst.  Activity Monitors are mailed by [CONTACT_632424], no name [CONTACT_39648].  The return address on the envelope is the the Pr incipal Investigator’s address at the University of 
[LOCATION_005], Amherst .  [CONTACT_632444]- Taber’s team will store the activity monitor data on the secure School of 
Public Health and Health Sciences server with access restricted to the study team and will lat er merge the lab 
data with the data export from REDCap for analysis.   
All other study information source documents that include identifying information (i.e. Informed Consent 
document, medical clearance form) will be secured in a locked filing cabinet in the locked Baystate Ob/Gyn 
office.  
All passwords will be at least [ADDRESS_844300] one number and one capi[INVESTIGATOR_281675].  
Safeguards for Ineligible Subjects Cohort: Using the Potential Participants Form (PPF) a research assistant

  D.16. Statistical Analysis  
Specific Aim #1, 2, 3: Impact of a Lifestyle Intervention on GWG and postpartum weight  loss; biomarkers 
of insulin resistance; postpartum biomarkers of CVD risk. The primary analysis will evaluate differences in the 
change from baseline in weight gain measures, glycemia and other biomarkers of  insulin resistance and 
cardiovascular risk factors between the groups (an intent to treat analysis). Initial analyses will describe the 
correlation of factors and investigate simple transformations for normality. The  primary analysis will be based 
on a mixed model with random subject effects, including a common mean at  baseline for the intervention 
groups, a period effect, and an intervention by [CONTACT_632425].
[ADDRESS_844302] in an analysis of 
covariance. The mixed model analysis will enab le inclusion of time varying  covariates such as depression, 
breastfeeding behaviors, and sleep, which may vary between baseline and  follow -up for subjects. Equivalence 
of the intervention groups will be assessed by [CONTACT_632426]. We will investigate established risk factors for weight gain  (e.g., parity) and glycemia as well as 
degree and treatment for abnormality on glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy (e.g., diet, oral hypoglycemic and/or insulin) as potential confounders or effect modifiers. Generally,  we will consider a change 
in the parameter estimate for the exposure (at least 15%), relative to that observed  when not controlling for the 
variable as reflective of confounding. Effect modification will be evaluated by [CONTACT_632427]. We 
will also model the relationship between measured levels of exercise,  sedenta ry behavior, and diet with each 
outcome, while adjusting for possible confounders using mixed effect  linear regression models. We will test 
hypotheses with 2- sided tests. Finally, we will compare adoption and maintenance of behavior change (i.e., 
exercise,  diet) in the intervention group relative to the control group by [CONTACT_1583] a fixed treatment group effect.  
Specific Aim #4: Evaluate the impact of a Lifestyle Intervention on the  outcomes of offspring. We will 
evaluate the impact of intervention arm on the o ffspring outcomes using the  methods described for Aim #[ADDRESS_844303] for fetal growth (i.e., BW/GA z  score).  
Specific Aim #5: Evaluate the cost -effectiveness of the Lifestyle Intervention. We will use procedures  
developed in our prior studies exa mining the cost -effectiveness of our interventions.
171-173 We will calculate the 
ratio of average dollars spent per average incremental improvement in outcome (i.e., GWG, postpartum weight  
retention, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and CVD risk). Incremental improvement will be defined as the  
mean change score from baseline for each group, adjusted for baseline values of the outcome measure and  other 
participant characteristics.  
Accounting for Missing Data: Although every effort is made to avoid missi ng data, we plan to use 
propensity score techniques174-[ADDRESS_844304] clinically significant  differences requires 300 participants (150 in  each 
intervention arm) at the time of delivery. Based on observed rates in our 2  trials (R01DK074876 and 
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 14 of 35   ASPH/CDC  S3948), we conservatively expect 10% of  women to leave the New England area,  deliver 
elsewhere, or withdraw during  pregnancy, and therefore will recruit 333 women over the 24 mos recruitment 
period. For  offspring outcomes, we calculate that 4% will be excluded for very early preterm birth  (<34 wks), 
miscarriage, or stillbirth resulting  in [ADDRESS_844305] 
that an additional 8% of women will be lost to follow -up due to withdrawal or movement out of the New 
England area. Women who become pregnant again will be censored. Therefore, we expect [ADDRESS_844306] mean difference in change from baseline in the Lifestyle Intervention vs. the 
Health & Wellness Control arm which we could de tect at 80% power using standard deviations based on our 
prior studies and the literature47, 177- 180  using 2- sided tests with a significance level of alpha=5% (NCSS PASS 
2008 software). For multiple  regression models, we assumed that  covariates accounted for 20% of the  variation. 
Tables [ADDRESS_844307] even ‘small to  medium’ mean differences, as defined by  
[CONTACT_30822],181 ranging from ~0.[ADDRESS_844308] 80%  power t o detect as small as a 2.4%  difference (Table 3) in percent change in  HbA1c between 
treatment arms. A  comparable trial among Hispanics  observed a 7.1% difference in percent change in HbA1c 
between treatment arms182 demonstrating that detecting this differe nce is well within the capability of the 
lifestyle intervention. For the categorical outcome of Compliance with IOM GWG guidelines, given our 
observation that 51% of overweight/obese Hispanic women exceeded guidelines in the study population, we 
have 80% p ower to detect a 30% reduction in risk or larger for exceeding IOM guidelines.

E. Protection of Human Subjects  
 1. Risks to the Subjects  
Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics:  
The population under study includes 333 overweight pregnant/postpartum women between the ages of 
[ADDRESS_844314] 1) prepregnancy BMI<25 kg/m2, 2)  history of type 2 
diabetes, heart disease, or chronic renal disease, 2) contraindications to participation in  moderate physical 
activity or to a low -fat/high -fiber diet (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis), 3) inability to  read English or 
Spanish at a 6th grade level, 4) < 16 or >45 yrs of age, 5) > 20 wks gestation, 6) current  medications which 
adversely influence glucose tolerance, 7) not planning to continue to term or deliver at the  study site, or 8) 
pregnant with twins or triplets. Women who have a very early preterm birth  (<34 wks), a miscarriage, or a still 
birth  after enrollment or a stillbirth will be excluded . Women who become pregnant a gain in the year following 
delivery will be censored at the time of their positive pregnancy test.  
 
Sources of Materials:  
At the time of recruitment (~10  weeks gestation), a blood sample to evaluate serum biomarkers associated 
with insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risk factors will be collected (termed “blood draw”). A total 700 microliters (uL) of serum will be collected which is equivalent to 1.5 milliliters (mL) or less than a teaspoon of whole blood. Physical activity, diet, and other covaria tes will also be assessed at recruitment. Subsequent 
assessments will be conducted at  ~24-28 weeks gestation, after 32 weeks gestation, 6- weeks postpartum, ~ 6.5-
months, and ~ 13-months postpartum. A urine pregnancy test will also be performed at the postpar tum 
assessments. Women who are identified as having a positive pregnancy test will be removed from the study at the time of their positive pregnancy test and referred to their obstetric care provider. Measurements of compliance with exercise and diet will include activity monitors (worn for a 4 -day period within each of these 
assessment time points), tracking the number of intervention sessions attended, number of booster calls participated in, number of assessments (e.g., questionnaires, blood samples) com pleted, as well as an 
assessment of degree of participation in physical activity and healthy dietary behaviors. No participants will be excluded from the study based on noncompliance. Assessments to measure other important covariates will also be collected  at these assessment time points. Subjects will be under no obligation to complete the assessments, 
activity monitoring, or blood collections. Pregnancy and postpartum medical and laboratory records will be reviewed for obstetric and medical history, clinical characteristics of the index pregnancy, and laboratory results. All data will be used specifically for research purposes.  
 Potential Risks:  
The exercise intervention focuses on increasing walking and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a more active lifestyle as per 
recommend ations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for postpartum women (ACOG 
Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. January 2002: “Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period”) and the American Diabetes Association guidelines for women with previous GD M (The American College of Sports Medicine 
and the American Diabetes Association Joint Position Statement: "Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes"). These 
recommendations include [ADDRESS_844315], if not all, days of the week. The overall goal of the dietary intervention is to reduce total calories via a diet with lower intake of calorie 
dense foods (e.g., fast food, high- fat snacks, fried foods and sugar -sweet beverages), saturated fat, and higher 
fruit and vegetable intake as r ecommended by [CONTACT_11026].  
A possible risk in this study involves the social/psychological risk for an individual resulting from 
inadvertent disclosure of confidential medical history information. Confidentiality of the data will be ensured by [CONTACT_20526] a subject identification number to each participant. All data collected in the study will be entered by [CONTACT_632428], password protected, firewall protected server located at 
 
V3 – June [ADDRESS_844316] access to the data in its raw state. All other authorized study staff will view 
coded data via forms and reports created by [CONTACT_632429]: Serum will be collected at each assessment time point. For most people, 
needle punctures to obtain blood specimens do not cause any serious problems. However, needle punctures may cause bleeding, bruising, discomfort, infections, dizziness, or fainting. To reduce this concern, the sample will be collected at a Baystate Reference Laboratory. A total 700 microliters (uL) of serum will be collected which is equivalent to 1.5 milliliters (mL) or less than a teaspoon of whole blood. Note: the (one-time) appr oximately 
5ml of blood required for the child blood draw is well below  the blood drawing limit of “the lesser of 50 ml or 3 
ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.”  
  2. Adequacy of Protection Again st Risks 
Recruitment and Informed Consent:  
A bilingual and bicultural recruiter will describe the study and its relevance to patients at the time of routine  
screening for GDM. Patients will be told that they are under no obligation to participate in this s tudy. Those  
who agree will complete a written informed consent which describes the: purpose of research, procedures, risks and discomforts, benefits, costs & compensation, alternatives to participation, patient enrollment/length of  
study, confidentiality, voluntary participation, requests for additional information, and voluntary consent.  
 Protection Against Risk: 
Prior to randomization (~ 12 wks gestation) , and again after delivery, participants will fill out the Physical 
Activity Readiness Questionnaire. I f they answer yes to any of the questions on the questionnaire, [CONTACT_632446] (Co- Investigator, and Director of Maternal/Fetal Medicine at Baystate) will evaluate the participant 
for study inclusion by [CONTACT_632430], the delivery medical  records, and/or postpartum visit 
records. It is important to note that we conservatively scheduled the onset of the Intervention Postpartum  Phase 
to not begin until [ADDRESS_844317] for the majority of women (ACOG Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. January 2002: “Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period”). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that, in the absence of complications from delivery , a mild exercise program consisting of walking, 
pelvic floor exercises, and light stretching of all muscle groups can begin in the immediate postpartum period (ACOG Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. January 2002: “Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period”). A  similar 
recommendation was made by [CONTACT_632431] (during the Intervention Pregnancy Phase). In the case that Dr . Markenson determine s there are contraindications to the lifestyle intervention, the woman 
will be excluded from the study and immediately contact[CONTACT_632432].  
Although the likelihood is low, our research team has well -established procedures for monitoring and 
responding to adverse events resulting from moderate intensity physical activity. First, during the orientation participants will be provided with contact [CONTACT_632433] (e.g., soft tissue injury). Additionally, we will be correspo nding with 
the study participants over brief time periods to obtain study -related questionnaires. As part of those 
questionnaires, participants will be asked whether any adverse event occurred. In the case of any report, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310665], who will then notify the DSMB and Institutional Review Board. In cases of injuries that interfered with functioning (i.e., ability to move about), the participant will be asked to cease activity and obtain physician clearance before continuing.  
Studies have shown the safety and efficacy of moderate exercise and weight reduction during lactation 
without affecting infant growth, milk composition (i.e., immunological component concentrations, vitamin B6, 
 
V3 – June 2014   
Page 18 of 35   essential fatty acids), or milk vo lume (ACOG Committee Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8561]. 361: “Breastfeeding: Maternal and Infant 
Aspects”). Moderate weight reduction while nursing is safe and does not compromise neonatal weight gain 
(ACOG Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. January 2002: “Exercise during Pregnancy and the Post partum Period”). Health 
educators will encourage lactating women to follow recommended guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which include exercising after the baby [CONTACT_632434];  use of a good support bra and avoidance of a sports bra because of breast compression; 
and maintenance of adequate nutrition and hydration to support the energy demands of breastfeeding and exercise (ACOG Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. January 2002: “Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period”).  
 Suicidal Ideation Protocol:  
A protocol has been developed for addressing possible suicidal ideations among participants. The Edinburgh Depression Scale asks “ The thought of harming myself has occurred to me .” All he alth educators and health 
assessors will participate in training before beginning interviews with participants , specifically in dealing with 
responses to this question. In evaluating individual participant’s needs for information/assistance related to depression, several levels of concern have been identified.  Data collectors will determine the level of concern 
for each participant and respond according to the categories below:  
 LEVEL 1 (NO REASON FOR CONCERN):  This means that the data collector has no in dication from the 
participant by [CONTACT_632435].  LEVEL 2 (CONCERN LEVEL):  Participants in this category exhibit some signs of suicidal thoughts.  An indication would be an a nswer of either ‘Yes, quite often’ or ‘Sometimes’ to the question “The thought of 
harming myself has occurred to me” from the Edinburgh Depression Scale (question 10).  Interviewers will provide these women with a resource referral sheet. They will urge th e participant to contact 
[CONTACT_632436].    Health educators and / or health assessors will then inform the study physician, Glenn Markenson, MD at ([PHONE_13151] and the Project Mana ger, Megan Ward Harvey at (413) 545- 6732. If deemed appropriate [CONTACT_632446] will then contact [CONTACT_2299]’s health care provider.  
  3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
The potential benefit to society of this stu dy could be substantial in recognizing exercise and diet as a tool  to 
prevent excessive gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention, and reduce subsequent risk of  obesity, 
type 2 diabetes, and CVD. By [CONTACT_4907], participants will  receive information about how  to 
become more physically active and improve their diets. Those in the Health & Wellness comparison group will receive high -quality, standard, low -cost, self -help material currently available to the public.  
  4. Importance of  the Knowledge to Be Gained  
The importance of the study lies in the fact that changes in modifiable risk factors may reduce the risk of  
excessive gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention, and subsequent obesity, type [ADDRESS_844318] in ethnicities,  such as Hispanics, with consistentl y high rates of pre -pregnancy overweight/obesity and low rates of 
physical  activity. The risks to participants in this study are judged to be minor. The anticipated benefits are 
great, insofar  as the results will be used to further understand the unique fa ctors related to promoting the 
 
V3 – June [ADDRESS_844319] (DSMB)  
written in concordance with the guidelines from the National Institutes of Health. The DSMB will: 1) review the research protocol and plans for data safety and moni toring, 2) evaluate the progress of the trial with biannual 
assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk  versus 
benefit, and reports from related studies, and 3) make recommendations to the IR B and investigators concerning 
continuation or conclusion of the trial. The DSMB will consist of three members including a physician who will serve as Chair  (to be named) , a statistician  (to be named) , and an outside researcher at UMASS Amherst  (to be 
name d) all of whom will be knowledgeable about the study’s content but not directly involved in the study nor 
in a supervisory role to study personnel. The DSMB will meet biannually. Prior to each meeting, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_879] a report which will include: 1) safety of the protocol participants, specifically if any adverse events have occurred; 2) validity and integrity of the data; 3) enrollment rate relative to expectation; 4) 
retention of participants; 5) data completeness; and 6) preliminar y data analysis. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632394] a written response regarding the DSMB’s approval or suspension of the study. The report will be forwarded to the Institutional  Review board. Monitoring activities by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_632395]-related adverse events would presumably be encountered.  
  Women and Minority Inclusion in Clinical Research  
The population under study include s 333 pregnant and postpartum women between the ages 16 and 45 years 
being seen for prenatal care at Baystate Medical Center. The study is an intervention  in the pregnancy and 
postpartum period among those diagnosed with abnormal glucose tolerance of pregnancy; therefore all subjects are women.  
All women are Hispanic. Hispanic women are the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. and have the 
highest rates of sedentary behavior as well as postpartum diabetes after a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Hispanics have, overall, been underrepresented in prior research.  
  
Inclusion of Children:  
Children between the ages of 16 and 21 will be included. Children younger than 16 will not be included for 2 reasons: 1) the study is a pregnancy and postpartum interve ntion among women with a history of abnormal 
glucose tolerance pregnancy, 2) modifiable determinants of type [ADDRESS_844320] applicability of hypotheses to this 
age group.

also sensitive to immunotherapy. While the initial early phase clinical trials showed promising 
results with prolonged durable response with imm une checkpoint blockade agents in TNBC, the 
number of patients who responded to  immunotherapy is fairly small.  TNBC is an aggressive form 
of breast cancer that lacks drug targets, name [CONTACT_751880] (ER), progesterone receptor 
(PR), and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_19074] r 2 (HER2). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_751812], this group of patients continues to have poor outcome with a median overall survival 
(OS) of 13 months {Anders 2008}. Due to the lack  of a validated drug target, TNBC represents 
not only a significant clinical challenge  but also a critical unmet medical need. 
1.[ADDRESS_1029226] Cancer 
Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers do not express functional cell surface 
receptors like ER, PR, and HER2. Triple-nega tive tumors are typi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a 
higher histologic grade, increased mitotic count, pushing margins of invasion, and a 
stromal lymphocytic response. Patients with TNBC often have poorer prognosis 
compared to other breast cancer subtypes. It is commonly misconceived that TNBC is 
more sensitive to chemotherapy. Although higher pathologic complete response rate (pCR) was observed in TNBC (25–45%) compar ed to luminal breast cancers (6–7%), 
patients with TNBC had worse four-year distant disease free and overall survival {Irvin & Carey 2008}. 
1.[ADDRESS_1029227] immune surveillan ce in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)  in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis 
in various malignancies. In particular, th e presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_1029228] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to do wn-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1  (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engage ment of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD 
L2). The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved. PD-1 and family members are type 
I transmembrane glycoproteins containing  an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-b ased inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (I TSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD [ADDRESS_1029229] 
from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated  lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ 
and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natu ral Killer cells. Expression has also been 
shown during thymic devel opment on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as

subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- 
hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumo rs. Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-lik e domains in the extracellular region and 
contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD- [ADDRESS_1029230] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting 
cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD-L2 is thought 
to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of can cers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 has b een suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) . This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor imm une evasion and should be considered as an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly sel ective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Ke ytruda™ (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the United Stated for the treatment of patient s with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
1.3 Immunotherapy in TNBC 
Over recent years, several studies demonstrated that the genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_751813] a set of tumor-associated antigens that the immune system can 
recognize and use to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells {Shah 2012; Stephens 
2012}. More recently, the presence of tumor-inf iltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at the time 
of the diagnosis has been shown to correla te with a significant increase in complete 
pathological response (pCR) to neoadjuv ant chemotherapy (NAC) {Denkert 2010}. 
Subsequently, TILs also has been shown to  correlate with both disease free survival 
(DFS) and OS among TNBC patients in a large adjuvant BIG 02-98 trial (Loi 2013). This 
observation was confirmed in a subsequent retrospective analysis of the Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2197 a nd 1199 trials {Adams 2014}. Although 
preclinical evidence suggests that antitumo r immunity can control TNBC progression, 
tumors progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_751814]-specific CD 8+ T cells infiltration. This paradox is 
mainly due to the exhausted nature of tumor-infiltrating T cells and the presence of 
immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. T-cell exhaustion is a result 
of the upregulation of inhibitory receptors and serves as immune checkpoints in order to 
prevent uncontrolled immune reactions. In the past few years, there are several immune 
checkpoint blockade agents that have show n promising activities across several cancer 
types, including breast cancer. In a phase Ib trial of Pembrolizumab (Keynote-012) {Nanda 2014}, a humanized anti-PD1 m onoclonal antibody, in TNBC, the overall 
response rate (ORR) was 18.5% and an additional 25.9% of patients had stable disease. Furthermore, among patients who responded, their responses appeared to be durable and 
lasted 15-40+ weeks. Another clinical tria l with anti-PD-L1, MPDL3280A9, also showed 
promising activity of immune checkpoint bloc kade agent with ORR of 33%. From a total 
of 9 evaluable patients, one patient had comp lete response (CR) and 2 patients had partial 
response (PR).

1.[ADDRESS_1029231] and Binimetinib 
Growth factor-mediated proliferative si gnals are transmitted from the extracellular 
environment to the nucleus throug h several pathways, including the 
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway {Roberts 2007}. This pathway comprises an 
evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade initiated by [CONTACT_751843], which activate the RAF kinases. Activated RAF kinases, phosphorylate and thereby [CONTACT_751844]1 and MEK2 kinases,  which in turn phosphorylate and activate 
the ERK1 and ERK2 kinases. Subsequent phosphorylation of a variety of downstream effector proteins, including transcription fact ors, by [CONTACT_751845], differentiation, migration, survival and 
angiogenesis. Aberrant signaling through th is pathway has been shown to lead to 
unconstrained cell growth and cell transformation {Yoon 2006} and is a characteristic feature of many cancers. Inappropriate ac tivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway 
can occur through a variety of mechanisms , including activating mutations in RAS and 
BRAF {Lea 2007}, activated growth factor signaling {Nakazawa 2005} and stress 
response signals {McCubrey 2000}. Preclinical studies indicate that the presence of 
mutations that activate RAS/RAF/MEK/ER K pathway signaling, typi[INVESTIGATOR_751815], NRAS and KRAS ge nes, are predictive for response to MEK 
inhibitors {Barretina 2012}. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting MEK may 
inhibit cancer signaling mediated by a wide variety of signals, making MEK an attractive 
target for the treatment of cancer and its asso ciated symptoms. The identification of an 
allosteric regulatory site on the MEK enzyme allows the design of highly specific 
inhibitor molecules {Ohren 2004}. Other than binimetinib, there are a number of approved and investigational sm all-molecule MEK inhibitors of significance that are 
undergoing clinical evaluation for different tumor types (solid and hematologic malignancies). These compounds include: trametinib, selumetinib, cobimetinib, 
rafametinib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_399163]. Trametinib ( www.fda.gov ) was the first MEK inhibitor 
approved by [CONTACT_751846] a single-agent treatment and in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with BRA FV600E or BRAFV600K mutations. 
Binimetinib (also known as binimetinib or ARRY-438162) is a potent, selective, 
allosteric small-molecule inhibitor of m itogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 
(MEK) that is uncompetitive with adenosine tr iphosphate (ATP). Binimetinib is currently 
being evaluated clinically in healthy subject s, in Noonan syndrome patients and in cancer 
patients. Previously, binimetinib has also been evaluated in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
1.[ADDRESS_1029232] of trials 
utilizing combination-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. One such target is MEK. Balko and colleagues 
{Balko 2014} evaluated genomic alterations in  tumors that may be associated TILs in 
residual tumor after NAC in TNBC. In parallel to previous studies, increased TILs are 
associated with favorable outcomes, including  DFS (p = 0.0008) and OS (p = 0.007). 
There appeared to be a trend toward redu ction in TIL level among patients who did not 
achieve pCR (p = 0.07). Using next-generati on sequencing, lower TIL level in residual 
disease after NAC was associated with genetic  alteration in the Ras/MAPK pathways, 
including KRAS, BRAF and RAF1 amplifica tions and NF1 truncations (p = 0.005). 
There was also an inverse correlation between the MEK activation signature [CONTACT_751881] (p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]). These findings suggested that the association 
between TIL levels and dysregulation of R as/MAPK pathway may be pathway specific.

The investigators further evaluate the eff ects of MEK inhibition in several TNBC cell 
lines and found that MEK inhibition, using AZD6244, up-regulates major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules in both in vitro and in vivo 
models. The investigators also went back  and evaluated the expression of HLA-A and 
HLA-DR in their patient samples and found the inverse correlation between the expression level of these MHC class I and II molecules and the MEK activation signature. However, there was also a signi ficant increase in the PD-L1 expression after 
MEK inhibition treatment, which has opposing inhibitory effects on tumor immune 
surveillance. The investigators further investigated the combination of MEK inhibitor and 
anti-PD-L1 antibody in in vivo mouse model and found that the combination can 
completely eradicate the tu mors, while each single agent only had modest effects on 
tumor growth. 
Currently, there is no clinical trial evalua ting the combination of pembrolizumab and 
binimetinib in breast cancer. Based on the intriguing preclinical data above, it is logical to 
develop and conduct a phase I/II trial of pembro lizumab in combination with binimetinib 
in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer. 
1.[ADDRESS_1029233] immunosuppressive checkpoints PD-1 or its 
major ligand PD-L1. Previous studies demonstrated that PD-L1 expression in the tumors 
appears to correlate with improved outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint 
blockade agents {Topalian, 2012}. Furtherm ore, studies also showed that immune 
checkpoint blockade agent can also incre ase tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and improve 
response to adoptive cell therapy (1). 
As described in the previous rationale se ction, MEK inhibition has been shown to 
upregulate cell surface MHC expression as well as PD-L1 in both in vivo and in vitro 
triple negative breast cancer models. Moreove r, the combination of MEK and immune 
checkpoint blockade agent were synergistic  and enhanced antitumor immune responses 
were observed in vivo breast cancer sy ngeneic mouse models {Balko 2014}. 
Nevertheless, the effects of MEK inhibitors to immune response in human remain largely 
unknown. 
To evaluate immunologic response to single agent binimetinib and the combination of 
binimetinib and pembrolizumab, several correlative studies will be carried out as 
followed: 
 
1.61 Correlative studies for tumor tissue We will perform the following correlative studies using tumor tissue. 1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: Tu mor infiltrating lymphocytes will be 
quantified based on the H&E as described (2). Furthermore, the composition 
of different subsets of lymphoc ytes will also be quantify using 
immunohistochemistry staining for CD4 for T helper cells, CD8 for cytotoxic T cells as well as CD25 and FOXP3 for regulatory T cells as we previously published (3). 
2. PD-L1 expression: PD-L1 expression in the tumor will be assessed by [CONTACT_751847] {Topalian, 2012} 
MC1632 9  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021   
 
3. Gene expression analysis: Global asse ssment of immune-related gene 
expression in pre- and post-treatment  tumors will be assessed using the 
NanoString PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel which includes 770 genes for 
24 different immune cell types and p opulations, 30 common cancer antigens 
and genes that represent all categories of immune response including key 
checkpoint blockade genes. 
4. PDJ amplification: We have recently reported that approximately 30% of patients with TNBC harbor PDJ amplification (4). Locating at chromosome 9p24.1, this amplicon encompasses JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 genes. TNBC patients with PDJ amplification had worse disease free (25.0% vs. 66.0%, p = 0.005) and overall survival (25.0% vs. 69.0%, p = 0.004). This amplicon has been previously described in the majority of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which has been reported to have rema rkable response to Nivolumab (86% 
clinical benefit rate in heavily pr etreated patients)(5). Based on these 
intriguing results, we plan to corre late PDJ amplification measured by 
[CONTACT_751848]. 
 
1.62 Correlative studies for blood 
We will perform the following correla tive studies using blood specimens. 
1. Immunoregulatory cell quantification: To evaluate the systemic immune 
response to binimetinib and binimetinib in combination with pembrolizumab, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected and quantified for CD4 
helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells, FOXP3 positive regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and NK cells. 
2. Cytokine profiling: Systemic cytokine  response before and after treatment 
will also be evaluated using Luminex Multianalyte assay which allows simultaneous quantification of multiple cytokines in a single sample. A panel 
of 17 cytokines and chemokines will be analyzed using a multiplexed approach with commercially availabl e human 17-plex kits. The following 
cytokines will be assessed: IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL- 
8), IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IFN-IFN- γ, TNF- α, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 
(MIP-1β), G-CSF, and GM-CSF. A panel of 17 cytokines and chemokines 
will be analyzed using a multiplexed ap proach with commercially available 
human 17-plex kits. The following cyt okines will be analyzed using the 
manufacturer-supplied reagents. 
3. Circulating tumor cells: Circulating tu mor cell (CTC) quantification will be 
performed by [CONTACT_751849], Inc. using CellSieve microfiltration technique. Furthermore, the expression of  other targets, including PD-L1 and 
phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), will also be assessed before and after treatment. Previously, we demonstrated  another unique form of CTCs that 
are associated with macrophage in the ci rculation of patients with metastatic 
breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer,  termed circulating cancer-associated 
macrophage-like cells or CAMLs. CAMLs are large multinucleated cells in peripheral blood that express epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l, monocytic, and endothelial surface 
makers. The role of CAMLs, particularly  in the context of immune therapy, 
is largely unknown.

agent pembrolizumab. The patient will conti nue to follow the test schedule (Section 
4.1) 
For binimetinib, if dose reduction goes below -[ADDRESS_1029280] be 
discontinued. If binimetinib is started at -2 dose level, then there are no further dose reductions. 
NOTE: There are no dose changes for pembro lizumab, only dose schedule modifications. 
For patients who do not tolerate the [ADDRESS_1029281]. 
A dose reduction below 15 mg BID is not allowed. Dose interruptions of more than 21 
days are not allowed. 
Missed/skipped doses will not be made up (i.e. the patient should not double their dose if 
the previous dose was missed). When the a dverse event that resulted in a dose reduction 
improves to and remains stable at Grade 1 or  less for a minimum of 21 days, the dose can 
be re-escalated at the investigators discretion provided there are no other concomitant 
adverse events. 
No dose re-escalation is allowed after dose reduction due to left ventricular dysfunction 
or prolonged QTcF >500 msec. 
MC1632 28  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  Dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation decisions should be based on the CTCAE 
grade of the adverse event (AE) and the guidelines provided below. In general, doses should not be reduced or interrupted for Grade 1 events, but treatment to control 
symptoms should be provided as appropriate. All AEs should be followed weekly or as 
clinically appropriate until stabilization or resolution. 
A patient with a Grade 4 AE may resume treatment at the lower dose level if the AE 
recovers to grade ≤ 1 within 21 days of interrupting drug and, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_751819], the event is not life-threatening, and the patient can be managed and monitored for recurrence of AE. Dose interruptions of more than 21 days 
are not allowed unless approved by [CONTACT_119576], and the [COMPANY_007] Inc. (formerly Array 
Biopharma LLC and Array Biopharma Inc.) Medical Monitor or designee. 
Please refer to the table below for dose adju stment recommendations for binimetinib- 
induced adverse events. 
For adverse events that can be attributed to either pembrolizumab or binimetinib, dose 
adjustment for both agents will be applied. These toxicities include but are not limited to 
diarrhea and liver function abnormalities.

concurrent medical conditions. All blood prod ucts and concomitant medications such as 
antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemeti cs received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after th e final dose will be recorded in the medical 
records. 
Suggested supportive care measures for the mana gement of adverse events with potential 
immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include 
the use of oral or intravenous treatment w ith corticosteroids as well as additional anti - 
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. 
Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decr eased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule 
out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treat ment guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the investigator determines the ev ents to be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is dete rmined not to be related, the investigator 
does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 8.2 for dose modification. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
9.2 Blood products and growth factors 
Blood products and growth factors should be  utilized as clinically warranted and 
following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should 
follow published guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
Update of Recommendations for the Use of White Blood Cell Growth Factors: An Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline. J Clin Oncol 2006; 24:3187-3205, 2006.

MC1632 39  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  9.4 Anti-Diarrheals 
Patients should be monitored for signs and sy mptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, w ith or without fever) and of bowel perforation 
(such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In sympto matic patients, infectious etiologies should 
be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should 
be considered. (See Section 9.5 and 9.9a  for management of treatment-related 
enterocolitis) 
All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear 
fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be 
substituted via IV infusion. 
NOTE: Loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] s hould NOT be used for diarrhea symptoms 
unless: (1) it is believed that pembrolizumab-re lated enterocolitis is unlikely to be present 
after detailed evaluation by [CONTACT_349658],  including endoscopy; PLUS (2) approval is 
documented by a gastroenterology specialist. 
9.5 Management of treatment related enterocolitis 
In patients with severe enterocolitis, pembro lizumab will be held and treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent. When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_1029301] 1 month. 
In patients with moderate enterocolitis, pembrolizumab should be withheld and 
antidiarrheal treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more than one 
week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grad e [ADDRESS_1029302] institutional practice. 
9.7 Corticosteroids 
Patients requiring chronic steroid administration (excluding inhaled steroids).are 
excluded from the trial. Patients may continue  on inhalation therapy. Corticosteroids are 
known immunosuppressive agents that can m itigate the effects of pembrolizumab. 
Steroids should be generally reserved to treat  side effects of pembrolizumab. Steroids can 
be used as primary prevention of nausea per institutional guidelines, but steroid doses 
should be reduced in subsequent cycles if nausea/vomiting is absent or very mild (see 
Section 9.3). 
9.8 Concomitant medications 
Medications or vaccinations specifically pr ohibited in the exclusion criteria are not 
allowed during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other 
medications or vaccinations specifically prohi bited during the trial, discontinuation from 
trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The final decision on a ny supportive therapy 
or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician. 
9.[ADDRESS_1029303]’s welfare 
may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be

the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements , and IV medications and fluids. If 
MC1632 40  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, 
route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1029304] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs. 
9.82 Permitted concomitant medications requiring caution for binimetinib 
Binimetinib potently inhibits CYP2B6 (Ki of 1.67 µM). Based on these in vitro findings, binimetinib may inhibit the metabolic clearance of co-medications 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6, if sufficiently high concentrations are achieved in vivo. 
At 45 mg BID, the maximum concentra tions achieved in plasma are normally

could potentially modify the gastric pH (i.e. PPI) should be instructed to take 
them at least two hours after the administration of binimetinib. 
Drugs with a conditional, possible, or known risk to induce Torsade de Pointes (TdP) should be used with caution. Patients receiving such medications must be carefully monitored for potentiating of t oxicity due to any individual concomitant 
medication, and may require dose titration of the drug substance. Investigators 
should use caution when prescribing co-med ications, as clinical experience with 
these compounds in patients with cancer is often limited.

varicella/zoster, yellow fever, ra bies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. 
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate 
symptoms from an event of clinical  interest of suspected immunologic 
etiology. The use of physiologic doses of  corticosteroids (e.g. equivalent 
to or less than oral prednisone 10 mg  daily) is allowe d and do not require 
Sponsor approval. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_8647], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the 
trial. Subjects may receive other medicati ons that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary. 
The exclusion criteria describe other me dications, which are prohibited in this

There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
9.9 a Immunotherapy-related toxicities  
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immunotherapy-related 
toxicities, which include but are not limited to the following: 
• Pneumonitis 
o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3-4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer 
additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed. 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunis tic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration. 
• Diarrhea/colitis 
Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as per itoneal signs and ileus). 
o All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis  should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endosco py to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, admini ster oral corticosteroids. 
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with  intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_458531].

Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  For this trial, male patients will be consider ed to be of non-reproductive potential if they 
have azoospermia (whether due to having  had a vasectomy or due to an underlying 
medical condition). 
Female patients will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either: 
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 mont hs with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women <45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be u sed to confirm a post-menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or  hormonal replacement therapy. In the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a si ngle FSH measurement is insufficient.); 
OR (2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilatera l oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; 
OR 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
Female and male patients of  reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming 
pregnant or impregnating a partner, respec tively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_1029308] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]: (1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; 
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptabl e contraception during heterosexual activity. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
• intrauterine device (IUD) 
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner 
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide) 
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only) 
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) 
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]- 
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vagi nal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
contraceptive injection 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity ) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle 
and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_751861]/IRBs. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is rest ricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then 
it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for patients participating at 
sites in this country/region. 
MC1632 44  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  Patients should be informed that taking th e study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were  to occur during the study. In order to 
participate in the study patients of childbeari ng potential must adhere to the contraception 
requirement (described above) from the day of  study medication initiation (or 14 days 
prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study 
period up to [ADDRESS_1029309] monthly and document the patient’s stat us until the pregnancy has been completed 
or terminated. The outcome of the pregnanc y will be reported to Mayo Clinic and to 
[COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 2 working days to 
[COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious adverse e xperience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital 
anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). 
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome 
of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn. If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to Mayo Clinic and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as 
described above. 
9.9d Use in Nursing Women 
Since many drugs are excreted in human m ilk, and because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patient s who are breast-feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment. Specific additional information follows for individual agents used in this 
trial. 
9.9d1 Pembrolizumab 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. 
9.9d2 Binimetinib 
It is unknown whether binimetinib is excreted in human milk. 
9.9e Hypertension Management 
Patients that will receive binimetinib must monitor their blood pressure at home on Days 
10 and 30 after treatment initiation if they meet the following criteria: 
• Patients with history of hypertension and/or 
• Patient receiving antihypertensive drugs be fore onset of study treatment and/or 
• Patients with a screening systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or 
• Patients with a screening diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg 
The investigator is to educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of hypertension and 
use of the home blood pressure monitor (if not already in place). More frequent 
assessments during the study drug treatment period may also be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator and if medically indicated. 
Measurements are to be taken at the same time on Study Days [ADDRESS_1029310] for 5 minutes in a sitting position. If SBP 
≥160 mmHg, or DBP ≥[ADDRESS_1029311] 
an unscheduled visit. At this unscheduled visit, the patient’s blood pressure should be 
assessed and these measurements must be doc umented in the patient record. Early 
MC1632 45  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  initiation of treatment and aggressive manage ment of emergent hypertension must be 
implemented after its diagnosis. 
For patients monitoring their blood pressure at home, it is suggested to develop a patient 
diary to record their self-assessed blood pressu re measurements and present the collected 
data to the investigator for evaluation and appropriate management. This diary must be 
maintained in the patient’s source documentation 
9.9f Skin disorders/care 
Initial Rash Treatment Regimen 
Clinical judgment and experience of the tr eating physician should gui de the management 
plan of each patient. In general, the followi ng interventions are in addition to the rash 
dosing guidelines in Table 8.2: 
o Prophylaxis of skin events to be initiated [ADDRESS_1029312] and upper back 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15872]-oily sunscreen (PABA free, SPF ≥30, UVA/UVB protection), 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (preferably mometasone cream i.e. Elocon®) and topi[INVESTIGATOR_751821] (i.e. Eryaknen® or topi[INVESTIGATOR_11974]) 
Note: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11975] a daily basis starting on Day [ADDRESS_1029313] dose, and more often as needed. 
o Possibly oral doxycycline (100 mg daily) for the first 2-3 weeks of study drug 
administration. 
Other effective medications are antihistamines, other topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], other topi[INVESTIGATOR_11976]-dose systemic corticosteroids. 
The treatment algorithm based on CTCAE grade is as follows: 
Mild rash (CTCAE Grade 1) 
o Consider prophylactic rash treatment if not already started 
o Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15876] (i.e. mometasone cream) and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_15877] (i.e. erythromycin 2%) are recommended. 
o The patient should be reassessed within a maximum of 2 weeks or as per investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
Moderate rash (CTCAE Grade 2) 
o Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_11979] (1%) plus topi[INVESTIGATOR_15879] (1%) plus oral anti biotics such as: lymecycline (408 mg QD), 
doxycycline (100 mg BID) or minocycline (50 to 100 mg QD). 
o Although there has been no evidence of phototoxicity or photosensitivity in patients 
being treated with MEK162, doxycycline (or minocycline as second-line) should be 
used with thorough UV protection (i.e., avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, use 
of sunscreen and sunglasses, etc.). 
o Use of acitretin is not recommended 
 
Severe rash (CTCAE Grade 3-4) 
CTCAE Grade 3 
o In addition to the interventions recomme nded for moderate rash, consider oral 
prednisolone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Upon improvement, taper the dose in a stepwise 
manner (25 mg for 7 days, subsequently decreasing the dose by 5 mg/day every day). 
MC1632 46  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  o Alternatively, in addition to the interv entions recommended for moderate rash, 
consider oral isotretinoin (low doses, i.e. 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg) (Lacouture et al 2011) 
o Use of acitretin is not recommended 
CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_1029314] udy drug and treat the patient with oral 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910] (see recommendation CTCAE Grade 3). 
Symptomatic treatment: 
o It is strongly recommended that patients who develop rash/skin toxicities receive 
symptomatic treatment: 
o For pruritic lesions, use cool compr esses and oral antihistaminic agents 
o For fissuring, use Monsel’s solution, silv er nitrate, or zinc oxide cream. If not 
sufficient use mild steroid ointments or combinations of steroids and antibiotics such 
as Fucicort® 
o For desquamation, use emollients with mild  pH 5/neutral (best containing urea 10%) 
o For paronychia, antiseptic bath and local pot ent corticosteroids, use oral antibiotics 
and if no improvement is seen, refer to a dermatologist or surgeon 
o For infected lesions, obtain bacterial and fungal cultures and treat with topi[INVESTIGATOR_751822]1632 47

MC1632 48  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  Events that would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_15881], but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]). 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect , problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including 
a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_1029316] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ) 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to  the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the timeframe/mech anism (see Section 10.4). 
e. Determine if other reporting is  required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a seri ous AE, which is defined in Section 10.4. 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events 
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicab le), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not require d, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan). 
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section  
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not re quired or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacer bate the expected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
MC1632 49  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  NOTE: *The consent form may contain study sp ecific information at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that th is information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refe r to protocol or IB for reporting needs. 
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure 
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is  related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
10.31 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur 
within this population and do not require E xpedited Reporting. These events must still 
be reported via Routine Reporting (see Section 10.6).* 
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected 
adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or 
investigator brochure as an expedited event. 
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected 
as an expedited event.

10.51 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in 
general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity , or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
[ADDRESS_1029322] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered. Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period. 
Effective Date: May 5, 2011 

MC1632 52  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  IRB-approved research protocol and in formed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
2. Related or possibly related to particip ation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, ec onomic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated  with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs. 
Note: If there is no language in the prot ocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pr egnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the study should be reported as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions: 
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845], provide appropriate documentation using Mayo Expedited 
Event Report form 
 
 
he Mayo Regulatory Affairs Office 
will review and process the submission to the Mayo 
Clinic IRB. 
10.52
 Death 
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided. 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1029323] dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128746] 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 

MC1632 53  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  • Death due to progressive di sease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that  the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease pro cess)  
should be submitted. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with inves tigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms ou tlined in each 
protocol. 
10.54 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting unless otherwise specified.

immediately. The patient should have a ppropriate follow-up as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_50835] w ith a birth defect or anomaly, a second 
expedited report is required. Prior to obtaining private information a bout a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal gua rdian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to th e IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obta ined, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or a bortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, the child/fetus is the patient. 
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonata l loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this form:

10.8 Additional Event Reporting Instructions 
10.81 Additional Instructions for AE Reporting to [COMPANY_006] 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any 
use of [COMPANY_006]’s product that: 
• Results in death; 
MC1632 56  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  • Is life threatening; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Results in or prolongs an ex isting inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Is an other important medical event 
• Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the 
below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the 
[COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892]. 
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
• Is associated with an overdose. 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization, any serious adve rse event, or follow up to a serious 
adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the 
cancer under study that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor (Mayo Clinic) and within [ADDRESS_1029325] to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol- 
specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_1029326] be followed up for outcome. 
SAE reports and any other re levant safety information are to be forwarded to the 
[COMPANY_006] Global Safety facsimile number:  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and A nnual Progress Reports is submitted as 
required by [CONTACT_8415], European Union (EU) , Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices 
agency (PMDA) or other local regulators.  Investigators will cross reference this 
submission according to local regulati ons to the [COMPANY_006] Investigational 
Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission. Additionally 
investigators will submit a copy of these reports to [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc.  
at the time of submission to 
FDA. 
10.[ADDRESS_1029327] 30 days 

MC1632 57  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  after the patient has stopped study treatment must be reported to [COMPANY_007] within [ADDRESS_1029328] be reported as 
follow-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the 
follow-up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated  to a previously reported one should be 
reported separately as a new event. 
Information about all SAEs is collected  and recorded on the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in 
order to provide a clinical ly thorough report. The investigator must assess and 
record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_751862] [ADDRESS_1029329](s) to whom the original SAE 
Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a 
follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original 
report. Each re-occurrence, complication,  or progression of the original event 
should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The 
follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or 
withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is 
thought to be related to the [COMPANY_007] study treatment, an [COMPANY_007] Drug Safety 
associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for 
Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_007] may need  to issue an Investigator Notification 
(IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
10.[ADDRESS_1029330] be reported to [COMPANY_007] within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. The pr egnancy should be followed up to 
determine outcome, including sponta neous or voluntary termination, 
details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal  and/or newborn complications. 

MC1632 58  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and 
reported by [CONTACT_751863]. Pregnancy follow- 
up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment any 
pregnancy outcome. A ny SAE experienced during pregnancy must be 
reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected  for the female partners of any 
males who took study treatment in this study. Consent to report 
information regarding these pregna ncy outcomes should be obtained 
from the mother. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use highly 
effective contraception methods wh ile they are receiving study 
treatment and up to [ADDRESS_1029331] 3 months following the expected delivery date 
10.822 Warnings and precautions 
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study protocol 
indicated that special warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided Investigator Brochure. Additional 
safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated 
in the form of Investigator Notif ications. This information will be 
included in the patient informed c onsent and should be discussed with 
the patient during the study as needed.

Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021   
11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_182655] (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1) and by [CONTACT_751864] 2014 Adaptation of the Immune-Related Response Criteria: 
irRECIST {Bohnsack 2014}. RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_1029332] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the short 
axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1029333] 1.1, the appearance of new lesions automatically signifies progressive 
disease (PD), while in irRECIST new measurable lesions are factored into the total tumor 
burden. The specifics are presented below. 
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the 
table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and 
analysis. 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every 6 weeks. In addition 
to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. 
11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non-Measurable Disease (same definitions for RECIST 
1.[ADDRESS_1029334]) 
11.[ADDRESS_1029335] diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_1029336] x-ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_1029337] diameter is 
≥1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or 
imaging. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. 
11.213  A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_1029338] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
NOTE: Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered 
measurable disease. 
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease 
11.221 All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non-measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to 
<1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/ 
pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable as well. 
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the de finition of measurability described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
MC1632 60  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  for selection as target lesions. In additi on, lymph nodes that have a short axis 
<1.0 cm are considered non- pathol ogical (i.e., normal) and should not be 
recorded or followed. 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
11.31 Measurement Methods: 
• All measurements should be recorded  in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers. 
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow-up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_1029339]-treatment tumor assessments. 
• Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_751865] a treatment. 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease: 
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT  slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1029340] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. The lesions s hould be measured on the same pulse 
sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followe d as closely as possible to prior scans. 
Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible.
 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT 
is of identical diagnostic quality to  a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST and irRECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
• Chest X-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT scans are preferable.  
• Physical Examination: For superficial non-nodal lesions, physical examination is acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In 
the case of skin lesions, documenta tion by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
11.33 Measurement at Follow-up Evaluation: 
A subsequent scan must be obtained a minimum of 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of an objective status of e ither complete response (irCR) or partial 
response (irPR). 
In the case of stable disease (SD), follow-up measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks (see Section 11.44). 
MC1632 61  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  NOTE: Once patient has had SD for ≥6 months, scanning can be reduced to 
every 3 months. 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplas tic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease. 
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.)  
11.[ADDRESS_1029341] 
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in S ection 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 
lesions, representative of all involved or gans, should be identified as “Target 
Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non- 
nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21), where no more than 2 lesions are from 
the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected. 
Note: If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no r eason to perform additional studies beyond 
those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions. 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should 
be those that lend themselves to reprodu cible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproducible m easurements in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD, or irPBSD for irRECIST): A sum of the longest diameter for all targ et lesions plus the sum of the short 
axis of all the target lymph nodes (and for irRECIST, plus the sum of new 
measurable lesions) will be calculate d and reported as the post-baseline sum 
of dimensions (PBSD, or irPBSD for irRECIST). If the radiologist is able to 
provide an actual measure for the targ et lesion (or target lymph node), that 
should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_1029342] that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD, or irMSD for irRECIST) is the minimum of the BSD and the PBSD (or the irPBSD for irRECIST) 
MC1632 62  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non-Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non-target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline. These lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 
Section 11.443. 
11.[ADDRESS_1029343]/MRI/PET- 
CT/Chest X-ray/physical examination must be measured on re- 
evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in objective status to eith er irPR or irCR cannot be done 
without re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes. 
Note: Non-target lesions and non-ta rget lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assess ment, especially in the case of first response or 
confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non-target 
organs may be evaluated less freque ntly. For example, bone scans may 
need to be repeated only when comple te response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
11.[ADDRESS_1029344] Complete Response (irCR): 
a. Complete disappearance of all measurable and non- measurable lesions, and 
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.[ADDRESS_1029345] Partial Response (irPR): 
a. At least a 30% decrease in irPBSD (sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short 
axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation, 
plus the measurements of new measurable lesions) taking as reference the BSD (see Section 11.41), and 
b. Non-target lesions are irNN (no target disease was identified at baseline and at follow-up the patient fails to 
meet criteria for irCR and irPD), and 
c. No unequivocal progression of new non-measurable 
lesions. 
11.[ADDRESS_1029346] Stable Disease (irSD): 
a. Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence 
of irPD. 
11.[ADDRESS_1029347] Progression (irPD): 
a. At least a 20% increase in irPBSD taking as reference 
the irMSD (see Section 11.41) with an absolute increase of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1029348]/MRI/PET- 
CT/Chest X-ray/physical examination must be measured on re- 
MC1632 63  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  evaluation at evaluation times specif ied in Section 11.1. Specifically, a 
change in objective status to either  a PR or CR cannot be done without 
re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes. 
Note: Non-target lesions and non-ta rget lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assess ment, especially in the case of first response or 
confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non-target 
organs may be evaluated less freque ntly. For example, bone scans may 
need to be repeated only when comple te response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
11.442 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions. 
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.0 
cm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of 
all the target lymph nodes at current  evaluation) taking as reference the 
BSD ( see Section 11.41). 
Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
c. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥1.[ADDRESS_1029349] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41). In addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the MSD. 
e. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for PD via FDG-PET imaging. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD. 
11.443 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions & Non-target Lymph Nodes 
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
a. Disappearance of all non-target 
lesions. 
b. Each non-target lymph node must 
have a reduction in short axis to

Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of  one or more non-target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes. 
Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be 
true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
which also includes any lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm 
short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 cm 
short axis during follow-up. 
MC1632 64  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  b. Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions and non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion and target lymph 
node status. It must be representative of overall disease status change.) 
c. See Section 11.[ADDRESS_1029350] 1.1 Overall Objective Status 
The overall objective status for an evaluation is determined by [CONTACT_131690]’s status on target lesions, targ et lymph nodes, non-target lesions, non-

11.46 Symptomatic Deterioration 
Patients with global deterioration of h ealth status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not 
either related to study treatment or other medical conditions, should be reported as PD and irPD due to “symptomatic deteri oration.” Every effort should be made 
to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due 
to symptomatic deterioration. A patient is  classified as having PD and irPD due 
MC1632 65  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  to “symptomatic deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not either 
related to study treatment or other medical conditions: 
• Unintentional weight loss >10% of body weight 
• Decline in performance status of >1 level on ECOG scale

12.2 Phase I dose level: 0 vs -1 
13.0 Treatment/Follow–up Decision at Evaluation of Patient 
13.1 Continuation of treatment 
Patients who are irCR, irPR, or irSD will continue treatment per protocol. 
13.2 Progressive disease (PD/irPD) 
Patients who develop irPD while receiving ther apy will go to the event-monitoring phase. 
13.3 Off protocol treatment 
Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than irPD will go to the event- 
monitoring phase per Section 18.0. 
13.4 Duration of therapy for irCR 
Patients who achieve irCR will receive treatment for a maximum of 2 years, then they 
will go to event monitoring 
13.5 Duration of therapy for irPR or irSD 
Patients who are in irPR or irSD will continue on therapy for a total of 2 years. After 2 
years, then they will go to event monitoring (see 13.4 above). Subsequent treatment is at 
the discretion of their attending physician 
13.6 Retreatment 
Patients who achieve SD, PR, CR may be eligible  for retreatment for up to 1 year if their 
disease progresses after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. (See Section 7.5 for criteria.) 
13.7 Inevaluable patients Phase I only: If a patient fails to complete the first two cycles (Cycles 1 and 2) of 
treatment for reasons other than toxicity, th e patient will be regarded as inevaluable and 
will be replaced. 
13.8 Ineligible 
A patient is deemed ineligible if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility criteria for study entry. 
The patient may continue treatment off-proto col at the discretion of the physician as long 
as there are no safety concerns, and the patient  was properly registered. The patient will 
go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable). 
• If the patient received treatment, all data  up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted. Event mon itoring will be required per Section 18.0 of 
the protocol. 
• If the patient never received treatment, on-study material must be submitted. Event 
monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol.

14.4 Background a nd Methodology 
14.41 Immunoregulatory cell quanitification 
Several subtypes of circulating immunore gulatory cells (IRC) (CD8, CD4, Treg, 
MDSC, NK cells) will be evaluated in th e peripheral blood of patients treated 
with pembrolizumab and binimetinib as previously described {Thomas 2014}. 
These subsets of IRC include CD4, CD8, regulatory T cells, myeloid derived 
suppressor cells, and NK cells. 
14.42 Cytokine profiling 
Luminex Multianalyte assay is a multip lex assay that allows simultaneous 
quantification of multiple cytokines in a single sample. A panel of 17 cytokines 
and chemokines will be analyzed using a multiplexed approach with commercially available human 17-plex kits. The following cytokines will be 
assessed: IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, 
IL-17A, IFN- γ, TNF- α, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1β ), G-CSF, and GM-CSF. 
Cytokine concentrations will be determin ed based on a standard curve generated 
on each plate using the manufacturer-supplied reagents. 
14.43 Circulating Tumor Cells 
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) will be is olated by [CONTACT_751849], Inc. using 
CellSeive microfiltration technique as previously described {Adams 2014}. 
Using a standard CTC fluorescent stain, we identify, quantify and score these 
cells according to their Cytokeratin, CD14 and CD45 positivity. The filtered 
samples are then processed by [CONTACT_751867]-R technique, whereby [CONTACT_751868] “Quenched-Underivati zed- Amine Striped” removing all 
fluorescence while leaving the cells intact and unaltered. The samples are 
“Restained” for subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_751826] l biomarker panels against biological 
targets (i.e. p-ERK, PD-L1, etc.) as well as circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs). The same  previously identified CTC and CStC 
are reimaged with the new immuno-targ ets, the markers are quantified and 

MC1632 70  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  scored. The process is repeated with up to 12 biomarkers identified, quantified 
and scored using the initially identified CStC and CTC. 
MC1632 71  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Binimetinib (MEK162, ARRY-438162, ONO-7703) 
15.11 Background: Binimetinib is an orally bioavailable, selective and potent MEK1 
and MEK 2 inhibitor. As a MEK inhibitor, this compound has the potential to benefit patients with advanced cancer s by [CONTACT_15936] (mitogen- 
activated protein kinases) pathway. 
15.12 Formulation: Binimetinib drug product is supp lied as film-coated tablets in a 
dose strength of [ADDRESS_1029359] of binimetinib, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, 
croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and a commercial film coating. The 
tablets are yellow to dark yellow and capsule shaped. 
Binimetinib tablets can be constituted in 3:1 (v/v) Ora Sweet®/water at 1 mg/mL 
binimetinib concentration to provide an easy to swallow oral suspension. 
15.13 Preparation and storage : Binimetinib film-coated tablets should not be stored 
above 25°C and should be protected from light. Tablets are packaged in plastic 
bottles acceptable for pharmaceutical use. 
Binimetinib oral suspension prepared from 15 mg binimetinib tablets should not 
be stored above 25°C and should not be refrigerated. The suspension should be 
used within 30 days after preparation. 
 
15.14 Administration: Binimetinib is administered twice daily with water, 
approximately 12 hours apart with or without meals. Tablets should be 
swallowed whole and should not be chewed. 
Binimetinib oral suspension is intended for oral administration as prepared. 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
Absorption: The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib are characterized by [CONTACT_751869], accumulation of approximately 1.5-fold, and steady state 
concentrations reached within 15 da ys. The human ADME study indicated that 
approximately 50% of binimetinib dose was absorbed. 
Distribution: Binimetinib is more distributed in plasma than blood. The blood- 
to-plasma concentration ratio of binimetinib in humans is 0.718. It is highly 
bound to plasma proteins (humans: 97.2%) 
Metabolism : The primary metabolic pathways  include glucuronidation (up to 
61.2% via UGT1A1), N-dealkylation (up to 17.8% via CYP1A2 and CYP2C19) 
and amide hydrolysis. 
Excretion: The excretion route was 31.7% of unchanged binimetinib in feces 
and 18.4% in urine. Estimated renal clearance of unchanged binimetinib was 
6.3% of total dose. 
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions : 
Overall, the risk for binimetinib to be  a cause of or be affected by [CONTACT_751870]-drug interactions is predicted to be  low. However, given the predominant 
role of UGT1A1 in the metabolism of bi nimetinib, special consideration should 
MC1632 72  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  be taken for co-administration of drugs that are UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers, 
and administration of binimetinib to  patients with low UGT1A1 activity. 
 
 
Binimetinib has been shown to be a substrat e for P-gp and BCRP in vitro. The impact of 
P-gp/BCRP inhibitors on the PK of binimetinib in vivo is unknown; therefore, it 
is recommended that P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are dosed with caution.

Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  15.2 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, SCH 900475, Keytruda™) 
15.21 Background: Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
with high specificity of binding to th e PD-1 receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and pot ent receptor blocking activity for PD-1. 
 
15.22 Formulation: 
Pembrolizumab is available as a liquid 25 mg/mL, 100 mg/vial. 
 
15.23 Preparation and storage : 
Vials should be stored in the refrigerator at temperatures between 2-8°C. 
 
Drug concentrate is further diluted with  normal saline (or 5% dextrose) in the 
concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL. Th e infusion solution in the IV bag should 
be immediately administered. Diluted pemb rolizumab solutions may be stored at 
room temperature for a cumulative period of up to [ADDRESS_1029365] ored at 2-8 °C for up to a cumulative time 
of [ADDRESS_1029366] be  allowed to come to room temperature 
before use. 
 
15.24 Administration: Pembrolizumab is administered by [CONTACT_162141] 
[ADDRESS_1029367] be 
between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Maximum rate  of infusion should not exceed 6.7 
mL/minute through a peripheral or indwelli ng catheter. Flush the line with 0.9% 
NaCL following the completion of the infusion. 
 
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a) Absorption – Because pembrolizumab is administered intravenously, it is 
immediately and completely bioavaila ble. Steady-state concentrations 
of pembrolizumab are reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with a Q3W regimen and the systemic accu mulation is 2.1-fold. The peak 
concentration, trough concentration, and area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve at steady state of pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg Q3W. 
b) Distribution – Pembrolizumab has a limited volume of distribution. 
c) Excretion – CL is approximately 23% lower after achieving maximal change 
at steady state compared with the fi rst dose. The terminal elimination 
half-life(t½) is estimated to be 22 days at steady state. 
d) Metabolism – Pembrolizumab is catabo lized through non-specific pathways; 
metabolism does not contribute to its CL.

Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 
16.1 Overview 
This is a Phase I/II, single-arm, open-labele d, multi-center study of pembrolizumab in 
combination with binimetinib in women with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
triple negative breast cancer. The main objec tive of this study is to assess the safety and 
efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and binimetinib. 
The phase I part will be a dose-finding study,  utilizing the classic 3+3 study design. The 
primary objectives are to determine the DLTs, to  evaluate the safety of this combination, 
and to establish the recommended dose for the phase II part. There are a total of 2 dose 
levels as defined in the treatment section. The number of participants enrolled in the 
phase I of this study will range from 6-12 participants. 
16.11 Primary Endpoint 
16.111  Phase I 
The primary endpoint in the phase I portion is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination. 
16.112  Phase II 
The primary endpoint in the phase II portion is confirmed objective 
response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_751871]. 
We will utilize Simon’s Two-Stage Optimal Design to test the null 
hypothesis that this two-drug combination has an ORR of at most 15% versus the alternative hypothesis that it has an ORR of at least 35%. Patients in the phase I part who are treated with the recommended dose 
of phase II and are evaluable for response will be included in the phase 
II analysis. The first stage will require 9 evaluable patients. With this 
design, if ≤[ADDRESS_1029372] 9 patients has objective response (i.e. CR or 
PR), the study will be closed since there is sufficient evidence that the 
therapy is not promising. Otherwi se, an additional 14 patients will be 
enrolled. In total, if >[ADDRESS_1029373] objective response, 
this combination will be considered  promising. This design has 80% 
power while controlling the type I error at 10%. Under the null 
hypothesis (when the true objective response rate is 15%), this design has a 60% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587520]. A minimum of [ADDRESS_1029374], progression free survival, and overall survival. 
16.2 Sample size and accrual rate 
For phase I, the study will require 6-12 patients to complete, allowing for 6 patients per 
dose level and 2 predefined dose levels. In phase II, the study will require 9-26 patients to 
complete. Therefore, the total sample size for this study is 15-38 patients. At an 
anticipated accrual rate of 10-12 patients/year, we  expect that this trial will need to accrue 
patients for anywhere from 15 to 32 months. 
MC1632 79  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  16.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
The objective of the phase I portion of the study is to estimate the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) using the standard 3+3 design. Sa fety/adverse events data will be tabulated, 
including adverse events of all grades. 
For the phase II portion of the study, the overall response rate by [CONTACT_751872] [On the estimation of the binomial probability in multistage clinical trials. Stat Med 23:881-96, 2004]. The 90% lower 
confidence bound will be calculated using the approach of Koyama and Chen [Proper 
inference from Simon's two-stage designs. Stat Med 27:3145-54, 2008]. Secondary efficacy endpoints include objective respon se rate by [CONTACT_44859]-related response criteria 
(irRECIST), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Objective response rate by [CONTACT_751873] a binomial proportion with a 2-sided 95% 
CI. PFS will be defined as the time from study enrollment to date of progression. Patients 
who have not progressed (including those lost to follow-up) at the time of data analysis 
will be censored at the date last known to be free of progression. OS will be defined as 
the time from study enrollment to death attributable to any cause (i.e. death from breast 
cancer, non-breast cancer cause, or from unknown cause). Patients who are alive (including those lost to follow-up) at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last 
known alive date. A Kaplan-Meier curve will be used to summarize the PFS and OS experience of this patient cohort. 
Baseline TILs and percent change in TILs from baseline will be summarized. Logistic 
regression models will be used to assess th e correlation between these biomarkers and 
ORR in order to assess their prognostic significance. Cox Proportional Hazard models 
will be used to assess their correlation with  time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS. 
Similar analyses will be performed for othe r exploratory biomarkers such as immune 
related gene signature, PDJ amplification, etc. These analyses will be exploratory in 
nature. As such, no adjustment for multiple  comparisons will be made; all hypothesis 
tests will be based on 2-sided alpha = 0.05 level. 
 
16.4 Phase I 
This portion of the study is designed to de termine the MTD and toxicity profile of 
binimetinib in combination pembrolizumab. 
16.41 MTD Definition: MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that 
induces dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of 
a maximum of 6 new patients). A total of 6 patients treated at the MTD will be sufficient to identify common toxicities at the MTD. 
Refer to Section 7.52 for definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The focus of 
this study is to establish the DLT of the combination of binimetinib and pembrolizumab. Therefore, only adverse ev ents that occur during the first cycle 
of treatment with the combination (Cycle  2) will be considered when evaluating 
for dose-limiting toxicity. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_1029375] cohort of three patients will be treated at dose level 0. Decisions on when and how to dose escalate are described below. 
MC1632 80  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  16.421 Three patients will be treated at a given dose level combination and 
observed for one cycle of the combination (Cycle 2) from start of 
treatment to assess toxicity.

16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring 
16.51 The principal investigator(s) and the st udy statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_128775]. 
16.52 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: 
MC1632 81  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_212241] b ased on the knowledge available at study 
development. We note that the rules may be adjusted in the even t of either (1) the 
study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and 
in consideration of newly acquired in formation regarding the adverse event 
profile of the treatments under investigation. The study team may choose to 
suspend accrual because of unexpected a dverse event profiles that have not 
crossed the specified rules below. 
Phase I (Includes all dose levels in phase I): 
By [CONTACT_740217] “cohorts of three” phase I study design, toxicity (i.e., adverse 
events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment) 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_751828]. Specifically, if 2 or more dose- 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during Cycle 2 at any given dose level, accrual to that dose level will be stopped, and patients will be accrued to the next 
lower dose level until a maximum of 6 patients are treated at the lower level. Note that a DLT that affects dose escalation is only that which is observed in the 
second cycle of treatment. However, all cycles will be reviewed and the study team will determine whether the dose leve l needs to be adjusted for future 
patients if ≥[ADDRESS_1029379] 3 patients OR ≥[ADDRESS_1029380]  possibly related to treatment over all 
cycles at any given dose level. 
Phase II (includes all phase II patients in cluding phase I patients treated at 
the MTD: 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly rela ted to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as “possible, ” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy 
either of the following: 
• If [ADDRESS_1029381] possibly related to treatment. 
• If after the first [ADDRESS_1029382] been treated, 25% of all patients experience a 
Grade [ADDRESS_1029383] possibly related to treatment. 
We note that we will review Grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify thei r attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse events.

17.4 Background and Methodology 
17.41 Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
Given that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been shown to correlate 
with patients’ outcome in several tumor t ypes, we plan to evaluate both stromal 
and intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_751831]. Besides H&E, more 
comprehensive evaluation of TILs will be performed using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CD4, CD8, CD25, and FOXP3 as we previously published {Knutson 2015}. 
17.42 Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 

MC1632 85  
Protocol Version Date: 23Jun2021  Since PD-L1 expression had been shown to correlate with response to anti-PD1 
therapy in the past20, we also plan to evaluate PD-L1 expression by [CONTACT_9064] {Topalian 2012} 
17.[ADDRESS_1029385]-treatment 
tumors will be assessed to potentially id entify baseline gene expression signature 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or changes in gene expression that ma y predict response to this combination. 
Gene expression analysis will be perform ed using NanoString platform with the 
nCounter GX Human ImmunologyV2 panel comprised of [ADDRESS_1029386] recently reported that approxima tely 30% of patients with TNBC harbor 
PDJ amplification {Barrett 2015}. Locating at chromosome 9p24.1, this 
amplicon encompasses JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 genes. TNBC patients with PDJ amplification had worse disease free (25.0% vs. 66.0%, p = 0.005) and overall survival (25.0% vs. 69.0%, p = 0. 004). This amplicon has been previously 
described in the majority of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which has been reported to have remarkable response to nivolumab (86% clinical benefit rate in heavily pretreated patients) {Ansell 2015}. Based on these intriguing results, we plan to 
correlate PDJ amplification and clinical  outcome of patients in this trial.

the University of Washington’s Drug Interaction Database. 
1 Sensitive substrates: Drugs that exhibit an AUC ra tio (AUCi/AUC) of 5-fo ld or more when co- 
administered with a known potent inhibitor. 
2 Substrates with narrow therapeutic index (NTI):  Drugs whose exposure-response indicates that 
increases in their exposure levels by [CONTACT_597529] t use of potent inhibitors may lead to serious safety 
concerns (e.g., Tors ades de Pointes).

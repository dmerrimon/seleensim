Title:    Buen Provecho!: A Virtual Family -Based Intervention  to Promote H ealth  
 
Short Title:   Buen Provecho Virtual Intervention  
 
Rationale:   Obesity rates are significantly higher among Hispanic youth in the [LOCATION_002], disproportionately putting 
these children at an increased risk for obesity -related diseases such as hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and impaired glucose 
tolerance. While virtua l programming offers an innovative option for pediatric weight management, limited data exists 
on the efficacy of virtual interventions for this population  and their guardians (parents  / caregivers) .  
 
Objectives:   The purpose of this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_203685] 
(expanded –Inova Healthy Plate Club, x-IHPC) at modifying knowledge, self -efficacy , and behaviors when compared to 
traditional in -office counseling for guardians of children who are obese or  overweight.  
 
Study Design:   In order to test the effectiveness of the x -IHPC intervention, outcomes from participants in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_203686] a comparison group of similar participants  who receive standard nutrition 
counse ling during their regularly scheduled check -ups. The team will enroll 25 children in the x -IHPC intervention and 
the same number in the comparis on group (n=50). Both groups will receive standard in -office counseling, but the 
intervention group will also receive the x -IHPC.  
 
Study Methodology:   The comparison group receives standard, in -office counseling at visit s 1, 3-months and [ADDRESS_242848]. In addition, a key pi[INVESTIGATOR_203687] (CHW s) to be Spanish -speaking facilitators of the x-IHPC  and utilizing  
community engagement strategies . Training these CHW s and including them in designing the x -IHPC curriculum , will 
ensure that the programming is culturally appropriate; includes local features that relate directly to the community’s 
needs; and enables study facilitators to respond effectively to the questions and learning needs of the parents and 
children involved in the program.  
 
Statistical Methodology:   
To examine the research question, a longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be 
conducted to assess if mean differences exist on dietary measures, screen time, physical activity and guardian self -
efficacy and confidence between the intervention and co mparison  groups while accounting for the correlation among 
the repeated measurements and controlling for covariates.   
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                              
 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1. Specific Aims   
 Obesity rates are significantly higher among Hispanic  youth in the [LOCATION_002], disproportionately 
putting these children at an increased risk for obesity -related diseases such as hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and 
impaired glucose tolerance. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831] d isparity , there is a lack of literature pertaining to culturally relevant  
and family -centered interventions for Hispanic  youth and their families. While virtual programming offers an 
innovative option for pediatric weight management, limited data exists on the efficacy of telehealth /virtual 
interventions for this population  and their guardians .  
 The purpose of this commun ity-engaged quasi -experimental study is to determine whether  a family -
based, culturally tailored , virtual intervention enables guardians  to shape the weight -related aspects of their 
home environments and the lifestyle behavioral practices (diet, exercise, screen behaviors) to be more 
supportive of their family’s optimal h ealth and weight, compared to standard in -office counseling alone. 
Specifically, the study intends to compare the effectiveness of an expanded virtual educational program (x -
IHPC) at modify ing knowledge, self -efficacy , and behaviors when compared to traditional in -office counseling 
for guardians of children who are obese or overweight.  
 
1.2. Hypothesis  
Research Question: Among guardians of children ages [ADDRESS_242849] in -office 
counseling?  
 
Ho: A family -based, culturally -tailored , virtual intervention does not significantly change knowledge, 
self-efficacy , and behaviors about modifiable lifestyle practices when compared to standard in -office 
counseling.  
 
Ha: A family -based, culturally -tailored , virtual intervention does significantly change knowledge, self -
efficacy , and behaviors about modifiable lifestyle practices when compared to standard in -office 
counseling.  
 
1.3. Background and Significance  
 Childhood obesity has been an epi[INVESTIGATOR_203688] a generation. The national childhood 
obesity rate has been rising for decades putting millions of children at greater risk for Type 2 diabetes, high 
blood pressure, asthma, and other serious conditions.1,2  Recent data show that 15.5% of youth ages [ADDRESS_242850] obesity. More importantly, the data exposes persistent racial and ethnic disparities with rates significantly 
higher among Hispanic youth than among White or Asian youth.3 The high prevalence of obesity among 
Hispanic children contributes to disparities in obesity -related disease risk factors including hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035],  and impaired  glucose tolerance. It also puts them at risk for chronic comorbidities in adulthood.  
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) Growth Charts are used to measure the size and 
growth patterns of children and teens in the [LOCATION_002], with BMI -for-age weight status categories and 
corresponding percentiles. In children, BMI percenti le cutoffs for obesity are intended to reliably define a level 
above which a child is more likely to have or be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_139430] -associated adverse health 
outcomes or diseases.  Children are considered overweight at the 85th  to less than the 95 th percentile. Children 
are considered obese at the 95th  percentile or greater.4

  Recent research is exposing the connection between obesity and COVID -19.[ADDRESS_242851] high er rates of infection and are more than three times as likely to die from COVID -19 
as are White people. Risks of severe illness are also worse for children; Black and Hispanic children are much 
more likely than their White peers to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203689] -19.8 
 Given this high prevalence of childhood obesity and persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic 
disparities, there is an urgent need to find solutions to provide intensive, family -based pediatric weight 
management. Without such interventions , the chronic pandemic of obesity will continue to be exacerbated, 
particularly among disproportionately burdened populations.[ADDRESS_242852] a

 low-income children and prevent the future  occurrence of heart disease/stroke, Type 2 Diabetes, and other 
related diseases. To date, IHPC has engaged more than 1,200 children in Northern Virginia in healthy -eating 
interventions. Two decades of research shows that family -based interventions work be tter than individual 
interventions at reducing childhood obesity.13 14 Therefore, the proposed study will examine the effectiveness 
of an expanded IHPC (x -IHPC), which will be virtual, family -based, and specifically designed for low -income 
Hispanic families in our community; all of which are evidence -based strategies for enha ncing healthy eating 
interventions.

2. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECT SELECTION  
 
2.1. Study T ype 
Quasi Experimental: Behavioral Intervention with convenience sampling.  In order to test the effectiveness of 
the x -IHPC intervention, outcomes from participants in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_203694] a 
comparison group of similar families  who receive standard nutrition counseling during their regularly 
scheduled check -ups at HWNV. The team will enroll 25 children in the x -IHPC intervention and the same 
number in the comparison group (n=50). Both groups of children and guardians will receiv e standard in -office 
counseling, but the intervention group will additionally receive the x -IHPC  (See study flowchart, Appendix A).   
 
2.2. Setting/Location  
Standard health counseling will take place during regularly scheduled office visits at the HWNV offices. The 
x-IHPC intervention is virtual and participants will engage in the intervention from their homes via virtual 
sessions.  
 
2.3. Duration of Study  
Participants will be part of the study for 6 months. This includes study recruitment, consenting, initial  and 
subsequent  in-office counseling, and x -IHPC for families enrolled in the intervention.  
 
2.4. Number of Subjects  
                 The team will enroll 25 children in the x -IHPC intervention and the same number in the comparison group 
(n=50).  
 
2.5. Study Population  
 
2.5.1. Gender of Subjects  
There are no restrictions on the gender of the participants for this program.  
 
2.5.2. Age of Subjects  
The primary parent /guardian participating in the study is required to be over the ag e of [ADDRESS_242855] health. Any family is eligible to participate who identifies 
as Hispanic  and Spanish is one of the primary languages spoken in the home.   
 
2.5.4. Vulnerable Populations

  This study intervention is designed for Hispanic families in our community. The primary guardian of 
children between 6 -12 years who screen eligible to be part of the intervention will be the individuals giving 
consent for their family to be part of the intervention  as well as  the individual providing data for the study 
through surveys about family and child behaviors. It is possible that some of these guardians may be pregnant 
at the time of consent or become pregnant during the study. Because the focus of the study is healthy eating 
and modifying lifestyle behaviors to improve health, the study intervention (surveys, healthy  eating activities , 
and counseling) pose no more than minimal risk to this vulnerable group. Although children are also 
considered a vulnerable group, the study activities pose minimal or no risk to the children involved in the 
intervention .  
 
2.6. Recruitment   
 The study employs convenience sampling. Recruitment will take place through email to families who 
receive care at HWNV in English and Spanish  as well as  posters advertising the program placed in community 
spaces where children and families who are clients at HWNV spend time  (updated recruitment flyer, Appendix  
B). If guardians are interested in being part of the program, there will be a contact [CONTACT_203711]. If a family is screened as eligible to be part of the x -IHPC 
intervention, a member of the study team will meet with the family virtually or in person and consent the 
guardian to be part of the stud y. This consent process will take place with a trained interpreter. The consent 
will be emailed to program participants prior to the consent conversatio n when possible.  Whether consent 
occurs virtually or in person, a hard copy of the consent will be printed and stored by [CONTACT_203712]. A copy of 
the consent will be given to the guardian.  
 Participants will also be screened for eligibility during their well -child clinic visit at HWNV by [CONTACT_203713]. If guardian meets the study inclusion criteria, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_203695].  
 Families will decide if they have the capacity to part icipate in the x -HPC intervention. They will be 
offered both groups, but can choose which group works for their family. We realize that this introduces 
selection bias into the study (families who self select to be part of the intervention are families who are 
interested in health and have the time and ability to attend). However, the intervention takes a lot of time and 
families need to choose the arm that works for their schedule. 
 
 2.7. Inclusion Criteria  
                 Inclusion criteria include:  
1. Child and Parent are  client s at HealthWorks for Northern Virginia  
2. Child  between the ages 6 -12 years  
3. Child has a BMI percentage greater than 85%  
4. Primary parent or guardian is > 18 years of age  
5. Family identifies as Hispanic and Spanish is one of the primary languages spoken in the home  
6. Children will be living with the primary guardian or parent for the duration of the program  
7. Access to the internet  
8. Parent or g uardian  is willing to commit to engaging in the 12 week program  
 
2.8. Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria include:  
1. Family plans to change location within the year  
2. During initial screening for the study, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_203696].  
 
 
3. STUDY METHODS AND P ROCEDURES  
 
3.1. Study Treatment/Intervention  
 The purpose of this community -engaged quasi -experimental study is to determine whether family -
based, culturally tailored , virtual intervention enables and motivates parents and children (experimental 
group) to shape  the weight -related aspects of their home environments and lifestyle behavioral practices 
(diet, exercise, screen behaviors) to be more supportive of their family’s optimal health and weight, 
compared to standard in -office counseling ( comparison group ). 
 Intervention : This project builds on the success of an existing community -focused program called the 
IHPC.  Within the Inova Division of Population Health  the IHPC aims to reduce obesity among low -
income children and prevent the future occurrence of heart d isease/stroke, Type 2 Diabetes, and other 
related diseases. To date, IHPC has engaged more than 1,200 children in Northern Virginia in healthy -
eating interventions. Currently, this popular program is delivered in English, for 5 -8 weeks, to children 
grades K - 8 in an afterschool setting.  
 The proposed study will examine the effectiveness of an expanded IHPC (x -IHPC), which will be 
virtual, family -based, and specifically designed for low income Hispanic  families in our community; all of 
which are evidence -based strategies for enhancing healthy eating interventions. Family -based interventions 
are not a novel approach to obesity reduction. Two decades of research shows that family -based 
interventions work better than individual interventions at reducing childh ood obesity .13,14 When the IHPC 
moved to a virtual format due to C OVID -19 in 2020, facilitators required parental home involvement. The 
anecdotal success of that family involvement has fueled the desire of IHPC to expand their programming to 
include more e ducation and activities for parents.  
 The x -IHPC will include 4 extra modules, (= 4 additional weeks of programming) that will be 
developed by a dietician curriculum specialist. The expanded IHPC will also include programming  just for 
parents to increase their involvement. A  key pi[INVESTIGATOR_203697] s from 
HWNV to be Spanish -language  facilitators of x -IHPC. Training these CHW s and including them in 
designing the x -IHPC curriculum will ensure that the programming is culturally appropriate; includes local 
features that relate directly to the community’s needs; and enables facilitators to respond effectively to the 
questions and l earning needs of the parents and children involved in the program.  
 IHPC provides produce boxes, nutrition and meal -preparation, education, and supportive counseling 
to address barriers related to obtaining produce and food. Th e intervention provides part icipants with a bi -
weekly produce box for 12 weeks  (6 boxes total)  and helps families identify sustainable ways to obtain 
vegetables once the produce boxes end. Providing produce boxes exposes families to new, unfamiliar 
vegetables that are not common in t heir home countries , and allows families to experiment with new 
recipes on a limited income. The CHW will support families by [CONTACT_203714], give tips on finding sales at grocery stores, as well as by [CONTACT_203715] n to food 
assistance sites including food pantries, school meal sites and bus routes, and neighborhood food 
distributions. Parents will learn strategies to increase vegetable consumption by [CONTACT_203716] – such as the child doesn’t like veg etables. Curriculum will also include topi[INVESTIGATOR_203698]. Both the families in the x -HPC and families who receive 
the in -office counseling will be offered the [ADDRESS_242856] the capacity to participate in the x -HPC intervention. They will be 
offered both groups, but can choose which group works for their family. We realize that this introduces 
selec tion bias into the study (families who self select to be part of the intervention are families who are 
interested in health and have the time and ability to attend). However, the intervention takes a lot of time 
and families need to choose the arm that wor ks for their schedule.  
 
3.2. Comparison Group   
 A comparison group of similar families who receive standard nutrition, exercise , and weight -related 
lifestyle counseling during their regularly scheduled check -ups at HWNV will serve as the comparison 
group for this program. Both groups of children and guardians will receive standard in -office counseling, 
but the intervention group wi ll also receive the x -IHPC intervention. Standard in -office counseling includes 
standard counseling related to diet, exercise, and screen behaviors ,. The comparison group will also get 
food boxes.  
 
3.3. Randomization   
None  
 
3.4. Endpoints/Outcomes Measurements  
 
3.4.1. Primary outcomes . 
3.4.2.  
Primary outcomes measured via a survey , which will include food frequency questionnaires, screen time 
estimates, physical activity questionnaires, estimated screen time reports, and guardian self -efficacy and 
confidence questions related to modifiable lifestyle behaviors.15 16 17 Survey data will be collected during 
phone calls from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_203699].  An 
example survey has been included ( Appendix C: Survey ). The s urvey questions may be altered or deleted 
based on feedback from the study advisory board or the CHWs , as this study is based on community 
engagement and feedback. The final survey instrument will be submitted to this IRB for approval before 
the data collection begins.  
 
3.4.3.  Secondary outcomes  
BMI percentile of children and guardian s enrolled in the study. This will be measured at each office visit by 
a trained medical assistant or the physician.  
 
3.5.    Consent/Assent  
Once a guardian has been screened as eligible for inclusion in the study, they will be approached by [CONTACT_203717] a nd asked if they are interested in being part of the study. If they are interested, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_203700].  A  member of the study 
team will meet with the family virtually o r in person and consent the guardian to be part of the study  
(Appendix D: Consent) . This consent process will take place with a trained interpreter. The consent will be 
provided in both English and Spanish. The consent will be emailed to program participan ts prior to the

4. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS/DATA ANALYSIS  
 
4.1.   Sample Size   
In order to test the effectiveness of the x -IHPC intervention, outcomes from participants in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_203702] a comparison group of similar families who receive standard nutrition 
counseling during their regularly scheduled check -ups at HWNV. The team will enroll 25 children in the x -
IHPC intervention and the same number in the comparison group (n=50). Both groups of children and 
guardian s will receive standard in -office counseling, but the intervention gr oup will receive the x-IHPC .  
 
 
4.2.   Method of Data Analysis  
Analyses will follow the intention -to-treat principle, which categorizes participants by [CONTACT_203718] -up, and includes  
them in all analyses. Descriptive statistics will be calculated and reported as mean, standard deviation and 
95% confidence intervals for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. 
Characteristics of study participants wi ll be compared at baseline between the intervention and control 
groups and tested for significance using the two -sample t -test for continuous variables and the Chi -square 
test for categorical variables. Comparisons that are significant at the P<0.10 level will be considered for 
inclusion in multivariable models for primary and secondary analyses given that participants will not be 
randomized to their respective treatment groups.  
Primary analyses will examine diet quality, screen time, physical activity, an d guardian self -
efficacy and confidence of those in the intervention and control groups while controlling for the correlated 
nature of the repeated measures within participants (i.e. baseline, post -intervention, and [ADDRESS_242859] -
intervention). Secondary an alyses will compare the BMI of guardians and BMI percentile of children at the 
three time points between the intervention and control groups. A longitudinal data analysis strategy will be 
employed with generalized estimating equations with robust CIs for b oth primary and secondary outcomes 
(Albert, 1999; Ma et al., 2012).  A 2-sided p -value <0.05 will be accepted to indicate statistical significance. 
Additional analyses will be conducted to determine if results were influenced by [CONTACT_203719] (age, gender, educational attainment of guardian, income, etc.). All analyses will be 
conducted in SAS version 9.2.   
 
 
4.3.   Data Storage  
 
4.3.1.  Data Management  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Privacy and confidentiality of all 
enrolled participants will be maintained.

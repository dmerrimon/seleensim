 1 Background  
1.1 Investigational Agent  
 Perfluoropropane gas (PFP or C 3F8) (Air Liquide, DMF #[ZIP_CODE])  
1.[ADDRESS_236407] 
use of PFx gases in an animal study was in 1984 ( 20) where perfluoromethane mi xed with 
oxygen was compared to Xenon ventilation CT studies in dogs. There was little additional activity in the field until 1998 when Kuethe’s group demonstrated the use of perfluoroethane 
mixed with oxygen to image rat lungs using 19F MRI and respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y triggered imaging (13 ). 
Two years later Schreiber’s group demonstrated ‘breath- hold’ imaging of the lungs of ventilated 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_198384]6 and ‘ultrafast’ MRI (24). The same group evaluated dynamic imaging including 
wash -in/washout kinetics of pulmonary vent ilation in 2001, again in ventilated pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (23). 
Kauczor reviewed various strategies for lung ventilation assessment using MRI in 2002 and cited 
six animal studies using PFx gases for such purposes (11). Jacob et al. demonstrated imaging of 
ventilation and diffusion in diseased and healthy excised human lungs as well as in 7 excised 
canine  lungs using perfluoroethane (9). Perez -Sanchez et al. used SF6 to create diffusion-
weighted images in anesthetized rats as well as calculated apparent diffusion constant ( ADC) 
maps in 2005 (18 ). The same group demonstrated the impact of pressure and air -SF6 
composition on ADC maps in rats in 2005 (21 ). Schreiber’s group demonstrated sub- second SF6 
images in pi[INVESTIGATOR_141364] 2006 as well as static 3D and dynamic wash- in images (26). Conradi et al. 
expanded on previous work and evaluated hyperpolarized 3He in humans as well as PFx gases in excised healthy and emphysematous human lung using perfluoroethane and perfluoropropane 
(4). Most recently Schreiber’s group has compared MRI of inhaled SF6 with respi[INVESTIGATOR_198385] (22).  
1.3 Risk/Benefits  
 There likely will be no direct benefits to the subjects, other than increased understanding 
of their COPD. There wil l be not direct benefits to the subjects without lung disease. The 
benefits resulting from this research includes a better understanding of COPD structure/function 
relationships and how these relate to clinical trajectories and therapeutic responses. This should 
translate into better -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198386].  
1.3.1 Potential Risks  
1. Pain and/or hematoma formation may occur at blood sampling site. This is not a serious 
complication.  
2. Dizziness during blood sampling may occur.  
3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_198387], but in our laboratory this has not been a 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page [ADDRESS_236408]  
5. The risks of participating in the MRI component of the study are considered minimal. 
MRI is a non- invasive imaging modality that involves no ionizing radiation. At the time 
of recruitment/consenting and again before the MRI session, all subjects will complete a standard questionnaire to screen for contraindications to MRI imaging (e.g. presence of 
metal in the eye).  
6. The primary r isk of the perfluorinated gases would be asphyxiation if breathed without 
oxygen present. This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_198416]. Further, as described in the preliminary 
data and research methods the source gas oxygen level is tested in the source gasbag prior 
to the study (510k cleared Oxygraf system) and the subject’s oxygen saturation is monitored with pulse oximetry before, during and after the MRI. Any abnormal drop in 
oxygen saturation based on absolute levels (SpO2 < 90%) or levels observed relative to 
room air breath- hold maneuvers OR any indication of a problem will the source gas 
would cause termination of the procedure. In addition, the gas is delivered via a 
disposable mask  with spi[INVESTIGATOR_198388] . Further, we monitor inhaled and exhaled flow with MR compatible 
pneumotachometers (510k cleared) . 
1.3.[ADDRESS_236409] Risk  
1. Pain and/or hematoma formation may occur at the blood drawing site. We have 
experienced coordinators and pulmonary function technologists certified in both arterial 
and venous blood sampling.  
2. Dizziness during blood sampling may occur. Subjects will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_198389].  
3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_198390], but in our laboratory this has not been a 
serious problem.  
4. Subjects will stay on their prescribed oxygen levels while participating in the study. Please note, this includes all the imaging components (CT and MRI)   
5. HRCT  will be performed in accordance with all Duke Department of Radiology 
procedures to minimize unnecessary ionizing radiation. The risks of the delivered 
radiation (i ncreased cancer risk) is described out in the required consent language and 
compared to other risks of everyday life (refer to section 1.3.4 ). 
6. All data will be maintained in secured files within the Duke Research site or in the 
SQUID research image management system.  
7. Subjects will be monitored as follows during the imaging procedures: (a) monito ring of 
SpO2 before during and after the examination (any SpO2 levels < 90% will cause the 
study to be terminated (b) monitoring of exhaled oxygen (%) and CO2 (%) using a laser 
based capnograph. Further, we monitor inhaled and exhaled flow with MR compatible 
pneumotachometers (510k cleared).  
8. Duke University has formal education and certification procedures regardi ng research 
ethics (www.irb.mc.duke.edu/certification.htm). All research personnel will complete 
these in full  before entry into the protocol;  the nature and risks of the study will be 
reviewed with each subject.  
9. Each subject will be given the opportunity to read the consent form and ask questions.

  Page [ADDRESS_236410]’s  body (this includes certain dyes found in tattoos). 
If there is any question about potenti ally hazardous metal within the subject’s body, we will be 
excluding the subject  from participation in this researc h study. We will also keep the exam room 
locked so that no one carrying m etal objects can enter while the subject is  in the scanner.  
 The study involves entering a large room i n which a magnet is present. The subject  will be 
placed on a narrow bed and then slid into a small tunnel approximately [ADDRESS_236411] with someone in attendance if you desire.  
1.3.4 Computed Tomography (CT)  
CT is a way to make x- ray images of the inside of the body. The CT scanner is a doughnut -
shaped machine that uses x- rays to create computer pi[INVESTIGATOR_198391] x- ray pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. During the procedure, a technologist will take the 
subject  into the CT scan room where the subject will l ie down on the table (usually on the 
subject’s  back) inside of the CT machine. The subject  should get comfortable because it is very 
important the subject does  not move during certain parts of the test.  CT examinations differ 
depending on the part of your body being studied. For example, if your abdomen is  being 
studied, a series of pi[INVESTIGATOR_198392]. During the study, the subject will be asked to hold their  breath so that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_198393]. The  
machine will make some  noise, and the table will  move during the scan. Also, the subject  may 
receive signals from the technologist or from the  machine about their  breathing.  
 If the subject is taking part in this research, the subject  will have one or mor e medical imaging 
studies that use radiation. The  tests or treatments the subject will have include lung CT scan 
(inhale/exhale). The radiation dose from this  research is a bout [ADDRESS_236412]  an 
idea about how much radiation will get, we w ill make a  comparison with an every- day situation. 
Everyone receives a small amount of unavoidable radiation each year. Some of this radiation 
comes from space and some from naturally occurring radioactive forms of water  and minerals. 
This research gives your body the equivalent of about 1 extra year’s worth of this natural  
radiation. The radiation dose we have discussed is what you will receive from this study only, and does not  include any exposure you may have received or will receive from other tests.  
 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 4 of 26 A possible health problem seen with radiation exposure is the development of cancer later in life. 
This extra  cancer risk is higher at younger ages and for girls and women. The extra lifetime risk 
of dying of a fatal cancer  due to the radiation exposure fr om this research may range from about  
one in 8,000 to about one in 3,000. At  such low radiation exposures, scientists disagree about the 
amount of risk. These estimates are very uncertain, and there may be no extra risk at all.  
 
We can compare this possibl e extra cancer risk to other risks (over a lifetime) that everyone is 
subject to in everyday life. For example, the chances of a person dying of cancer with no extra radiation exposure are about one in 4. The chances of dying in a car crash are about one i n 82, 
and the chances of being killed by a car while crossing the street are about one in 730.

spaces in their lungs using magnetic resonance imaging of  inert gas/oxygen mixtures.  
1.5 Trial Design  
An open l abel study in 250 subjects over five  years. We ar e planning 130 subjects with 
COPD (var ies stages of GOLD I -IV) and 120 normal subjects (non- smokers, ex smokers and 
current smokers with normal PFT’s).  
1.[ADDRESS_236414] (14) ( 11) at suspended or full expi[INVESTIGATOR_198394] a threshold 
value, e.g. < -[ADDRESS_236415] to be perhaps the only clinical phenotype to identify the several genotypes of COPD (http://www.copdgene.org/ats -abstracts -2010) (17) (7 ). 
We will focus on measuring such trappi[INVESTIGATOR_198395] 1.1 as well as washout using temporal 
measures of PFx image intensity in Aim 1.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
1. IND and Mixed Gases from Air Liquide/Scott Medical Products  
Before the initiation of these studies we received a full FDA  safety review and obtained 
IND 104,917 (Evaluation of Regional Ventilation in Normal Subjects and Subjects with Airway and Lung Disorders Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Inert Perfluorinated Gases 
mixed with Oxygen (SF6, and PFP): A Phase 1 Study) . We provided this information to our IRB 
in support of local approval of the protocol. Our shipments of gas mixtures have undergone microbial limit testing under USP <1111>, USP <61> and USP <62> as required by [CONTACT_198417] a t low pressure to insure that the dense gas component  remains 
in the gaseous state. Example calculations follow: The gas mixture is formulated to have a ‘dew point’ of 0°C, i.e. it will not ‘condense’ above 0°C. The vapor pressure of PFP at 0°C is 60.41 
psi. In order to determine the overall pressure of the mixture we divide the vapor pressure by [CONTACT_198418] (at 0°C). Then multiply by 294/273 (°Kelvin to °C conversion) to find the pressure at 21°C/70°F (assumed room 
temperature). So, for 79% PFP mix, it is: 60.41 / 0.79 = 76.46 psia @ 0°C x 294/273 = 82.35

2. Initial Human Images and Physiological Monitoring  
We have initiated a proof of concept study under IND 104,917 and with local IRB approval 
(Evaluation of Regional Ventilation in Normal Subjects and Subjects with Airway and Lung 
Disorders Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Inert Perfluorinated Gases mixed with 
Oxygen (PFP): A Phase 1 Study) . We have  conse nted 44 subjects  minus  one withdrawal , 
screened 43 subjects in the study with the characteristics described in Table 1 and scanned 30 
subjects (reasons for non scanning of subjects: 1 voluntary withdrawal  prior to any study 
participation, 5 body habitus (t oo obese), 4 screen fails, 4 MRI contraindications).

Table 1: Disease profiles of screened su bjects in the phase [ADDRESS_236416] udy will determine regional qualitative and quantitative lung function 
information in the context of the clinical trajectory of COPD defined by [CONTACT_198419] s. Due to the long time -frame of this disease we are using a modified case 
control design that allows a cross -sectional evaluation of the proposed measures in aims 1- 2 to 
identify putative markers that could later be tested as prognostic factors in longit udinal studies. 
In the case of these PFx/oxygen mixtures, the availability of multi -liter quantities allows for 
wash -in/wash -out image acquisition and analysis allowing direct measures of gas trappi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a 
manner not easily achieved with any existing modal ity.

  Page 6 of 26 3.1 Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims  
Aim 1: Determine quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in terms of direct 
measures of gas trappi[INVESTIGATOR_198396].  
 Sub- aim 1. 1: Compare gas trappi[INVESTIGATOR_198397]  [ADDRESS_236418] using 
conventional analysis procedures.  
 
Sub- aim 1.2: We will accomplish this aim (as well as Aim 2) in a well -characterized 
cohort of subjects with COPD and subjects with normal global pulmonary function tests (non- , 
ex- and current smokers). This cohort will provide the basis for the cross sectional evaluation of 
the imaging markers in all aims with respect to disease severity (e.g. GOLD status) and risk factors (e.g. smoking)  
 Aim 2: Determine ventilation defect severity by [CONTACT_198421]- in of 
the perfluorinated gas mixture to steady state in the same cohort.  
 
The outcomes  of the work  proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a novel quantitative 
approach for ventilation defect and gas trappi[INVESTIGATOR_198398] -center studies. It should also provide a set of bi omarkers 
that could better inform evaluation of new treatments.

spaces in their lungs using magnetic resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.   The 
subjects will receive the gas by [CONTACT_198422] a [ADDRESS_236420] Douglas Bag system. No additional drug products, 
investigational or otherwise will be provided in this study.  The subjec t will be monitored with a 
MRI compatible pulse oximeter as well as exhaled % oxygen and carbon dioxide.  
3.3 Duration  
3.3.1 Screening (V0)  
1. Obtaining Informed Consent from each subject   
2. History and Physical exam. The history will focus on onset of symptoms, co- morbidities, 
and smoking/occupational/environmental history. Also included:  
a. An assessment of patterns of exacerbations (mild = use of oral antibiotics and/or 
steroids for an acute change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]; moderate = hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198399] a change in re spi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]; severe = requirement for mechanical ventilation 
for a change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]).  
b. A measurement of the body mass index (BMI).  
c. A medication history (oral steroids, chronic bronchodilator use, oxygen use) with 
an emphasis on whether adhe rence was adequate.  
d. Assessment of gast ro-esophageal reflux disease ( 10)

3. Pulmonary function tests will include spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], plethysmographic lung volumes, and 
corrected carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). All procedures will be done in 
accordance with A TS/ERS standards ( 3) (15) (1 7). 
4. High resolution computerized scans of the chest (HRCT). Emphysema scores will be calculated per COPD  Gene protocol  (7). We will also explore novel approaches to 
quantifying airway structures ( 5) (16) 
5. A six -minute walk test with monitoring of pulse oximetry and heart rate will be 
conducted in a ccordance with ATS standards (1)  
6. Vital Signs will be measured and recorded ( temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ) 
7. Pulse oximetry will be measured and recorded.  
8. Weight and height will be recorded.   
9. Quality of Life (QOL) will be assessed using the St George self -administered instrument  
10. A serum  pregnancy tes t will also  be performed in women with child bearing potential.  
  
MRI will be collected at the study visit 1 after the screening visit. Where possible the screening visit (V0) and MRI visit (V1) will be accomplished on the same day for the convenience of the 
subject. In all cases, the MRI will be followed- up immediately following the MRI procedure for 
any adverse events. Finally, all subjects will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] [ADDRESS_236421] -MRI by [CONTACT_198423] -up regarding any adverse events.   
3.3.2 Visit  1: MRI 
Visit [ADDRESS_236422] , (if not performed at 
screening), the MRI exam, Vital signs (temperature, heart  rate, blood pressure,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_198401]) will be collected at pre and post imaging examination. A urine pregnancy 
test will be performed on female of child- bearing potential  if the screening serum test was given 
[ADDRESS_236423] a negative result to further participate in the study.   
  Additionally, subjects will be carefully observed for any signs of hypoxia  before,  during , and 
after the MRI exam using pulse oximetry. Any SpO2 reading < 90% will result in termination of 
the study.

4.4.1  MRI  
At the study visit (V1), MRI ‘studies’ will be perfo rmed using the same MR scanner (a 
3.0-Tesla (T) TRIO MRI system (Siemens Medical Systems )).  Lung morphology and function 
will be acquired using conventional 1H MRI followed by 19F MRI with a gaseous contrast agent 
mixed with oxygen for the 19F MRI study.  For both series the subject will lie down in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_198403] a transmitter and receive (T/R) coil for imaging of the hum an 
torso.  
 
For the gas mixture, the inert medical grade perfluorinated gas  (PFP) will be present at 
79% combined with 21% medical grade oxygen.  The agents will be supplied in aluminum 
cylinders (MR compatible) at pressures to prevent phase change of the perfluorinated component 
to the liquid phase.  For example, in an 8 inch by 52- inch aluminum cylinder, the same format 
cylinder of the 79% PFP/21% oxygen mixture will contain [ADDRESS_236431] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_198404], and then switch to PFP 
by a passive Douglas bag system with 35 mm tubing with remote pneumatic switching between 
room air and PFP and MRI compatible pneumotachometers to allow flow rate and gas volume 
determinations. The subjects are monitor ed with an MRI compatible pulse oximeter as well as 
exhaled % oxygen and carbon dioxide. The subjects will then exit the MRI suite.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_236432] scan will be performed of lower dose (50 mA) to assess for  air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

and reviewed periodically (every 6 -12 months).  In addition, a local Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will be established. The committee members will be pulmonologists and 
radiologists with knowledge of COPD, imaging techniques and clinical research procedures. The 
frequency of monitoring depends on the progress of the study and will range between 3 and 12 
months.  Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB and DSMC, and serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours.  An annual progress report (or more frequently, if requested) 
will be submitted to the IRB and DSMC . 
5.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB and DSMC, and any other regulatory agents, 
and serious  adverse events will be reported within 24 hours. An annual progress report (or more 
frequently, if requested) will be submitted to the IRB, DSMC and any other regulatory agents.  
 
Significant morbidity and mortality are anticipated in these study subjects  due to the nature of 
the disease. Deaths, exacerbations of COPD, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198407].  These outcomes will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_6802].  In accordance with policies of the NIH, other serious events, including 
severe injuries and new diagnosis of potentially fatal or disabling medical conditions will be reported as serious adverse events of the study to the local IRB, the DSMC, and the NIH.  The clinical investigator(s)  will terminate the study immediately if the occurrence of serious adverse 
events that suggests unacceptable risk to the health of the subjects.  All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study procedure (s), will be 
recorded on the adverse events page(s) of the CRF’s or worksheets.  Events involving adverse experiences occurring during the study procedure(s) will be recorded.   
5.[ADDRESS_236434] or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study procedures. Adverse events include the following:  
• All suspected procedure -related adve rse events.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness (see fifth 
bullet, below, regarding preexisting conditions).

  Page 14 of 26 • Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident  (e.g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.  If an accident results in a subsequent adverse event (e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall), both the ac cident and 
the subsequent event should be  recorded in the adverse event CRF.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require clinical intervention or further investigation unless they are associated with an already 
reported adverse event.  A test or an examination that is repeated to check a possible 
abnormality does not constitute an adverse event.  
• Preexisting condition (i.e., a disorder present before the adverse event reporting period 
started and noted on the pretre atment medical history/physical examination form) should 
not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_198408].  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_236435] medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., puts the patient or clinical investigation subject at immediate risk 
of death; but not an event that, had it been more severe, might have created a risk of death);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determi ning whether an event is an 
important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening 
and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event may 
jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is 
not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the study docum ents.  
In this case, “expected” does not include events that are anticipated based on pharmacological properties.

ventilation parameters f rom 19F gas imaging. So with 250 (5 groups) subjects we should be able 
using a t -test (or ANOVA) to detect a variation in defect volume of approximately 6% in the 
smallest sample (N = 26/group, GOLD III/IV) (alpha 0.05 and 90% power) and 5% in the 
referenc e groups (N=40/group). [ Statmate Ver 2, GraphPad Software (La Jolla, Ca)].  
 
Further, we wish to evaluate the diagnostic/prognostic ability of the MRI parameters to 
provide distinction among current ‘phenotypes’ and perhaps extend better discrimination with  
the MRI parameters from study aims .  We will also use statistical modeling for this project to 
correlate the features obtained from the gas -probe MR imaging- based measures with one or more 
of the clinical assessment measures recorded in Aim 1.2, to better  characterize disease 
phenotypes and identify the most promising prognostic indicators.  
 
In a similar context, a recent study has shown such promise for certain CT imaging- based 
features ( 7). Thus, if the role of MR imaging- based measures can be establishe d in a similar 
fashion then, associated with a link £, is some MR -defined variable Z which can define a 
biomarker, risk factor or phenotype R, resulting in the general linkage statement of 
R←£→GOLD+MRI. The makeup of this biomarker would contain information obtained from 
one or more measures Aims 1, 1.1 and 2 as well as other clinical status information X (as 
codified in the GOLD score or more generally some combination of the demographic, physiological and past history information, (Aim 1.2). This biomarker would then provide a 
more rapid and efficient means for deciding treatment strategies. We will examine the 
diagnostic/phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_198409]- based features (Aims 1 and 2) in  terms of 
their ability to predict existing clinical phenotypes (GOLD) characterized and other clinical features (Aim 1.2). For this purpose, we will divide the predictors into two categories: a) clinical 
assessments features (Xa1, Xa2,…, Xak), obtained fr om existing clinical, physiologic, and 
HRCT imaging, measured under Specific Aims 1.1 and 1.2; b) features obtained from MR 
imaging (Xb1, Xb2,…, Xbl), identified under Aims 1 and 2. A generalized linear model of the 
form [1] will be fitted using the method of maximum likelihood:  
 
g(Yt) = βa0 + βa1Xa1 + …+ βakXak + ε [1] 
 
The predictability of this model will be calculated using the Akaike Informati on Criterion 
(AIC) statistic (2), which balances the quality of fit (likelihood) against model complexity (8). Selection of the optimal subset of predictors will be achieved via a search over predictor space to identify the subset that maximizes the AIC statistic.

  Page [ADDRESS_236438] Access to Source Data/Documentation  
During trial conduct, DIAL  will conduct periodic monitoring to ensure that the protocol and 
GCP  are being followed.  DIAL staff will review source documents to confirm that the data 
recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow DIAL staff and 
appropriate re gulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   
8 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The trial site  (Duke)  may be subject to review by [CONTACT_198425]/or to quality assurance audits 
performed by [CONTACT_34434], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_198426].  It is 
important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during these monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
[ADDRESS_236439]  is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the trial and possible 
risks associated with participation.  The investigator will obtain written informed consent from

Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page [ADDRESS_236440]'s before any study- specific activity is performed.  The informed consent 
form used in this trial, and any changes made during the course of the trial, must be 
prospectively approved by [CONTACT_112392].  Additionally, the FDA will be notified of any 
changes prior to implementation as appropriate.  The investigator will retain a copy of each subject’s signed consent form.  
 The subjects will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_198427] (or other 
physician) so that they can be notified if any potentially clinically relevant findings are obtained from standard clinical procedure (e.g HRCT or PFT’s).  This contact [CONTACT_198428].

without written permission from Duke.   
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all 
CRFs. CRFs must be  electronic  signed by [CONTACT_198429] .  
These signatures serve to attest that  the information contained on the CRFs is true.  At all times, 
the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.

10.2  Data Storage  
All MRI images are stored in DIAL  for QA/QC and image  analysis;  CAMRD  will be 
notified of cases of unacceptable image quality t o enable the rescheduling of scans accordingly. 
Subjects can be rescanned a maximum of one (1) time. The data will be de -identified and stored 
in the research image management system SQUID, a research image management system in 
DIAL.

investigator according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), or federal, and local regulations should retain the records, whichever is longer.  
 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, the trial 
records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator at Duke.  The 
investigator must obtain Duke’s writte n permission before disposing of any records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.

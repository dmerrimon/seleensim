Short Title The CONTRoL  Trial: Cryotherapy  vs. cOmpression  Neuropathy  TRiaL 
Protocol Number AAAR9515  
Phase Phase 2B 
Methodology  Randomized,  placebo-controlled,  clinical selection trial 
Study Duration  18 months  
Study Center(s)  Single-center - Columbia University  Medical Center 
 
 
Objectives  To select the best intervention  from cold therapy, compression  therapy 
and placebo at reducing neuropathic pain  as measured  by [CONTACT_862022]  (NTX) component  of the Functional  Assessment  of 
Cancer Therapy (FACT) -Taxane questionnaire,  following  12 weeks of 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant  chemotherapy  with paclitaxel  or docetaxel  
among breast cancer patients.

Statistical  
Methodology  Patients will be randomly  assigned in triplets to receive either frozen 
gloves and socks, compression  gloves and socks, or “loose” gloves and 
socks (placebo arm) during chemotherapy  infusion. Randomization  will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_862023] (weekly vs q3week). The 
primary goal of the trial is to select the best intervention  to be carried 
forward for further study, with a high probability  of correct selection if 
one intervention  is truly superior to the other two by a pre-specified 
effect size. Up to 100 patients will be enrolled in the study, using a novel 
sequential  design based on the Levin-Robbins-Leu family of sequential  
selection procedures  that allows for an early elimination  of an apparently  
inferior arm. 
 
The primary endpoint of the study is the change in the neurotoxicity  
(NTX) component  of the Functional  Assessment  of Cancer Therapy 
(FACT) -Taxane questionnaire  at [ADDRESS_1201992] NTX of less than 5 points from 
baseline. Each time an outcome is observed for all patients in a triplet 
(or, after elimination  of one arm, a pair), those outcomes  are added to a 
running tally of successes  for each intervention.  Pre-specified criteria 
for eliminating  an inferior arm and for selecting the preferred 
intervention  will be applied starting from the 15th patient. From that 
point forward, with this sequential  procedure,  the preferred intervention  
can be selected during the ongoing enrollment  as soon as the pre- 
specified selection criteria are met, and further enrollment  will cease.

3. BACKGROUND  
Chemotherapy -induced peripheral  neuropathy  (CIPN) is a frequent side effect resulting from the 
administration  of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.  The incidence of CIPN can vary on the 
type of agent used, the frequency  with which it is  given, and  the cumulative dose.  Unfortunately,  
for some patients, symptoms  may persist even after discontinuation  of the drug due to 
irreversible nerve  damage [1].  Furthermore,  dose reduction  or early termination  of effective 
anti-cancer treatment may ultimately  affect overall survival.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_861991], only duloxetine  is recommended,  based on 
efficacy data from a large randomized  placebo-controlled  trial [2]. Numerous  trials have studied 
the efficacy of various pharmacologic  agents and chemoprotectants  in the prevention  of CIPN 
including  acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC), amifostine,  amitriptyline,  calcium and magnesium,  
diethyldithio -carbamate  (DDTC), glutathione (GSH),  nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  org 2766, all-trans-retinoic 
acid, rhuLIF, vitamin E,  N-acetylcysteine,  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], glutamate,  goshajinkigan  (GJG), 
omega-[ADDRESS_1201998] not shown  any consistent  and/or

conclusive clinically meaningful  benefits when compared  with placebo controls.  As of now, 
there are no established  agents for CIPN prevention  [3]. 
The taxanes, such as nab paclitaxel,  paclitaxel  or docetaxel,  are effective chemotherapeutic  
agents used in a variety  of malignant  diseases such as breast, ovarian, prostate  and lung cancer 
[4]. Clinical trials where patients received taxane -based therapy have reported up to 33% grades 
3-4 sensory  neuropathy  and up to 14% of motor neuropathy  [5].  The sensory symptoms  
associated  with taxane-induced peripheral  neuropathy  often begin in a  "stocking -glove" pattern 
and is characterized  by [CONTACT_77368], numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. Patients may  also 
experience motor deficits such as weakness,  difficulty walking or droppi[INVESTIGATOR_98474] [6].  Activities  
of daily living are often affected and  can greatly impair a patient's quality of life [7]. Often 
patients who experience  CIPN require dose reductions  or cessation of the offending  agent. 
Peripheral  neuropathy  is a disabling adverse effect of taxane therapy and no effective 
preventative  treatment currently exists.  The  purpose of this study is to directly  compare the 
efficacy of compression  therapy and cryotherapy  to a control arm for the prevention of CIPN. 
We hope to overcome  some of the study limitations  and biases of the prior clinical trials with the 
current study design. Given the safety  and tolerability  of cold therapy and compression  therapy, 
it is reasonable  to test the  efficacy of these non -pharmacological  interventions  in women with  
Stage I-III breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant paclitaxel  or docetaxel  for 12 weeks. 
 
 
4. INVESTIGATIONAL  AGENT 
 
4.1 Preclinical  Data - N/A 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1201999] been several studies investigating  potential pharmaceutical  agents, herbal 
supplements  and other modalities for  the prevention  and treatment of CIPN [8].  Recently, scalp 
cooling has been shown  in a randomized  clinical trial to reduce the incidence  of chemotherapy - 
induced alopecia in breast cancer patients receiving taxanes and/or anthracyclines  [9]. The 
rationale behind this therapy  is cold temperature  causes vasoconstriction,  decreasing  blood flow  
to the hair follicles  and therefore reducing the amount of drug that reaches the follicles. This 
concept was applied by [INVESTIGATOR_73808]é, et al. who evaluated  frozen glove use in the prevention  of 
docetaxel -induced nail and skin toxicity.  In this case control study, onycholysis  and cutaneous  
toxicity was significantly  lower in the hand with the frozen glove compared  with the control 
hand (P = .0001).  Eleven percent of patients withdrew from the study  due to cold intolerance  
[10]. 
In another prospective study,  forty breast cancer patients were treated with weekly  paclitaxel for  
12 cycles and wore frozen gloves and  socks on the dominant  side for 90 minutes [11]. 
Symptoms  on the treated sides were compared  to the untreated (non-dominant) side, which 
served as the control arm.  The  primary endpoint assessed was tactile disturbance using a 
monofilament  test.  Secondary  endpoints  included thermosensory  disturbance,  vibration 
perception,  performance  speed, patient neurotoxicity  questionnaire  (PNQ), electrophysiological

signs, and pharmacokinetics.  Tactile deterioration  was significantly  lower for the  intervention  
side compared  to the control side  (hand: 27.8% vs. 80.6%, P < .001; foot: 25.0% vs. 63.9%, P <  
.001).  In addition, the incidence of severe CIPN (PNQ grades D or E) occurred less with 
cryotherapy  (hand: 2.8% vs. 41.7%, P < .001; foot: 2.8% vs. 36.1%, P = .007). No patients 
dropped out due to cold intolerance.   Limitations  of the study included no  randomization,  each 
subject acting as their own control, and lack of long term follow-up. 
Similar to cryotherapy,  compression  therapy can also decrease microvascular flow  in the 
extremities.   In a self-controlled clinical trial, [ADDRESS_1202000] cancer wore two surgical 
gloves (one size smaller than the size that fit their dominant  hand) for 90 minutes while  receiving 
nab-paclitaxel  [12].  The rates of grade 2 or higher sensory and motor neuropathy  was 
significantly  lower in the  hand with the surgical gloves compared  to the control hand (sensory 
neuropathy  21.4 vs. 76.1%; motor neuropathy  26.2 vs. 57.1%).  Furthermore,  compression  
gloves significantly  decreased  the temperature of each fingertip by 1.6-2.2°C (P<.0001).   There 
were no withdrawals  from the study due to intolerability  of compression  gloves. In this trial, 
peripheral  neuropathy  was only evaluated  using subjective measures  (CTCAE,  PNQ) and feet 
were not addressed.

5. STUDY DESIGN  
 
5.1 General Design 
This is a randomized,  placebo-controlled  clinical selection trial of interventions  for CIPN in 
patients treated with  docetaxel  every 3 weeks or paclitaxel on a  weekly schedule.  Patients will  
be randomly  assigned to receive either frozen  gloves and socks, compression  gloves and socks, 
or “loose” gloves and socks (placebo arm) during  chemotherapy  infusion.  The primary goal of 
the trial is to select the best intervention  to be carried forward for further  study, with a high 
probability  of correct selection if one intervention  is truly superior to the other two by a pre- 
specified effect size.  Up to 100 patients (with expected sample sizes between 60-[ADDRESS_1202001] likely  scenarios)  will be enrolled in the study, using a novel sequential design that 
allows for an early elimination of  an apparently  inferior arm.  Initially the randomization  will be 
blocked in triplets of patients within chemotherapy  strata (every three weeks or weekly).  Each 
time an outcome is observed for all patients in a triplet, those outcomes  are added to a running 
tally of successes  for each intervention.   There is a pre-specified criterion in terms of the success 
tallies for eliminating  arms as evidence of apparent inferiority  accumulates.  If and when one  arm 
is eliminated,  pairs of patients are thereafter  randomly  assigned to the two remaining  
interventions,  and the trial continues until one of  the remaining  interventions  is subsequently  
eliminated, at which time  the apparently  superior intervention  is selected as the preferred 
intervention.   In the event that two arms are simultaneously  eliminated at any given examination  
of triplet tallies, the trial terminates at that time with the selection of the apparently  superior 
intervention.   With this sequential  procedure,  the preferred intervention  can be selected during 
the ongoing enrollment as soon as the pre-specified selection criteria are met, and further 
enrollment  will cease.  To ensure that there will be some unbiased estimates of the  proportion  of 
patients with a good outcome available for  each interventi on arm (a secondary  goal of the study), 
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
[ADDRESS_1202002] been 
observed.   Fifteen patients per  arm will provide a 95% confidence interval no wider than 0.52 
(+/- 0.26) percentage points for  the estimate of the proportion  of patients with a good outcome 
based on the Clopper Pearson method. 
 
This novel  approach based on the  Levin-Robbins-Leu family of sequential  selection procedures  
[18-23] will a) allow a rational selection of the CIPN intervention  to be carried forward for 
confirmatory  testing in a future phase 3 trial; b) provide preliminary  concurrent  control estimates 
for the placebo arm that can be used for sample size estimation in that future trial; and c) keep 
the trial small and efficient, consistent with a  Phase 2B design, until sufficient evidence of 
promise accumulates  to warrant the major investment in funds, time, and effort to complete the 
larger Phase 3 study. 
 
Upon enrollment,  each study participant will complete a baseline questionnaire  assessing 
demographic  information  (age, race, and tobacco use). Clinical characteristics  (cancer staging, 
grade, concomitant morbidities, chemotherapy  cumulative  dose and current medications) wi ll be 
documented  as well.  Patients will be able to enroll in the trial and complete the baseline 
assessment  up to the second chemotherapy  infusion. 
 
During each study encounter  (at baseline, week 12 +/- 14 days, and at week 24 +/ - 21 days), 
study participants  will complete a questionnaire  assessing pain, severity of CIPN, function, and 
comfort with the intervention.   They will also undergo objective neurological  assessments  of 
sensory and motor neuropathy  (see below). Further, adherence to the intervention  will also be 
assessed by [CONTACT_3647]. Patients will be evaluated  at weeks 12 and 24 from baseline to 
determine clinical  benefit of the intervention  during treatment  and to assess if the  benefit is 
sustained after discontinuation of  the intervention.   Outcome measures on week 12 from baseline 
will be evaluated  before scheduled  chemotherapy  infusion.  Visits will be conducted  within the 
below specified windows forbidding  unexpected  circumstances  such as missed appointments  or 
loss to follow-up.

scheduled  to receive adjuvant  or neoadjuvant paclitaxel  or docetaxel.  Therefore,  an accrual 
of up to 100 participants,  with an expected accrual of 60-70 participants, is feasible. 
6.5 Early Withdrawal  of Subjects 
6.5.1When and How to Withdraw  Subjects 
 Patients are not expected to develop progressive disease while receiving neoadjuvant or  
adjuvant therapy.  However,  if at any time the patient develops progressive  disease, 
he/she 
will be referred for alternative  therapy. He/she will continue to be  followed for the 
primary endpoint. American  Indian or Alaskan Native 0 + 0 =

  If at any time the patient develops unacceptable  neuropathy  from the chemotherapy  that leads 
to dose reduction/modification  or treatment discontinuation,  he/she will be counted as having 
a “poor” outcome for the primary endpoint. 
 If at any time the patient develops unacceptable toxicity from the chemotherapy  unrelated 
to neuropathy,  and needs to stop treatment,  he/she will continue to be followed for the 
primary 
endpoint. 
 If at any time the patient is found to be  ineligible for the protocol as designated  in the 
section on Criteria for Patient/Subject  Eligibility  (i.e., a change in diagnosis),  the patient 
will be removed from  study. 
 If the patient withdraws  consent for  continued  participation, he/she will  be removed 
from study 
 
6.5.2Data Collection  and Follow-up for Withdrawn  Subjects 
 
Even though subjects may be withdrawn  prematurely  from the study, it is imperative to collect at 
least efficacy data on such subjects throughout  the protocol defined follow-up period for that 
subject.  Such data are important to the integrity  of the final study analysis since early withdrawal  
could be related to the safety profile of the study products.  If a subject withdraws  consent to 
participate  in the study, attempts will be  made to obtain consent from the subject to record at least 
efficacy data up to the protocol-described  end of subject follow-up period. It must be a  high 
priority to try to obtain at least efficacy data on all subjects lost to follow-up and to note what 
methods should be  used before one can state the subject is truly lost to follow -up (e.g. number of 
phone calls to subject, phone calls to next-of-kin if possible, certified letters, etc.). Subjects  
withdrawn  because of unacceptable adverse events will be  followed for the primary endpoint 
and/or until resolution  or stabilization of the  adverse event.   In order to preserve the intent-to-treat 
principle ( “once randomized  then analyzed”) we will impute a  “poor” outcome for any patient 
who withdraws from  the study and cannot or will  not be evaluated  at [ADDRESS_1202008] Eligibility.  
 
Obtain informed consent,  by [CONTACT_862025],  along with applicable institutional  policies and federal regulations.  
 
Only Investigators/Research  personnel  properly trained and delegated  to consent subjects for this 
protocol will participate in the consenting  process. Furthermore,  properly delegated/trained  
Physician  Investigators (e.g.,  MD, MD PhD) are required  to sign/verify  a protocol specific 
Eligibility  Checklist  for each subject enrolled on the study, in addition to providing  the relevant 
source documentation confirmation subject eligibility.  
 
All participants  must be centrally  registered  through the Central Registration  Office

7. TREATMENT  PLAN 
 
7.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment  will be administered  on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks for frozen mittens/socks  and compression  garments are described  in Section 10. There are 
no dose modifications  for the products. 
 
Cryotherapy : Study subjects will wear NatraCure  flexible socks on bilateral hands and feet. The 
garments will be available in 3 sizes: small, medium, large.  The correct size will be determined  
during the initial visit and the same size used during each chemotherapy  infusion.  The  sock will 
act as a mitten and covers the entire hand until past the  wrist. There are [ADDRESS_1202010] 3 hours 
at -25 to -30°C prior to use.  With each infusion, patients will wear the frozen garments on their 
hands and feet for a total of 90-[ADDRESS_1202011] 15 minutes (with the window 
being within 30 minutes prior to start) before the start of the infusion and until at least 15 
minutes after the end of the infusion.  Two sets of socks will be used during each session for 45- 
60 minutes each to maintain a consistently  low temperatures  of the extremities.  Patients may 
remove the garments for up to 10 minutes during treatment if they need to use the restroom.  
 
Compression  therapy: Study participants will wear Sigvaris Secure Arm Sleeves and Gloves on 
bilateral upper extremities.   The sleeves and gloves provide 20-30mmHg  of compression.   The 
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
[ADDRESS_1202012] size will be 
determined  during the initial visit and the  same size and products used during each chemotherapy  
infusion.  With each chemotherapy  infusion, patients will wear the sleeves/gloves  and socks for a 
total of 90-[ADDRESS_1202013] 15 minutes before the start of the infusion (with the  
window being within 30 minutes prior to start) and until at least 15 minutes after the end of the 
infusion. 
 
Control arm (Loose glove/sock) : To minimize  potential biases of patients receiving treatment in 
the intervention  arms, we will have a control arm where patients will wear loose or comfortably  
fitting gloves/sleeves  and socks on their hands and feet. 
 
Study subjects will wear a non-compressive sleeve and  loosely fitting glove on bilateral arms and 
hands. They will also wear a non-compressive Sigvaris  Basic Liner with the CompreFlex  Lite 
loosely applied over it.  We will verify that no compression  is applied via using an interface 
pressure sensor (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_861993]).   The maximum level of allowed pressure for garments on the upper 
and lower extremities  will be 3mmHg.  If the pressure reading is >3mmHg,  then a larger garment 
size will be used.  For the loose garments,  the correct size will be determined  during the initial visit  
and the same size and products used during each chemotherapy  infusion.  If weight gain or 
swelling is noticed, then the patient may need to be refitted to ensure the correct placebo pressure 
is applied.  Measurements  with the pressure sensor will be repeated as needed to ensure a low 
pressure level of less than 3mmHg. With each chemotherapy  infusion, patients will wear the 
gloves/sleeves  and socks for a total of 90-120 minutes, beginning  15 minutes before the start of the 
infusion and until 15 minutes after the end of the infusion.

9.2 Definitions  
Adverse Event:  
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
20  
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward  or unfavorable  medical occurrence  in a human subject, 
including  abnormal  sign, symptom or disease, temporally  associated  with the subject’s 
participation  in research, whether or not considered  related to the subject’s participation  in the 
research. Abnormal  results of diagnostic  procedures  are considered  to be adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated  with a serious adverse event 
 is associated  with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional  treatment  or to further diagnostic  tests 
 is considered  by [CONTACT_862028]: 
Adverse events are classified  as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is: 
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolongation  of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unless 
o routine treatment  or monitoring  of the studied indication, not associated  with any 
deterioration  in condition (procedures  such as central line placements,  paracentesis,  
pain control) 
o elective or pre-planned treatment for  a pre-existing condition  that is unrelated to the 
indication  under study and has not worsened  since the start of study drug 
o treatment  on an emergency  outpatient basis for  an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions  of an SAE given above/below and  not resulting  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186993]  
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_861994]’s 
general condition  
 results in persistent  or significant  disability or incapacity  
 a congenital  anomaly or birth defect 
 an important  medical event 
 
Important  medical events are those that may not be immediately  life threatening,  but are clearly of 
major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize  the subject, and may require intervention  to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes  noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861995]. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious events should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events. 
 
Unanticipated  Problem:  
An unanticipated  problem is any incident, experience  or outcome involving  risks to subjects or 
others in any human subjects research that meets all of the following  criteria: 
 Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity or frequency)  given (a) the research procedures  
that are described  in the IRB-approval protocol and informed consent document,  and (b) the 
characteristics  of the subject population  being studied; 
 Related or possibly related to participation  in such research (e.g., there is a reasonable  
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
[ADDRESS_1202015] been caused by [CONTACT_862029]);  and 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including  
physical, psychological,  economic  or social harm) than was previously  known or recognized.  
Adverse Event Reporting  Period 
The study period during  which adverse events must be reported is normally  defined as the period 
from the initiation of  any study procedures  (e.g., after the first dose of study treatment)  to the end 
of the study treatment  (e.g., last dose of study treatment) and/or follow-up.  For this study, the 
study treatment  follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_1202016]. 
Baseline/Preexisting  Condition  
A baseline/preexisting  condition is one  that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting  
condition should be  recorded as an adverse event if the frequency,  intensity, or if the character of 
the condition worsens during the study period. 
General Physical Examination  Findings 
At screening,  any clinically significant  abnormality  should be  recorded as a preexisting  
condition.   At the end of the study, any new clinically significant  findings/abnormalities  that 
meet the definition  of an adverse event must also  be recorded and documented  as an adverse 
event. 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be  followed by [CONTACT_862030], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise  explained.  At the last 
scheduled  visit, the investigator  should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician,  believes might reasonably  be related to 
participation  in this study. 
Abnormal  Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory  abnormality  should be  documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following  conditions  is met: 
 The laboratory  abnormality  is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the  
abnormality  
 The abnormality  suggests a  disease and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality  is of a degree that requires active management  (e.g., change of dose, 
discontinuation  of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments,  further diagnostic  
investigation,  etc.). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  Prolonged  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861996] a serious adverse event unless specifically  instructed  otherwise  in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be  documented  as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for  an adverse event. 
Neither the condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor  surgery are reported as an

 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861997] 
a preexisting  condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic  and the outcome was  uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861998]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861999],

9.[ADDRESS_1202017] seek information  on adverse events  by 
[CONTACT_85396], as appropriate,  by [CONTACT_5148].   Information  on all adverse events 
should be  recorded immediately  in the source document,  and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of  the case report form (CRF).   All clearly related signs, symptoms,  and abnormal 
diagnostic  procedures  results should be recorded in the source document, though should be  
grouped under one  diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring  during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of 
each event should be  followed until resolution,  stabilization, or  until it has been determined  that 
the study treatment  or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse  events that are still ongoing 
at the end of the study period must be  followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered  to be possibly  related to the 
study treatment  or study participation  should be  recorded and reported immediately.  
 
9.4 Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events 
9.4.1 IRB Notification  by [CONTACT_2728]-Investigator  
Reports of all events (including  follow-up information)  that meet the definition  of an unanticipated  
problem posing risk to subjects or others must be submitted  to the IRB within one week (5 business 
days) following  the occurrence  of the unanticipated  problem or the principal investigator ’s 
acquiring  knowledge  of the unanticipated  problem in accordance  with IRB policy. Additionally,  
the sponsor-investigator  will submit a summary of all Unanticipated  problems that occurred since 
the beginning  of the study at the time of continuing  review. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_862001].

Study Products 
 
9.6 Description  
 
Cryotherapy : Study subjects will wear NatraCure  flexible socks on bilateral hands and feet. The 
garments will be available in 3 sizes: small, medium, large.  The correct size will be determined  
during the initial visit  and the same size used during each chemotherapy  infusion.  The  sock will 
act as a mitten and covers the entire hand until past the  wrist. There are [ADDRESS_1202019] of the hand.  For the feet, the sock 
will cover the entire foot until above  the ankle. 
Compression  therapy: Study participants will wear Sigvaris Secure Arm Sleeves and Gloves on 
bilateral upper extremities.   The sleeves and gloves provide 20-30mmHg  of compression.  The 
arm sleeves will be available in several sizes.  Subjects will wear Sigvaris CompreFlex  Lite 
compression  garments on the lower extremities  which includes a transition liner with a 
compressive foot, providing  20-30mmHg  of compression  on the lower leg and 15mmHg  on the 
toes and feet.  AccuTabs  will be placed along the CompreFlex  Lite to easily and accurately  set 
the compression  level at 20-30mmHg.   For the compression  garments,  the correct size will be 
determined  during the initial visit  and the same size and products used during each chemotherapy  
infusion. 
Control arm (Loose glove/sock) : Study subjects will wear a non-compressive  sleeve and  loosely 
fitting glove on bilateral arms and hands.  The will also wear a non-compressive  Sigvaris Basic 
Liner with  the CompreFlex  Lite loosely applied over it. We will verify that no compression  is 
applied via using an interface pressure sensor  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_861993]).  The maximum level of allowed 
pressure for garments on the upper and lower extremities will be  3mmHg.  If the pressure 
reading is >3mmHg,  then a larger garment size will be used. For the loose garments,  the correct 
size will be determined  during the initial visit  and the same size and products used during each 
chemotherapy  infusion. 
 
9.7 Treatment  Regimen 
Cryotherapy : Products will be refrigerated  for at least 3 hours at -25 to -30°C prior  to use. With 
each infusion, patients will wear the frozen socks on both hands and feet for a total of 90-120

 minutes, beginning  at least 15 minutes before the start of the infusion (with a window of  30 
minutes prior to infusion)  and until at least 15 minutes after the end of the infusion.  Two sets of 
socks will be used during each session for 45-60 minutes each to maintain a consistently  low 
temperature of the extremities.  
 
Compression  therapy/Control  arm: With each chemotherapy  infusion, patients will wear the 
gloves/sleeves  and socks for a total of 90-[ADDRESS_1202020] 15 minutes before the 
start of the infusion (with a window of  [ADDRESS_1202021] 15 minutes 
after the end of the infusion.

9.8 Method for Assigning  Subjects to Treatment  Groups 
 
Randomization  will be centralized  by [CONTACT_862033]. Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_862034] (every 3 weeks versus weekly). Patients will be randomized  
in triplets at the start of the trial until the outcomes  of [ADDRESS_1202024] compliance with the frozen, compression  and placebo products 
during each treatment.   Subjects who are significantly  non-compliant with the  study treatment  
regimen will be asked to withdraw from  the study.

10. STUDY CALENDAR  
 
Study protocol and schedule of  evaluation:  Upon enrollment,  each study participant will  
complete a baseline questionnaire  assessing demographic  information  (age, race, and tobacco 
use).  Clinical characteristics  (cancer staging, grade, concomitant  morbidities, chemotherapy  
cumulative dose and current medications) will  be documented  as well. Patients will be able to 
enroll in the trial and complete the baseline assessment  up to the second chemotherapy  infusion. 
During each encounter, study participants  will complete a questionnaire  assessing pain, severity 
of CIPN and function, and self-reported comfort with the study intervention.  They  will also 
undergo objective neurological  assessments  of sensory and motor neuropathy  (see below). 
Further, research staff will assess adherence to the treatment  intervention.  Patients will be 
evaluated  at weeks 12 and 24 from baseline to determine  clinical benefit of the intervention  
during treatment and to assess if the  benefit is sustained after discontinuation of  the 
intervention.   Outcome measures on week 12 from baseline will be evaluated  before scheduled  
chemotherapy  infusion.  Visits will be conducted within  the below specified windows

11. MEASUREMENT  OF EFFECT  - 
 
Primary endpoint: 
Functional  Assessment  of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT -Taxane) Neurotoxicity  (NTX): 
We will assess neurotoxicity  using the 11-item neurotoxicity  component  of the Functional  
Assessment  of Cancer Therapy - Taxane symptom module. Each item is measured on a 0-4 
scale (1, not at all; 4, very much). Questions  pertain to sensory  neuropathy,  motor 
neuropathy,  hearing neuropathy,  and dysfunction  associated with  neuropathy.  The FACT 
NTX was  initially developed with input of expert clinicians  and patients who reported 
symptoms  of CIPN within the past month.[13] The questionnaire  was validated in patients 
with cancer who  received taxane and platinum chemotherapy,  drugs known to cause 
CIPN.[14, 15]. The FACT NTX has been shown to have internal  consistency  reliability  on 
the basis of Cronbach  α coefficients  of 0.84-0.88 and the scale is also responsive  to changes 
 
26 
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020   
 in patient reported CIPN over time [15]. The FACT NTX has been used in prior clinical trials 
evaluating  intervention  for treatment and prevention  of CIPN.[16-19] 
The primary endpoint is the change in FACT NTX at [ADDRESS_1202028] NTX will be dichotomized into a good outcome (change in 
FACT NTX<5 from baseline to week 12) versus a poor outcome (change in FACT NTX≥5  from 
baseline to week 12).[16] This dichotomy  will be the primary outcome for monitoring  in the 
selection procedure.   Patients who experience dose reductions/modifications  and/or treatment 
discontinuation  for their chemotherapy  treatment  due to neuropathy  are considered to have  a 
”poor” outcome. 
 
Secondary  endpoints:  
National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) 
grading scale: The NCI-CTCAE is a subjective method to evaluate CIPN  which is performed  
by a healthcare  professional.   The patient's peripheral  sensory neuropathy,  peripheral  motor 
neuropathy,  dysestheia,  paresthesia and  neuralgia will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 
depending  on severity  [20]. 
Skin/nail toxicity: Cutaneous  toxicity and onycholysis  will be assessed by a healthcare  
professional  using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity  Criteria (Version 2), 
specifically  nail changes.  Grade 1 includes discoloration,  ridging (koilonychia),  or pi[INVESTIGATOR_862002] 2 is partial or complete loss of nail(s) or pain in the nail beds. 
Comfort with Intervention : Comfort with the study intervention  will be assessed on a 4-point 
scale, (0=dissatisfied;  1=not satisfied; 2=satisfied;  3=very satisfied).  This scale was  used to 
assess comfort  of cryotherapy  previously,  comfort to compression  therapy was not previously  
assessed.[ 10] 
Tuning fork (vibration):  Study participants will be assessed for development  of sensory  
neurological  dysfunction.  Vibration  perception  will be assessed using a tuning fork [21]. 
 
Vibration  threshold will be tested on the bilateral dorsum of the  distal interphalangeal  joint of 
the index finger and dorsum of the  interphalangeal  joint of the  hallux. Subjects will be asked 
to indicate when  the vibration stimulus  is initially felt (perception  threshold)  and when the 
stimulus disappears (disappearance threshold.) The vibration perception  threshold is the  
average of three paired  measurements.  
Neuropen  (pressure/pain):  Evaluation  of other sensory endpoints  including  touch, pressure 
and pain will be evaluated  using a Neuropen.   Touch and pressure sensation will be assessed 
using a 10-g monofilament on the  subject's dominant foot.  Pain and subjective sharpness  
sensation will be assessed using the Neuropen  on the dominant foot.  The spring mechanism  
is calibrated  to exert a force of 40 grams to help identify subjects with loss of pain sensation. 
Timed get up and go: The ‘timed get up and go’ test is a rapid and widely used clinical 
performance -based measure of lower extremity  function, mobility, and fall risk [22]. Subjects 
are asked to stand up  from a standard chair (seat  height between 44 and 47 cm), walk  a 
distance of 3 m (marked on the floor) at a comfortable pace, turn, walk back and sit down. 
Subjects are permitted  to use routine walking aids and are instructed  not to use their arms  to 
27

28  
 stand up. No physical assistance  is given. The time to complete the task is measured  with a 
stopwatch. Timing  commences  on the command  ‘go’ and stops when the subject's back is 
positioned  against the back of the  chair after sitting down. Shorter times indicate better 
performance.  Patients who are wheelchair -bound will not be required to complete this  
assessment.  Training on the use of this tool is available online 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grrYoBucNPE ). 
Tandem and Unipedal stance test: Balance will be assessed using the tandem and unipedal 
stance test [23].  In this assessment, the subject stands with one  foot in front of the other (heel 
to toe) (30 seconds), then on one leg with: eyes open (60 seconds), eyes closed (30  seconds), 
and eyes open with head rotation (30 seconds) with arms held comfortably  at the side. 
Participants  are allowed one practice trial  for each of the balance tests. Tests are recorded as 
achieved or not. The test was accepted failure when the stance foot shifted in any way or the 
nonstance foot touched the ground. If the subject did not reach the maximum time, the best 
time was recorded. 
Adherence to the Study Intervention : Adherence  will be defined as wearing the assigned 
gloves and  socks for ≥ 80% of infusions

Adverse event lists, guidelines,  and instructions  for AE reporting can be found in Section 10.0 
(Adverse Events:  List and Reporting  Requirements).  The Data Safety Monitoring  Plan is 
described  in Section 12.2. 
 
12.1 Data Collection  
The Herbert Irving Comprehensive  Cancer Center has an electronic clinical  trials and data 
management  system (CTMS) that will be used for data collection.  CRFs for the study will be 
built into the  CTMS for data entry. The system has full auditing capabilities  which is web-based 
and housed on a server in a fully HIPAA compliant server room  with restricted  access and video 
camera monitoring.  All users must login with their own application  username [CONTACT_2383].  
Users off campus  must first access the Virtual Private Networ k with their assigned campus 
username [CONTACT_862048].  Users are only able to see 
study information if they are indicated as study personnel in our  electronic  IRB system. Users 
are limited to access based on the role assigned  in their corresponding  protocol. Subject data is 
entered directly into the system, which (in the case of Columbia subjects) confirms the correct 
identity of patients via an interface with the electronic medical patient index.  Staff with the 
appropriate  IRB defined roles can run reports within the  system for reporting purposes.

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Implementation:  
This is a randomized,  placebo-controlled  clinical selection trial of interventions  for CIPN in 
patients treated with  paclitaxel  or docetaxel  every [ADDRESS_1202033] procedure.  The data will be examined  each time a triplet (or, after elimination of one  arm, a 
pair) of randomized  patients completes  follow-up. 
 
The goal of the procedure  is to make  a correct selection,  i.e. to select the intervention  that yields 
the greatest true probability  of change in FACT NTX<5, assuming  one exists, with high 
probability.   The procedure  follows the preference  zone / indifference zone approach,  wherein 
we require the selection procedure to guarantee  a probability  of at least 80% correct selection (of 
the truly best intervention),  assuming that one is truly superior to the others by a pre-specified 
amount.  This pre-specification  defines a region in the parameter  space called the preference  
zone.  If the best intervention  does not exceed the next best by [CONTACT_7416]-specified amount, the 
success probabilities  are said to lie in the indifference zone , where we shall be indifferent  to the 
fact that the probability  of correct selection may be less than 80%.  For this trial, the preference  
zone consists of all parameter  vectors (p1, p2, p3) of success probabilities  where the odds ratio 
comparing  the largest to the next largest is greater than or equal to 2.0. 
 
The selection procedure  is specified by [CONTACT_862037], the elimination  rule, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], 
and the terminal decision rule, as follows. 
 
Sampling rule : 
Vector-at-a-time sampling  will be used.  Patients will be randomized  in triplets within 
 
31 
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
32  
 chemotherapy  strata to one of the three intervention  arms.  If and when one arm is eliminated,  
patients will be randomized  in pairs to the remaining  interventions.  
 
Success tallies: 
Each time the follow-up for each patient in a triplet is complete and a “good” or “poor” outcome 
is determined  for each (change in FACT NTX<5 or >=5, respectively),  the triplet becomes 
“observed” and is available for sequential  monitoring  by [CONTACT_124436] a running tally of the “good” 
outcomes  for each intervention.  These success tallies are used for the elimination  criterion. 
 
Elimination criterion:  
The criterion for elimination  of an intervention  is a difference of [ADDRESS_1202034] time that the success tally for the intervention  (or 
interventions) with  the largest tally exceeds the  success tally of the intervention (or 
interventions) with  the smallest tally, we eliminate the intervention  (or interventions)  with that 
smallest tally.  By “elimination” of an interventio n arm we mean that no further patients will be 
randomized  to such an arm.  Thereafter,  the trial continues with the  remaining  interventions  
whose success tallies resume at their current  values. The trial then continues  randomizing  
additional  pairs of patients until the difference in success tallies again equals 4, at which time  the 
intervention  with the smaller success tally is eliminated.  If at any time two arms should happen 
to be tied with 4 fewer successes  than the intervention  currently in the lead, then both trailing 
interventions  are eliminated  at that time. 
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]: 
Stop the first time two intervention  arms have been eliminated,  if this occurs at or before 100 
patients’ outcomes have been  observed.   If the criterion for the second elimination  has not been 
reached at or before [ADDRESS_1202035] been  observed,  the maximum  
number of subsequent  pairs will be (100−3N)/2 if N is even or (99−3N)/2 if N is odd. (There is 
no truncation  if an early elimination of  two interventions  occurs at or before [ADDRESS_1202036]  
been observed because the trial stops in that case with a criterion decision.)  
 
Decision rule: 
If the second elimination  criterion is reached, the remaining  intervention  with the largest success 
tally is selected as the preferred intervention.  If the trial stops by [CONTACT_862038], the intervention  
with the largest success tally among the remaining  competitors is selected.  If there are ties for 
the largest success tally at time of truncation,  we will select the intervention  according  to other 
considerations  (safety, ease of compliance,  etc.).  By [CONTACT_862039], there 
can be no ties for best success tally if the trial stops before truncation.  
 
Incomplete  triplets and overrunning : 
If at the time of first elimination  there are partially filled or partially observed triplets of patients 
that have been  randomized  and have started their intervention,  we will allow each patient in each 
such triplet to complete their follow -up even if the  arm to which they were randomized  is

Version Date: 16Jan2020  
[ADDRESS_1202037] elimination,  data from 
such overrun triplets or pairs will be used to weigh the evidence concerning  success 
probabilities,  but they will not be used to alter the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862005], 
in order to preserve the validity of the sequential  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124502].  
 
Operating  characteristics  of the Study Design: 
The elimination  criterion of a lead of [ADDRESS_1202038] 80% for any true success probabilities  lying 
in the preference zone characterized  by [CONTACT_136063] 2.[ADDRESS_1202039] two interventions.   For example, true  success probabilities of 26/33  
(approximately  0.79), 0.65, and 0.65 with an odds  ratio of 2.0 comparing  26/[ADDRESS_1202040] favorable configuration  with p1 > p2 = p3 and {p1/(1− p1)}/{p2/(1− p2)} 
= 2.0, the selection procedure  will result in a correct selection with at least 80% probability.  
Based on published  studies [12,13]  [12] [12] evaluating  frozen and compression  gloves, the 
observed rates were 72% and 79%, respectively,  and experience suggests  a 40% success rate for 
the control arm is plausible.   We  shall refer to the configuration  of success probabilities  of 79%, 
65% and 40% as the design alternative  and it too is inside the  preference zone. Under the design 
alternative,  the probability  of correct selection is over 90%.  Table 1 shows the operating  
characteristics  of the selection procedure under various scenarios of true success probability  
configurations  for the three arms.

P[as] is the probability  of an acceptable  selection overall, either by [CONTACT_862040]

Mean[N] is the mean of the distribution  of the (random) total number of patients. 
Median[N] is the median of the distribution  of the total number of patients. 
 
Mean[N at first elim] is the mean number of outcomes  observed at time of first elimination.  If no arms 
are eliminated,  the number at first elimination  is the number at truncation  (i.e. 99). 
P[truncation ] is the probability  that the trial will be truncated before the second elimination  time. 
P[cs at N=45] is the probability  of correct selection after [ADDRESS_1202041] been randomized  (15 patients in each 
of the three arms). 
P[as at N=45] is the probability  of acceptable  selection after [ADDRESS_1202042] been randomized  (15 patients in each 
of the three arms). 
P(N=45) is the probability  of reaching a decision after exactly [ADDRESS_1202043] stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862006].  
P(N<80] is the probability  that the total number of patients is less than 80 
P(N<60] is the probability  that the total number of patients is less than [ADDRESS_1202044] favorable  configuration  in 
the preference zone with an odds ratio of 2.0. The second scenario corresponds to  the 
abovementioned design  alternative based on the observed rates from previously  conducted  
studies (where we have adjusted those  rates to have more conservative  effect sizes to account 
for a potential placebo effect). The third and fourth scenarios describe the operating  
characteristics  of the selection procedure inside the indifference  zone, assuming smaller 
differences  in the success rates for the two interventions.  The third scenario assumes  that both 
interventions  are superior to the placebo with a smaller difference between  them (such that the  
odds ratio between the best and second best intervention  is less than 2.0).  The fourth scenario 
Columbia  University  Medical Center 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Version Date: 16Jan2020  
35  
 assumes that both interventions  are superior to the placebo with no difference between  them 
(an odds ratio of 1.0). The fifth scenario illustrates  a case where there is no true difference in 
the rates for all three arms.  The  first row displays the probability  of selecting the first 
intervention  (which is the best in scenarios 1-3, and tied for the best in scenarios 4-5). The 
second row of the table shows the probability  of an acceptable selection.   For parameter  values 
inside the indifference zone, it is deemed acceptable to select any intervention whose  success 
probability  has an odds ratio compared to the best treatment  no less than 1/2.0 = 0.5.  Thus in 
the third and fourth scenarios,  it is acceptable to select either of the first two interventions.   In 
the fifth scenario, it is acceptable to select any of the three interventions.  For configurations  in 
the preference  zone, only correct selections  are deemed acceptable.  
 
In scenarios 1-3 where there is a superior  arm, the design chooses the superior  arm over 83% of 
the time across these scenarios with average sample sizes between 65.7 and 75.2 (median of 59 
to 76). The average time to first elimination ranges from 46.[ADDRESS_1202045] 15 patients per arm. Under the design alternative,  there is 27.2% 
probability  that we will stop the trial w ith 15 patients per arm. The probability  of having to 
truncate the study ranges from 16.3% to 30.3%,  with the lowest probability  for our design 
alternative.   The probability  of selecting the superior arm  after 45 patients are enrolled is 
between 68.1% and 79.2% in these scenarios,  which explains the need to continue enrollment  to 
ensure that the correct dose is selected with  high probability.  
 
In scenario 4, both interventions  are equally efficacious  and superior to the placebo.  In that 
setting there is not a single superior treatment  and selecting either one of the superior 
interventions  would be acceptable.   In that scenario, the probability  of selecting either of the 
superior interventions  is 99.7%. The average total sample  size is similar to that under the least 
favorable configuration  and the probability  of truncation is slightly  larger because there is no 
superior arm after a first elimination  of the placebo arm. 
 
In scenario 5, there is no difference among the three arms. Thus, the design randomly  selects 
one of them with a probability  of 0.33.  However,  given that they are all the same, it is  
acceptable  to select any of them and thus the  probability  of selecting an acceptable  intervention  
is 100%. Because there is no superior intervention  in this scenario, evidence of an apparent 
advantage accumulates  more slowly than under  other scenarios and thus the procedure incurs  a 
larger average sample size,  average sample size to first elimination, and probability  of truncation.  
 
Thus, under the design alternative the average sample size  is 66 (median is 59), and it is more  
likely than not that the sample size  is under 60. Under scenario  3, which assumes a  smaller 
difference,  the average sample size is [ADDRESS_1202046] a sample size of 80 or less.

j Analysis  of the Primary  Endpoint:  
For reporting purposes,  we will calculate the sample proportion  of patients along with the 
corresponding exact  binomial 95% confidence interval  after [ADDRESS_1202047] NTX<5from  baseline to week [ADDRESS_1202048] selections, assuming  there is a 
minimum true  degree of superiority  as measured  by [CONTACT_862041], we will quote the  
likelihood  ratio (LR) measure of weight of evidence in various ways as follows. 
 
At the end of the trial, we will calculate the likelihood of  the success tallies for the intervention  
selected together with the first runner-up.  This likelihood is given by 
L( p , p | X (n) , X (n) ) 
( n ) p i (1 p )nXi  
( n ) 
p  j (1 p )nX j , 
i j i j i i j j 
 
where X (n) and (n) 
j are the observed success tallies for the selected and first runner-up 
intervention  and where pi [INVESTIGATOR_862007].   We will also 
calculate the likelihood  of the observed success tallies under the assumption  that we erred in our 
selection and that the true  success probabilities are those for the two interventions  transposed , 
namely, L( pj , pi | X ( n) , X ( n) ) . The likelihood  ratio LR is the ratio of these two likelihoods.  It can 
be shown that LR, equals the true odds ratio raised to the fourth power,

in the case where the trial ends meeting the selection criterion.  In the case of truncation,  the 
exponent 4 is replaced by X (n)  X (n) .  We will evaluate LR at the maximum  likelihood  estimates 
i j 
of pi [INVESTIGATOR_136047], which are the adjusted sample proportions  ( X (n)  0.5) (n 1) and ( X (n) 0.5) (n 1) . 
The values of success tallies used in LR are those used in the  elimination  and selection criteria, i.e., 
without follow-up data from incomplete  triplets or  overrun triplets or pairs. However,  for the 
values of pi [INVESTIGATOR_136048], we will use the corresponding  sample proportions using all of the 
available outcome data including  data from incomplete triplets and overrun triplets or pairs. X

For example, suppose after an early elimination  of the placebo arm, the success tally for the 
frozen gloves  and socks is 18 and that of the compression  gloves and socks is 14, each with 27 
patients observed at stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_220580]. Then the maximum likelihood estimate  of the true odds ratio 
comparing  the two interventions  (adding one-half to each frequency)  is (18.5/9.5)  / (14.5/13.5) =  
1.813, so that the likelihood  ratio weight of evidence is 1.813 raised to the fourth power which  is

 10.8.  Likelihood  ratios in excess of 8 or  10 are generally considered  to be moderate to strong 
evidence [24].  For example, the usual “significant  at p<0.05” corresponds  to a LR of only 6.[ADDRESS_1202049] elimination,  measuring  the weight of evidence that 
the intervention  eliminated  by [CONTACT_862042].   In the above example, suppose 
that the placebo was eliminated after 20 triplets with a success tally of 7 compared  with the other 
two interventions’ tallies tied at 11 successes  each.  Then the odds ratio comparing  the leading 
tally to the trailing tally is (11.5/9.5)  / (7.5/13.5) = 2.179.  Then the LR is 2.[ADDRESS_1202050] selection (if  LR>10) or only weak evidence,  and the 
LR weight of evidence will be taken account of in evaluating  whether or not to mount a  
subsequent  phase [ADDRESS_1202051]. 
 
13.2 Size/Accrual  Rate 
Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_862043] (CUMC).  The estimated  accrual is [ADDRESS_1202052] 
cancer patients each week. Approximately  8-12 patients per  month are scheduled to receive 
adjuvant or neoadjuvant  paclitaxel  or docetaxel.  Therefore,  an accrual of 100 patients,  
expected to be  around 60 to 70, is feasible. 
 
13.3 Stratification  Factors 
Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_862044] (every 3 weeks 
versus weekly).  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1202053] NTX of less than 5 and a worsening  in neuropathy  
as determined  by [CONTACT_6812]-CTCAE grading, who reported satisfied or very satisfied in the  comfort 
scale, who discontinued  intervention  will be reported by [CONTACT_67887]. Moreover,  we will report 
the descriptive statistics  (mean, median, interquartile range) for the changes from baseline with 
the Neuropen,  tuning fork, timed get up and go test, and tandem/unipedal  stance test by [CONTACT_48831], 
as well as, changes in FACT NTX,. The  proportion  of patients with cutaneous  toxicity and 
onycholysis  using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity  Criteria (Version 2) will also 
be estimated  by [CONTACT_48831]. Graphical  display of the data will also be done.

 If at the time of first elimination  there are partially filled or partially observed triplets of patients 
that have been  randomized  and have started their intervention,  we will allow each patient in each 
such triplet to complete their follow -up even if the  arm to which they were randomized  is 
eliminated.  Outcomes  collected from  these incomplete  triplets will contribute to the secondary  
goal of obtaining  unbiased estimates of the success probabilities  and in interpreting  the results of 
the study as explained below.  However,  the data from patients in incomp lete triplets randomized  
to eliminated  arms will not be considered  in applying the criterion to eliminate  a subsequent  
intervention,  in order to preserve the validity  of the sequential  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124502].  
 
Similarly,  if there are partially observed triplets or pairs of patients at the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862008] a 
selection decision prior to truncation,  we will allow the  patients to complete their follow -up in 
order to observe their outcomes.  As for incomplete  triplets at time of  first elimination,  data from  
such overrun triplets or pairs will be used to weigh the evidence concerning  success 
probabilities,  but they will not be used to alter the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862005], 
in order to preserve the validity of the sequential  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124502].

In bullet 3, the fo llowing addit ional details were added regarding adverse events (AEs) that 
meet criteria for discont inuat ion as def ined in the Toxicit y Management Guidelines 
(Appendix E)
Perm anent discont inuat ion of study  drug/study  regimen shoul d occur for any  
Grade ≥3 immune -mediated AE, that does not downgrade to Grade ≤1 or baseline 
status (for patients who entered the s tudy with an exist ing laboratory  abnorm ality) 
within 14 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_285931] (ie, use of steroi ds or poten t 
immunosuppressive medicat ion).  Certain except ions are enumerated below for 
specific immune -mediated AEs:
 Pneumo nitis / interstitial lung disease (ILD) –For any Grade >3 event 
prom ptly discont inue study  drug/study  regimen .
 Diarrhea/Enterocolit is -For any  Grade >3 event prompt ly discontinue 
study  drug/study  regimen.
 Nephrit is (Serum Creatinine > 3.0 X baseline; >3.[ADDRESS_348807]) -For 
any Grade >3 event prompt ly discont inue study  drug/study  regimen.
 Hypothy roidism  –Isolated hy pothy roidism may  be treated wi th 
replacement therapy  without treatm ent interrupti on.
 Other toxicit ies m ay have slight ly different time to resolution for any 
Grade >3 event (i e skin rash, peripheral neuropathy), please refer to

In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual eve nt basis should 
be applied to clarify th at the malignanttumor event should be as sessed and reported as 
a non-serious AE. F or example, if t he tum or is inc luded as medical history  and
progres sion occurs during the study , but the progressio ndoes not change treatment 
and/or prognosis of the m alignant tum or, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being 
assessed a s serious, al though reporti ng of the progress ion of the malignant tum oras an 
AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of  malignant tumo rs, w hich do not 
spread rem otely after a rout ine tre atmentthat does not require hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689],may be 
assess ed as non-s erious;examples inclu de Stage 1 basa l cell carcino ma and Stage 1A1

Malignant tum ors that –as par t of normal, if rare, progr ession –unde rgo

1.1 Backgrou nd and ra tionale for conducting this stu dy
See tum or sp ecific modules (APPENDIX F)for tumorspeci fic back ground and rat ionales.
1.1.1 Immunotherap ies
It is increasingly understood that can cers are reco gnized by [CONTACT_27639] , and, under 
some ci rcums tances , the immune sy stem  may control oreven eliminate tumors ( Dunn et al 
2004 ).  
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that 
areinvolved incontrolling T -cell act ivation. The PD -1 recepto r (CD279) is expressed on the 
surface of activated T-cells (Keir et al 2008).  It has 2 k nown ligands: PD -L1 (B7 H1; 
CD274 )and PD- L2 (B7 D C; CD273) (Okazaki and Ho njo 2007). The PD-1 and PD-L1/PD 
L2 belo ng to the fa mily of immune ch eckpointproteins that ac t as c o inhibi tory factors, which 
canhalt or limit the development of T -cellresponse.  W hen PD-L1 binds t o PD -1, an 
inhibi tory signal is tra nsmitt ed into the T c ell, which reduces cytokine production and 
suppress es T cell prolife ration. Tumorcells expl oit th is immun e checkpo int pathway  asa 
mechanism to evade detection and inhi bit immune re spon se.
PD-L1 is const itutive ly expressed by  B cells , dend ritic cells, an d macrophages (Qin et al 
2016 ). Importantl y, PD -L1is commo nly o verexpre ssed on tumo r cells or on non-transform ed
cells in the tumormicroe nvironme nt (Pardoll 2 012).  PD -L1 ex pressed on thetumorcells 
binds to PD -[ADDRESS_348860] ivated T -cells remain inhibit ed in the tumormicroenvironme nt.  The PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway  represe nts anadapt ive immun e res istance me chan ism that is exerted by  [CONTACT_285986]-tumoractivity.  
The inhibitor y mechanism describe d above is co -opted by  [CONTACT_178530] -L1 asa way 
of evading immune detecti on and eliminat ion. T he binding o f an ant i-PD-L1 agent to the 
PDL1 receptor in hibits the interac tion of PD-L1withthe PD-1 and CD80 r eceptors
expresse d on immune cells(ICs) .This activit y overcom es PD -L1-mediated in hibitionof
antitumor immuni ty. While funct ional bl ockade of PD -L1 resul ts in T-cell reactivation, this 
mechanism o f action(MO A) is differe nt from direct ag onism ofa stimulatory receptor such as 
CD2 8.
PD-L1is expressed in a broad range of cancers .Based on thesefindings, an ant i-PD-L1 
antibody  coul d be used therapeut ically to enhance antitumor immune responses in patients
withcancer. Results ofnon-clinical andclinical stud iesof monoclonal ant ibodies (mAbs) 
targeting the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_348861] ivity and a manageable 
safety profile, suppor ting the hypothesisthat an anti -PD-L1 ant ibody  could beused to 
therapeutically enha nce ant itumor immune r esponse i n cancer pat ients (Brahmer et al 2012 ; 
Hirano etal 2005 ; Iwai et al 2002 ; Okudaira et al 2009 ; Topalian et al 2012 ; Zhang et al 2008 ) 
with resp onses that tend to be m ore pronounced in pa tients w ith tumors that expressPD-L1

eg,inbladder c arcino ma (Alexandrov et al 2013 ) may contribute to the responses se en with 
immun e therapy.
In con trast, cy totoxic T-lymphocy te-assoc iated antigen -4 (CTLA -4) is constitutively 
expressed by  [CONTACT_285987] T-cells and upr egulated on a ctivated T -cells.  CTLA -4deliver s a
negat ive regulato rysigna l to T -cells upon binding of CD80( B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) ligands on

antitumor activity in pat ients with solid tum ors.
Pre-clinic al data has now been addedto witha wealth of clinical da ta showi ng that blockade 
of negativeregul atory  signals to T-cells such a s CTLA -4 and PD-L1 has promising clinical 
activit y.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_285939] (US) F ood and Drug Administra tion (FDA)

56(143)1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and cont rolgrou ps
This study  is designed to further evaluate the s afety and overall survival (OS) of durva lumab + 
tremelimumab combinat ion therapy  or durval umab m onotherapy  using fixed dosing in 
advanced so lid tumor patients. 
This study  is designed to complement and exp and the safet ydatabases fro m the ongoing 
Phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_285940] –D419AC0000 1 (MYSTIC), D419AC000 03 
(NEPTU NE), D419LC0 0001 (KESTREL), D4193C00002 (EAGLE) and D419BC00001 
(DANUBE), and potenti ally the durvalumab monotherapy  studi es –D4191C00 001 (PACIFIC) 
andStudy  D419 0C00001 (Study  1108) .  As most of these studies were i nitiated using weight -
based do sing (mg/kg), expandi ng data on the safety  profile of the fixed -dose combination is 
warranted, particularly wit h rare events.  
The stud ywill assess short an dlong-term safety including evaluat ion of  nature of toxi cities 
(adverse even ts [AEs], serious adv erse even ts [SAEs ], immune -media ted adverse events 
[imAE s]), interventions / treatment, and outcomes of treatment of these.
The study  will also yield in depth understanding ofrare events, or new imAEs that may occur 
through l ong-term administration o f study drug.
1.2.1 Dose and tr eatment regimen justification
In the original studies with durvalumab, the schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W has been tested .This 
was then amend ed to 20 mg/kg Q4W, which represents the same dose with a different 
schedule. As for trem elimumab , doses t ested includ ed 1 mg/kg Q4W, 3 mg/kg Q4W and 
10mg/kg Q4W. The selection o f a combinat ion dose and schedule for the combination of
durvalumab and tre melimumab for taking forward into the wider program  consisted of 
optimizing d urvalumab at a dose t hatwouldallow for m aximum  target suppressi on, optimize 
synergy ,and balance safety  following combinat ion with tremelimumab. 
Based on PK/pharm acodynamic (mo notherapy  and combination) and prelim inary  efficacy  
data from  the co mbinat ionin Study D4190C00006 1, durval umab doses o f 3 and 10 mg/kg 
Q4W co mbinat ion cohorts were excluded f rom further development.  The 10 mg/kg Q2W and 
20mg/kg Q4W regimen s are expected to have simil ar AUC at steady  state based on PK 
simulat ions. Cohorts were t herefore narrowed to 15mg/kg Q4W and 20 mg/kg Q4W of 
durvalumab. Monotonic increases in pharmacodynamic act ivity with the combinat ion 
(increased act ivation/proliferation markers on CD4 and CD 8 T-cells in periphery) were 
observed wit h increasing doses of tremelimumab (1, 3, 1 0 mg/kg) in co mpar ison to 
durvalumab monotherapy . Safet y data fro m the 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab Q4W cohorts 
demonstrated num erical  increases in the frequen cy of treatmen t-related AEs and AEs l eading 
to discont inuat ion of in vestigational product wi th increasing d oses (>1 mg/kg) of  
tremelimumab. In addit ion, clinical act ivity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab 
combinat ion did not appear to provi de qualit ative changes of de eper or m ore rapi d resp onses 
with increasing doses of tremelimu mab. As a result, th e selected dose and s chedule o f the 
combinat ion based on dat a from Study D4190C00006 was 20 mg/kg durvalumab and 1 mg/kg 
tremelimumab Q4Wfor 4 doses, fo llowed by 20 mg/kg durvalumab mo notherapy  Q4W .

57(143)1.2.2 Rationale for fixed dosing
A popula tion PK m odel was dev eloped fo r durval umab using m onotherapy  data from  a Phase 
I study  (study  1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 m g/kg Q3 W; solid tumors).
Popul ation PK analysis ind icated only  minor impac t of body  weight (WT) on the PK of 
durva lumab (coefficient of ≤0.5). The impact of body WT -based (10 mg/kg Q2W ) and fixed 
dosing (750 mg Q2W ) of durvalumab was evaluated by  [CONTACT_285989] (5th, median and 95thpercentil es) using the populat ion PK mod el. A fixed dose 
of 750 m g wa s selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body  WT of ~75 kg). A 
total of 1000 pati ents were simulated using body  WT distribut ionof 40–120 kg. Simulation 
resul ts dem onstrate that body WT-based and fixed dosing regi mens yiel d similar m edian 
steady state PK concentrations wit h slight ly less overall between -patient variabilit y with fixed 
dosing regimen.  
Similarly, a populat ion PK m odel was devel oped for tremelimum ab using data from Phas e 1 
through Phase 3 (N=654; dos es= 0.01 to 15 m g/kg Q4W or Q9 0D; metastatic melano ma) 
(Wang et al 2014 ). Population PK model indicated minor impact of body W T on PK of 
tremelimumab (coeffici entof ≤0.5). The WT -based (1 m g/kg Q4W ) and fixed do sing 
(75mg/kg Q4W ; based on m edian body  WT of ~75 kg) regimens were compared using 
predi cted PK concentrations (5th, median and 95thpercent iles) using population PK model in a 
simulated populat ion of 1000 pa tients wi th body weight distribut ion of 40 to 120 kg. S imilar 
to durvalumab, simulat ions indicated that both body  WT-based and fixed dosing regimens of 
tremelimumab yield similar median steady  state PK concentrati ons wi th slight ly less 
between patientvariability with fixed dosing regimen.
Similar fin dings hav e been reported by  [CONTACT_2312] ( Ng et al  2006 ; Wang et al 2009 ; Zhang et al  
2012; Narwal  et al  2013 ). Wang and co lleagues investigated 12 mAbs and found that fixed 
and body  size-based dosing perform similarly, wit h fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 
antibodies ( Wang et al 2009 ). In addit ion, they investigated 18 therapeut ic proteins and 
pepti des and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the 
between -patientvariabilit y in pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamics parame ters ( Zhang et al 
2012). 
A fixed d osing approach is preferred by  [CONTACT_72959] y because of the ease of use 
and reduced dosing errors. Given expectation o f similar pharmacokinet ic exposure and 
variabili ty, we considere d it feasible to swi tch to fixe d dosing regimens. Based on a verage 
body  WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) 
and a fixed dose of 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is included in 
the current stud y.

58(143)1.3.1 Potential benefits
There remains a significant unmet medical need for addit ional treatment options for advanced 
solid tumors, including bladder, lung, and head and neck. 
Treatment with agents targeting PD-1/PD -L1 (such as durvalumab) or CTLA -4 (such as 
tremelimumab) has shown ac tivity in several tumor ty pes in a subset of patients deriving 
meaningful and durable benefit.  Efficacy data for patients treated with durvalumab 
monotherapy  in the bladder cance r, lung cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcino ma 
(HNSCC) cohorts have shown some clinical act ivity.  Preliminary  data generated from  
patients wi th NSCLC treated with durvalumab + tremelimumab co mbination therapy have 
shown early signs of clinical activity, and da ta from com petitors indicate th at the co mbinat ion 
may act syn ergist ically ( Wolchoket al 201 3).  Thus, these agents may  potenti ally offer benefit 
to this patient population.  The study  design aims t o minimize poten tial risks and intensive 
monitoring, inc luding early safet y assessment, i s in place for those risks deemed to be most 
likely  based on pri or experi ence wi th the invest igatio nal products (IPs; including durvalumab 
and tremelimumab).
See tum orspecific module s (APPENDIX F) for descript ion of potential benefits.
1.3.[ADDRESS_348867] immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell 
death ligand 1 (PD -L1) as well as those directed agains t programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) or 
cytotoxic T-lymphocy te an tigen-4 (CTLA -4), aim to boost endogenous immune responses 
directed against tumor cells. By [CONTACT_38225], there is the 
potenti al for adverse effects on o ther tissues.
Most adverse drug reactions seen with the immune chec kpoint inh ibitor cl ass of agents are 
thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory  cells on specific t issues. These risks are

1.3.3 Overall benefit risk
The toxi city profile of the combinat ion of dur valumab and tremelimumab included fat igue,

increases, amylase and lip ase increases, rash and pruritus, and other immune -mediated 
reacti ons, which were m ostly  reversible a nd manageable by  [CONTACT_285990].  Increased toxicit ies have been seen when these agents are used in combinat ion. 
In parti cular,based on the specific MOA of durvalum ab and trem elimumab l eading to T -cell 
activat ion and prolifer ation, there is the possibilit y of observing imA Es during the c onduct of 
this study .  Potenti al imAEs m ay be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43844], BMS -

hepat itis, and endocrinopathies ( Brahmer et al 2012 , Hodi et al 2010 , Topalian et al 2012).  
Patients shoul d be m onitored f or signs and sympt oms of imAEs.  In the absence of an 
alternate et iology (eg,infection or PD), an immune -related etio logy shoul d be considered for 
signs or symptom s of ente rocolitis, dermatit is, hepatit is, and endocrinopathy.  It is

2.1 Primary objective
1. To assess the incidence, severit y,nature, seriousne ss, intervention/treatment, 
outcom e, and causali ty, including immune -relatedness, of adverse event sof special 
interest (AESIs ) inpatie ntswho are treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab 
combinat ion therapy  or durval umab m onotherapy, u sing fixed dosing. 
An AESI is one of scientific and medical interest s pecific to understanding of the 
Invest igational Product. AESIs for durvalu mab and tremelimumab incl ude but are not limited 
to events wi th a potenti al inflammatory  or immune -mediated m echanism and which may 
requi re more frequent m onitoring and/or intervent ions su ch as steroids, immunosuppressants 
and/or horm one rep lacement therap y.An imAEis defined as an AESI that is associated with 
drug exposure and is consistent with an im mune -medi ated MOA and where there is no cl ear 
alternate etiology.
AESIs observed with durvalumab or tremelimumab inclu de pneumon itis, hepatitis,
diarrhea /colitis,intestinal perforation , endocr inopathi es (hypo-and hyp er-thyroidism ,adrenal  
insufficiency, hypophysit is/hypopi [INVESTIGATOR_285942] I di abetes m ellitus), nephri tis,
rash/dermat itis,myocarditis, myositis/ polymy ositis, pancreat itis, and rare/less freq uent imAEs
includingneurom uscular toxi cities su chmyasthenia gravis andGuillain -Barré syndrome.
Other inflamm atory  responses that are rare/lessfrequent witha potential immune -mediated 
etiologyinclude, but ar e not limited to pericardit is, sarcoi dosis , uveit isand other events 
involving the ey e, skin, hematol ogical  and rhe umatol ogical events, vasculit is, non -infecti ous 
meningit is and non-in fectious encephali tis.It is possible that events with an inflammatory  or 
immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly  all organs . In addit ion, infusio n-related 
reacti ons and hypersensit ivity/anaphylact ic react ions wit h a different underl ying

3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to with draw from  the study  at any time (IP and assessments), wi thout 
prejudice to furthe r treatm ent. It shou ld be confirmed and documented in source notes if the 
patient is wi thdraw ing consent to the study  treatm ent or to all study  procedures, i ncluding 
survival follow up . Efforts shoul d be made to follow patients unt ilthe end of study , but 
particularly to con duct the 90-daysafety follow up .
Patients who wi thdraw consent for furth er parti cipati on in the study  will not receive any  
further durvalumab + tremelimu mab or further study  observat ion, wi th the except ion of 
followupfor survival, w hich will cont inue un til the final DCO unless the pati ent has 
expressly  withdrawn thei r consen t to survival follow up .  Note that the patient may be offered 
additional tests or tapering of treatm ent to wi thdraw safely .
A pat ientwho withdraws consen t will always be aske d about the reason(s) for withdrawal and 
the presence o f any AE. The Invest igator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study.  If 
possibl e, they  will be seen and assess ed by [CONTACT_39595](s). AEs will befollowed up (See 
Section 6). The Study  Physician shoul d be notified of any  ongoing AE that may delay 
treatm ent or necessitate permanent disc ontinuat ion of treatment.
Provi ding consent allows, survival status will be followed up by [CONTACT_285997]  3months up until the fin al DCO (seeSection4.3).
If a patient withdraws consent, they  will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent 
to:
 All further participation in the study  including any further fo llow up ( eg,
survival contact [CONTACT_285998])
 Withdrawal to the use of any  sam ples (see Sect ion5.7.4 )
[IP_ADDRESS] Survival status for withdrawn consent and lost to follo w up patie nts
Patients will  be considered lost to follow up only if no contact [CONTACT_285999] (see Section 9.3), such that there is insufficient information to 
determine the pati ent’s status at that ti me.  Patients who refuse to continue participation in the
study , including tel ephone contact, should be documented as “wit hdrawal o f consent” rather

missing pati ents throughout the study  period.  If contact [CONTACT_29881] a missing pat ient is 
re-established, the patient should not be consi dered l ost to follow up and evaluat ions should 
resum e according to the protocol.
In order to support key  end point ofOS analysis, all en rolled pat ients’ survival status should 
be re -checked, this includes those pati ents who wi thdrew con sent or are classified as “lost to 
follow up ”.

2. In the event tha t the pati ent has actively wit hdrawn consent to the processing o f 
their personal  data, the survival status of the patient can be obtain ed by  [CONTACT_286000] (if available ) where it is possible 
todo so under applicab le local laws to obtain a current survival status .

The study  may be stopped if, in the judgement of [COMPANY_008], study  patients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings thatmeet any  of the f ollowing cri teria:

Reasons for the early closure of a study  site by [CONTACT_286001]:
Failure of the Invest igator to comply wit h the protocol, the requir ements of the IRB/IEC

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Princi pal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the st udy is 
familiar wit hthe content of this section.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An AE is the de velopment o f anundesirable medical  condi tion (other than progression of the 
maligna ncy under e valuat ion) or the deterioration of a pre -exist ing medical condit ion
following or during exposure to a pharma ceutical product, whether or not considered causally 
related to theproduct.An undesirable medical condit ion can be symptoms ( eg,nause a, chest 
pain), si gns ( eg,tachy cardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal result s of an investigatio n (eg,
laborato ry findings, ECG ).In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesira blemedical 
condi tion occurring at any  time, incl uding run -in or washout periods, ev en if no study  
treatm ent has been administered.
The term  AE is used to include both ser ious and non -serious AEs.
6.2 Defini tions of serious adverse event
A SAE is an AE occurri ng during any study  phase ( ie,run-in, treatment, washout, and follow 
up), that fulf ills one or m ore of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is imm ediately life -threatening
 Requi res in-patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_285951]
 Resultsin persistent or si gnificant di sabili ty/incapaci ty or substantia l 
disrupt ionof the abilit y to conduct normal life functions
 Is a congenital a bnorm ality or bi rth defect
 Is an im portan t medical e vent that may jeopardiz e the pati ent or m ay 
requi re medical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

96(143) AEs for new maligna nt tumors (ie, not the tum or for whi ch entry  into the 
study  is a cr iterion and that is b eing treated b y the IP under stu dy and is 
not the development of new or pr ogressi on of existing metastasis to the 
tumor under study )reported during a study  shoul d gene rally be assessed 
as SAEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Im portant Medi cal 
Event’ cri terion should be use d.
In certain situat ions, however, medical j udgement onan individual event 
basis should be applied to clarify that the malig nant tumo r event should 
be assessed and reported as a non-serious AE. For exam ple, if the tum or 
is included as me dical  history  and progressi on occurs during the study , 
but the progres sion doe s notchange treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumo r, the AE may n ot fulfill the attributes for being assessed 
as serious, although r eporti ng of the progr ession o f the malignant tum or 
asan AE is valid and should occur. Also, so me types o f malignant 
tumors, whi ch do not spread remotely after a routine treatmen t that does
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], may be assessed as non-serious; examp les 
include Stage 1 b asal ce ll carc inoma and Stage 1A 1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy.
Malignant tumorsthat –as part of normal, if rare, progression –undergo 
transfor mation (e g, Richter's transformat ion of B cell chronic 
lymphocy tic leukemia into diffuse large B cell lympho ma)shoul d not be 
considered a new malignant tumo r.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Addit ional Safety  Inform ation in
APPENDIX A.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Adverse even ts andSAEs will be collected from t ime of the pati ent signingthe ICFuntilthe

98(143)The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE versio n 4.03 will  be utilized for all 
events wi th an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCA E grade s, 
the recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that conv erts mild, m oderate , and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy  of the CTCAE versi on4.03 can be downl oaded 
from the Cancer Therapy  Evaluat ion Program websi te (http:/ /ctep.can cer.gov).
It is important to dist inguish between serious and sev ere AEs. Severit y isa measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_286013] 6.2and the Addit ional 
Safety Infor mation inAPPENDIX A.An AE of severe intensit y need not necessarily  be 
considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for se veral hours m ay be considered 
severe n ausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the c riteria s hown in Section 6.2and 
APPENDIX A.On the other hand, a stroke that resul ts in only a limited degree of disabilit y 
may be considered a mild stroke but would b e a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria shown in 
Secti on6.2and APPENDIX A.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess c ausal relat ionship between durvalumab (mon otherapy  Modules),
or between durvalumab an d trem elimumab (combinat ion therapy  Modul es) and each AE, and 
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consid er that there is a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_38219]?’ (monot herapy Mo dules) or and ‘D o you 
consider tha t there i s a reasonable possibilit y that the even t may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_286014]?’ (combinat ion therapy  Modul es)?’
For SAEs ,causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion, stu dy proced uresand
alterna tive etio logies. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure 
the causal relat ionship is imp lied as ‘yes’.
A gu ide to the interpretati on of  the causalit y quest ion is found in APPENDIX A.
6.3.5 Relationsh ip to protocol procedures
The Investigator is also required to provi de an assessment of the relat ionship of SAEs to 
protocol  procedures on the SAE report form.  T his includes both n on-treatm ent-emergent ( ie,
SAEs that occur prior to theadministration of I P) and treatment -emergent SAEs.  A protocol -
related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or int ervention requ ired during the study  (eg,
blood collection).  The fo llowing guideli nes should be used by [CONTACT_286015] t he protocol:
 Protocol -related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervent ion 
that was descr ibed in the pr otocol for whic h there is no alternative 
etiology present in the pat ient’s medical record.
 Not protocol -relate d: The ev ent is related to an eti ology  other than the 
procedure or intervent ion that was des cribed in the protocol.  The 
alternat iveetiology mustbe do cumented in the study patient’s medical 
record.

durvalumab monotherapy  and combinat ion therapy . An immune -mediated adverse event
(imAE) is defined as an AESI th at is associat ed w ith drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune -mediated MOA andwher e there i sno clear alternate etio logy. Serologic, 
immuno logic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to suppo rt an imAE
diagnosi s. Appropria te efforts sho uld be made to rul e out neopl astic, infecti ous, m etabo lic, 
toxin, or other e tiologic causes of the imAE. 
In Japan , in the event of imAE or suspected imAE, the [COMPANY_008] study  team  may request 
relevant clinic al information (inc luding images ) for those p atients who dem onstrate the event, 
and may  request the independent rev iew by [CONTACT_286018].
If the Investigato r has any quest ions in regards to an event being an imA E, the Inv estigator
shoul d prom ptlycontact t he St udy Physician.

6.8 Medic ation Err or
Forthe purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mi stake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study drug that either c auses harm to the patient or 
has the potenti al to cause harm  to the pati ent. 
A medicat ion erroris not lack o f efficacy  of the drug, but rather a h uman or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or pati ent.
Medicat ion error incl udes s ituations where an error. 
 occurred
 was i dentified and intercepte d before the patient received the drug
 did not occur, but circumsta nces were recognize dthat coul d hav e led to 
an error
Examples of events to be report edin clinical s tudies as medication erro rs:

Examples of events that do not require re porting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS /IWRS -including those which 
lead to one of the above listed eve nts that would othe rwise have been a 
medication error 
 Patient acci dentally  missed drug do se(s), eg,forgot to take medication
 Accidental  overdose (will be c aptured as an overdose)
 Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packagi ng
 Errors relate d to background and rescu e medicat ion, or standard -of-care 
medicat ion in open -label studie s, even if an A Z prod uct
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs ,but AEs may occur as a consequenc e of the 
medicat ion error.

RECIST 1.1 (or other tumor assessment method) -defined PD during the 
durvalumab monot herapy portion of the combinat ion regimen, with o r 
without con firmation according to RECIST 1.1, may  restart treatm ent 
with the combinat ion.
For all patients who are treated through progression and for patients who are restarting 
durval umab + trem elimumab ,the Invest igator should ensure that:
 The patien t does not ha ve any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible 
toxicities that indicate continuing treatment will not further benefit the 
patient
 There i s absence of clin ical symptom s or s igns indicating clin ically  
significant disease progression accompani ed by a decli ne in WHO/ECOG

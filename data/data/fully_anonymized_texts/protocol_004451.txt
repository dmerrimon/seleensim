Ranging Study Using a High -Volume, Low -Dose Protocol  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Dolak  
 Abstract:  
The purpose of the proposed study is aimed to determine  whether continuous subfascial 
infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399626] -Q
® elastomeric  pump in combination with 
intrathe cal (IT) preservative- free morphine  (PFM)  will improve post -operative cesarean 
section pain relative to IT  PFM alone (the current standard of care).  Using a double -
blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled study design, [ADDRESS_503655] cesarean section will be rand omly assigned to one of 3 different groups 
receiving either saline  (control, n= 20) or ropi[INVESTIGATOR_110762] (0.1% or 0.2%, experimental groups 
n=20 in each) subfascially via the elastomeric pump . We will enroll up to 70 subjects to 
achieve 60 randomized and treated subjects, to account for screen failures and/or early 
terminations,   All partic ipants will receive an IT  dose of 200mcg of PFM as part of a 
standardized spi[INVESTIGATOR_399627].  During closure of their abdomen, all patient s will undergo placement of a multi- orifice, silver -impregnated 
catheter in the subfascial space.  At the conclusion of the surgery, the catheter will be bolused with 8ml of one of the three test solutions, after which an On -Q
® elastomeric 
pump (containing the same solution as initially administered through the catheter) will be 
attached to infuse the test solution at a rate of 8ml/hr.  The infusion system will then be 
left in place for up to 72hr .  Adjunctive pain medicines (ketorolac, morphine, ibuprofen, 
and oxycodone -acetaminophen) will be available for the treatment of breakthrough pain 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The primary outcome  being measured in the study is  post -
operative pain with movement as assessed immediately after the study bolus (baseline) 
and during the immediate post- operative period , when leaving the PACU (2hr), 6hr, 12hr, 
24hr, 48hr, and 72hr post -op.  Pain will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_1381] 4 -6 weeks and 
3mo after surgery .  A visual acuity pain scale ( VAPS ) will be used to measure patie nt 
pain levels  while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399628] 4 -6 week visit and 3mo will be 
quantitated using a numeric pain scale (NPS) .  Secondary outcome s to be studied include 
degree of pain at rest, time to first rescue medication, time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], amount of

anesthetic side effects, catheter related issues, breast feeding s uccess, maternal 
satisfaction, evaluation of wound healing, categorization and quantification of outpatient 
pain medication, and cost analysis.  
 
Introduction and Background:  
The primary hypothesis of this study is t hat post -cesarean  section pain with movement  
will be significantly improved in women treated with IT  PFM  by [CONTACT_399679][INVESTIGATOR_10319] .  There are approximately 4 
million deliveries in the [LOCATION_002] every year; with  about 30% of these delive ries 
being  cesarean section s.  This makes cesarean section  one of the most common surgeries 
performed today.  Women experience significant post -operative pain after cesarean 
sections.   Cesarean section patients are unique among surgical patients in that th ey have 
to immediately care for their newborns  after their procedure, and the ir infant s may be 
affected by [CONTACT_399680] -admini stered  maternal pain medications if breastfeeding.  
Therefore, this population requires  the combination of maximal pain relief with minimal 
sedation , while minimiz ing the exposure of infants to clinically -significant amounts of 
drugs in breast milk. This encourages further studies that will elucidate better means of 
accomplishing ideal post -operative pain.  
 Pain, both intraoperative and postoperative, has been shown to be the anesthetic outcome 
of greatest concern to women undergoing cesarean section with the potential side effects of pain relief being of much less concern (1).  This was found to be true both in terms of 
absolute ranking and when using a relative value score.   Pain as part of the childbirth 
experience may predispose the parturient to the development of post -traumatic stress 
disorder (2).  It has also been suggested that pain after cesarean section decreases the 
effec tiveness of breast feeding leading to more formula and pacifier use  (3, 4).  In 
addition to the obvious psychological aversion to pain by [CONTACT_1962], it is well -known that 
pain can stimulate a variety of potentially detrimental physiological effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, respi[INVESTIGATOR_399630], and inactivity, which in turn can lead to 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, [ADDRESS_503656] -surgical pain  (CPSP) (5 , 6).  CPSP is defined as pain of at 
least 2mo duration which devel ops after a surgical procedure, and which is not related to 
any other causes of pain (infection, malignancy, etc.) or to pain continuing from a pre -
existing pain problem (7).   The incidence of CPSP after cesarean section is believ ed to be 
between 10 -12% (5 , 6), meaning that as many as 168,000 women might be affected w ith 
this each year.   Even more troubling is that an estimated  4% of the women undergoing 
cesarean section  (~48,000) actually develop disabling chronic pain defined as pai n > 5 on 
a scale from 0 to 10 (6).   Recognition of the above psychological and physica l attributes 
of pain led to the Joint Commission recommendation to treat pain as the fifth vial sign, 
with the stated goal for US healthcare facilities to uniformly achieve pain scores ≤ 3 out 
of 10 (8). 
 
Pain after cesarean section has two well -recognized  components – somatic and visceral .  
Somatic pain is often described as a well -localized, sharp, burning, or tearing pain. In 
contrast visceral pain is described as a poorly -localized, dull or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_284933].  Somatic 
pain has both cutaneous and deep components which are transmitted via the anterior 
components of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315], wher eas visceral pain  is a sympathetically -mediated 
pain whose sensation returns via afferents from the uterus to the inferior hypogast ric 
plexus, and hence into the sympath etic chain, ultimately arriving at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (8).   
It is a well- accepted theory that multimodal pain relief helps to alleviate pain by [CONTACT_399681] (somatic vs visceral) and at different pain receptors 
leading to either ad ditive or synergistic analgesia , while minimizing the side -effect 
profile of any single drug component of the analgesic cocktail (9 ).  For instance, either 
systemic or neuraxial opi[INVESTIGATOR_399631]-operative pain .  Unfortunately , opi[INVESTIGATOR_399632] -effects including pruritus, constipation, urinary 
retention, nausea/vomiting, sedation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] ( 10). In an effort to 
mitigate these troublesome issues,  NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce the 
inflammation  associated with surgical injury,  thereby [CONTACT_399682]00073292  Version February 6, [ADDRESS_503657]  (8, 10).   Additionally, 
NSAIDs are particularly effective against the visceral cr ampi[INVESTIGATOR_399633] (8).   
 
While the combination of neuraxial opi[INVESTIGATOR_399634] 24hr, a significant number  of 
women experi ence pain greater than 3/[ADDRESS_503658] and movement pain at time periods greater than 24hr.  These pain 
exacerbations  primarily involve discomfort resulting from tension on the wound, often 
require treatment with IV or PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , and appear to be due largely to cutaneous or 
deep somatic pain .  As incisional pain can often be acutely managed with local anesthetic 
(LA)  infiltration, interest grew in seeing if continuous local infiltration of LA  alone, 
NSAIDs alone, or combinations  of NSAIDs with LAs  through a catheter inserted into the 
surgical wound could reduce both post -surgical pain and post operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023].  Initial results using subcutaneous catheters were di sappointing , showing at 
most modest reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], with little or no change in pain scores  (11) .  For 
example, in one study comparing the subcutaneous infusi on of 4ml /hr of 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] a saline infusion control showed no difference in VAS for pain at rest, but showed a 22 mg reduction  in morphine use over 24hr (12).  However, a meta -analysis 
of a number of trials involving subsets of surgical patients showed both reductions in pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_399635]/gynecologic surgery population , although 
only pain at rest was examined ( 11).  Multiple studies involving cesarean section patient s 
have shown that subfascial infusions of plain 0.2% ropi [INVESTIGATOR_10319] (13) , 0.25% 
levobupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (14), 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399636]  (15), or 0.2 % ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399637] (16)  all provide good post operative analgesia and a reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_399638] -operative pain.  In one of these studies (16), wound infusion of identical 
solutions through either subfascial catheters or subcutaneous catheters was compared, 
and subfascial administration  was shown to be clearly superior based on pain at rest and 
total po stoperative mor phine consumption.  Additionally, i n two of the above studies , 
continuous wound infusion was found to provide postoperative analgesia nearly 
equivalent (14) or better (13) than epi[INVESTIGATOR_399639], 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, [ADDRESS_503659] to these positive studies, one negative study found that 
subfascial wound infusion with 5ml/hr of 0.375% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399640] (17).  Therefore, while there are 
both theoretical and evidential g rounds to support the use of subfascial wound catheters, 
their absolute efficacy as sole agents for pain relief remains to be established.  
 To date, long- acting neuraxial opi[INVESTIGATOR_399641] -
cesarean delivery analgesia w hether given via the IT  or epi[INVESTIGATOR_399642], providing excel -
lent pain relief for the first 24hr while allowing the mother to ambulate and care for her 
child  (18, 19).  However, it is clear that neuraxial opi[INVESTIGATOR_399643], with more than 70% of patients requesting further analgesia (19).  Even when codeine with acetaminophen is 
given prn , 33% of women in one study still experienced inadequate analgesia (18).  Pain 
with movement appears to be the most poorly treated pain phenomenon using neuraxial PFM (19).  Again , this points to the importance of multimodal pain control  in obstetric 
patients . Sur prisingly, while continuous wound infiltration has been examined as a 
primary technique for post -cesarean pain relief (13,14,15,16) and has even been 
compared for efficacy to epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] (13,14) and IT (17) post -cesarean analgesia, no one has 
tested to see if continuous wound infiltration with LAs improves the analgesia obtained 
from IT PFM.  However,  it is standard practice of some  obstetricians  in our institution to 
use the continuous wound infiltration system on every patient undergoing a cesarean  
section  whether they have IT PFM or not . The purpose of the proposed study  is to 
examine the hypothesis  that continuous wound infusion with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72167] a high -
volume, low -dose protocol will significantly improve pain with movement after cesarean 
section  in patients who have received our standard dose of IT PFM .  A control group (IT  
PFM + saline wound infusion) will be compared to two g roups receiving both IT  PFM 
along with one of two doses of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ( experiment al groups) using the OnQ
® 
elastomeric pump for delivery of the infusions .  We  have purposefully used lower 
concentrations of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_275728] (0.1-0.2% ) along with higher volumes in recognition that 
the nerves to be anesthetized are of smaller diameter, and therefore require lower 
concentrations of LA  for this effect; while ensuring a high enough volume to completely 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, 2019  
Page 7 of 16 
 bathe the wound at the subfas cial layer.  During both cesarean section under local 
anesthesia (20) , and with transversus abdomini s plane blocks for post -operative analgesia 
(21) -  situations which involve  some of the same sensory nerves blocked by [CONTACT_399683] -  the importance of volume versus concentration of LA s has been 
stressed.   It is expected that r opi[INVESTIGATOR_110762], used in conjunction with IT  PFM , will provide 
additive or synergistic pain r elief as compared to IT  PFM alone, and hopefully this will 
lead to better breast feeding, decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_399644] -effects , fewer 
prolonged stays secondary to pain issues, increased patient satisfaction, and ultimately to 
decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680].  
 
Objectives:  
The primary outcome measured in thi s study is post -operative pain with movement 
measured both during cough and 20° straight leg raise.  Pain at rest will also be 
evaluated.  All  types of pain will be measured usi ng a visual analogue pain scale (VAPS) 
determined using a 100mm line with the patient making a mark on the line between no pain and worst pain ever  (12).  Pain scores will be collected after the bolus of study 
medication/placebo  (zero time), at PACU discharge (2hr), 6hr, 12hr, 24hr, 48hr, and 72hr 
post-cesarean section .  Pain at 4- 6 weeks and 3mo will be quantitated over the telephone 
using a numerical pain scale (NPS) with [ADDRESS_503660] pain imaginable.  In addition to the pain scor es, pain with movement will be further evaluated 
qualitatively using the short- form McGill pain questionnaire  (22) at all time -points in the 
study .  This will allow us to look at pain quality (sharp, burning, etc.), as well as 
examining the affective components (exhausting, fearful, etc.)  of the pain . 
 
There are several secondary outcomes of this study that c an be divided into  rescue 
medication  information, medication side  effects, breastfeeding, wound evaluation, patient 
satisfaction, and cost -analysis . 
 Rescue medication data will be collected during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521] (0- 72hr).  We 
will note the time  to dosing with the fi rst rescue medication for breakthrough pain. A fter 
the first rescue medication  is given, the patients will be eligible for further doses of IV or 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, 2019  
Page 8 of 16 
 PO pain medicines for continued breakthrough pain as neede d (see Study Design and 
Methods  section below for specifics). The time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_399645] .  Additionally, we will quantitate  
narcotic use in terms of morphine equivalents given ( in mg)  both by [CONTACT_447] -operative day 
and with a cumulative total.  The total dose of NSAIDs ( in mg ) will be recorded for each 
of the firs t three postoperative days , along with a cumulative total.   We will also be 
measuring the proportion of patients who requi re opi[INVESTIGATOR_399646] 0, 2, 6, 12, 
24, 48, and [ADDRESS_503661] -op.  We will also ask if patients are still requirin g opi[INVESTIGATOR_50953]/or NSAIDs for surgical discomfort along with inquiring about the amount of each 
used per day at the  4-[ADDRESS_503662] data on the incidence and severity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_399647]/or 
systemic side effects – pruritus, nausea/vomiting (not associated with hypotension), somnolence, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].  Somnolence will be graded using a published 
perioperative somnolence scale (23 ).  Meas urements of nausea/vomiting and pruritus will 
make use of  previously published scales (24).  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_399648] < 10 breaths/min.  We will also make note  of both 
the type and amount of treatme nt given for these opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related side- effects .  In addition, 
we will collect data  on the incidence and severity of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399649] – 
tinnitus, perioral numbness , metallic taste, and seizures – and will characterize  both the 
type and amount of treatment required.  
 Breast -feeding success and safety will be monitored during this study.  Breast fee ding 
success will be measured using  LATCH Scores (25 ) obtained in the PACU , and once per 
shift on the mother -baby [CONTACT_399684] [ADDRESS_503663] been measured during epi[INVESTIGATOR_399650]  (0.125%)  
IRB00073292  Version February 6, [ADDRESS_503664] mil k-plasma ratio  being somewhere between 0.23 and 0.25 at 
18-24hr (26 ).  Surprisingly, the literature is silen t regarding the concentration of 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399651].  
 
Both the cesarean section incision and the catheter insertion site will be evaluated.  Any 
catheter - or infiltrate -related issues like wound infection and seroma formati on will be 
noted.  Wounds  will be assessed for inf ection or dehiscence at 24, 48, and 72hr. At the  4-
6 week and  3-month follow -up phone call s the patient will be asked about the presence of 
wound dysesthesia (numbness, tingling, burning, pric king, allodynia, or hyperesthesia).  
The patient will also be asked about the occurrence of infection, dehiscence, and keloid 
formation at this time.  
  Patient satisfaction will be monitored with a satisfaction scores (100 mm scale) at 72hr.  
A cost analysis will occur for the inpatient stay.  Some of the costs we will look at are 
include those for preparation of the drugs and devices, along with monitoring/supervision 
costs based on nursing and physician interventions, as well as  cost of days spent i n the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( 27). 
 
Study Design and Methodology  
After informed consent has been obtained, a ll study participants  will receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_399652] .  Patients ≥ 64 inches will get spi[INVESTIGATOR_399653] 
12mg 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (1.6ml), 10mcg fentanyl (0.2ml), and 200mcg PFM  (0.4ml) for 
a total volume of 2.2ml.  Patients ≤ 63 inches will receive the same spi[INVESTIGATOR_399654] ≥ 64 inches ex cept that the dose of 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_399655] 10.5mg 
(1.4ml) resulting in a total volume of 2.0ml.  The PFM dose of 200mcg was chosen as it is the commonly used clinical dose ( 28).  These spi[INVESTIGATOR_399656] 1.[ADDRESS_503665] has already been created using a 
randomization free -ware packet fro m the internet  (Random Number Generator,

 stattrek.com) , and is on file at the research pharmacy.  The code is not known by [CONTACT_399685].   The arms are as follows: 1 ) a bolus dose of 8ml of normal  saline 
followed by [CONTACT_60801] 8ml/hr of normal saline using an On -Q® elastomeric pump, 2) 
a bolus dose of 8ml of 0.1% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399657] 8ml/hr  of 0.1% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399658] -Q® elastomer ic pump, or 3) a bolus dose of 8ml of 0.2% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399659] 8 ml/hr of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399658]-Q® 
elastomeric pump .  The pump will be filled to its maximum capacity of 550 ml and will 
infuse    until the total volume is delivered. The patient s will undergo their cesarean 
section s in the usual fashion through uterine closure.  The peritoneum may or may not be 
closed and the rectus ab domini s muscles may or may not be approximated as  per the 
usual practice of the attending obstetrician .  The obstetrician will insert a 20G guide 
needle/introducer assembly through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and rectus fascia about 
3cm above and just lateral to the incision. When the introducer is fixed in the desired 
location, the guide needle is removed, and a multiport, silver -impregnated catheter (6 -
10cm) is pl aced above the rectus muscle parallel to the fascial incision .  The fascia is then 
closed above the rectus muscles, and the rest of the closure occurs as per the usual 
practice of the surgeon.  After closure is complete, one to two drops of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_399660] (2 -octyl cyanoacrylate or Su rgiSeal®) will be placed on the skin at the exit site 
of the multiport catheter and the catheter will be further secured with adhesive surgical 
strips. The exit site, along with a small length of catheter will then be covered with a 
sterile bio -occlusive dressing.   The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399661] a [ADDRESS_503666] so lution, along with an On -Q® elastomeric pump  
loaded with the same solution to the operating room prior to, or during , the cesarean 
section.  The test solutions  are all water -white in color, and will have no discerning 
markings to indicate whether it is saline or one of the two concentrations of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_110762].  
The preparing pharmacist will be the only person not blinded to the study.  At the 
termination of the surgical procedure, the obstetrician will administer  the 8ml bolus of 
test solution  via the catheter using the 10ml preloaded syringe , followed by [CONTACT_399686] -set to deliver 8ml/hr of test solution.  
 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, 2019  
Page 11 of 16 
 Ketorolac (30 mg IV) will always be given at the first request for additional pain 
medi cine after leaving the operating room. Thereafter , the study patients  will receive 
30mg ketorolac q6hr prn pain for 24 hr if their pain score is > 3.  If their pain score 
remains > 3 twenty min utes after ket orolac administration, they can receive morphine 
1mg IV q1hr until their pain score is ≤ 3.  After 24hr, and through discharge, the study patients will receive 1-2 tablets  PO oxycodone -acetaminophen (5/325)  q6hr for post -
operative pain for pain scores > 3.  Additional breakthrough pain still present 30 min after oxycodone -acetaminophen dosing will be treated with ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6hr.  
Again, if the pai n score remains > 3 thirty  min after ibuprofen dosing, IV morphine  (1-2 
mg q1hr)  will be administered until the pain score is ≤ 3. 
 Each patient that ends up participating in our study will have a folder (see attached Data 
Collection Instrument) associated with her name.  This folder will include all of the VAPS scoring sheets and the McGill pain scoring sheets obtained at the different  time 
periods.  It will also contain summary sheets for data abstracted from the medical, nursing, and pharmacy records such as uterine closure, LATCH scores, t ime to first 
rescue medication, time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441],  and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_399662] , etc.  The se 
folders will be stored in locked file cabinets in the main office of the EUHM Department 
of Anesthesiology where other sensitive patient information is kept securely.  Data, without personal identifiers will be entered into Excel spread sheets and ke pt on the 
Emory Healthcare virtual desktop for further analysis.    
Participant S election  
The study will take place at Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79452] (EUHM), which cares 
for a mixed community - and university -based obstetric practice. P artur ients will be  
recruited from the patient pools of both private and Emory physicians , and enrolled after 
appropriate consent has been obtained.  The inclusion criteria for the study includes  all 
ASA class I -III parturients at least [ADDRESS_503667] allergies to morphine,

 ketorolac, or amide local anesthetics; pregnancies less than 34wks gestational age; 
significant maternal cardiac, liver, or renal disease; maternal history of narcotic abu se or 
dependency; presence of a pre- operative fever  (> 100.4 °F) ; emergent  cesarean sections 
with or with -out general anesthesia; and patients in whom valid consent is questionable 
(non- English speakers or mentally -impaired individuals).  Study  patients have the option 
of withdrawing from the study at any point, as t he On -Q® pump infusion can be simply 
discontinued and the catheter removed .  At suc h time the patient would revert to our 
standard pain management protocol. 
 
Statistical Analysis  
Based on a preliminary sample size calculation using an α risk of 0.05, a β  risk of 0.2, 
and an effect size involving  a 40% reduction in pain scores, we estimate that [ADDRESS_503668].  Normally distributed data will be presented as means ±  SD, 
whereas non- normally distributed data will be expressed as medians with interquartile 
ranges.  Categorical data will be reported as frequencies.   VAS scores will be analyzed 
using two -way ANOVA for repeated measures.  Non -normal data will be analyzed using 
the Friedman test.  Categorical data will be analyzed using the Χ2 test.  Multiple 
comparisons will use a Bonferroni correction.  Differences will be considered statistically significan t at a P<0.05 . 
 
Patient Safety and Potential B enefits 
There is no added discomfort of having the On- Q
® device placed , as it is inserted during 
surgery under spi[INVESTIGATOR_323135].  There is al so minimal to no discomfort upon re moval of 
the catheter which is simply  pulled out when the infusion is completed, if the patient 
withdraws from the study, or if the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  An adhesive 
bandage is placed over the insertion site and left in place for 12- 24hr after catheter 
removal.  Control patients who end up getting  the normal saline infus ions will be receiv e 
the current standard of care  for pain relief at our institution  (PFM and adjunctive 
medications ). 
 
IRB00073292  Version February 6, [ADDRESS_503669] postsurgical days is commonly provided by 
[CONTACT_399687] -acetaminophen (5/325) and ibuprofen, with IV 
morphine  being occasionally used in refractory cases.  
 
Several of our obstetricians routinely place the OnQ® pain system post -cesarean delivery, 
and administer 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_142245] 5 ml/hr through a subf ascial catheter.  In this  study, 
we propose changing  the LA  infused from 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_399663] 5 ml/hr to either 0.1% or 
0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], at 8 ml/hr.  This change should actually enhance patient safety as not only does this represent a reduction in LA dose/ hr (from 25mg/hr with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_399664] 8 or 16mg/hr with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], respectively), but also constitutes a change from a relatively cardiotoxic LA (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) to one considered significantly less so

and in fact, 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_142245] 8- 12ml/hr forms our standard labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_399666].  Finally, it shoul d be noted that the highest daily ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399667] (day 1 
which includes the hourly infusi on plus an 8ml bolus ( which works out to either 200mg 
or 400 mg  for the two infusions ) in this study is well below the maximum recommended 
daily dose of 800mg  (30).   
 
Additionally, patients in the study will be immediately unbli nded via phone call to the 
pharmacy in the three following situations: a) if they experience any 2 of 4 minor LA 
toxicities (perioral numbness, metallic taste in mouth, tinnitus, or light- headedness); b) 
any signs of severe systemic toxicity (seizures, arrhythmia, obtundation, cardiac arrest); or allergic reactions which appear by [CONTACT_399688] ( hives, 
angio edema, anaphylaxis).  Minor toxicities will be treated by [CONTACT_238365][INVESTIGATOR_399668] 6hr (approximately [ADDRESS_503670] insert) .  Major toxicities will be treated by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_399669]00073292  Version February 6, 2019

 appropriate supportive or resuscitative care.  It is felt that major toxicity is very unlikely 
considering the drug utilized, the drug dosage, the use of a clinically -approved delivery 
device, and the restrictions on recruiting patients with LA allergies.  
 
The OnQ® elastomeric pump and silver -impregnated catheter are FDA -approved devices 
for the treatment of post -surgical pain after all types of surgery including cesarean 
section.  Theoretically, it could  be argued that t here is a small risk of skin or  wound 
infection due to the presence of a tunneled percutaneous catheter for three days.   This risk 
will be mitigated in three ways.  First, s terile technique will be used throughout the 
procedure and the patients will be given antibiotic prophylaxis befor e the cesarean 
section .  Second, the silver -impregnated catheter has inherent antimicrobial properties 
which prevent formation of a bacterial microfilm with subsequent c atheter colonization; 
and also elutes silver directly into the implantation site where it may have d irect 
antimicrobial activity (3 1).  Finally, LA s themselves have intrinsic bacteriostatic and/or 
bactericidal properties  against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, and thereby 
[CONTACT_399689] (32).  
 There are possible benefits of being enrolled in the study.  If our hypothesis is correct , 
both acute post operative pain (at rest and with movement) and chronic postsurgical pain 
will be reduced in patients that receive the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_399670] .  These patients would 
likely experience a reduction in the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_399671].  
This could lead to a reduction in the incidence and treatment of medication -related side -
effects.  The reduction in pain, as well as a decrease in medication use, might  result in 
more successful and safer breastfeeding.  Pain and side -effect reduction might also lead 
to the need for fewer nursing interventions , along with a potential decrease in the length 
of stay after a cesarean section .  If these goals are met, this truly multimodal technique of 
postoperative pain control might also decrease the cost of these patients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

1. Purpose of the Study and Background  
 
1.1 Purpose of the Study  
 
The primary aims of this  study are to  assess  the feasibility , acceptability, and tolerability  of a 
virtual reality ( VR) behavioral activation (BA) treatment for individuals diagnosed with major 
depressive disorder (MDD) . The secondary aim of this study is to explore the efficacy of using 
VR to deliver BA therapy to a clinical MDD population . 
 
The primary hypothesis of this study is that VR is an acceptable, feasible, and safe way to deliver 
a BA intervention  for individuals diagnosed with MDD . Acceptability will measure the 
participant ’s desire to continue using the VR treatment after the study ends, the participant ’s 
satisf action with the VR treatment, the participant 's use of the headset, and the participant ’s 
acceptance of VR treatment. Feasibility will look at how well VR can integrate into the BA 
therapy. Tolerability will measure simulator sickness and agitation while u sing the VR headset . 
 
A secondary hypothesis is that VRBA will have stronger effects than BA treatment as usual or a 
waitlist control in treating individuals with MDD due to increased homework compliance. This is 
due to the research that has illustrated that homework compliance is one of the strongest 
predictors of treatment outcomes for BA. This hypothesis will be assessed by [CONTACT_56047] t -tests 
comparing the change in PHQ -9 scores at timepoints across the three study arms.  
 
This study will also comment on the following questions: Can one successfully deliver BA 
without the movement component, simulating just t he experience of pleasure/ mastery? Does 
VRBA lead people to want to engage in real -life activities?  Is the active ingredient of BA 
emotion or movement?  Movement during the VRBA will be measured with the headset.  
 
1.2 Study Significance  
 
Little to no rese arch has been done to elucidate the role of VR technology in lieu of real -world 
behavioral activation. This study will lay the groundwork for future studies to examine the role 
that VR may play in improving mood in clinical populations that are unable to p erform real -
world behavioral activation because of physical and/or psychological limitations.  
 
1.3 Background  
 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders in the United 
States. The lifetime prevalence of MDD is estimated to b e 12% (Kessler et al., 2011) and it is the 
11th greatest cause of disability and mortality in the world (Murray et al., 2012). Current  
treatment includes both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological intervention. 
There is strong evidence for  the efficacy of a very simple type of CBT for depression that 
requires no active cognitive abilities from participant s and can be delivered by [CONTACT_242447]. This type of therapy is called Behavioral Activation (BA) (Dimidjian et al., 2011). 
Rese arch has shown BA to be more effective than cognitive therapy alone and equivalent to 
medication for treating depression in participant s (Dimidjian et al., 2006; Scogin et al., 2005; 
Spates, Pagoto, & Kalata, 2006). However, many participant s are unable to  complete BA therapy 
due to lack of access to trained providers, physical constraints, diminished motivation, or 
geographical or financial reasons. Increasing access to mental health care using technology such 
as a Virtual BA therapy may provide a solution  to these barriers.  
  
Behavioral Activation encourages participant s to change their moods by [CONTACT_242448]. BA therapy begins with monitoring a 
participant ’s current activity and identifying positive activities that can be added into the 
participant ’s daily schedule. These pleasant activities can be as simple as soaking in a bathtub, 
going to the mall, lying on the beach, or going fishing. These activities a re then scheduled into 
the participant ’s daily routine, and progress is tracked. The list of activities is modified as 
necessary and challenges and barriers are problem‐solved for each participant . 
  
Virtual Reality (VR) technology now allows one to create  and experience realistic and 
immersive virtual environments in which people can move around freely and interact with their 
surroundings. Compared to other mediums, VR is a very effective tool for eliciting feelings of 
presence: the user’s subjective feeli ng of being inside a virtual environment. In part because of 
its ability to elicit presence, VR has been leveraged to deliver mental health interventions, 
including exposure‐based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242442] s with anxiety. VR is ideal for exposure  
therapy be cause participant s are realistically immersed in a feared environment that is tailored to 
match their specific phobias (Maples‐Keller, Runnell, Kim, & Rothbaum, 2017). For similar 
reasons, VR may also be ideal for delivering BA therapy : individuals can be immersed in 
environments that evoke strong feelings of enjoyment, mastery, and pleasure. These 
environments can be tailored to match each individual’s list of ideal, positive activities. VR may 
also be ideal for delivering BA because it makes an incredibly  wide range of activities easily and 
immediately accessible and can include pleasurable activities that may be impossible to complete 
in the real world (e.g. scuba -diving the Great Barrier Reef).  
  
Within a clinical MDD population, VR -BA may be especially ideal for individuals who lack the 
motivation to engage in real -world BA. In this setting, VR -BA may either replace or act as a 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_242443] -world BA. Standardizing and operationalizing a BA treatment to be self‐
administered may also be a cost -effective way of preventing and treating MDD. This may be 
especially important in areas where access to care is a problem for MDD treatment.

2. Criteria for Subject Selection  
 
2.1 Number of Subjects:  30  
 
2.2 Gender of Subjects:  All genders will be included and accepted in the study.  
 
2.3 Age of Subjects: Participants must  be over the age of 18 years old.  
 
2.4 Racial and Ethnic Origin:  No enrollment restrictions based on race or ethnicity.  
2.5 Inclusion Criteria:   
1. Participant  must meet DSM V criteria for MDD  
2. [ADDRESS_294151] School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences  for an intake 
session. This session will include obtaining informed consent, the Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview, and completing the demographic questionnaire. If subjects meet 
study eligibility , they will be randomized into either the VRBA, BA treatment as usual, or 
waitlist control arm of the study  using [ADDRESS_294152] treatment appointment.  
 
The VR interventio n will follow the protocol for Behavioral Activation (BA). Participant s in the 
BA treatment as usual or VRBA arms of the study  will meet with their clinician once per week  
for [ADDRESS_294153] four 
activit ies that are  highly enjoyable  to schedule into the ir upcoming week . The VRBA 
participants  will be required to choose VR activities for the week and the BA treatment as usual 
participants will be required to choose real -life activities to participate in. The VR participants 
will complete an activity in VR during session, in order to learn how to use the headset, which 
they will take home. Each time  the participant finishes an activity in VR , he/she will be asked to 
complete a questionnaire assessing “spatial presence,” “simulator sickness,” “agitation measure,” 
and acceptability. Participants will  also be asked to rate their mood on a scale of 1 -10 (1=worst 
they ever felt; 10=best they ever f elt) before and after their chosen activity. During session [ADDRESS_294154] of care procedures, steps to minimize risks to the 
confidentiality of identifiable info rmation will be taken as with all HIPPA compliant services 
delivered at the Clinic. Data will all be labeled with the participants' assigned ID number. 
Protected Health Information will be kept separate from data and ID numbers in a Stanford 
University Sch ool of Medicine encrypted database to which only the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_242446]. Psychological effects of study participation or breeches in confidentiality will 
be monitored and discussed at research meetings. There is a slight risk of mo tion sickness so 
participants will be closely monitored while immersed in the virtual scene, and if there is any 
discomfort they will be removed from the virtual environment. Participants are free to 
discontinue participation at any time. Any situation req uiring medical attention will be promptly 
provided.  
 
Given that participants enrolled are clinically depressed, suicidal ideation will be assessed each 
session. If it is revealed that a participant is expressing suicidal ideation, the clinician will 
conduc t a thorough risk assessment in real time and a safety plan will be created. If it is 
determined the participant is an imminent danger to themselves, the clinician will initiate a 5150 
hold and walk the participant to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

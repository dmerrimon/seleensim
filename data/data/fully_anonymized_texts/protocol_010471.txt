liver and extrahepatic bile ducts, which m ay terminate at the ampulla of Vater.  Based on 
anatom ical location, cholangiocarcinoma can be divided into 3 categories: (1) intrahepatic (20 -
25%), occurring in the bile ducts residing within the liver; (2) extrahepatic or perihilar  (also 
known as Klatski n tumour, 50%), occurring at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts; 
and (3) distal extrahepatic bile duct (20 -25%) , occurring beyond the liver .  More  than 90% of 
cholangiocarcinoma are adenocarcinomas, with different histological variants incl uding 
adenocarcinoma, papi[INVESTIGATOR_448553], intestinal -type adenocarcinoma, and mucinous 
adenocarcinoma.  
 
Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been shown to be effective in 
prolonging long -term survival .  Although photodynamic thera py has been reported to be 
effective as a palliative treatment, it is not curative.  Radical surgery is the only potentially 
curative treatment modality .  However, in most cases, the tumors are well advanced at the time 
of diagnosis, which results in limit ed treatment options .  The impact of chemotherapy on survival 
remains controversial.  The overall survival for patients with cholangiocarcinoma  is ~[ADDRESS_1221533] line chemotherapy.  However, the outcomes of 
this therapy are limited.  After gemcitabine/cisplatin t herapy, there is essentially no  known 
effective chemo therapy.  The poor response of cholangiocarcinoma to  current therapy highlights 
the need  for a safe and effective therapy.  
 
CPI-613 is a novel anti -cancer agent ( Zachar et al. 2011).  CPI -613 s electively targets the altered 
form of mitochondrial energy metabolism in tumor cells, causing changes in mitochondrial 
enzyme activities and redox sta tus which lead s to apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy of tumor 
cells (Zachar et al. 2011) .  The activities of CPI -613 involve the catalytic and regulatory 
functions of the altered form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  (PDC)  and the α-
ketoglutarate dehy drogenase complex (KGDHC) found in tumor cells (Zachar et al. 2011).  CPI-
613 is also well -tolerated at doses up to 3,000 mg/m2, according to Phase [ADDRESS_1221534] a variety of

marker CA -19-9 and performance status. Should the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_874783]. Should the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874784] a favorable resp onse, those patients will continue treatment 
with CPI -613 for an additional three cycles (approximately three months). At that 
time, patients will then undergo re -imaging contrast CT, CA -19-9 and 
performance status.  
 
According to the Response Evaluation C riteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the 
efficacy of treatment for solid  tumo rs is determined by [CONTACT_307964] r size. RECIST  
criteria are the golden standard to evaluate the tumor. In this study  RECIST 
criteria  will be used to evaluate response. H owever, the re is a pseudoprogression  
phenomenon described with the use of CPI -613 in Phase I solid tumor studies  
(Lee et al. 2012).  
 
It is felt that if CPI -613-induces necrosis of the tumor lesion there may be some 
radiographic evidence for increasing size. CPI -613 induces  tumor necrosis due to 
its mechanism of action – selectively targeting the altered form of mitochondrial 
energy metabolism in tumor cells, causing changes in mitochondrial enzyme 
activities and redox status, which leads to apoptosis, necrosis, and autophag y of 
tumor cells (2,3,7,17,18).  
 
For the purposes of this study, pseudoprogression will be defined and considered 
in patients who meet RECIST criteria of progression. It will be the treating 
physician’s discretion to continue treatment in this situation i f the patient is 
deemed to be getting clinical palliative benefit. In these patients, the study drug 
can be given for another two cycles  prior to  making definitive determination of 
progression or response .  
. 
Assessment of tumor response will be the respon sibility of the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874785] (i.e., contrast CT of the 
chest , abdomen, and pelvis,  and MRI  of the abdomen) , CA-19-[ADDRESS_1221566] after treatment termination. 
(Note:  During the bimonthly post -study telephone contact, information related to 
cancer treatment received after the study will also be collected) . OS and PFS will 
be calculated from the first day of treatment. The duration of OS wi ll be measured 
until the date of death or censored at follow -up. The duration of response 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_16625]) will be measured from the date a first objective response is 
documented until the first sign of progression assessed by [CONTACT_874792].  
 
**NOTE:   Tumor  necrosis alone should not be criteria for determining

assessment of progression or response.  However, patients will not be allowed to 
continue treatment with CPI -613 at  the time of “pseudo -progression” if any of the 
following criteria are met:  
 
a. The patient does not meet eligibility criteria set at the start of the protocol.  
b. Biliary function worsens.  
c. The patient has symptomatic progression . 
 
OS will be determined from the first dose of CPI -[ADDRESS_1221569] after 
treatment termination.  
 
RR is defined as % of patients who experienced a Complete Response (CR) or 
Partial Response (PR) .  CR and PR are based on Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 Eisenhauer et al. 2009). The best response 
recorded from the start of the t reatment until Disease Progression (DP) will be 
considered . 
 
PFS will be determined from the first dose of CPI -[ADDRESS_1221570] dose of CPI -613. 
 
5.2 Specifics of Tests Performed During the Study  
 
Described below are the specifics of the tests performed in this study.  
 
5.2.1 ECOG Performance Status  
 
The ECOG Performance Status scales (Oken et al 1982) will be used to assess 
how a patient's disease is progressing and assess how the disease affects the daily 
living abilities of the patient.  These scales are listed in Table 5.2.1-1 (below).

5.2.3 Analys es of Plasma CPI -613 Concentration s, Possibly Metabolite 
Concentrations, and Possibly Other Analyses  
 
Plasma samples for the determination of CPI -613 concentration s, possibly 
metabolite concentrations  and possibly other analyses  will be obtained before and 
at various times after dosing of CPI -613 on Day 1 of Pre -Cycle 1 & Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 at the following time points:  ~[ADDRESS_1221573] -dose of CPI -613. 
 
Blood (4 mL for each sample) should be obtained from a peripheral vein, and not 
from a central veno us catheter . The blood samples should be collected in 4 -mL 
lavender top collection tubes containing K2 -EDTA anticoagulant. The procedures 
for obtaining plasma samples are described in subsequent sections.  
 
The specific procedures for collecting the blood s amples are:  
Sample Collection:  
 
1. Collect [ADDRESS_1221574] 
the tubes on a mechanical shaker for 10 minutes to ensure full mixing.  
4. The samples are then immediately centrifuged (< 1300x g for 10 minutes). 
Ther e should be ~2 mL of plasma from each 4 mL blood sample.  
5. The plasma fraction should then be transferred in approximately equal 
fractions using a disposable pi[INVESTIGATOR_874786] 1.8-mL Nunc cryovial 
(provided by [CONTACT_874793]) and immediately frozen. The total time from 
collection to freezing should not exceed 60 minutes.  The recommended 
temperature for sample storage is -80°C (or lower).  
 
Sample Tube Labeling  
 
Each sample vial should be marked with a unique identifier, to be provided by 
[CONTACT_874793]. The unique  identifier include the date and time of collection, 
dose, and subject number.  A separate document  (the “PK Sample Collection 
Log”) should then identify the number as it pertains to dosage, date, time of 
collection, etc.  
 
Sample Tube Shipment  
 
When all sa mples from each patient have been collected, they should be 
shipped to Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to the attention of Asela Boteju .

1-week -off treatment cycles has been determined from Co hort 1, and once the 
dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week has been determined from Cohort 2 -

613 for 5 days during the pre -Cycle 1 week at doses as determined from 
Cohort s 2-4, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determ ined from Cohort 1.  
 
6.1.2  Justification of the Dose  
 
Based on Phase I trial s in patients with solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies, 3 ,000 mg/m2 is the MTD , when CPI-613 is given as a single agent 
infused over 2 hours on Days 1 and 4 for 3 weeks of a 4 -week treatment cycle .  
CPI-613 did not induce any significant adverse effects at or below MTD . 
Additionally, CPI-613 at or below 3,000 mg exhibits anti -tumor activities in 
patients with various types of solid and hematologic malignancies (Pardee et al, 
2011a and b, & 2012; Lee et al. 2011 & 2012; Senzer et al 2012) . Because of the 
safety and efficacy  against other cancers , 3,000 mg/m2 is the target dose for thi s 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
In this study, patients will be treated with CPI -613 for 5 consecutive days during 
pre-Cycle 1, prior to being treated with CPI -613 given 2x weekly for 3 weeks. A 
sub-MTD (2,300 mg/m2, approx. three -quarter s of the MTD) will be used in the 
first 3 patients (in Cohort 1) who will be treated with the 4 -week treatment cycles 
and without treatment during the pre -Cycle 1 week to ensure safety, before 
initiating the dose escalation procedure to determine the  MTD. The maximum 
plasma concentration ( Cmax) of CPI -613 associated with the dose level of 2,300 
mg/m2 is ~90  μM, which is significantly lower tha n the C max of ~200 μM 
associated with 3,000 mg/m2. Therefore, 2,300 mg/m2 is expected to be a safe 
starting dose.

- 25 of 54 - 6.2 Dosing Delay and Dose Modification of CPI -613 in the Event of Adverse 
 Events  
 
For adverse events unrelated to serum creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function 
but are possibly related to CPI -613, the occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not genera lly 
require dose modification for subsequent doses for that patient.  However, if Grade 2 
toxicity (other than alopecia and nausea) probably related to CPI -613 develops, treatment 
is to be withheld and can resume only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been re duced to 
Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced 
by 25% of the dose at which such Grade [ADDRESS_1221596] be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and 
the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced to 50% of the dose at 
which such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs.  
 
For adv erse events related to creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function that are 
possibly related to CPI -613, dosing of the patient will be withheld even if the severity 
level is Grade 2 or above.  Treatment can resume only after the toxicity has been r educed 
to Grade 1.  The dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 15% 
if the severity level is of Grade 1, by 25% for Grade 2 toxicity, and by 50% for Grade 3 
or 4 toxicity.  
 
Furthermore, if the toxicity possibly related to CPI -613 is acute renal failure and the 
severity level is Grade 3 or 4, further patient enrollment will be temporarily suspended in 
order to enable assessment of the following aspects of the trial and implementation of 
corrective measures or protocol amendment,  and if necessary:

rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  To avoid local reaction s at and around the site of 
administration, CPI -613 should be administered via a central venous catheter.  
Subsequent sections describe the appropriate types of IV catheters, IV bags, syringes and

Leaching of Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP) :  CPI -613 can cause leaching of DEHP from 
IV infusion sets and IV bags (Study COM -003). Therefore, DEHP -containing IV infusion 
sets, IV bags or syringes should not be used in mixing or administration of CPI -613.

can be used in the administration of CPI -613 are:  
 
Extension Set for Syringe Pump Use :  All extension sets from MED -RX do not contain 
DEHP.  
 
Syringes :  Kendall Monoject syringes, all  mono -ject syringes are DEHP free.  
 
IV Infusion Sets :  A compatibility study has been conducted showing that CPI -613 is 
compatible with 4 commonly used IV infusion sets (Study# COM -001).  Therefore, these 
4 types of IV infusion sets, and IV infusion sets that are made with the same materials, 
can be used to administer CPI -613.  These IV infusion sets are:  
 PVC material - ADDitIV Primary IV Set with Universal Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], Backcheck Valve, 
2 Injection Sites, DEHP -Free and Lat ex-Free, 15 drops/mL, REF V14453, B Braun

D5W (i.e., 1 portion of CPI -613 diluted with 3 portions of D5W) prior to administration.  
The diluted drug product should be visually inspected for clarity.  If haziness, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_874787] (other than colorless) is observed, do not use the diluted drug product for 
dosing.  After dilution with sterile D5W, the solution is clear and has a pH of 8.[ADDRESS_1221609] has been found to be stable for 24 hrs at room 
temp erature and refrigeration temperature (Studies STA -010).  
 
CPI-[ADDRESS_1221610] be administered IV, via an IV catheter that is free flowing and free of air in 
the dead space of the IV catheter, to minimize vascular irritation, inflammation and acute 
toxicity of CPI -613 (Study NCL -049). Accidental co -administration of extra air in the 
dead space of IV catheters during administration of CPI -613 has demonstrated the 
potential to induce acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal studies (Study NCL -
049).  Also, accide ntal leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space during IV 
administration, which prolongs exposure of perivascular tissue to CPI -613, can induce 
significant local inflammation according to animal studies (Studies NCL -027 and NCL -
030).  To avoid local re actions at and around the site of administration, CPI -[ADDRESS_1221611] not be administered as a bolus, but by [CONTACT_104482], at a rate of ~0.5 mL/min, 
via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rat e of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  This is 
to minimize potential acute toxicity of CPI -613, according to animal studies (Study NCL -
049).  
 
The following precautions must be taken when administering CPI -613: 
 
A. Confirmation of the placement of the IV line to ensure  a lack of leakage of CPI -[ADDRESS_1221612] with D5W, as instructed in the study protocol.

unused CPI -613 vials) at room temperature in an access -limited area.  
Alternatively, destroy t he used CPI -613 vials according to institutional policy 
after documentation of the number of used CPI -613 vials and remaining volume 
in each used vial.  
- At the end of the study, deface the label (both used and unused vials) with a 
permanent marking pen.  
- For used CPI -613 vials (if not already destroyed according to institutional policy),

7.9 Calculation of the Amount of CPI -613 for Each Patient  
 
The amount of CPI -613 at each dose level is based on the BSA of the patient. The BSA 
values will be calculated b ased on the height and body weight taken during screening and 
this BSA value is used throughout the study. This is unless there is a >10% change in the 
body weight from baseline during the study. At that point, BSA should be revised based 
on the new body w eight and height. The new BSA values will be used from that point on

their cancer, or any other investigational drugs for any indications, while on this study.  
All otherwise permitted concomitant medications (including trade and generi c names, 
dosage and dosing schedule) must be recorded.  
 
Prophylactic treatment for drug -related symptoms is not planned, or it will interfere with 
the assessment of the toxicity of the investigational product. However, following the 
evaluation of the causal relationship of the symptom(s) to the study drug and the 
information has been documented, the investigator may prescribe supportive treatment.  
Supportive treatment may include anti -emetic, anti -diarrhea, anti -pyretic, anti -allergic, 
anti-hypertensi ve medications, analgesics, antibiotics, allopurinol, and others such as 
blood products and bone marrow growth factors.  Patients may use erythropoietin for 
chronic anemia.  Also, the hemoglobin should be maintained ≥9 g/dL  or ≥90 g/L  during 
the course of the study.  The treating physician may utilize erythropoietic factors, or 
blood or platelet transfusions at their discretion.

be reported to them for review. Th is procedure is a part of the CCCWFU Data 
Safety Monitoring Plan that our institution has on file at the NCI. All CRM staff 
members assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_380210], documenting and reporting an SAE 
qualifying for STRC  reporting are responsible for informin g a clinical member of 
the STRC  committee as well as the entire committee via the email notification 
procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.  
 
8.3  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adv erse 
events shall be promptly reported to the  IRB, according to institutional policy .  
Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, 
or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or 
device.  Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include 
psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result 
of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a 
result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions with research 
subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to 
the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others.  The  Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible 
for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others to the IRB.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874788] a change in the 
risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the 
informed consent, protocol or other study -related docu ments are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a 
site where the study has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (internal events) 
must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or 
other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at 
another site conducting the same study that has been approved by [CONTACT_399339] (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar 
days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential 
benefit of the research and as a result warrants a s ubstantive change in the 
research protocol or informed consent process/document in order to insure the

exhibiting dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), and DLT is defined as toxicity of Grade [ADDRESS_1221631] 
cycle. Note – this section is redundant with section 6.1 but is included for completeness.  
 
Cohort 1:  The first 3 patients will not be treated with the 5 daily doses of CPI -613 during the 
pre-Cycle 1 week, and will only be treated with 3 -weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles (see 
Table 6 -1). The dose of CPI-613 will be 2,300 mg/m2 (which is approximately three -quarters of 
the target dose). If none of these 3 patients develop a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) through Cycle 
1, the dose for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all 
subsequent patients in this trial . However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the 1st, 
2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be ex panded to a 
maximum of 6 patients. If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, 
the dose for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all subsequent 
patients in this trial . However, once DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients will be 
treated at 2,300 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles from that point on, even 
though the total number of patients in this cohort is as few as 2. The dose level of 2,300 mg/m2, 
which induces a D LT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be above the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles . In this case, all subsequent patients 
in this trial will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles . 
 
Cohort 2:  In another 3 patients, the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1. These patients will also be treated with the 5 daily 
doses of CPI -613 during the pre -Cycle 1 week.  The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week 
will be 1,200 mg/m2/day, which has previously been established to be the weekly MTD (see 
Section 6.1.2). If none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 3 . 
 
However, if a DLT is observed in a pa tient (whether it is the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended 
patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If 
no DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto 
Sub-Cohort 2 (see below) .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients 
will be treated at 1,200 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though the total number of 
patients at this cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 1,200 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle [ADDRESS_1221632] University

patients in this trial will be 6 00 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 mg/m2/week, equivalent to the MTD when 
given as a single dose) . 
 
Sub-Cohort 2:  Sub -Cohort 2 is activated only if 1 out of 6 patients exhibits DLT in Cohort 2.  
There are 3 patients in this sub -cohort, the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week-off 
treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  These patients will also be treated with 
the 5 daily doses of CPI -613 during the pre -Cycle 1 week.  The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -
Cycle 1 week will be 1,700 mg/m2/day.  If none of these 3 patie nts develop a DLT , the study can 
move onto Cohort 3 .  However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the first, second 
or third of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a 
maximum of 6 patients.  If n o DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 
patients, the study will move onto Cohort 3 .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no 
additional patients will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though 
the tota l number of patients at this sub -cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 1,700 mg/m2/day 
during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be 
above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 
week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 6 00 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 mg/m2/week, 
equivalent to the MTD when given as a single dose) . 
 
Cohort 3:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in Cohort 2, or DLT is 
observed in 1 or less patients in Sub -Cohort 2.  There are 3 patients in this cohort, and the dose 
of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  
The dose for the 5 daily IV infusions during the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 2,300 mg/m2/day.  If 
none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 4 .  However, if a DLT 
is observed in a patient (whether it is t he 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended patients), the number of 
patients in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If no DLT is observed in 
another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto Cohort 4 .  However, i f 
a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients will be treated at 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during 
the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though the total number of patients at this sub -cohort is as few as 2.  
The dose level of 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or 
more patients, is considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the 
dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 1,700

Cohort 4:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in 1 or less patients in Cohort 
3.  There are 3 patients in this cohort, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off 
treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  The dose for the 5 daily IV infusions 
during the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 3,000 mg/m2/day.  If none of these 3 patients develop a 
DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 5 .  However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it 
is the first, second or third of the 3 i ntended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will 
be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a

- 36 of 54 - even though the total number of patients at this cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 3,0 00 
mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is 
considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for 
the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 2,300  mg/m2/day 
 
Cohort 5:  This cohort is performed once the dose of CPI -613 for  the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off 
treatment cycles has been determined from Cohort 1, and once the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -
Cycle 1 week has been determined from Cohort 2 -4.  There are 10 patients in this cohort.  These 
patients will be treated with CPI -613 fo r 5 days during the pre -Cycle 1 week at doses as 
determined from Cohorts 2 -4, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  
As can be seen by [CONTACT_874801] s that could occur in order 
to determine the dose for the 10 patients to be evaluated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Once the above 
procedure is completed we will then enroll 10 patients at the determined dose.  
Accrual Rate  
We anticipate accruing one patient per mont h for this protocol. Since the dose escalation 
procedure described above may involve a variable number of patients (at least 6 but possibly 
more) we cannot be certain the entire length of accrual for this protocol.  However, we do 
anticipate that the total  number of patients in this protocol will be between 16 -40 (with [ADDRESS_1221636] likely range). Thus, we anticipate that we will reach the target sample size of [ADDRESS_1221637] sizes for these outcomes.   
 
For the time -to-event outcomes we will estimate survival curves for OS and PFS using Kaplan -
Meier techniques. In addition, we will estimate the 6 month and 1 -year OS an d PFS rates for 
these participants. For response rate we will present the proportion of patients who are CR, PR, 
SD or PD. In addition, we will estimate the proportion of responders as the percent of patients 
who are CR or PR. For this rate we will also in clude a 95% confidence interval.  
 
We will also examine toxicities for these [ADDRESS_1221638] specific effects , 
however with this sample size we will be able to estimate the response rate using a 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval with an interval that will extend no more than 0.[ADDRESS_1221639] University

Mandatory Safety and Toxicity Review Committee (STRC; Previously CROC)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Notification Procedure  
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form 
that is submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol 
intervention) SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional trial patients . There 
are multiple en tities that require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for 
what is reported, and how it is reported.  
Rules used by [CONTACT_485230] (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, 
etc.) should NOT be u sed to evaluate whether an event sh ould be reported to STRC. 
Only the rules for reporting described in this document should be considered.  
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by [CONTACT_399348]: In-house, in ternally 
reviewed trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry 
sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, 
implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial 
initiated by  [CONTACT_399349].   Institutional trials are 
almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are 
labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group 
protocol s are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAE s 
on these trials be reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) 
staff members assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_777735] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648] , 
followed by [CONTACT_399350].  
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH 
CANCER CENTER INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS.  
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected gr ade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol 
(e.g. myelosuppression) and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) 
should be reported. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, 
which can exten d days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

event. This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_399351]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all per sons that the event applies to will be notified; remember 
to file a copy of your confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the 
required fields, consult the help page for further instructions.)

- 49 of 54 - 4. Follow up with/update the clinical member of STRC regarding any new 
developments or information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation 
and reporting process.  
Elements needed to complete the electronic STRC f orm:  
1. ORIS Patient ID (PID)  
2. Name [CONTACT_485238]/Date/Time/Comments.  
3. Grade of event.  
4. Is this related to protocol intervention or treatment?  
5. Is suspension of the protocol needed?  
6. Is any change to consent or protocol needed?  
7. Was the nature or sever ity of the event unexpected?  
8. Date of the event.  
9. Brief description of the event using approved CTC version terminology.  
10.  Date of last study dose before event.  
11. Relevant tests/labs.  
12. Most importantly make sure that the Investigator assigns attribution to the 
reported event (grade) using the appropriate CTCAE version for the protocol.

Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_874804] a re asonable amount of time, then 
initiate contact [CONTACT_399354].  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to 
respond to a phone call or page before contact[CONTACT_485235]. This is a general 
guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical  research professional given 
the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is 
appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the event occurs near the end of day, then 
leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC 
notification form.  The important criteria is that have taken reasonable steps to notify 
and document that you have initiated some type of contact [CONTACT_485236].

- 50 of 54 - STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the 
events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event 
reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the 
information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order 
for an assessment to be made further communication directly with the investigator may 
be warranted. STRC reserves the right to agree with the investigator’s assessment i f 
STRC does not agree with the investigator STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial 
pending further investigation.

BACKG ROUND : 
 
The goal of the propos ed project is the deve lopment and  evaluation of a novel  mobile 
medical application  for the detection and monitoring of strabismus  (eye misalignment).  The image 
analysis technology nece ssary to measure strabi smus u sing the corneal reflection technique 
(Photogr aphic Hirschbe rg Test)  has been  available for many  decad es (Brodie 1987),  however  it 
has never been deployed  using a  smart phone.  A smart  phone platform  will eliminate barriers  of 
cost (since  the hardware  is main tained  and updated by [CONTACT_276285] ), leading  to rapid 
widesp read application and allowing the techn ology to  finally reach  its potenti al level  of impa ct 
for child ren’s’  eye care in the de tection and management  of strabismus.  Strabismus causes visual 
confusion and double  vision which  ultimately re sults in the brain suppressing vision  from the 
deviated eye.  In children this results in unde r-development (a mblyopia) with permanent  vision 
loss in the deviated eye if not detec ted and treated at a young  age (Rowe,  2012).  Strabismus in 
children is also associat ed with coordina tion problems  such as postural instability (Lions et. al. 
2013)  and severe social disadvantages (Lukm an et. al. 2011). Strabismus develops  in an estimated 
3-8% of children in the U.S. (Tay lor et.al. 2011;  Cotter et.al.  2009;  Rowe 2012).  The prototype 
smart phone  app (Referr ed to here as the Mobile  Eye Alignm ent App – MEAA), uses photog raphic 
analysis of the corneal reflect ion (Purkinjie image) gene rated by  [CONTACT_276286]. 
The corneal reflection  method  uses the displacement  of the reflection from  the center  of the pupil 
in the deviated  eye to calculate  the amount  of eye misalignment. 
 
This measurement technique  will be deployed  for the proposed project using the 
hardware  of the Sams ung Galaxy,  a popul ar phone with an Android operating system. Preliminary 
results suggest the app can measure differences in  eye alignment  of 1.6° (2.8 prism diopters). If 
successfully deve loped, the  app has potenti al to be utilized to advance  pediatric strabismus 
research by [CONTACT_276287][INVESTIGATOR_276282]. Such  a 
tool could  better deline ate the natural history of strabismus and perhaps help determ ine its causes.  
 
While devices are available  which  could  make  these measure ments, the costs are 
prohibitively high  (>$3,000  ea.) and will not reach the widespread  availability of smart phone s. 
Clinical goals for the app are to provide eye docto rs with an objective measureme nt tool  in the 
exam  room, allow daily monitoring of treatment effects,  and even tually to be used as a screen ing 
tool by [CONTACT_276288],  pediatricians, and  parents. The barriers to market success of stand-alone 
devices is not the accur acy sensiti vity or spe cificity of photographic analysis  techni que which  has 
been  repor ted with sensitivity from  53% to near 90% and specifici ty ranging from 76% to 94% for 
strabismus detection (Loudon  et.al. 2011; Barnard et.al. 2013). 
 
Impact of strabismus  screening  for the young  - Early detection  for strabismus  in young 
children, especially during  the critical period  up to 2 years of age, is important  to ensure that 
treatment is administered as soon  as possible (Klaver et. al. 2011;  Williams et.al.  2002).  The 
success of amblyopia treatment depends on several factor s, but principa lly on the age of onset  and 
the age at which  the treatment  is initiated  (Taylor et.al. 2011). Ther apy for amblyopia is maximally 
effective if started  before age 3 and can be initiated as early as 8 months, unde rscori ng the critical 
need  for early and widespread  access to strabismus  screening  (Epe lbaum 1993;  Williams  et. al. 
2002).  Indeed,  countries  with long-standing early vision screening programs have reported 
significantly reduced  rates of amblyopia (Eibschitz-Tsimhoni et.al.  2000).  Access  to strabism us 
screening is also important for older, school  age children  (age 7-17) suffer ing from amblyopia,  for 
whom  treatment  can lead to  signifi cant improv ements in visual  acuity ranging  from 20%-70% of 
patients, depending  on their age bracket (Taylor 2011;  Scheiman  et. al. 2005).  
 
 
 
AIM  
 
AIM 1:  
 
Develop  and test key functionality  of the strabismus app by [CONTACT_276289] (no n-strabism ic 
volun teers will gaze at off axis targets  of kno wn ecc entricity). 
 
AIM 2 : 
 
Evaluate the strabismus  app accuracy and feasibility  in a clinical environmen t.  Partic ipants with 
strabismus will  be tested with both the app and clinical  methods  and analyzed for  levels  of 
agreement  and test-retest repeatabilit y, satisfaction with the app evaluation, impact on symp toms, 
and perceived value.  
 
 
 
OBJE CTIVES : 
 
1) Using  simulated  strabismus, we will systematically evaluate  chan ges to the prototype app. The 
app will be tested  in various  lighting conditions  and in participants with  various iris colorations, 
using  this information  to refine and eventually  select the best algori thm. 
 
2) Comp are the app measurem ent with the following  common clinical  tests of eye alignment: the 
cove r-test with prism  neutralization, mod ified Thorington, or Von Graefe  method to determine 
accuracy, test-retest variabili ty, and robust ness of the prototype (op timized in objective 1) to 
accurately measure strabismu s. 
 
3) Determine the best methods  for tele-strabismus co nsultat ion and rapid  delivery of prism 
treatment, develop a user interfac e, and determine the perceived value. 
 
 
 
HYPOTHES ES: 
 
For strabis mus ranging from  1 to 30 prism diopters (target  range),  the optimized versi on of the app 
will provide  measurements which  are not  signi ficantly  different  from  the ground  truth (simul ated 
strabismus) or clinical  tests of eye alignmen t.

STUDY PROCE DURES 
 
Using  a conven tional  smartphone  with a high resolution rear camera  and flash (for 
example, Samsung  Galaxy S4 and above;  Samsung, Seoul,  South  Kore a, and iPhone  5 and above; 
Apple,  Cupert ino, CA), the EyeTurn  app automatically  detects the difference  in corneal  reflec tion 
posit ion relative to the eye center (based  on fitting a curve to the limbus  bounda ry) to  calculate 
ocular misalignm ent, and prov ide an objective measure of eye deviat ion from  the captured image  
of the patient’s eyes (Fig 1). The captured ima ges are processed entirely with in the smartphone 
using  custom image process ing algori thms, and the eye deviat ion measurements  are disp layed on 
the screen usually within  a couple of second s. We use iris center (center of the eye, or the center 
defined by [CONTACT_276291]) instead of pupil  center as the reference for computing the  corneal 
reflection decentration,  as it has b een reported to be a mo re robust r eference for measuring ocular 
alignment, especially when  computi ng binocular  differen ces (Barry JC, Backes  A 1997). Also,  for 
darker iris colors, the limbus  bounda ry is better-delineated  than the pupil bounda ry in visible 
spectrum images  captur ed by a typi[INVESTIGATOR_276283].  The corneal reflect ion decentration 
distance is conve rted to prism diopters (D) using  an HR in the range of previous ly reported values 
(Jagini,  2014). 
 
 
 
Figure :1 The EyeTurn app for measurement of eye deviations.  (Left)  Features detected by [CONTACT_276292]: 
limbus  boundary  deno ted by a green circle, its center denoted by a green cross, and the  corneal reflection due to the flash denoted 
by a red dot. The distance between the eye center  and cor neal reflection, sho wn as ‘d’, is  compared between  the two eyes to detect 
eye deviation.  (Righ t) To measure  the eye alignment using  a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], the phone  is held [ADDRESS_337255].  In clinic, measurement  under dissociated  conditions is done  by [CONTACT_276293]–uncover  or alternate- cover tests with prisms (CTP N). One key feature of  the app is 
the ability to measure eye deviat ions under  dissoci ated conditions without the need for prism 
neutralization. In this operational  mode, the examiner  presses a button to record  a video,  while  the 
patient fixates on a target binocul arly. The patient’s binocular  fusion  is broken  in the traditional 
mann er by [CONTACT_276294]–uncover (of  one eye) or alternate cover  (involving both eyes). The 
examiner ultimately uncovers one eye, and the app records this entire event as a video sequence 
(Fig.  2). The user is prompted with audio  tones  to assist in the timing of the cove r– uncove r. The 
video  frame just after uncove ring an eye can be selected for processing  the maximum  dissociated 
eye devia tion. Due to the high framera te of video capture (30 Hz), we can measure the deviat ion 
before a recovery vergence eye movement can be initiated. Figure  2b shows an example of the eye 
move ment trace  obtained  when  perform ing the  alternate cover test, with a smartphone recording 
the video of this event. 
 
 
 
Figure  2. Cover  testing mode for dissoc iated measureme nts using the app. (Top row)  Alterna ting cover–unco ver test using  the 
video-based co ver test mode. This novel operational mode  can be used for dissoc iated measurements.  The examiner alternately 
covers the eyes (first  two images on top row).  The frame  with both eyes unco vered (th ird image on the top row)  is selected for 
automatic processing by [CONTACT_276295]. (Bottom row) Eye movem ent trace after offline processing 
of the video of the alternate cover test shows the movements of the eyes after the cover is removed. Negat ive values show  temporal 
deviation (o utward),  whereas positive values show  nasal  deviation (inward). T here is a brief duration after removing the  cover 
during  which  the deviation can be measured  (highlight ed by [CONTACT_276296]). It should  be noted that the eye movement trace  in 
this figure was generated by [CONTACT_276297] a desktop  computer using  the same image 
processing  software  used in the app, but may be included as  part of the app in the future.  Permission to publish photogr aph was 
obtained via a signed  conse nt to publish  document.  
 
Ground truth  study:  
The subjects will sequentially fixate on the targets of known  eccentricity placed on the 
rear surface of the smartphone along  the horizontal direction  with their head  stabilized in a chin 
forehead rest (Fig.  3). The app does not need  to be used in this mann er in actual practice; however, 
for the purpose of establishing  the true deviat ion values for the fixation targe ts, such a controlled 
setup was necessary. The test setup covered an angular  range  of +13 degree (approxi mately +23D 
with respect  to a central fixation  corresponding  to camera lens).

the rear side of a smar tphone placed at a distance of 30 cm with their head resting on a chin–head rest. Twel ve of the [ADDRESS_337256]  to the central fixation point were computed (angular range covered by [CONTACT_276298] 6138  or 623D) and compared to measurements  with the app. 
 
 
Clinical  study: 
In a second  study,  dissociated phoria measure ments w ith the app will be compared  to 
the Modified  Thor ington (MT)  test. Subje cts will rest their head in a chin–head  rest and the phone 
will be mounted 40  cm from the eyes. A 20/[ADDRESS_337257] (at 40 cm ).

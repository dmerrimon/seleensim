ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
IND Number  N/A  
Number of Trial Patients  [ADDRESS_1093541] been gradual and the overall 
case fatality rate remains greater than 80%. Most US patients are 
diagno sed with locally advanced or advanced disease with an 
estimated more than 40,[ADDRESS_1093542] in that they can be treated 
with curative intent although only approximately 25% will be 
cured by [CONTACT_793154] .  Their generally better 
health compared to patients with metastatic NSCLC  makes these 
patients ideal candidates for an immunologic approach. The 
combination of checkpoint inhibition to counter tumor related 
immunosuppress ion along with standard chemoradiotherapy that 
depletes  T-regulatory cells might create immunologic “space” to 
facilitate clonal expansion of effector T -cells in an environment 
that has potentially improved tumor immunogenicity by [CONTACT_793155]-L1. Further, both chemotherapy and radiation may expose 
otherwise hidden antigens that can present additional targets to the reconstitut ing immune system .  
 
Immunotherapy has come to the forefront of promising new 
modalities of care over the past few years. Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_793127] 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093543] reported response rates in the 20% range overall  
but with response 
durations that can be significantly longer than would be expected 
with chemotherapy. Many studies suggest that response correlates  
with degree of PD -L1 expression, but optimal biomarkers are not 
yet known and some  non- expressers have responded well . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_793128], the checkpoint inhibition strategy  is 
promising and is particularly attractive in patients with the 
possibility of cure such as those with stage III NSCLC  in whom 
reversal of cancer mediated immunosuppression might reasonably 
be hoped to improve long- term survival  rates . 
 
An estimated 30 -50% of late -stage NSCLC patients may express 
PD-L1. Preclinical data suggest that an even higher percentage of 
tumors from stage III patients are PD -L1 positive (Genentech 
personal communication) , hence these patients are likely to be the 
best candidates for neoadjuvant  trials of checkpoint inhibition. 
This trial is intended to lead directly into a phase III trial of 
neoadjuvant atezolizumab followed by [CONTACT_793156]/immunotherapy compared to 
chemoradiotherapy followed by [CONTACT_793157]. 
 
                                                                                                     
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093544] of radiotherapy is, in part, 
immune mediated and that T cells are required for regression of 
distant metastases after radiotherapy.  Lee and Weich selbaum 
demonstrated that CD-8+ T cells are required for distant 
radiotherapy effects.  Radiation therapy (RT)  can increase tumor 
expression of PD -L1, and combined RT plus PD -1-pathway 
targeting results in synergistic decrease in  suppressor T -cells, 
thereb y promoting anti -tumor immunity.  These pre -clinical data 
combined with recent case reports of immune checkpoint inhibitor 
mediated abscopal effects provide support  for a trial combining  
anti-PD-L1 therapy with atezolizumab before and after  definitive 
chem oradiotherapy. 
 
Primary Objective  Determine the disease control rate ( DCR ) of neoadjuvant 
atezo lizumab  therapy in the study population. 
 
The goal of the primary objective of the phase II trial is to 
determine whether neoadjuvant anti -PDL -[ADDRESS_1093545] the disease control rate (DCR), i.e., 
the rate of complete/partial response  and stable disease, in 
response to neoadjuvant atezolizumab . If the disease control rate 
after neoadjuvant therapy is high , and in the absence of clinically 
significant toxicity, further study of this approach in locally 
advanced NSCLC will be merited.  
 
Secondary Objectives  Determine progression -free survival ( PFS) after neoadjuvant 
atezolizumab therapy followed by [CONTACT_793158] , 
consolidation and adjuvant atezolizumab in the study population. 
 
Evaluate safety of neoadjuvant atezo lizumab  therapy combined 
with standard chemoradiotherapy followed by [CONTACT_793159] . 
 
Determine response rates (RR) to neoadjuvant atezolizumab  and 
to the overall treatment regimen . 
 
Determine overall survival ( OS) at 12 and 18 months.  
 
Translational Science Objectives  
 Principal:  Define  the role of PD -L1 biomarker testing in selecting 
the population most likely to respond to neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
immunotherapy together with standard chemoradiotherapy. 
 
Additional: Study the association of biomarkers, including 
immunologic signatures , and outcome s. Analyses may include ,

but are not limited to , multipanel immunohistochemistry , gene 
expression profiling by [CONTACT_315647], RNAseq or RT -PCR, whole 
exome and T cell receptor sequencing , cytokine/chemokine 
analysis, flow cytometry, and T cell function analysis . Specimens 
will include  blood, serum , whole blood/plasma for additional 
evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) , and FFPE tissue .  
Other Correlative Sciences 
Objectives  Quality of life endpoints will be assessed  during induction  
atezolizumab , during chemoradiotherapy, and during adjuvant 
atezo lizumab  at 3 month intervals  and will be  measured by [CONTACT_120372]-30. 
 
Trial Design and Schema  Induction immunotherapy : atezolizumab 1200 mg IV q 21 days x 
4 cycles. 
Restaging after cycle 2  and cycle 4  induction: p atients with 
progression of disease ( PD) at the post -cycle 2 assessment  will 
stop atezolizumab and go immediately to chemo radiotherapy if 
still stage III  and eligible for curative intent therapy.  Subjects may 
remain on study despi[INVESTIGATOR_793129] 2 induction  if, in the 
investigator’s view, the s ubject may benefit clinically . 
Chemoradiotherapy: carboplatin AUC = 2 + paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 
IV weekly x 6 weeks concurrent with radiation to a total dose of 
60 Gy given in 2 Gy fractions daily M -F x 30 fractions 
Consolidation chemotherapy: Carboplatin AUC = 6 + paclitaxel 
200 mg/m2 IV q 21 days x 2 cycles beginning 3 -5 weeks after 
completion of radiation .  
Adjuvant immunotherapy : atezo lizumab  1200 mg IV q 21 days to 
complete one year of therapy  (from start of induction) .   
If, as anticipated, this study leads into a phase III trial, the 
comparator arm will be standard chemo radiotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_179475].  
 Study Design: 
This phase II trial will combine neoadjuvant immunotherapy with 
atezolizumab q [ADDRESS_1093546] 
chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for good PS patients with unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC . Because of the consequences 
of progression in this curative -
intent population, restaging CT 
scans will be obtained after the first 2 cy cles of neoadjuvant 
therapy. Real-time monitoring will be used to provide reassurance 
that there is not an unacceptable rate of early PD in PD -L1 
negative patients. Non -progressing patients will complete a total 
of one year of anti -PD-L1 therapy with an interruption during 
chemoradiotherapy.  
 
Assumptions include :  
• DCR of at least 70% with  neoadjuvant immunotherapy,  
• That 85% of the study population will complete radiation,

• That 60% of the study population will complete the entire 
treatment course including consolidation chemotherapy 
and adjuvant immunotherapy with atezolizumab .  
 
If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_793130], a randomized 
phase III trial is planned in which patients will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_1093547] c hemoradiotherapy  and adjuvant immunotherapy .  
 
A key component of the successful completion of this study will 
be quality assurance of the radiotherapy delivery.  Augmentation 
of the immune system by [CONTACT_793160] , cardiac and esophageal 
toxicity .  Data  on the use of PD -1/PD -L1 pathway agents in 
sequence with radiotherapy  are limited.   Out of 129 patient s with 
NSCLC on a phase I trial for the PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab, 75 
(58%) had previously received RT  although the site of RT, dosing 
parameters and timing are not known.  O ut of the 129 NSCLC 
cases, there were 9 cases of pneumonitis (7.0%) and 3 cases of 
grade 3 -4 pneumonitis (2.3%) . There is some suggestion  from 
early trials that the risk of pneumonitis may be less with 
atezo lizumab  than previously seen with nivolumab.  R ecent trials 
of the anti -PD-L1 BMS agent [ADDRESS_1093548] meet the following criteria for study entry:

PI [INVESTIGATOR_793134] 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093560] been gradual and the overall case 
fatality rate remains greater than 80%. Most US patients are diagno sed with locally advanced or 
advanced disease with an estimated more than 40,[ADDRESS_1093561] in that they can be treated with curative intent although only 
approximately 25% will be cured by [CONTACT_793161]. Their generally better health 
compared to patients with metastatic NSCLC lends this population to an immunologic approach. The combination of immune regulation with checkpoint inhibition  plus standard treatments that 
deplete T-regulatory cells (radiation and chemotherapy) may create immunologic “space” to 
facilitate clonal expansion of effector T -cells. Further, both chemotherapy and radiation may expose 
otherwise hidden antigens that can present additional targets to the re constituting  immune system  
after chemoradiotherapy.  
 
Immunotherapy has come to the forefront of promising new modalities of care over the past few 
years. Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_793135].  Similar strategies have shown promise in advanced NSCLC and checkpoint 
inhibitors targeting PD -[ADDRESS_1093562] line for stage IV 
                                                                                                     
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093563] shown response rates in the 20 -30% range but with response durations that can be 
significantly longer than would be expected with chemotherapy.  Most studies suggest that response is correlated with degree of PD -L1 expression, but the optimal biomarkers are not known and a few 
non-expressers have responded well. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_793136], the approach is promising 
and is particularly attractive in patients with the possibility of cure such as those with stage III NSCLC.  
 
An estimated 30 -50% of late -stage NSCLC patients may express PD -L1. Preclinical data suggest 
that an even higher percentage of tumors from stage III patients are PD -L1 positive (Genentech 
personal communication) hence these patients are likely to be the best candidates for initial trials of checkpoint inhibition. This trial is intended to lead dir ectly into a phase III trial of the combined 
chemoradiotherapy/immunotherapy approach compared to standard chemoradiotherapy. 
 
Radiotherapy can affect the host immune response and impact tumor control and spread.  In preclinical studies, Formenti and colleagues demonstrated that the abscopal effect of radiotherapy is, in part, immune mediated and that T cells are required for regression of distant metastases after 
radiotherapy.  Lee and Weichselbaum demonstrated that CD -8+ T cells are required for distant 
radiotherapy effects.  R adiation therapy  can increase tumor expression of PD -L1, and combined RT 
plus PD -1-pathway targeting results in synergistic reduction of suppressor T -cells, thereby 
[CONTACT_510635] -tumor immunity.  These pre -clinical data combined wit h recent case reports of 
immune checkpoint inhibitor mediated abscopal effects form the basis for studying anti -PD-L1 
therapy with atezo lizumab  in sequence with definitive chemoradiotherapy.  
 
1.2. Study Drug Mechanism of Action  
Atezolizumab  is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy 
chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214  amino  acids) and is produced in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells.  Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc- effector function via a  single  amino acid 
substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a non-glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc- effector function at 
expected concentrations in humans.  Atezolizumab  targets human programmed death- ligand 1 (PD -
L1) and inhibits its interaction with its receptor, programmed death -1 (PD -1).  Atezolizumab  also 
blocks binding of PD -L1 to B7.1, an interaction that is reported to provide additional inhibitory 
signals to T  cells.  
 
Atezolizumab  (Tecentriq
TM) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC)  and for second line treatment of advanced NSCLC . 
Atezolizumab  is being investigated in a wide spectrum of  solid tumors  and hematologic 
malignancies in humans, please see IB or drug label for approved indications. 
 
1.3. Preclinical Data

The nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab  program was to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo 
activity, to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, to demonstrate an acceptable safety 
profile, and to identify a Phase I starting dose.  Comprehensive pharmacology, PK, and toxicology 
evaluations were thus undertaken with a tezolizumab . 
 
The safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of a tezolizumab  were investigated in mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and to aid in projecting the 
appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of a tezolizumab  for cynomolgus 
monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the primary and relevant 
nonclinical model for understanding the safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of 
atezolizumab .  
 
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for a tezolizumab  supported 
entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the proposed Phase I 
starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were consistent with the anticipated 
pharmacologic activity of down- modulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_1093564] and supported entry into 
clinical trials in patients.  
 
Refer to the a tezolizumab  Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.   
 
1.4. Clinical Ph armacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
On the basis of available  preliminary  PK data  (0.03−20 mg/kg), atezolizumab appeared  to show 
linear pharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg.  For the 1- mg/kg and 20-mg/kg dose groups, the mean 
clearance (CL) and the mean volume at steady state (V ss) had a range of 3.20 −4.43 mL/kg and 
48.1− 64.1 mL/kg, respectively, which is consistent with the expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in 
humans. 
 
The development of ATAs has been observed in patients in all dose cohorts and was associated with 
changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  The development of detectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses 
from 10− 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10 -, 15-, and 20- mg/kg dose levels have maintained the 
expected target trough levels of drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_33384].  To date, no clear relationship 
between detection of ATAs and AEs or IRRs has been observed.

Phase II Study GO29293  
Ongoing Study GO29293 is a single- arm, open label, Phase II study to assess the clinical 
benefit of a tezolizumab  as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UBC.  
The co -primary endpoints of this study are independent review facility (IRF) −assessed 
objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and investigator -assessed ORR according to modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.  
 
Phase III Study GO28915 (OAK)  
Study GO28915OAK was a randomized, Phase III, open -label study assessing the clinical 
benefit of atezolizumab as a single agent versus docetaxel in PD -L1-unselected patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has progressed during or following treatment wit h 
a platinum-containing regimen     
At the primary analysis, there were 850 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT 
population), 425 in the docetaxel arm and 425 in the atezolizumab arm.  Median OS 
in the ITT population was 13.8 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.6 months for 
docetaxel (HR of 0.73; 95% CI:  0.62, 0.87, p=0.0003). OS benefit was seen regardless of 
PD-L1 expression (HR 0.75 in <1% PD- L1 expression population; 0.41 in ≥50% TC or 
≥10% IC expression population) and was consistent across subgroups, including histology 
(HR 0.73 for both), patients with asymptomatic CNS mets (HR 0.54) and never smokers 
(HR 0.71). Atezolizumab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to 
docetaxel. No new safety signals were identified. The rate of imm une-mediated AEs was 
low (Barlesi et al. 2016) . 
1.5.2.    Clinical Activity  
 
Single -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer in Study 
PCD4989g  
Study PCD4989g is a Phase Ia dose escalation and expansion study, in which atezolizumab is bein g used as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
or hematologic malignancies, and provides significant data (with  629  safety -evaluable 
patients across all cancer types as of the data cutoff date of 15  December 2015 ) for the 
safety profile of atezolizumab as monotherapy. 
Currently, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD), no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs), and no 
clear dose- related trends in the incidence of adverse events have been determined.  
The safety profile of atezolizumab  as a single agent is observed to be consistent across 
different indications, including small- cell lung cancer, NSCLC, urothelial bladder cancer 
(UBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, head and 
neck cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma. 
Of the 629 patients across all cancer types in Study PCD4989g, 619 patients ( 98.4 %) 
experienced at least one adverse event, including 444 patients ( 70.6 %) who experienced 
one treatment- related adverse event.  Commonly reported events (reported in  ≥ 10% of all 
patients) included fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, constipation, dyspnea, 
pyrexia, and cough.

A total of 89 safety- evaluable patients with NSCLC received atezolizumab in 
Study  PCD4989g.  A total of 88 patients (98.9%) experienced at least one adverse 
event, including 67 patients (75.3%) with treatment -related adverse events, 35 
(39.3%) patients with Grade 3− 4 adverse events, 36 patients (40.4%) with serious 
adverse events, 5  patients (5.6%) who discontinued study drug due to an adverse 
event, and 1  death (1.1%).  
The safety profile of the NSCLC cohort was consistent with the overall safety profile 
of all safety -evaluable patients in Study PCD4989g, as well as with the 
safety -evaluable patients with NSCLC who received atezolizumab monotherapy in 
other studies.  
Analyses of tumor -infiltrating immune cells for PD -L1 expression on baseline tumor tissue 
have been performed for Study PCD4989g.  Preliminary results from Study  PCD4989g 
suggest that PD -L1 expression in tum or-infiltrating immune cells is likely to be associated 
with response to atezolizumab . 
 Efficacy in NSCLC Patients  
The POPLAR trial is a randomized, phase II comparison between standard second line docetaxel and atezolizumab in good performance status patients with NSCLC that had 
progressed after a platinum based chemotherapy regimen (. The study screened over [ADDRESS_1093567] 2013 and March 2014. Patients 
had normal organ function and measurable disease and were stratified by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 stat us, tumor 
infiltrating immune cells as well as by [CONTACT_793162]. The primary study endpoint was overall survival in the ITT population and the PD -L1 prespecified subgroups.  
Survival was similar to  docetaxel in patients lacking PD -L1 expression and improved with 
atezolizumab in both responders and non-responders.  
Overall survival of the participants in the POPLAR study was 12.6 months (95% CI 9.7 – 
16.4) for atezolizumab and 9.7 months (95% CI 8.6 – 12.0) for docetaxel (HR 0.73, p= 0.04). 
Survival improvement with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel was associated with the 
degree of PD -L1 expression. 
Atezolizumab was well tolerated. 11 (8%) patients discontinued treatment due to AEs 
compared to 30 (22%) for docetaxel. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab arm had grade 
3/4 AEs compared to 52 (39%) for docetaxel. There was one treatment related death in the 
atezolizumab group and 3 in the docetaxel group.iv

1.6. Clinical Safety  
 
The presented safety data for a tezolizumab  have been derived mainly from the treatment of patients 
in Phase Ia Study PCD4989g.  As of 10 May 2014, a tezolizumab  has been administered to 
approximately 775 patients with solid and hematologic malignancies.  No dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) have been observed at any dose level, and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 
established.  Fatigue was the most frequently reported adverse event (AE).

Adverse Events  
The following safety data are from PCD4989g, in which a tezoliz umab  is being used as single- agent 
therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.  
In 412 treated patients, 97.1% reported an AE while on study .  Of these AEs, 48.8% were Grade 1 
or 2 in maximum severity on the basis of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  The most frequently observed AEs (occurring 
in ≥ 10% of treated patients) included fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, pyrexia, dyspnea, 
diarrhea, constipation, cough, headache, back pain, vomiting, anemia, arthralgia, rash, insomnia, 
asthenia, abdominal pain, chills, pruritus, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].   
 
Grade  ≥ 3 AEs were reported by 199 of 412 patients (48.3%). There were 51 patients (12.4%) who 
reported Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1093568] 
frequently reported related Grade ≥ 3 AEs included fatigue (5 patients  [1.2%]), increased ALT and 
increased AST (each reported in 4 patients [1.0%]); and asthenia, autoimmune hepatitis, and hypoxia (each reported in 3 patients [0.7%]).  
 
Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab , events associated with inflammation and/or 
immune- mediated AEs have been closely monitored during the atezolizumab  clinical program.  
These include potential dermatologic, hepatic, endocrine, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] e vents as well as events of 
hepatitis/elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and influenza -like illness.  Expected adverse drug 
reactions associated with atezolizumab  include the following:  hepatitis/transaminitis, 
hypothyroidism, infusion- related reactions (IRRs), pneumonitis, influenza -like illness, and 
dermatologic reactions.  Potential adverse drug reactions include the following:  anti -therapeutic 
antibodies (ATAs), colitis, endocrine disorders, hypersensitivity, neurologic disorders, and 
pericardial eff usion.

1.7. Study Design Rationale and Significance  
 
1.7.1.    Study Design 
 
This phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_793137]  q [ADDRESS_1093569] chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for good PS patients with unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Because of the consequences of progres sion in this 
curative -intent population, restaging CT scans will be carried out after the first [ADDRESS_1093570] 70% to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, that 85% of the 
study population will complete radiation, and that 60% of the study population will complete 
the entire treatment course including consolidation chemotherapy and adjuvant 
immunotherapy with atezolizumab . If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_793130], a 
randomized phase III trial is planned in which patients will be randomized 2:1 to  induction 
                                                                                                     
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093571] conventional chemoradiotherapy  followed by [CONTACT_179475].  
 
A key component of the successful completion of this study will be quality assurance of the 
radiotherapy delivery.  Augmentation of the immune system by [CONTACT_793163].  To date, there are limited data on the use of 
PD-1/PD -L1 pathway agents in sequence with radiotherapy.  Out of 129 patients with NSCLC 
on a phase I, dose -escalation, cohort expansion trial for the PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab, 75 
(58%) had previously received RT.  Without knowing the precise details of radiotherapy 
treatment, out of the 129 NSCLC cases, there were 9 cases of pneumonitis (7.0%) and 3 cases 
of grade 3- 4 pneumonitis (2.3%), suggesting that the incidence of radiation mediated toxicity 
was not increased by [CONTACT_793164].  There is some suggestion that 
the risk of pneumonitis  will be less with atezo lizumab  than previously seen with nivolumab.  
Recent trials of the anti -PD-L1 BMS agent [ADDRESS_1093572] been gradual and the overall case fatality rate remains greater than 80%. Most US p atients are diagnosed with locally 
advanced or advanced disease with an estimated more than 40,[ADDRESS_1093573]  in that they can be treated with curative 
intent with  chemoradiotherapy although only approximately 25% will be cured. Their 
generally better health compared to patients with metastatic NSCLC lends this population to an immunologic approach. The combination of checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy with 
standard treatments that deplete T -regulatory cells (radiation and chemotherapy) may create 
immunologic “space” to facilitate clonal expansion of effector T -cells. Further, both 
chemotherapy and radiation may expose otherwise hidden antigens that can present additional targets to the recovering immune system.  
 PD-1 is a T -cell co -receptor found on activated T -cells. Some tumors, including a substantial 
minority of NSCLC, seem to be able to exploit this receptor through expression of the inhibitory PD -L1 ligands whose interaction with PD -1 can suppress the antitumor immune 
response. Expression of PD -L1 within lung cancers is thought to contribute to activated T -
cell down- regulation and to the immunosuppressed state of lung cancer patients. Initial trials 
in advanced lung cancer patients report  response rates in th e 20- 30% range but with response 
durations that can be significantly longer than would be expected with chemotherapy.  Most studies suggest that response correlates with the degree of PDL1 expression, but the optimal 
biomarkers are not known and a few non- expressers have responded well. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_793138] 8/19/2019  Version  4.0 
 
Page 30 of 104 
 
uncertainties, the approach is promising and is particularly attractive in patients with the 
possibility of long term survival  such as those with stage III NSCLC  in whom the curative 
fraction may be incr eased by [CONTACT_87069] . 
 
An estimated 30 -50% of late -stage NSCLC patients may express PD -L1. Preclinical data 
suggest that an even higher percentage of tumors from stage III patients are PD -L1 positive 
(Genentech personal communication) hence these patients are likely to be the best candidates 
for induction trials of checkpoint inhibition. This trial is intended to lead directly into a phase 
III trial of combined chemoradiotherapy/immunotherapy compared to standard chemoradiotherapy. 
 
1.7.3.    Trial Significance  
 
Patients with stage III lung adenocarcinoma are treated with chemoradiotherapy with curative 
intent, but the vast majority of patients will relapse and die of disease. This patient population 
is healthier and more likely to have an intact immune system than patients with more 
advanced disease and with heavy cytotoxic pretreatment. The opportunity to add immune 
modulation with checkpoint inhibitors neoadjuvantly and adjuvantly in this patient population would be expected to improve overall survival significantly and may increase the proportion 
of patients who can be cured. 
 
1.7.4.    Rationale for Dose Selection and Duration of Treatment 
 
Chemoradiotherapy will be the Alliance standard carboplatin + paclitaxel concurrent with RT 
as most recently used in the [ADDRESS_1093574] survival statistics to date with a  weekly low dose  carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy backbone 
and a radiation dose of 60 Gy. The duration of atezolizumab therapy of one year with an 
interruption during chemoradiotherapy is based on previous trials with the agent. 
 
1.7.5.    Rationale for Endpoints 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  - Induction immunotherapy may not produce early tumor shrinkage so the 
traditional tumor response measurement method, such as RECIST, may not accurately capture the immunotherapy efficacy. In this trial, we elected  to use disease control rate as 
the primary endpoint, rather than response rate (CR+PR) defined in RECIST 1.1. The 
decision was intended to better capture the immunotherapy effect among those patients who 
may respond to immunotherapy without early tumor shrinkage.
vii  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary - The secondary endpoints of PFS, OS, RR and safety are standard. The 
proportion of patients completing induction chemoradiation and consolidation chemotherapy 
is of particular importance in a stage III NSCLC population. - The denominator will be the 
total n umber of patients who register to the trial and start the induction immunotherapy. The 
numerator will be the number of the patients who complete induction immunotherapy, 
chemoradiation therapy and consolidation chemotherapy.  These data are vital to compare the 
study therapy with recent multimodality trials in stage III NSCLC patients without the immunotherapy component. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Translational Research . The primary correlative analysis for this trial will be the 
correlation o f PD-L1 expression in tumor specimens with changes in immune system

the study for additional detail. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Correlative biomarkers 
Please refer to specimen management manual for additional information  and to Appendix 
11 for correlative science objectives.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient reported outcomes/QoL  
Questionnaires will be collected at the following time points: on Cycle 1 Day One of Induction Therapy, Day 1 of Concurrent Therapy, Cycle 1 Day of Consolidation Therapy 
and at 3 month intervals throughout a djuvant therapy
.   The EORTC QLQ- C30 is a well -
validated cancer -specific measure 73. It is comprised of six functional scales (physical, role, 
emotional, cognitive, social, and global health status/quality of life); three symptom scales 
(fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and six single items (appetite loss, constipation, 
diarrhea, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, and economic consequences of the disease and 
treatment).  Functional and symptom scales/items are combined into a newly developed 
single health -related QOL (HRQL) summary measure. The summary score and all scales 
and single item s range from 0 -100. A high score for the summary measure and all 
functional scales indicates a high/better level of QOL or functioning, whereas a high score 
on a symptom scale/item represents a higher level of symptoms/problems.  
 2. Objectives  
 
2.1. Primary Object ive  
 The primary objective of this single arm phase II trial is to determine wheth er neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant  anti-PD-L1 therapy bracketing  standard chemoradiation therapy and consolidation therapy 
is worthy of further investigation in NSCLC  patients tre ated with curative intent for stage IIIA and 
IIIB disease (AJCC 7
th edition) . The primary endpoint will be the disease control rate (DCR) after 
12 weeks in duction immunotherapy.  
 2.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary endpoints include  objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS)  and the proportion of patients who complete induction immunotherapy , chemoradiation 
therapy and consolidation chemotherapy . Toxicity including immune related adverse events will be 
assessed  for all patients receiving any study therapy.  
 
2.3. Translational Science Principal Objective 
 
Assess the utility of PD -L1 as a biomarker for DCR, ORR, PFS, OS in the study population. 
 
2.4. Translational Science Additional Objectives 
 
Study the association of biomarkers, including immunologic signatures , and clinical outcomes . 
Analyses may include, but are not limited to, multipanel immunohistochemistry , gene expression 
profiling by [CONTACT_315647], RNAseq or RT -PCR, whole exome and T cell receptor sequencing, 
cytokine/chemokine analysis, flow cytometry, and T cell function . Specimens will include  blood and 
FFPE tissue. Time -points are: at baseline, after atezolizumab induction, after chemoradiotherapy ,

during adjuvant atezolizumab monotherapy, at treatment completion, and during follow -up. Please 
see appendix 11 for detailed correlative science description and procedures. 
 
2.5. Other Correlative Science Objectives  
Quality of life endpoints will be measured by [CONTACT_20368] -30 assessed during induction, during 
chemoradiotherapy, during adjuvant atezolizumab  at 3 month intervals. 
 
2.6. Study Design  
 
Single arm phase II trial of  induction immunotherapy with anti -PD-L1 for patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC and PS 0 -1. 
 
The phase II trial will register a total 63 patients. Assuming 5% ineligibility and cancelation , [ADDRESS_1093575] one cycle of the experimental agent. PD -L1 status 
will be determined by [CONTACT_793165]  (TC/IC) . Of [ADDRESS_1093576] approximately 40 and 20 
patients are PD -L1 positive (≥1% expression in tumor cells or tumor -infiltrating immune cells ) and 
PD-L1 negative (otherwise), respectively.  The DCR in PD- L1 negative patients in particular is a 
topic of great intere st and will be assessed in real time by [CONTACT_793166]. 
 
2.7. Sample Size  
 
The disease control rate (DCR) is assumed the same for PD -L1 positives and negatives. With 60 
eligible and treated  patients, the study has approximately 90% power to detect H0: P</=0.50  versus 
H1: P>/= 0. 67, where p is the disease control rate (DCR) after [ADDRESS_1093577] at a significance level of 0.10. In particular, i f 35 or fewer 
of these patients remain disease controlled, it will be concluded that the treatment regimen is not 
worthy of further investigation. Otherwise, it will be concluded that the treatment regimen has 
sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation. Under the design, t he probability of erroneously 
concluding that the treatment regimen is worthy of further investigation when the DCR  is truly 
50% or less is 0.0775. The probability of erroneously concluding that the treatment regimen is NOT 
worthy of further investigation when the true DCR is  67% or greater is 0.0999. 
 
2.8. Accrual Rate and Accrual Duration 
 
A total of [ADDRESS_1093578] 20 treated patients experience grade 4/5 non- hematologic adverse events 
that are probably, possibly, or definite ly related to study treatment s, OR if the rate of treatment -
                                                                                                     
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093579] 20 patients at any time, accrual to 
the study will be suspended to allow for investigation. I f the true rate of grade 4/5 non -hema tolog ic 
AEs is 10%, 20%, 30%, 33%, 40%, 50%, the corresponding probability of accrual suspension is 
0.043, 0.370, 0.762, 0.848, 0.949, 0.994, respectively. T he safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_793139], e.g. >84.8% if the true SAE is ≥ 30%.  After consideration by [CONTACT_3476], a 
decision will be made as to whether accrual can be resumed, potentially with modifications to entry 
criteria and/or study conduct. 
 
2.11. Analytic Methods  
 
The analysis cohort will be the patients who meet eligibility criteria and receive at least one cycle of the experimental agent.  
 
The primary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR), which is defined as the proportion of patients who 
reach complete/partial response and sta ble disease after [ADDRESS_1093580] will be used for testing. The 90% exact confidence interval for DCR will 
be provided.    
For the analysis of secondary endpoints, the primary analysis cohort will be used. Objective response 
rate (ORR) is the rate of best overall response (complete or partial response) after 12 weeks of 
neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy. ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated.  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start of neoadjuvant therapy to disease 
progression or recurrence (first disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first). The Kaplan -Meier 
estimator will be used to estimate median PFS, PFS at 12 months, a nd their  confidence interval s. 
Similar analys is will be conducted to estimate median o verall survival (OS)  and OS  at 12 and 18 
months.  The frequencies of metastases by [CONTACT_665506] .  
 The proportion of patients who complete induction immunothera py, chemoradiation therapy and 
consolidation chemotherapy will be estimated. Its 95% confidence interval will be provided .  
 
Overall treatment -related adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_793167] ( Induction 
immunotherapy, Chemoradiother apy, Consolidation chemotherapy, Adjuvant immunotherapy ), type 
and grade for all patients who received at least one cycle of atezolizumab therapy.  
 
Blood based biomarkers will be evaluated before and after the protocol treatment . The association of 
the baseline value and the changes of these biomarkers with clinical outcomes, such as objective response, overall survival and progression free survival, will be evaluated using logistic regression and 
Cox models.  
 QoL will be measur ed by [CONTACT_20368]-30. The QoL scores, including mean, standard 
deviation, range, for each scale will be summarized at the following time points: induction at 6 & 12 weeks, chemoradiotherapy at completion of concurrent phase + after consolidation, during 
adjuvant at ezolizumab at [ADDRESS_1093581] meet the following criteria for study entry:

4. Patient Enrollment  
 
4.1. Site Enrollment Requirements  
  
Site must submit all required essential documents including:  
• IRB/Regulatory Approval  
• Investigator 1572(s) 
• Institutional informed consent form  
• Following regulatory and ethical approval for each participating site, it is the responsibilit y 
of the Sponsor to formally activate sites according to local obligations. Sites will only be 
able to enroll patients once formal site activation has been perfor med by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
4.2. Patient Enrollment Procedures 
 
Informed consent:  The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and 
willingly consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side -effects, risks, and discomforts. Current human 
protection committee approval of this protocol and a consent form is required  prior to patient consent 
and enrollment. 
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the AFT web -based RAVE EDC (electronic data capture ) 
system.  
 
Patients must be enrolled prior to submission of biospecimens. After written informed consent has 
been obtained, the study site will obtain a unique patient identifier which will stay the same 
throughout the entire study.  Patients enrolled but not treated  for any reason have to be documented 
as a Screening Failure in IRT.  
 
Prior  to accessing AFT EDC , site staff should verify the following:

8. Study Treatment 
 
8.1. Treatment Plan  
 
Protocol treatment is to begin within 21 days of registration. Questions regarding treatment 
should be directed to the ALLIANCE Study Chair.  
 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093603] of induction (neoadjuvant) atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 21 
days for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_793170]. Consolidative chemotherapy will be given for two cycles after the completion of 
concurrent therapy.  Adjuvant atezolizumab will be administered as in the neoadjuvant 
portion of the trial every 21 days to complete a total of one year of therapy.  
 
Concurrent Therapy (1 cycle = 36 days):  
Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy will begin [ADDRESS_1093604] dose of 
induction immunotherapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be started within 1 day 
of each other. 
Patients will receive paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 by [CONTACT_204108] [ADDRESS_1093605] 
premedicat ion followed by [CONTACT_542067] 2 by [CONTACT_204108] 30-60 minutes for 6 weeks (days 
1,8,15,22,29,36). 
 
Consolidation (1 cycle = 21 days): 3 -5 weeks following the end of radiotherapy, patients 
will receive paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 by [CONTACT_204108] 3 hours followed by [CONTACT_542067] 6 by [CONTACT_793171] 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a total of 2 cycles (days 1 and 22).   
8.2. Radiotherapy  
 
All patients will receive a radiotherapy course using single daily fractions of [ADDRESS_1093606] be reviewed by [CONTACT_793172] (QARC) prior to initiating therapy.  NOTE:  Digital submission 
of treatment plans is required on this study. 
 
8.2.1.  Target Volume Definitions  
 
The nomenclature and definitions of ICRU Reports [ADDRESS_1093607] or PET imaging or biopsy proven 
sites.  This will in general include lymph nodes within the mediastinum ≥ 1.0 cm in 
short diameter and/or PET positive lymph nodes. Information from PET imaging 
should be used t o determine occult nodal areas as well as to accurately contour gross 
disease within areas of atelectasis. For areas within or near inflated lung tissue, lung window settings will be utilized for contouring.  For disease within or abutting the mediastinum, soft tissue window settings will be used.  
 
The GTV will be expanded based on motion assessment imaging to account for target 
motion and thus an internal target volume (ITV) will be created.   
 
A 0.5 cm  (CTV) expansion  of the ITV  will be utilized to account for potential occult 
tumor involvement.  This can be edited back from areas were extension cannot occur 
(blood vessels, bone, chest wall, etc. ) unless there is imaging evidence that inclusion 
would be logical.  Elective nodal i rradiation of lymph nodes is not allowed on this 
study.  Only areas of gross disease as determined by [CONTACT_793173].  
 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 49 of 104  
 The C TV will be expanded an additional uniform 5mm minimum to create a planning 
target volume (PTV ) to which the radiotherapy dose will be prescribed.  This can be 
adjusted to no more than 1.[ADDRESS_1093608] a complete response (CR) to induction immunotherapy, the target volume will be modified such that a CTV will be delineated to include the pre -
immunotherapy nodal stations in the hilum and mediastinum and as best as possible, the location of the original primary tumor.  The size of this CTV should take into 
account anatomic ch anges as a result of the response to therapy, i.e. diminishment in 
mediastinal width due to response.  This CTV will be expanded by 5mm to create a 
PTV.  
 
8.2.2.  Treatment Techniques  
 
3D Conformal Planning or IMRT is required on this protocol.  Both planar and non-
coplanar field arrangements are acceptable.  If IMRT is used,  patient specific IMRT 
QA will be required prior to treatment with the IMRT plan.   
• Patient Position  
A custom immobilization cast is encouraged but not required. All components 
of immobilization must, in conjunction with the image guidance being used, 
ensure that both interfraction set -up uncertainty and unaccounted for 
intrafraction motion be limited to less than 5mm (PTV margin).  Patients must be treated in the  supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].   
• Inhibition of effects of internal organ motion:   
Motion management with respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344], active breathing control (ABC), 
or breath hold and monitoring techniques will be encouraged.  IMRT will be 
restricted to patients with less than 1cm of tumor motion on 4D imaging or 
utilizing of gating, ABC, or breath hold methods.  Abdominal compression as a method of minimizing respi[INVESTIGATOR_510615].  The Motion 
Management Reporting Form shall be submitted to document the method used.  
 
• Image Guidance:  
A reliable method of daily image guidance will be utilized.  This can include but is not limited to daily conebeam imaging, fiducial marker tracking systems, 
kV – kV matching.    
8.2.3.  Equipment 
 
• Modality - 3D Conformal or IMRT Radiotherapy  
• Energy  - Megavoltage quality radiation will be used with a nominal energy of 
4-12 MV.  C0- 60 treatment is not allowed on this protocol.  Proton therapy is 
not allowed on this protocol. 
• Geometry  - The distance from the radiation source to the isocenter should not 
be less than 100 cm. 
3.3.1 Target Dose  
• Prescribed Dose:  60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.0 Gy per fraction given once daily. 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 50 of 104  
 • Dose Uniformity:  The prescribed isodose volume will cover at least 95% of the 
PTV. The minimum PTV dose must not fall below 95% of the prescription 
dose. The maximum dose must not exceed a value that is 125% of the prescribed 
dose.  The minimum and maximum doses will be defined as the dose to a 0.1cc volume of the PTV.   
• Acceptable and Unacceptable Vari ations:  Deviations from the above target 
coverage are not desirable, but are acceptable for treatment situations in which 
the target to critical structure geometry is challenging.  Variations Acceptable include: The prescribed dose can cover as little as 9 0% of the PTV.  The 
minimum dose to the PTV can likewise fall to 90% of the prescribed dose.  The maximum dose cannot exceed 130% of the prescribed dose. Unacceptable 
deviations occur if the variation acceptable limits are exceeded. Additionally, a 
deviati on unacceptable is assigned if more than 1 cc of tissue outside the PTV 
receives > 120% of the prescribed dose.  
• Tissue Heterogeneity : All dose calculations will account for the density 
differences within the irradiated volume.   
• Approved Dose Algorithms: Planning must be performed using an approved 
dose calculation algorithm. Approved algorithms include: convolution 
superposition, collapsed cone convolution, and Monte Carlo. Contact [CONTACT_793174].  
• Additionally, the treatment planning system PlanUNC, which uses a 
Clarkson’s- integration with a [ADDRESS_1093609] will allow better distinction between tumor and adjacent 
normal tissue or atelectasis. Axial acquisi tions with gantry 0 degrees will be required 
with spacing ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_1093610] lines, disc, or tape.  
• The additional exception to the use of IV contrast with the CT planning scan will be if the restaging diagnostic CT of the chest at the completion of the 
induction immunotherapy occurs within 10 days (before or after) of the 
planning CT in such a way that it can be timely incorporated into the planning process and that the patient can start on time.  This will minimize the 
possibility of close-proximity contrast injections. 
 
Four- dimensional CT (4D -CT) is permitted and encouraged for the study. There are 
many valid approaches to defining target volumes and margins using multiple datasets representing different phases of the breathing cycle. These include but not 
limited to:  
a. the ITV (Internal Target Volume) concept from ICRU 62 with an appropriate margin accounting for geometric uncertainties (uniform 5 mm  recommended) 
to define the PTV; this method is preferred for purposes of this protocol. 

 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 51 of 104  
 b. the mean target position with an appropriate margin to account for target motion 
and geometric uncertainties to define the PTV;  
c. two helical scans, one scan with the patient at inhale breath -hold and the second 
scan with patient at exhale breath -hold. 
Options B and C have inherently more uncertainty and the PTV margin will be a 
minimum of 7 mm with a maximum of 1 cm based on discretion of treating physician. T he following will be required in terms of documenting target motion: 
1. For particular method of target motion suppression (abdominal compression, breath hold, etc.), keep a tally of target motion range for each patient treated. Describe clearly the method  utilized in the measurement of range of target 
motion and provide estimated error of measurement. Justify the estimation of 
error.  
2. It is preferable to have information on range of motion along each axis of the 
patient’s body (sup- inf, ap- pa, lt -rt). In  case such information is not available, 
provide range of motion in 1 or 2 directions with clear indication of the orientation of the axis along which the motion range is evaluated. 
3. In case of multiple measurements of ranges of motion (at simulations an d/or at 
treatments, possibly pre - and post -treatments) provide information about the 
day and time when the data have been collected.  
4. When data for some patients/treatment fractions is not collected the record of 
the missing measurement has to be kept and reported. If there is a clinical reason 
for not collecting data, it needs to be reported as well. 
5. The reported range of motion has to be separated from setup errors. 
 
A treatment planning FDG PET/CT scan (or FDG -PET alone) with the patient in 
the trea tment position may be utilized to aid in treatment planning.  If no dedicated 
treatment planning PET imaging is available then the staging PET imaging must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_793175].  
 
8.2.5.  Time -dose Considerations 
 
Treatment will be delivered in single daily fractions, 5 fractions per week.   
 
Adjustments for Treatment Interruptions : There are no planned radiotherapy rests. 
Treatment interruptions are strongly discouraged. The Study Chair should be notified 
for treatment interruptions > [ADDRESS_1093611] should be contoured starting at the level of the cricoid cartilage and 
extending to the level of the GE junction. In short, this should include the same 
contouring range as that for the esophagus. 
 
Esophagus  
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093612] (or 
base) for purposes of contouring will begin at the level of the root of the great vessels and extend inferiorly to the apex of the heart.  
 Whole Lung  
Both the right and left lungs should be contoured as one structure. Contouring should 
be carried out using pulmonary windows. All inflated and collapsed lung should be 
contoured; however, gross tumor (GTV) and trachea/ipsilateral bronchus when 
contouring structure should not be included in this structure.  
 
Chest Wall 
Although no specific dose constraints will be used, the dose to the chest wall is of 
interested and will be required.  The chest wall is defined as 3cm thick expansion of 
the lung contour toward the periphery of the patient subtracting the lung and 
mediastinal contents.  
 Bronchial Tree  
The dose to the proximal bronchial tree will not be restr icted but recorded for this 
protocol in order to potentially learn some dose constraint for hypofractionated 
therapy with regard to this organ.  The bronchial tree will be defined as the distal 2 
cm of trachea and include the mainstem bronchi, and lobar br onchi to the level of the 
segmental bronchi.  Please refer to Kong et al IJROBP thoracic contouring atlas for detailed descriptions.
36 
 
8.2.7.  Normal Tissue Sparing  
 
The following dose constraints will be followed:  
Lung  
V20 > 35% will be a minor deviation, V20 > 40 % will be a major deviation.  
Mean Lung Dose will be recorded and in general should be kept below 20 Gy 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 53 of 104  
 although the V20 constraints will be utilized as the dose limitations for 
purposes of this protocol. 
Heart  
The heart will be treated with the following limits: V50 < 25% and mean heart 
dose < [ADDRESS_1093613] 
The maximum cumulative dose to any contiguous volume ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1093614] will be: 50.0 Gy. 
Esophagus 
The esophagus is in general located in close proximity to nodal areas involved 
in stage 3 NSCLC and therefore is challenging to limit the total dose without sacrificing tumor coverage.  In general < 30% of the contoured esophagus 
will be allowed to receive a dose > 55 Gy.  This is also not an absolute 
requirement but maximum dose to a contiguous 5cc of the esophagus will be 
limited to ≤ 105% of the prescription dose when feasible.  
Brachial Plexus 
The maximum cumulative dose to any contiguous volume ≥ 0.03 cc in the brachial plexus will be:  62.1 Gy. 
 
8.2.8.  Quality Assurance Documentation  
 
Digital Submission:  Submission of treatment plans in digital format as 
DICOM RT is required. Digital data must include CT scans, structures, plan and 
dose files. Submission may be either by [CONTACT_793176]. Instructions for data submission are on the QARC web  site at Any items on the list

For further details, see the A tezolizumab  Investigator’s Brochure . 
8.4.3.    Dosage, Administration, and Storage 
 
The dose level of atezolizumab  to be tested in this study is 1200 mg (equivalent to an 
average body weight− based dose of 15 mg/kg) administered by [CONTACT_39623]  3 weeks (21 [ ± 2] days).  Atezolizumab  will be delivered in infusion bags with 
IV infusion lines that have product contact[CONTACT_226837] (PVC) 
or polyolefin and 0.2 µ m in-line filters (filter membrane of polyethersulfone [PES]).  
No incompatibilities have been observed between ATEZOLIZUMAB  and PVC or 
polyolefin infusion mater ials (bags or infusion lines).  
Administration of a tezolizumab  will be performed in a setting with emergency 
medical facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical 
emergencies.  
The initial dose of atezolizumab  will be delivered over 60 ( ± 15) minutes.  If the 
first infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated AEs, the second infusion may 
be delivered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, 
all subsequent infusions may be delivered over  30 (± 10) minutes.  For the first 
infusion, the patient’s vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) should 
be determined within 60 minutes before, during (every 15 [ ± 5] minutes), and 
30 (± 10) minutes after the infusion.  For subsequent infusions, vital signs will be 
collected within [ADDRESS_1093620] dose of atezolizumab .  Premedication 
may be administered for Cycles ≥  2 at the discretion of the treating physician.  The 
management of IRRs will be according to severity as follows:  
a. In the event that a patient experiences a mild (NCI CTCAE Grade 1) 
IRR, the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate being given at 
the time of event onset.  Once the event has resolved, the investigator 
should wait for 30 minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 58 of 104  
 rate.  If tolerated, the infusion rate may then be increased to the original 
rate. 
b. In the event that a patient experiences a moderate IRR (NCI  CTCAE 
Grade 2) or flushing, fever, or throat pain, the infusion should be 
immediately interrupted and the patient should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment.  The infusion should be restarted only after the 
symptoms have adequately resolved to baseline grade.   The infusion rate 
at restart should be half of the infusion rate that was in progress at the 
time of the onset of the IRR. 
c. For severe or life- threatening IRRs (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), the 
infusion should be stopped immediately, and aggressive resuscitat ion 
and supportive measures should be initiated.  Patients experiencing severe or life- threatening IRRs will not receive further infusion and will 
be further managed as clinically indicated until the event resolves.  
For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix 
 6.  
Guidelines for dosage modification, treatment interruption, or discontinuation and the 
management of specific adverse events are provided in Section [ADDRESS_1093621] (Non IP) 
 
Carboplatin, paclitaxel and all routine pre -medications will be obtained from standard 
commercial sources and administered according to the manufacturers’ and institutional 
guidelines. 
 
8.6. Dose and Treatment Modifications  
 
8.6.1.    General Guidelines  
 
Monitoring  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non-serious AEs, defined and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  Patients will 
be assessed for safety (including laboratory values) according to the schedule in Protocol Section 5.  Patients will be followed for safety for [ADDRESS_1093622].   
General safety assessments will include serial interval histories, physical 
examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistries and blood 
counts (see  Protocol Section 5for the list and timing of study a ssessments).  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and protocol -defined events of special interest 
(see Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] ) will be reported in an expedited fashion (see Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] ).  In addition, the investigators will review and evaluate observed AEs on a 
regular basis.  
Patients who have an ongoing study treatment −related AE upon study completion    
or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093623] to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, 
or until it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause 
of the AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Management of Specific Safety Concerns with Atezolizumab  
 
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab  treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as 
autoimmune serology or biopsies, may be used to determine a possible 
immunogenic etiology. 
Although most immune -related adverse events (irAEs) observed with 
immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should 
be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential ma jor complications.  
Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect 
and, in severe cases, immune- related toxicities may require acute management 
with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, or TNF α 
inhibitors.  
The primary approach to Grade 1 to 2 irAEs is supportive and symptomatic care 
with continued treatment with a tezolizumab ; for higher -grade irAEs, 
Atezolizumab  should be withheld and oral and/or parenteral steroids administered.  
Recurrent Grade 2 irAEs may also mandate withholding atezolizumab  or the use 
of steroids.  Assessment of the benefit -risk balance should be made by [CONTACT_1275], with consideration of the totality of information as it pertains to the nature of the toxicity and the degre e of clinical benefit a given patient may be 
experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab .  Atezolizumab  
should be permanently discontinued in patients with life-threatening irAEs. 
Please refer to the IB for management of specific irAEs and guidelines for dose 
modifications in specific circumstances.
 
8.6.2.    Dose Modifications  
 
Atezolizumab  treatment will be given as long as the patient continues to experience 
clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_793146], symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, or any of the 
other reasons for treatment discontinuation listed in Section 9. 
There will be no dose reduction for atezolizumab in this study.  Patients may 
temporarily suspend study treatment for up to 84 days beyond the scheduled date of 
delayed infusion if study drug- related toxicity requiring dose suspension is 
experienced.  If atezolizumab  is held because of AEs for > [ADDRESS_1093624] be tapered off steroids used to treat AEs, a tezolizumab  may be held 
for additional time beyond 84 days from the scheduled dose until steroids are 
discontinued or reduced to  a prednisone dose (or dose equivalent) of  ≤ 10 mg/day.  
The acceptable length of interruption will be at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093625], and there is no available antidote for atezolizumab .  In severe cases, immune -related toxicities may be acutely managed 
with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, or TNF α 
inhibitors. 
Patients should be assessed clinically (including review of laboratory values) for 
toxicity prior to, during, and after each infusion.  If unmanageable toxicity due to  
atezolizumab  occurs at any time during the study, treatment with atezolizumab  
should be discontinued. 
Management of hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, rash, and hypothyroidism are 
presented in this section as they have been observed in this study and are potentially 
immune related.  See appendix 4 for guidelines for the management of  IRRs (see 
Appendix 6 for precautions for anaphylaxis).
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
 
Immune -mediated colitis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab . 
 
Patients should be  advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even 
if it is mild.  
 
If the event is of significant duration or magnitude, or is associated with signs of 
systemic inflammation or acute phase reactants (e.g., increased CRP or platelet 
count or bandemia), it is recomme nded that sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if 
appropriate) with colonic biopsy with three to five specimens for standard paraffin block be performed.  If possible, one or two biopsy specimens should be snap frozen and stored.     
Treatment may be restarted f ollowing the resolution of colitis.  In addition, if the 
patient is being managed with corticosteroids, treatment should not be restarted 
until the steroids have been tapered down to a prednisone dose ≤ 10 mg/day .  
Patients who resume treatment should be m onitored closely for signs of renewed 
diarrhea.  Table  1 provides a summary of dose modification guidelines for 
gastrointestinal toxicit ies.

 While in this study, patients presenting with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain 
and/or unexplained nausea or vomiting should have LFTs performed immediately, 
and LFTs should be reviewed before administration of the next dose of study drug. 
 
If LFTs increase, neoplastic, concurrent medications, viral hepatitis, and toxic 
etiologies should be considered and addressed, as appropriate.  Imaging of the liver, gall bladder, a nd biliary tree should be performed to rule out neoplastic or 
other causes of increased LFTs.  Anti -nuclear antibody, perinuclear anti -neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody, anti -liver kidney microsomal, and anti -smooth muscle 
antibody tests should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is considered.  
 Patients with LFT abnormalities should be managed according to the guidelines 
in Table  2.

Treatment -emergent rash has been associated with a tezolizumab .  The majority of 
cases of rash were mild in severity and self- limited, with or without pruritus.  
A dermatologist should evaluate persistent and/or severe rash or pruritus.  A biopsy 
should be performed unless contraindicated.  Low -grade rash and pruritus irAEs 
have been treated with symptomatic therapy (e.g., antihistamines).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_421990].

[IP_ADDRESS].  Endocrine Toxicity  
 
Hypothyroidism has been associated with the administration of a tezolizumab . 
 
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, impotence, mental 
status changes, or constipation should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], or adrenal endocrinopathies, as well as for hyponatremia or 
hyperkalemia.  An endocrinologist should be consulted if an endocrinopathy is suspected.  Thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels should be 
obtained to determine whether thyroid abnormalities are present.  TSH, prolactin, and a morning cortisol level will help to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency 
from primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_13002] . 
 
Hypothyroidism should be managed according to the guidelines in Table  4. 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093629].    Restart atezolizumab when 
symptoms are controlled by [CONTACT_793183].  
TSH  = thyroid -stimulating hormone. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pulmonary Toxicity 
 
Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates have 
been associated with the administration of atezolizumab and have primarily been 
observed in patients with underlying NSCLC. 
 
Mild -to-moderate events of pneumonitis have been repo rted with a tezolizumab .  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported etiologies such as pneumonia/infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pulmonary hypertension and the following should be performed: 
a. Measurement of oxygen saturation (i.e., arterial blood gas) 
b. High -resolution CT scan of the chest 
c. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy 
d. Pulmonary function tests (with diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon 
monoxide [DL
CO]) 
 
Patients will be assessed for pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study.  
Patients will also have CT scans of the chest at every tumor assessment 
(see Section  10.3.2 ). 
Pulmonary toxicity should be managed according to the guidelines in Table  5.

hypoxia, or dyspnea  Hold treatment with 
atezolizumab.   Re-evaluate after 1 week.  
If no worsening in GGO/infiltrates and patient still asymptomatic, resume treatment with atezolizumab. If GGO/infiltrates worsen and patient is still asymptomatic, continue to hold atezolizumab and refer for bronchoscopy.  Consider starting low-dose oral p rednisone 10 mg or 
equivalent.   Re-evaluate after 1  week.  
Resume a tezolizumab if 
GGO/infiltrates improving. 
 
Hypoxia or dyspnea in presence of GGO or infiltrate without alternative etiology  Hold atezolizumab.   Consult a pulmonologist.  Investigate for other etiologies and consider bronchoscopy.  If bronchoscopy is consistent with immune -related etiology, 
start 60 mg or 1- 2 mg/kg 
prednisone equivalent per day followed by [CONTACT_579424] 2 weeks.  Restart atezolizumab if 
symptomatically improved, infiltrates are resolved, and steroid use is ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone equivalent per day.  
Permanently discontinue atezolizumab for life-threatening, 
immune-related pulmonary events.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Pericardial and Pleural Effusions  
  
Pericardial and pleural involvement with associated effusions is common in 
patients with cancer and has the theoretical potential to be exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_793184]- tumor immunity following PD -L1 bloc kade.  
Patients presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or unexplained tachycardia should be evaluated for the presence of a pericardial effusion.  Patients with pre-existing pericardial effusion should be followed closely for pericardial fluid volume 
measurements and impact on cardiac function.  When intervention is required for 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 67 of 104  
 pericardial or pleural effusions, appropriate workup includes cytology, LDH, 
glucose, cholesterol, protein concentrations (with pleural effusions), and cell count.  
For patients with a pericardial effusion causing end- diastolic right ventricular 
collapse, treatment may be restarted following the placement of a pericardial window, demonstration of hemodynamic stability, and resolution of right 
ventricular dysfunction. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential Pancrea tic Toxicity  
 
Symptoms of abdominal pain associated with elevations of amylase and lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis, have been associated with administration of other immunomodulatory agents.  The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain 
should include pancreatitis.  Appropriate workup should include an evaluation for obstruction, as well as serum amylase and lipase tests (see also Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential Eye Toxicity  
 
An ophthalmologist should evaluate visual complaints.  Uveitis or epi[INVESTIGATOR_793148].  Atezolizumab  should be 
permanently discontinued for immune -mediated ocular disease that is 
unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy.  
Ocular toxicity should be managed according to the guidelines in Table  6.

8.7. Concomitant Medications  
8.7.1.    Concomitant Therapy  
 
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over -the-counter 
preparations used by a patient between the 7  days preceding the screening evaluation 
and the treatment discontinuation visit. 
 
Patients who experience infusion- associated symptoms may be treated 
symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093630] practice (for sites 
outside the [LOCATION_002], equivalent medications may be substituted per local 
practice).  Serious infusion -associated events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_793149] 
(e.g., supplemental oxygen and β2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix ).  
 
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF α inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab  but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating  physician.  If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should 
be considered.  Premedication may be administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids 
(e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency is allowed.  Megastrol administered as appetite stimulant is acceptable 
while the patient is enrolled in the study.   
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement ther apy, prophylactic or 
therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low -molecular -weight heparin or 
warfarin at a stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy should continue 
their use.  Males and females of reproductive potential should use high ly effective 
means of contraception.  
8.7.2.    Excluded Therapy  
 
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health authority- approved or experimental, is prohibited.  This includes but is not limited to 
the following:  
• Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, 
investigational agents, or herbal therapy  
 
It is strongly recommended that:  
• Traditional herbal medicines not be administered because the ingredients 
of many herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in 
unanticipated drug -drug interactions that may cause, or confound 
assessment of, toxicity  
• The use of a RANKL inhibitor (denosumab) be discontinued during the study; t his agent could potentially alter the activity and the safety of 
atezolizumab  
 
Initiation or increased dose of granulocyte colony -stimulating factors 
(e.g., granulocyte colony -stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage 
colony- stimulating factor, and/or pegfilgrastim) is prohibited for patients with 
solid malignancies.   
 
Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including but not 
limited to IFN -α, IFN -γ, or IL -2, during the entire study.  These agents, in 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 69 of 104  
 combination with atezolizumab , could poten tially increase the risk for autoimmune 
conditions. 
 
Patients should also not be receiving immunosuppressive medications, including 
but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide.  
These agents could potentially alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab .  
Systemic corticosteroids and anti- TNFα agents may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab  but may be administered at 
the discretion of the treating physician.  If feasible,  alternatives to these agents 
should be considered. 
In addition, all patients (including those who discontinue the study early) should 
not receive other immunostimulatory agents for [ADDRESS_1093631] dose of 
atezolizumab . 
9. Dose Modifications and Management of Toxicity  
 
9.1. Dose Modifications During Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy 
 
9.1.1.  Hematologic Toxicities  
 
• For ANC <1,000 or platelets <75,000 on day of treatment, delay carboplatin 
and paclitaxel until ANC ≥1,000 and platelets ≥75,000, then resume at the 
previous doses. If treatment is delayed for ≥ 3 weeks, discontinue the drugs for 
the duration of concurrent therapy. 
• For febrile neutropenia occurring at any time during a cycle, hold therapy. 
• Doses that are missed will not be made up.  
• Radiation therapy will be held for grade 4 hematologic toxicity.  
 
9.1.2.  Non-hematologic Toxicities  
 
Radiation therapy should continue to be delivered for ≤ grade 3 non-hematologic 
toxicities in or outside the radiation treatment field. RT should be held for all Grade 
4 non- hematologic toxicity in or outside the treatment field and resumed only when 
toxicity ≤ grade 2.  
Neurotoxicity:  
• Grade 2:  Hold paclitaxel until ≤ Grade1, then resume at full dose. If paclitaxel 
is held ≥ 3 weeks, discontinue paclitaxel permanently. Continue carboplatin at 
full dose. 
• Grade 3:  Discontinue palictaxel permanently, continue carboplatin.  
 
Renal Toxicity:  A ≥10% change in the serum creatinine, based on weekly 
calculated creatinine clearance, will require a recalculation of the carb oplatin dose. 
Ototoxicity: For ≥ grade 3 toxicity discontinue carboplatin permanently.  
Hypersensitivity: For grade [ADDRESS_1093632] 1/3 of th e 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093633] 2/3 of the infusion, double the rate of the infusion. For 
documented Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel, discontinue paclitaxel. 
Cardiotoxicity: If a patient develops chest pain, hypotension, or arrhythmia other 
than asymptomatic sinus brachycardia, the paclitaxel infusion should be stopped 
and patients should not receive further paclitaxel. For asymptomatic sinus brachycardia, the infusion need not be stopped, but the patient should be followed 
carefully.  
Hepatic Dysfunction:  Give the following % of full dose for paclitaxel:  
AST   Bilirubin  Paclitaxel  
<2.[ADDRESS_1093634]  and <1.5 mg/dl  100%  
2.0-5.[ADDRESS_1093635]  and <1.5 mg/dl  50% 
>5.[ADDRESS_1093636]  or ≥1.5 mg/dl  0* 
* Hold paclitaxel for one week (radiation therapy may continue), repeat labs, and 
evaluate for etiology. If progressive disease is found, take the patient off protocol treatment. If disease progression is not found and labs return to normal (AST  <2.[ADDRESS_1093637] and Bili<1.5 mg/dl) within three weeks, reinstitute paclitaxel 
at 100%. IF AST  >5.[ADDRESS_1093638] or bilirubin >1.5 mg/dl after three weeks, 
discontinue paclitaxel for all subsequent cycles but continue treatment with 
carboplatin. 
Other toxicities:  For all other toxicities that exceed grade 3 (except alopecia, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue and anorexia), hold carboplatin and paclitaxel until 
toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2.  
 
9.1.3.  Radiotherapy Related Toxicity  
Esophagus/pharynx  
• Grade 3: If day of chemotherapy hold until ≤ grade 2. Hold radiotherapy ≤ 5 days.  
• Grade 4: Hold radiation and chemotherapy until toxicity has resolved to ≤ grade 2, then resume therapy at previous dose. 
• If IV support is needed insertion of a feeding tube should be considered. 
• If treatment is interrupted ≥ 3 weeks discontinue all protocol therapy. 
  
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 71 of 104  
 Pulmonary Toxicity 
• Grade 3:  Hold treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy. 
Once toxicity has resolved to < grade 2 restart chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
at prev ious dose. 
• Grade 4:  Discontinue all further radiotherapy. Hold treatment with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel until toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2.  
• If treatment is interrupted ≥ 3 weeks discontinue all protocol therapy. 
 
9.2. Dose Modifications During Consolidation Chemotherapy 
 
• If more than one of the dose modifications apply, use the most stringent (i.e., the 
greatest dose reduction).  
• The following dose levels are used for dose modifications. If dose reduction below 
level -1 is required, discontinue the drug causing the toxicity, and continue the other 
drug.  
• If treatment is delayed for ≥ 3 weeks, discontinue all protocol treatment. 
Dose Level  Carboplatin  Paclitaxel  
0 AUC = 6  200 mg/m2 
-1 AUC = 4.5  150 mg/m2 
 
9.2.1.  Hematologic Toxicity  
• For ANC <1,500 or platelets <100,000 on day 1, delay treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel until ANC ≥1,500 and platelets ≥100,000, then resume at the previous doses if fully recovered in 1 week. If not, decrease by 
1 dose level when recovered.  
• For ANC <500 or platelets <25,000, hold therapy then decrease carboplatin 
and paclitaxel by [CONTACT_793185] ≥1,500 
and platelets ≥100,000.  
 
9.2.2.  Non-hematologic Toxicities  
 
Neurotoxicity:  
• Grade 2:  Hold paclitaxel until ≤ Grade1, then resume at full dose. If paclitaxel 
is held ≥ 3 weeks, discontinue paclitaxel permanently. Continue carboplatin at 
full dose. 
• Grade 3:  Discontinue paclitaxel permanently, continue carboplatin.  
 
Renal Toxicity:  A  ≥ 1 0 %  c hange in the serum creatinine, based on weekly 
calculated creatinine clearance, will require a recalculation of the carboplatin dose.  
 
Ototoxicity: For ≥ grade 3 toxicity discontinue carboplatin permanently.  
 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 72 of 104  
 Hypersensitivity: For grade [ADDRESS_1093639] 1/[ADDRESS_1093640] 2/3 of the infusion, double the rate of the infusion. For documented Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel, discontinue paclitaxel. 
 
Cardiotoxicity: If a patient develops chest pain, hypotension, or arrhythmia other 
than asymptomatic sinus brachycardia, the paclitaxel infusion should be stopped and patients should not receive further paclitaxel. For asymptomatic sinus 
brachycardia, the infusion need not be stopped, but the patient should be followed 
carefully.  
 
Hepatic Dysfunction:  Give the following % of full dose for paclitaxel:  
 
 AST   Bilirubin  Paclitaxel  
<2.[ADDRESS_1093641]  and <1.5 mg/dl  100%  
2.0-5.[ADDRESS_1093642]  and <1.5 mg/dl  50% 
>5.[ADDRESS_1093643]  or ≥1.5 mg/dl  0* 
* Hold paclitaxel for one week, repeat labs, and evaluate for etiology. If 
progressive disease is found, take the patient off protocol treatment. If disease 
progression is not found and labs return to normal ( AST  <2.[ADDRESS_1093644] and 
Bili<1.5 mg/dl) within three weeks, reinstitute paclitaxel at 100%.  IF AST  >5.[ADDRESS_1093645] or bilirubin >1.5 mg/dl after three weeks, discontinue paclitaxel for all subsequent cycles but continue treatment with carboplatin.  
 
Other toxicities:  For all other toxicities that exceed grade 3 (except alopecia, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue and anorexia), hold carboplatin and paclitaxel until 
toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2.  
 
9.2.3.  Failure to Complete Consolidation Chemotherapy 
 
Based on available data of conso lidation chemotherapy ( 34-35), it is expected that 
not all patients will either start or complete the consolidation chemotherapy portion 
of the trial. These patients will still be evaluable for toxicity and outcome 
endpoints. Toxicities will be scored as outlined above. Not completing 
consolidation therapy will not in and of itself constitute a dose limiting toxicity. 
For purposes of follow -up assessment, imaging will be timed to start as outlined 
in the calendar based on the anticipated Cycle [ADDRESS_1093646] of treatment in obese patients when 
actual body weight is used to calculate doses which are defined in terms of body surface 
area (BSA) considerations. Accordingly, paclitaxel dosing, defined on the basis of BS A, 
will be calculated on the basis of the patient's actual body weight. This will eliminate 
the risk of calculation error and the possible introduction of variability in dose 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 73 of 104  
 administration. Failure to use actual body weight in the calculation of drug dosa ges will 
be considered a major protocol violation.  
AUC dosing will be used to determine carboplatin dosing. The protocol permits use of 
the Cockcroft -Gault formula to estimate creatinine clearance. However, in markedly 
obese patients, the Cockcroft -Gault formula will tend to overestimate the creatinine 
clearance. (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creatinine requiring renal clearance). The actual body weight (in kilograms) will be utilized in the Cockcroft -Gault formula. 
However, if the calculated creatinine clearance exceeds an upper limit for creatinine clearance, as specified below, then this ceiling value for creatinine clearance, rather than 
the calculated creatinine clearance, will be used in the Calvert formula to calculate the 
dose of carbop latin.  
 
At the treating physician’s discretion, institutional standard dosing for carboplatin and 
paclitaxel may be used, using actual body weight in the calculation of drug doses. 
 
The maximum CrCl that can be used in this calculation, for both women and men, 
is 125 mL/min.  Alternatively, at the treating physician's discretion, a measured [ADDRESS_1093647] v1.1  (see Appendix ) and immune- related response 
criteria  (irRC; see Appendix  ).  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines 
(vers ion 1.1).  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions 
and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline
viii. 
 
10.1. Schedule of Evaluations:  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated  for response and survival  every 
[ADDRESS_1093648] diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_1093649] x- ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_1093650] 
component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093651] diameter is ≥ 1.0 cm in 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging.  In the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a r uler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_1093652] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
 
10.2.2.  Non-Measurable Disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non -measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥ 1.0 to < 1.5 cm).   
 
Note:  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis < 
1.0 cm are considered non -pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded 
or followed.  
10.3. Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
10.3.1.  Measurement Method s 
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions 
of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -
up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_1093653]- treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_31952] a treatment.   
 
10.3.2.  Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1093654] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for 
a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  The lesions should be measured on  the same pulse sequence.  Ideally, 
the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 75 of 104  
 • PET- CT:  If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT 
is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and 
can be used interchangeably  with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.   
• FDG -PET:   FDG- PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease.  A ‘positive’ FDG- PET scanned lesio n is defined as one which is FDG avid with 
an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG -PET scanned lesion is considered 
‘negative.’  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be id entified 
according to the following algorithm: 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:   
1) If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.   
2) If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on C T at the same evaluation, additional follow -up CT scans 
(i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to 
determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initia l abnormal PDG -
PET scan.   
3) If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, it is not classified as PD.  
 
10.3.3.  Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation   
 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
 
10.4. Measurement of Treatment/Intervention Effect  
 
10.4.1.  Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• Measurable l esions up to a maximum of 5 lesions, representative of all involved 
organs, should be identifie d as “Target Lesions” and recorded and measured at 
baseline.  These lesions can be non -nodal or nodal, where no more than 2 lesions 
are from the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 76 of 104  
 Note:  If fewer than 5 target lesions and t arget lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond 
those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.   
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be 
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not 
lend itself to  reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest 
lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected.   
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):   A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD).  The BSD 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response 
in the measurable dimension of the disease.   
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):   A sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes 
will be calculated and reported as the post -baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD).  
If the radiol ogist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or 
target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm.  If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measur e, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_1093655] that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and 
the PBSD.  
 
10.4.2.  Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 12 .2.2) are classified as non- target lesions 
or non- target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at  baseline.  These lesions 
and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
10.4.3.  Response Criteria 
 
All target lesions and target lymph nodes followe d by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI/PET -CT must be 
measured on re -evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1.  Specifically, 
a change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
Note: Non -target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be evaluated at each  
assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response.  In  
selected circumstances, certain non -target organs may be evaluated less frequently.   
For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is  identified in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 77 of 104  
 • Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to < 1.0 
cm. 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all 
the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD 
(see Section 11.4.1).  
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased 
to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1093656] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph 
nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 
11.4.1).  In addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 0.5 cm from the MSD.  
c. See Section 11.3.2 for details in regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficie nt shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes 
• Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all non -targe t lesions.  
b. Each non- target lymph node must have a reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesions or non -
target lymph nodes. 
• Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true:  
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased 
to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during follow -up.   
b. Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions and non-
target lymph nodes.  (NOTE:  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion and target lymph node status.  It must 
be representative of overall disease status change.)  
c. See Section 11.3.2 for details in regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.

10.4.5.  Symptomatic Deterioration  
Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not 
either related to study treatment or other medical conditions, should be reported as 
PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration.  
 11. End of Treatment  and Follow -up 
11.1. Duration of Treatment  
 
11.1.1.  CR, PR, or SD  
Patients who are in CR, PR or SD will continue on therapy for a total of 12 months.  
After treatment is discontin ued, patients will be followed per the study calendar in 
Section 5.0 and 6.0.  
11.1.2.  Disease Progression  
 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 79 of 104  
 Remove from protocol therapy any patient with disease progression. Document 
details, including tumor measurements, on data forms. 
 
After disease progression, patients should be followed for survival per the study 
calendar (Section 5.0 and 6.0). 
 
11.2. Managing ineligible patients and registered patients who never receive protocol 
intervention 
Definition of ineligible patients: A study participant who is registered to the trial but does not meet all of the eligibility criteria is deemed to be ineligible. Patients who are deemed 
ineligible may continue protocol treatment, provided the treating physician, study chair, and executive officer agree there are no safety concerns if the patient continues protocol 
treatment. All scans, tests, and data submission are to continue as if the patient were eligible. 
Notification of the local IRB may be necessary per local IRB policies.  
 
Study participants who are registered to the trial but never receive study intervention (for a 
reason other than because they were deemed ineligible) must still complete follow -up 
requirements as specified below.   
 
11.3. Extraordinary Medical Circumstances  
If, at any time the constr aints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health 
and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event: 
• Document the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy on data forms. 
• Follow the patient for protocol endpoints as required by [CONTACT_618160]. 
11.4. Follow-up  
After the end of treatment visit, patients will be required to attend follow -up visits. These visits 
will occur 3, [ADDRESS_1093657] and imaging. Blood samples will be collected for assessment of 
circulating tumor cells as well  (See Section 5 for details).  
 12. Safety Instructions and Guidance  
12.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of any study procedures  and ends [ADDRESS_1093658] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whi chever is 
earlier.  After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
12.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
 
All AEs and SAEs, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_102], discovered by [CONTACT_15480], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other 
means, will be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by  [CONTACT_793186] 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 80 of 104  
 duration (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected 
relationship to the study drug (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should 
apply the following general guideline: 
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration 
of atezolizumab , and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomit ant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of 
response to atezolizumab ; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of 
atezolizumab  or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
     No   
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than atezolizumab  (e.g., pre -existing 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to atezolizumab  administration (e.g., 
cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1093659] dose of study drug).  
 
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert (PI) or 
current Investigator’s Brochure.  
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_570266]’s Brochure or not 
identified.  This includes AEs for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with 
the description in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_168338]’s Brochure.  For example, under this definition, 
hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_168338]’s Brochure only referred to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
 
12.3. Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
12.3.1.  Eliciting Adverse Events  
 
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation timepoints 
should be adopted.  Examples of non- directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last 
here?”  
 
12.3.2.  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs 
or SAEs.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather 
than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 81 of 104  
 single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report 
the information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Deaths  
 
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see 
Section  12.1), regardless of att ribution, will be reported to the appropriate 
parties.  When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical 
concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time 
of reporting, report “Unexplained Death.”  Deaths that occur during the protocol- specified adverse event reporting period (see Section  12.1) that are 
attributed by [CONTACT_793187].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
 
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the 
study.  Such conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history.  A 
pre-existing medical condition should be re -assessed throughout the trial and 
reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793150].  If a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a 
medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE.  For 
example, if a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], r ecord 
the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15429]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793151] -existing conditions, 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842], or 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15432].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately 
inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1093660] dose of study drug.  A Pregnancy Report CRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
 
Version Date 8/19/2019      Version  4.0 
Page 82 of 104  
 learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via fax.  A pregnancy report will 
automatically be generated and sent to Genentech Drug Safety.  Pregnancy 
should not be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  The investigato r should 
discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient 
should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any SAEs associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after 
the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed in the AFT -
EDC (Ra ve) system  within [ADDRESS_1093661] to Genentech Drug Safety within 24 hours of receipt. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancies in Partners of Male Patients  
 
Male patients will be instructed through the ICF to immediately inform the 
investiga tor if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
90 days after completing treatment with Atezolizumab .  Male patients who 
received study treatment should not attempt to father a child until end of study.  A Pregnancy Report CRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) in the AFT -EDC 
(Rave) system . AFT will forward to Genentech Drug Safety within [ADDRESS_1093662] and report details of the course and outcome 
of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  The 
pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of 
Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  Once 
the authorization has been signed, the investigator will update the Pregnancy Report with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy.  An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_793188], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the 
treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abnormal Liver Functions Tests Reported as Hy’s Law  
 
Investigators must report as a serious adverse event the occurrence of either of 
the following:  
 
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST (>[ADDRESS_1093663]) in combination with 
total bilirubin (>[ADDRESS_1093664])  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST (>[ADDRESS_1093665]) in combination with 
clinical  jaundice 
 The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (>[ADDRESS_1093666]) in combination with 
either an elevated total bilirubin (>[ADDRESS_1093667]) or clinical jaundice in the 
absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to 
be an indicator of severe liver inj ury. 
 
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093668] appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the 
abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF 
and reported to the safety department of AFT (US sites) or ABCSG (Non- US 
sites) immediately (i.e., no  more than 24 hours after learning of the event) 
using the study specific SAE reporting way. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abortions 
 
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as an SAE (as the Sponsors 
consider spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded on  
the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to AFT immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  12.3 ). AFT will forward to 
Genentech Drug Safety within 24 hours of receipt. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
 
Any congenital a nomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient or 
female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as 
an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event CRF, and reported to AFT immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning  of the event). AFT will forward to 
Genentech within 24 hours of receipt. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post-Study Adverse Events 
 
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient has completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior atezolizumab  exposure.  If the investigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient who participated in the study, this should be 
reported as an SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events of  Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result of safety monitoring of the IMP. 
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event ) via the AFT -EDC (Rave) system.
 
The following AEs are considered of special interest and must be reported to the Genentech Drug Safety expeditiously, irrespective of regulatory 
seriousness criteria:  
• Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT 
or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law and based on the following 
observations:  
 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093669]  ≥ 3 × baseline value in 
combination with total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN (of which  > 35% is 
direct bilirubin)  
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  ≥ 3 × baseline value in 
combination with clinical jaundice 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as 
defined below 
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein 
transmitting transmissible   spongiform encephalopathy), 
pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious 
agent.   A transmission of an infectiou s agent may be suspected 
from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term 
applies only when a contamination of study treatment is 
suspected  
• Pneumonitis 
• Colitis  
• Endocrinopathies:  diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, 
hyperthyroidism and hypophysitis 
• Hepatitis, including AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1093670] 
• Systemic lupus erythematosus  
• Neurological disorders:  Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome 
or mya sthenia gravis, and meningoencephalitis  
• Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, infusion- related reactions, 
cytokine release syndrome, influenza- like illness, systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome and systemic immune activation  
• Nephritis  
• Ocular toxicities  (e.g. uveitis, retinitis)  
• Myositis  
• Myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis  
• Grade  >2 cardiac disorders (e.g. atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, 
pericarditis)  
 
12.3.3.  Adverse Events Reporting 
 
The prompt reporting of adverse events is the responsibility of each invest igator 
engaged in clinical research, as required by [CONTACT_280087]. Adverse events 
must be described and graded using the terminology and grading categories defined 
in the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0. The CTCAE is available at  
Attribution 

 
Version Date 8/19/[ADDRESS_1093671] be determined by [CONTACT_793189], using the codes provided. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].    Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the 
studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. 
Adverse events will b e recorded after informed consent is obtained and 
initiation of any study procedures through [ADDRESS_1093672].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Investigators are required by [CONTACT_654945]. Investigators are required to notify the 
AFT and their Institutional Review Board if a patient has a reportable serious 
adverse event. The descriptions and  grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 
will be utilized for AE reporting.  The CTCA E is identified and located on 
the CTEP website at: 
 All 
app
ropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE. All 
reactions determined to be “reportable” in an expedited manner must be 
reported via the Adverse Event eCRF  in the Rave.  
 
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting via the AFT -EDC (Rave) system , regardless of causality.  Attribution to 
treatment or other cause should be provided.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (AFT) ANY Serious Adverse Events, 
whether or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 
312.64)

 Table 7. Serious Adverse Event Repor ting Requirements  
 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15163] ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
7) Or is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study). 
8) Or is associated with an overdoes  
ALL  SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to AFT  via

of awareness of the event.   
NOTE: Deaths occurring outside of the serious adverse event reporting period that are clearly due to 
progressive disease should NOT  be reported as an SAE, but rather should be reported via routine 
reporting methods in the AFT -EDC (Rave) system.  For d eaths occur ring within the reporting window, 
even if considered to be related to disease progression, the cause of death should be reported as an 
SAE within the AFT -EDC (Rave) system  with death noted as the outcome of the event.

curative -intent population, restaging CT scans will be carried out after the first [ADDRESS_1093676] 70% to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, that 85% of the study population will complete radiation, and that 60% of the study population will 
complete the entire treatment course including consolidation chemotherapy and adjuvant 
immunotherapy with atezolizumab . 
 
13.2. Endpoints 
 
13.3. Primary Objective  
 The primary objective of this single arm phase II trial is to determine whether neoadjuvant 
and adjuvant anti -PD-L1 therapy bracketing standard chemoradiation therapy and 
consolidation therapy is worthy of further investigati on. The primary endpoint will be the 
disease control rate (DCR) after 12 weeks induction immunotherapy.  
 
13.4. Secondary Objectives  
 Secondary endpoints are  objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) , the proportion of patients who complete induction immunotherapy, 
chemoradiation therapy and consolidation chemotherapy . Toxicity including immune 
related adverse events will be assessed for all patients receiving any study therapy.  
 
13.5. Translational Science Principal Objective  
 Assess the utility of PD -L1 as a biomarker for DCR, ORR, PFS, OS in the study 
population. 
 
13.6. Translational Science Additional Objectives  
 
Examine the role of immunologic signatures for positive and negative predictive value and 
to iden tify selective biomarkers. Multi -panel immunohistochemistry, NanoString /RNA -
Seq/RT -PCR expression profiling, whole exome and T cell receptor sequencing, flow 
cytometry, and cytokine and chemokine markers will be assessed in blood and in FFPE 
tissue . Additionally, whole blood and serum will be obtained at study entry and at crucial 
time-points for additional evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA ). Whole blood 
will be obtained at 3 crucial timepoints (at baseline, after induction atezolizumab, after 
chem oradiotherapy.

 13.7. Other Correlative Science Objectives (e.g., QoL, PRO, etc)  
 
Quality of life endpoints will be assessed during induction, during chemoradiotherapy, 
during adjuvant atezolizumab  at 3 month intervals  and will be measured by [CONTACT_70128] -30. 
 
13.8. Sample Size, Accrual time, and Study Duration  
 
13.8.1.  Sample Size  
 
The disease control rate (DCR) is assumed the same for PD -L1 positives and  
negatives. With 60 eligible and treated patients, the study has approximately 90%  
power to detect H0: p≤0.50 versus H1: p≥0.67, where p is the disease control rate  
(DCR) after [ADDRESS_1093677] at a significa nce level of 0.10. In particular, i f 35 or fewer of these patients  
remain disease controlled, it will be concluded that the treatment regimen is not  
worthy of further investigation. Otherwise, it will be concluded that the treatment  
regimen has sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation. Under the design,  
the probability of erroneously concluding that the treatment regimen is worthy of  further investigation when the DCR is truly 50% or less is 0.0775. The probability  
of erroneously concluding that the treatment regimen is NOT worthy of further  
investigation when the true DCR is 67% or greater is 0.0999. 
 
13.8.2.  Accrual Rate and Accrual Duration 
 
The phase II trial will register a total 63 patients. Assuming 5% ineligibility and 
cancelation, [ADDRESS_1093678] one cycle of the 
experimental agent. PD-L1 status will be determined by [CONTACT_793165] (TC/IC). Of 
them, we expect approximately 40 and 20 patients are PD -L1 positive (≥1% 
expression) and PD -L1 negative (otherwise), respectively.  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_1093679] 18  months will be required for all patients for 
progression free survival and overall survival.  
 
13.9. Study Team - Safety Monitoring 
 
In addition to the collection of the treatment -related toxicity forms (radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy), the status of patients will be monitored by  [CONTACT_793190] . The monit oring will occur at least twice monthly  during 
therapy and monthly after treatment.  The goal is for real time understand ing of potential 
toxicity issues, treatment delivery challenges, accrual barriers, and study retention.

INTRODUCTION  
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional response criteria (e.g.,  Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 [RECIST v1.1 ] and World Health Organization 
[WHO]) may not be sufficient to characterize fully activity in the new era of target therapi[INVESTIGATOR_203257]/or biologics.  In studies with cytokines, cancer vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies, 
complete response, partial response, or stable disease has been shown to occur after an increase in tumor burden a s characterized by [CONTACT_379560].  Therefore, 
conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of immunotherapeutic agents because progressive disease (by [CONTACT_33450]) does not  necessarily 
reflect therapeutic failure.  Long -term effect on the target disease must also be captured.  The 
immune- related response criteria
1 (irRC ) are criteria that attempt to do that by [CONTACT_793199] (i.e.,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  (Note:  The irRC only index and measurable new lesions are taken 
into account.)

BASELINE ASSESSMENT USING ir RC 
Step 1 . Identify the index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to ten visceral lesions and 
five cutaneous lesions).   
Step 2 . Calculate the SPD of all of these index lesions:  
SPD = (Largest diameter of lesion i) × (Second largest diameter of lesion i ).

POST -BASELINE ASSESS MENTS USING ir RC 
Step 1 . Calculate the SPD of the index lesions.   
Step 2 . Identify new, measurable lesions (≥  5 × 5 mm; up to five new lesions per organ:  five new 
cutaneous lesions and ten visceral lesions).   
Step 3 . Calculate the SPD of the new, measurable lesions.  
Step 4 . Calculate the tumor burden:  
Tumor burden =  SPD index lesions  + SPD new, measurable lesions 
Step 5 . Calculate the change in tumor burden relative to baseline and the change in  tumor burden 
relative to nadir.  
Step 6 . Derive the overall response using the table below.  
Overall  Response Criterion  
irCR  Complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not, and no 
new lesions) confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment ≥  [ADDRESS_1093683] documented 
irPR Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to baseline confirmed by a 
consecutiv e assessment ≥ [ADDRESS_1093684] documented  
irSD  Criteria for irCR, irPR, and irPD are not met; does not require 
confirmation  
irPD  Increase in tumor burden ≥ 25% relative to nadir confirmed by a 
consecutive assessment ≥ [ADDRESS_1093685] documented 
irCR =  immune- related complete response; irPD  = immune- related progressive disease; 
irPR = immune -related partial response; irSD  = immune -related stable disease.  
 
DETERMINATION OF irBOR  
Once a patient has completed all tumor assessments, his/her irBOR may be determined:  
Condition  irBOR  
At least one irCR  irCR  
At least one irPR and no irCR  irPR 
At least one irSD and no irCR and no irPR irSD  
At least one irPD and no irCR, no irPR , and no irSD  irPD  
irBOR  = immune- related best overall response; irCR  = immune- related complete response; 
irPD  = immune -related progressive disease; irPR  = immune -related partial response; 
irSD  = immune -related stable disease.

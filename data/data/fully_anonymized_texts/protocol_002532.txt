5. Study  Design  
This is a prospective, non -randomized , multi -center, evaluator blinded, safety and 
efficacy clinical study. Subjects will serve as their own control as the appearance of their 
benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_201489]/or wrinkles at baseline is compared to the appearance 
following laser treatment.  
 
6. Study  Overview  
Subjects will participate in a Screening Visit to evaluate the presence of benign 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_201490], or wrinkles including fine lines. After evaluating 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and providing signed informed consen t, subjects will 
be considered enrolled in the study and assigned a unique identification number that will 
appear on all records for that subject as the Subject ID.  
 
Subjects will then either be scheduled for the Baseline / Treatment Visit #1 at a later 
date, or the Screening and Baseline / Treatment #1 Visits may be combined into the 
same visit.  
 
Subjects will receive up to four (4) study laser treatments at 6 ± 2 week treatment 
intervals.  
 
NOTE: Fewer than four (4) Treatment Visits may be required to reach maximum 
expected clinical results in some subjects. Treatments may therefore be stopped, and 
subject placed into the Follow -Up phase at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
The Study Doctor or s taff will make up to three (3) attempts to contact [CONTACT_201545] 10 days after each treatment to assess healing response.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 10 of 35  After the final study laser treatment, subjects will be schedule for three (3) follow -up 
visits at 4 ± 2 w eek intervals, or approximately 1, 2 and 3 months.  
 
After successful completion of the 12 week follow -up visit, subjects will be exited from 
the study.  
 
7. Study  Population  
Up to 160 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to two (2) investigational sites in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
 
The Study Population will be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator after 
determining that eligible subjects have unwanted benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_201491], scalp, neck, chest, b ack, arms, hands, legs or feet; or wrinkles 
including fine lines on the face.  
 
Subjects will be assessed at the Screening Visit and allocated to one or both study sub - 
groups if eligible:  
 
Group A: Benign Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201470] B: Wri nkles including fine lines  
The logic scheme used for group allocation is provided below in Figure 1.

The following activities typi[INVESTIGATOR_201499].  
 
Informed Consent  
The site will provide detailed information about the study, including study procedures, visit 
schedule, potential risks and benefits and alternative treatment options. The subject will 
be given time to review the informed consent form (ICF). If the subject  wishes to 
participate, he/she will complete the ICF with a signature [CONTACT_3670]. The original will be 
retained with subject’s study records and a copy will be provided to the subject.  
 
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.[ADDRESS_240423]’s medical history, including dermatological treatment history and assessment of 
medication use will be documented.  
 
Pregnancy Test  
Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Subjects with a 
positive pregnancy test are ineligible for study participat ion. 
 
A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a premenopausal female capable of 
becoming pregnant. This includes women on oral, injectable, or mechanical 
contraception; women who are single; women whose partners have been vasectomized 
or whose part ners are utilizing mechanical contraceptive devices.  
Treatment Area Examination and Lesion Identification  
Wrinkle evaluation will be performed using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score. Benign 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], a description of lesion type anatomical location, and size will be 
documented.  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Review  
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to verify study eligibility.  
 
10.2.  Baseline and Treatment Visits  
The following activities typi[INVESTIGATOR_201500].  
 
Pregnancy Test  
Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Subjects with a 
positive pregnancy test will be discontinued from the study. The subject will be followed 
until the outcome of pregnancy is determined.  
 
Photography  
Prior to each laser treatment the treatment areas will be photographed using a high - 
resolution digital camera. Camera settings and other parameters such as distance, 
lighting, background and polarization will be recorded and repro duced at subsequent 
photography sessions.  
 
Subject Satisfaction  
At each treatment visit beyond Treatment #1, subjects will be asked to rate their level of 
satisfaction with the study treatments thus far using the Subject Satisfaction Scale 
provided in Appe ndix D.  
 
Eye Safety  
The correct eye protection must be worn during all laser treatments by [CONTACT_423], the 
treating Investigator, and all other study personnel or observers in the room during laser 
operation.  
 
Treatment Area Preparation  
The intended treat ment area will be cleansed with isopropyl alcohol or similar prior to 
treatment to ensure the treatment area is free of any makeup, creams or lotions.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 14 of 35  Skin Biopsy (Optional)  
Subjects may be asked if they will allow one or more skin punch biopsies to be performed 
at or near the treatment area prior to and/or immediately after treatment. Biopsies are 
optional and will only be performed after written consent is obtained from the subject.  
The Investigator will determine if biopsies are n eeded based on the condition being 
treated, location, or other factors. Performance of the biopsy typi[INVESTIGATOR_201501]:  
 
a) Skin biopsies will be collected at or near the treatment  area.  
b) Biopsy site will be cleansed with isopropanol alcohol or  simila r. 
c) Local anesthetic injection (lidocaine or similar medication) will be administered 
intradermally to the biopsy site prior to  collection.  
d) Biopsy will be collected using sterile, single use disposable 2 mm to 4 mm punch 
biopsy.  
e) Sutures may be used to close the biopsy site as  needed.  
f) Biopsies will be placed in a container labeled with Subject’s ID number and date  of 
collection.  
g) Biopsies will be fixed and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and/or 
scanning electron microscopy according to labora tory guidelines.  
 
Anesthesia  
To reduce pain and discomfort during laser treatment, the Investigator may recommend 
use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_201502], such as EMLA or LMX -4 cream, which is applied to 
the intended treatment area for approximately 60 minutes  prior to treatment. The 
Investigator may also recommend use of a local intradermal injection of anesthesia, such 
as lidocaine or similar medication. Nonmedicinal methods may also be offered such as 
simple ice packs, or devices that provide cold air , such  as a Zimmer cooling device (Cryo 
6, Zimmer Medizin Systems, Irvine, CA). Subjects may also elect to be treated without 
anesthesia.  
 
Test Spots  
Test spots may be performed prior to treatment to help the Investigator establish 
appropriate treatment paramete rs to achieve the desired clinical endpoint such as 
erythema or whitening. Test spot parameters will be guided by [CONTACT_201546], lesion 
type, color or location among other factors. The procedure for test spots involves 
delivering a laser pulse to the s kin at or near the treatment area using a low energy, 
fluence or other setting, and then increasing the relevant parameters until the desired 
clinical endpoint is achieved. For the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201463]® laser system the clinical endpoint is most 
commonly erythema or whitening of the skin.  
 
Laser Treatment  
Study laser treatments will be administered using treatment parameters recommended by 
[CONTACT_201547], Candela Corporation. The treatment location, 
wavelength, handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], pulse energy, number of passes, and number of pulses will be 
documented in the case report form.

country requirements for conducting human research studies.  
 
17. Study  Endpoints  
 
17.1.  Primary Effectiveness  Endpoints  
 
Benign Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201519] 12 -Week follow -up visit in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201520].  
 
Wrinkles  
Mean difference from Baseline to final 12 -Week follow -up in Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score as 
determine d by [CONTACT_201551].  
 
 
17.2.  Primary Safety  Endpoint  
Analysis of the incidence, severity and relatedness of local skin responses and 
anticipated adverse device effects (ADE) and unanticipated adverse device effects 
(UADE).  
 
17.3.  Secondary  Endpoints  
 
1. Benign Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201484] (PCS) of 3 or 4 (> 
50% improvement) comparing baseline to 12 -week follow -up as determined by 
[CONTACT_201552]  
 
2. Wrinkles  
Percentage of subjects demonstrating > 1 score improvement in Fitzpatrick Wrinkle 
Score (FWS) from baseline to [ADDRESS_240431] Satisfaction Scores at all visits beyond Treatment

17.4.  Exploratory  Endpoints  
Histological analysis of laser -tissue effects and/or healing response from pre - and post - 
treatment skin biopsies using light microscopy and/or scanning electron m icroscopy.  
 
18. Blinded Evaluation  
Efficacy endpoints will be determined from the data gathered by [CONTACT_201553]. Three qualified, non -treating clinicians will be trained to 
independently review Baseline and post -treatment pho tograph sets for each subject. The 
identity of the subjects will be masked when possible. No information will be provided to 
the evaluators that may allow them to determine the Baseline from the post -treatment 
photography. Evaluators will then examine pair s of Baseline and post -treatment 
photographs presented in a randomized fashion, and be asked to identify which is the 
Baseline, and to rate any perceived improvement using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201521].  
 
19. Statistical  Methods  
 
19.1.  Statistical Plan  Overview  
The study will be conducted with two separate strata (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517], wrinkles) which will be 
evaluated. Benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_201490] (Group A) and wrinkles 
including fine lines (Group B) will be separately powered and analyzed for efficacy and 
safety while both groups will further be combined for safety analyses. All study sites will 
be eligible to enroll subjects into each stratum; no subject will be enrolled into both strata.  
 
Subjects participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_201522] (Appendix A) while subjects participating in the wrinkle 
treatment stratum will be evaluated using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score (Appendix B). All 
study subjects will also be evaluated using the Subject Pain Scale (Appendix C), Subject 
Satisfaction Survey (Appendix D), the Local Skin Response (Appendix E), and will be 
evaluated for safety according to 21 CFR Part 812 as well as ICH guidelines (E3 and E6) 
and ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2016 as applicable.  
 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to study initiation. The database 
will be constructed using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The 
database will be locked following a review of all protocol deviations to be classified as a 
major or minor deviation. Major and minor protocol deviations will be reviewed once all 
data undergo source document verification and prior to database lock. The independent 
biostatistician will determine major  vs. minor protocol deviations.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 23 of 35  Data analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or later (SAS Institute, Cary NC) 
and StatXact Version 10 or later (StatXact, Cambridge MA). All analyses will be 
performed in a GCP environment controlled by [CONTACT_201554].  
 
19.2.  Hypotheses  
 
Null and alternative hypotheses are stratum specific. They assess the change from 
Baseline to Week 12/study exit.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201523] ([ADDRESS_240433]) will be evaluated according to the 
following null and alternative hypotheses for Group A:  
 
• Null Hypothesis: Less than 50% experience good to excellent improvement in the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201524] (PCS)  
• Alternative Hypothesis: At least 80% experience good to excellent improvement in 
PIS. 
 
Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score ([ADDRESS_240434]) will be evaluated separately for 
peri-orbital wrinkles and peri -oral wrinkles as well as the sum according to the following 
null and alternative hypotheses for Group B:  
 
• Null Hypothesis: There is  no mean improvement in the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score 
(FWS)  
• Alternative Hypothesis: There is at least a 2 -point mean improvement in  FWS.  
 
19.3.  Sample Size  
The following summarizes the sample size required to achieve 80% power separately for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_201525] A  and Group B for their respective primary efficacy endpoints.  
 
From Kung, et al, 2018, Graph 1 indicates that for clearance of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 0% 
experienced complete improvement (Grade 5: >95%), 53.8% experienced excellent  
(Grade 4: 75 -94%) improvement, whi le 30.8% experienced good (Grade 3: 50 -74%) 
improvement from baseline. With 30 evaluable subjects, there is 80% power to reject a 
50% improvement rate in favor of a 75% improvement rate according to a two -sided 
exact binomial test with 5% Type I error. Sta tistical significance will be achieved if 69% 
improvement is observed at 12 week follow -up / study exit visit.  
 
From Fitzpatrick, et al, 1996, Table [ADDRESS_240435] deviations < 2 points. With 34 evaluable subjects, there is 80% power to 
detect a [ADDRESS_240436] with 
5% Type I error. Statistical significance will be achieved  if a 0.7 mean improvement is 
observed from Baseline to 12 week follow -up / study exit with a [ADDRESS_240437] separately for the peri- 
orbital, peri -oral, and combined outcomes from baseline to study exit. In addition, the 
percentage achieving a 1 -point improvement will also be displayed with two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals to support regulatory submissions requiring [ADDRESS_240438] Satisfaction Score will be evaluated by [CONTACT_201555], mean, and two -sided 95% confidence intervals provided. 
Results will be displayed separately for Groups A and Group B.  
 
The effectiveness analyses will be performed using a Per Protocol (PP) population which 
excludes subjects with major protocol deviations such as subjects withdra wn prior to final 
evaluation.  
 
 
19.5.  Safety  Analyses  
 
Safety will be evaluated using the Local Skin Response (Appendix E) which will 
specifically assess the following nine pre -defined safety endpoints: erythema, edema, 
whitening, petechiae, pi[INVESTIGATOR_81863], p urpura, crusting, blistering, burn, as well as 
other to be graded on a 5 -point ordinal score.  
 
Safety will be evaluated in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population which includes all treated 
subjects. Safety results will be displayed separately for Groups A an d Group B. 
Analyses will include a summary of the incidence, severity, and relatedness of all 
reported local skin responses, adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse device 
effects. In addition, the percentage with no adverse device effects will a lso be reported 
as well as the percentage according to worst overall degree; a similar evaluation will be 
performed for the worst degree for those at least related to the study treatment. The 
percent reporting each ordinal score per safety endpoint will be  presented separately for 
each stratum and  combined.  
 
20. Histological  Analysis  
 
20.1.  Light  Microscopy  
 
Skin biopsies will be processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) tissue staining to 
allow light microscopy analysis of laser -tissue effects such as acute skin and pi[INVESTIGATOR_157234], wound healing, or other morphologic changes.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 25 of 35  20.2.  Scanning Electron  Microscopy  
 
Skin biopsies may be processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by a third -party 
laboratory to allow analysis of laser -tissue effects such as acute skin and pi[INVESTIGATOR_157234], wound healing response, or other morphologic changes.  
 
21. Risks and  Benefits  
 
21.1.  Potential  Risks  
The study treatments to be administered in this trial carry risks of local skin responses 
that are commo n, expected, and at times even desired with study treatments. The skin 
responses are typi[INVESTIGATOR_201526], and transient in nature, resolving within a 
few days after treatment.  
 
Common local skin responses or side effects of treatment include e rythema, edema, 
whitening, petechiae, pi[INVESTIGATOR_81863], purpura, crusting, blistering, and burning 
following the treatment.  
 
Examples of less common but potentially more severe or lingering local skin responses 
associated with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_201463] ™ laser treatment inc lude hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], herpes virus activation, infection and scarring.  
 
Allergic reactions to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_201527].  
 
There is also a risk of eye injury associated with the use of any laser device. This risk is 
very uncommon as it is easily prevented if proper safety eyewear is used as required.  
 
21.2.  Potential  Benefits  
Subjects may benefit from participation in this study by [CONTACT_201556][INVESTIGATOR_201528], or their wrinkles 
including fine lines. However, there is no guarantee that subjects will experience any 
beneficial clinical result at all.  
 
22. Adverse Device Effects  
 
22.1.  Definitions  
 
The following occurrences will be documented and re ported as required for compliance 
with applicable regulations including 21CFR 812 and ICH GCP EC(R2).  
 
Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device in a subject, whether it  is expected or unexpected.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.[ADDRESS_240439], problem, or death was not previously identifi ed in nature, severity, or degree 
of incidence in the protocol; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
22.2.  Reporting  
 
Anticipated device effects (ADE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) are 
collected from the time of subject consent until the subject exits the study. A description 
of the adverse event or device effect, date of onset, severity, action taken, relationship to 
study treatment and ou tcome are documented in the case report form. All adverse 
events or adverse device effects are followed until  resolution.  
 
The Investigator will submit to Candela and to the reviewing IRB a report of any 
unanticipated  adverse  device  effect  (UADE)  that might  have  led to a serious  adverse  event 
if suitable action had not been taken, intervention had not been made; or if circumstances 
had been less fortunate within [ADDRESS_240440] an evaluation and report the results to IRB within 10 working days.  
 
22.3.  Rating  
The Investigator will assess the severity and relationship of all adverse effects. The  
following definitions will be used for severity assessment:  
 
For all ADE and UADE reported, the Investigator will assign independent ratings for 
Severity and Relatedness to laser treatment in accordance with the descriptions found in 
Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.

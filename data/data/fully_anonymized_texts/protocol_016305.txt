 Synopsis  
 
Schema  
 
 
Number of patients   = between 7 -45 for phase I (depending on tolerance)  
   = 50 for phase II  
 
Phase I  
Patients in each dose cohort will all be  treated as a single group for dose escalation.  The 
starting dose for the dose escalation portion will be 9 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (total dose 
= 45 Gy).  Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive an additional 0.5 Gy per treatment (total 
2.5 Gy  per escalation) as follows:  
 No. Fractions   Dose per fraction (Gy)  Total Dose (Gy)  No. Patients  
  5   9    45   7-15 
  5   9.5    47.5   7-15 
  5   10    50   7-15 
    
Minimum waiting periods will be assigned between each dose cohort to observe toxicity.  The 
phase I portion of the study will be completed when dose limiting toxicity is reached or when a 
sufficiently high dose level (i.e.,10 Gy per fraction, 50 Gy total), is attained to consider the 
therapy likely to be efficacious.   
  
Phase II  
Additional patients will be treated at either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or at the 10 Gy 
per fraction dose level as determined from the Phase I portion of the study.  The phase II study 
will evaluate efficacy endpoints with larger patient numbers and continue t o build the toxicity 
profile of this regimen following the phase I study.  
 
Eligibility  
Men who satisfy all of the following conditions will be eligible for this study:  
 Willing and capable to provide informed consent  
 Signed study specific informed consent f orm.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1      Localized Prostate Cancer  
 
There were 232,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002] in 
2005 and 30,000 deaths [1].  Among males, prostate carcinoma was the 2nd leading 
cause of cancer mortality behind lung cancer and ahead of colo -rectal cancer.  The 
incidence of early stage prostate cancer rose dramatically in the US with the onset of 
widespread use of prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test screening.  Levels 
have continu ed to increase but more slowly in men younger than 65, but have 
leveled off in men older than [ADDRESS_692122] remained level or 
decreasing since the mid 1990s, presumably from earlier detection with PSA 
screening.  The main risk factors ar e age, ethnicity, and family history.  Up to 70% of 
all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men greater than [ADDRESS_692123] higher 
incidence than men in Asia and South America.  Familial disposition may account for 
5-10 percent of prostate cancers.  Early detection of the disease appears to account 
for improvements seen in the US cause -speci fic mortality rate.  The American 
Cancer Society recommends annual screening PSA testing and digital rectal 
examination (DRE) in all men starting at age 50 (starting at age 45 in high risk men) 
in order to allow diagnosis of cancer while still organ confin ed.  With this approach, 
overall 5 -year survival has improved from 67% in 1974 to nearly 100% in 2000; 
however, cancer specific survival continues to decline after five years due to the long 
natural history and lack of cancer control in many men.   
   
Radiotherapy options for organ confined prostate cancer have included protracted 
radiation in the form of external beam delivered over 7 -10 weeks of daily therapy 
(including 2 -D, 3-D conformal, and intensity modulated radiation therapy or IMRT)  
[2-4] and also  permanent brachytherapy seed implantation using iodine or palladium 
[5-7].  Treatments have also been delivered using shorter overall treatment times.  
These include hypofractionated external beam treatments and high dose rate (HDR) 
brachytherapy implants  [8-11].  In addition to being more convenient for patients with 
fewer trips to the treatment facilities, these treatment options completed over a 
shorter period have unique long term effects in both tumor and normal tissues.  
Depending on the relative dif ferences between tumor response and normal tissue 
injury, the timing in which radiotherapy is delivered may have significant impact on 
the therapeutic ratio (benefit/toxicity).  A commonly used mathematical model used 
to describe these effects has been the  “linear -quadratic” model proposed by [CONTACT_533056] [12].  In this model, the log survival vs. dose relationship is modeled by 
[CONTACT_533057].  The linear 
coefficient in this progression is commo nly called “alpha” while the quadratic 
coefficient is called “beta.”  It has also been proposed that the linear term described 
by [CONTACT_533058] e clonagenicity of the cell with little 
chance of repair.  In turn, the beta term reflects the consequence of more than one 
single strand break in close enough proximity on the DNA to disable the cell.  These 
single strand breaks occur much more frequently  than double strand breaks, but 
they may be more readily repaired unless they happen so frequently that repair 
mechanisms become overwhelmed such as might occur with large dose per fraction 
radiation.  Hence, at low dose per fraction, alpha events dominate  the cellular 
response while at large dose per fraction, beta events become more important.  
Version [ADDRESS_692124] a 
lower alpha/beta ratio in the order of [ADDRESS_692125] alpha/beta ratios in the 10 range.  For such 
tumors, exploitation of the differences between normal tissue and tumor response 
has led radiation oncologists to use more protracted courses of radiation using small 
daily doses to high total cumulative doses (so -called conventional fractionation, e.g., 
2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 70 -76 Gy).  Prostate cancer cell lin es have been 
difficult to grow in tissue culture and therefore there has been less direct evidence of 
the alpha/beta ratio.  It was generally assumed to be similar to epi[INVESTIGATOR_533023].  More recent 
evidence, however, has implied that the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer may be 
much lower th an expected.  In fact, using outcome data of patients treated with 
different dose fractionation schemes (in vivo), it has been suggested that the 
alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer may be as low as 1.[ADDRESS_692126] investigated using modestly 
larger dose per fraction treatment schemes as compared to conventional 
fractionated radiotherapy [refe rences].  For example, in a mature prospective 
experience reported by [CONTACT_533059], 50 Gy total in 3.13 Gy 
fractions produced PSA control rates comparable to published reports using 70 Gy 
with 2 Gy fractions [13 -14].  In addition, the y found the treatment carried out with 3 -D 
conformal techniques was well tolerated.  That same group is carrying on the 
research using 3 Gy per fraction, 60 Gy total dose, and intensity modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) techniques in an effort to improve PSA control rates [11].  In the US, 
Kupelian and colleagues used 2.5 Gy per fraction and published mature results to 70 
Gy total dose in 5.5 weeks [10].  Their patients also had good PSA control rates and 
acceptable rates of toxicity, especially if the vol ume rectum getting 70 Gy is limited to 
10 cc.  Similar investigations are now being planned or carried out for larger groups 
of patients in cooperative group trials.   Altogether, these trials show that the 
treatment can be delivered much more quickly and conveniently using 
hypofractionation without compromising PSA control or toxicity so long as careful 
technique is respected.  
     
1.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)  
 
‘Stereotactic radiosurgery’ generally refers to a procedure design to treat de ep-
seated brain tumors or abnormalities, and is commonly performed on a specialized 
machine, such as the Gamma Knife.  This procedure involves immobilizing the 
patient (cranial halo), affixing a stable 3 -D coordinate system (fiducial box and head 
Version 15   10 
 frame), p erforming high resolution imaging (CT or MRI), registering the images to the 
coordinate system using a computer, virtually simulating delivery of very focal and 
conformal dose profiles of radiation with steep dose gradients toward normal tissue, 
and finall y carrying out the treatment with sub -millimeter accuracy.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_533024] (15 -40 Gy) are given in a single treatment with this 
technique.  Any adjacent normal tissues that receive this dose may be significantly 
damaged, thus the re quirement for very conformal treatments with rapid dose fall -off.  
An alternate strategy has been to divide total radiation dose into two or three 
fractions, still with fairly large dose per fraction (6 -10 Gy), attempting to decrease 
adjacent normal tissue  toxicity.  These fractionated techniques are referred to as 
‘stereotactic radiotherapy,’ and are carried out with hope that surrounding normal 
tissue will tolerate the treatment as a result of relatively more successful sublethal 
damage repair as compared  to tumor.  
 
Translation of the stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy concepts to 
extracranial sites has not been straightforward [15 -17].  With brain treatments, the 
skull serves as an excellent surface to rigidly couple the immobilization frame using  
stainless steel pi[INVESTIGATOR_424388].  Once the skull is immobilized, targets 
within the skull are likewise immobilized in that there is very little movement of 
intracranial structures outside of fluid waves around the ventricles.  Such is not the 
case for extracranial sites.  Inherent motion, such as the heart beating, lungs 
expanding and emptying, and bowels churning, results in movement of potential 
targets.  In addition, the external surface anatomy does not have structures 
amenable to rigid fix ation to a frame.  In 1994, Lax, et al, from the Karolinska 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533025] a fiducial stereotactic coordinate system along its side 
panels [18].  The system used vacuum pi[INVESTIGATOR_533026] (maximizing surface area of contact) and correlation of external 
anatomical reference points on the sternum and calf for immobilization.  To decrease 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_367117], an abdominal press was empl oyed forcing the patient to 
perform relatively more chest wall rather than diaphragmatic breathing.  A formal 
verification of reproducibility study was carried out, and target motion was reduced to 
within 0.[ADDRESS_692127] and 1.0 cm in the caudal/ cephalad plane.  With this 
degree of accuracy (compared to 0.05 cm target position accuracy for the Gamma 
Knife), stereotactic radiosurgery could not be performed; however, they did set up a 
program treating patients with extracranial stereotactic radiothe rapy.  
 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a new therapeutic paradigm for 
treating localized tumors outside of the central nervous system and involves 
delivering very high doses of focused radiation using unique beam arrangements 
and special immo bilization equipment [19].  As already demonstrated in lung and 
liver cancers, these treatments offer hope for improved local control of cancers that 
may translate into gains in survival especially for smaller early stage lesions.  SBRT 
employs daily treat ment doses dramatically higher than typi[INVESTIGATOR_533027] (CFRT).  In turn, it is incorrect to assume that SBRT 
radiobiology is similar to historical CFRT.  Indeed, a unique biology of radiation 
response for very large d ose per fraction treatments is being appreciated both in 
terms of tumor control as well as normal tissue consequences translating into unique 
clinical outcomes.  For example, local control with CFRT in early stage lung cancer 
is consistently reported below  50% while several series using SBRT show local 
control around 90% [20 -21].  
Version 15   11 
  
SBRT has been defined by [CONTACT_38978] (ACR) and American 
Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) to involve the use of very 
large dose per frac tion [22].  Indeed, dose per fraction of 8 Gy minimum would 
obviously make SBRT very different from even the more abbreviated 
hypofractionation schemes described above.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], only 1 -5 fractions are used 
for SBRT depending on the tolerance of adjacent  or intervening normal tissues.  
Linear structures (like the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) and tubular structures (like the bowels) are 
commonly called “serially functioning tissues” akin to series electrical circuits 
because their function is disrupted if there is a defec t anywhere along their pathways 
[23-24].  It has been shown that serial functioning tissues are less tolerant to SBRT 
than so -called “parallel functioning tissues” like the peripheral lung and liver.  In 
response, typi[INVESTIGATOR_533028] (e.g ., five fractions rather than one) 
when serially functioning tissue cannot be avoided.  In the case of treating prostate 
cancer, the rectum is an adjacent serially functioning tissue while the urethra is an 
intervening serially functioning tissue traversin g the very center of the prostate 
target.  
  
     1.3 Current Protocol  
 
Prostate cancer has several good treatment options for organ confined disease such 
as surgery and conventional radiation.  In addition, some men with indolent disease 
are appropriately treated with watchful waiting.  However, all of the established 
treatments continue to fail in a portion of patients via tumor recurrence.  
Furthermore, current treatments are often unpalatable for many patients because 
they are either too invasive or too inconvenient.  It has also been shown recently that 
many prostate cancers may be better controlled using large dose per fraction 
treatments such as might be delivered by [CONTACT_533060] 
(SBRT). While large dose per fraction treatments a re facilitated by [CONTACT_533061], technology cannot independently overcome normal 
tissue consequences to tubular organs adjacent or within targets (e.g., the urethra 
and rectum for prostate cancer).  As such, careful prospectiv e clinical trials must be 
designed that appropriately bridge the information learned from laboratory testing, 
historical clinical experience, and the clinical experience with SBRT from other sites 
in order to test this new therapy for prostate cancer.  Thi s is an important problem, 
since localized prostate continues to recur despi[INVESTIGATOR_533029], less toxic and more convenient treatments are necessary.  
 
As the SBRT therapy is strictly local, we will select for patients with prostate  cancer 
locally confined to the prostate gland.  As such, we will select eligibility criteria 
sanctioned in the past by [CONTACT_533062].  We will apply the Roach formula to limit eligibility to patients with under a 
20% risk of pelvic lymph node involvement.  Some patient eligible for this trial may 
have a somewhat higher risk of extraprostatic spread (e.g., T2b, Gleason 7 or 
PSA>10) and it will be allowed to use pre -treatment hormonal therapy in such 
patients at the investigator’s discretion.  Hormonal therapy may also be used to 
shrink prostates that are massively enlarged.  As the primary toxicity will likely be 
mucosal damage, we w ill avoid enrolling patients with pre -existing mucosal 
dysfunction (including those with previous radiation, TURP, very large prostate 
glands, and inflammatory bowel disease).  In this way, patients will be uniformly 
Version [ADDRESS_692128] in this population to warrant 
further clinical testing.  
 
We will use a treatment regimen carried out in 5 total fractions.  This would be a 
more tolerant regimen than our 3 f raction regimens published in liver and lung 
cancer [25 -26] and may lessen the toxicity to serial functioning tissues in close 
approximation to the prostate (rectum and urethra). Given there will be only 5 
treatments, daily enemas, rectal tubes, and even u rethral catheters for simulation 
are all feasible undertakings that may help optimize the therapy.   
 
It is predicted that the dose limiting toxicity from this treatment will likely relate to 
urethral dysfunction (e.g., ulceration, bleeding, pain, narrowin g and frank stricture) 
and rectal damage (ulceration, bleeding, chronic inflammation, and pain).  Since the 
radiotherapy target for radiotherapy of the prostate is the entire gland, the urethra 
will by [CONTACT_533063] a minimum.  In fact, the urethra may receive even a higher 
dose than the minimum target dose owing to the fact that SBRT dosimetry 
commonly includes a 10 -30 percent higher central dose within the target.  While 
wedges and other methods of modulation (including IMRT) may be used to steer this 
higher dose away from the visualized urethra, these techniques will have limited 
ability to protect the urethra.  The prostatic urethra will likely be significantly 
damaged w hich may limit dose escalation.  If it has the ability to heal by [CONTACT_533064] a diffuse untreatable stricture, the treatment may still be 
feasible.  Certainly if mucosal clonagens can migrate from the bulbous urethra and 
bladder to “rescue” the prostatic urethra after SBRT, care will be taken to spare dose 
to those structures [24].  In regard to the rectum, the treatments will be carried out 
with a rec tal tube to separate much of the circumference of the rectal wall from the 
prostate target.  This rectal tube must be positioned appropriately above the anus 
and extend superiorly to above the prostate to be effective.  In addition, the rectum 
should be ev acuated of feces to avoid confounding the geometry prior to each 
treatment.  If the dose to the rectum is tightly confined to the anterior wall next to the 
target, it is hoped that the ulcer likely to be produced will heal by [CONTACT_533065] b lood supply from the lateral and posterior walls.  Indeed, a 
precedent for assuming such a process exists with the reported treatment of small 
rectal cancers using an endorectal orthovoltage tube by [CONTACT_533066][INVESTIGATOR_533030] 
[27].  In that experience, doses as high as [ADDRESS_692129] toxicity owing to the extremely localized high dose 
dosimetry.   
 
1.4 Who Would Benefit from this Treatment?  
 
As noted above, there are several quite good but not perfect treatments for organ 
confined prostate cancer that have significant follow -up and published experience as 
well as an option for watchful waiting.  Still, there are populations that mi ght find the 
invasiveness of surgery and brachytherapy implants less ideal and the 
inconvenience of IMRT and [ADDRESS_692130] evidence of tolerance by a similar 
treatment strategy has been presented by [CONTACT_533067] 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions of  6.7 Gy were delivered using SBRT 
in men with early stage prostate cancer [28].  That dose was tolerated without grade 
III or higher toxicity, but had rather poor PSA control [personal communication, Berit 
Madsen, M.D., 5/05).  Although not using SBRT tech niques, Collins and colleagues 
used a 6 fraction regimen to 36 Gy at 6 Gy per fraction with more conventional 
external beam delivery techniques which again was well tolerated [29 -30].  A similar 
but more invasive treatment approach to SBRT is the high dose  rate (HDR) implant 
experience which gives large dose per fraction treatments on a daily basis through 
implanted brachytherapy catheters.  Indeed the heterogeneous target dosimetry is 
similar in many ways to SBRT.  While HDR has mostly been used as a boost  
treatment after conventional external beam treatment, there is institutional data from 
Martinez and colleagues using HDR as monotherapy.  That group at the William 
Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533031] a 4 fraction regimen of 9.5 Gy to a total dose of 38 Gy and 
publishe d an acceptable toxicity profile in treated patients [31 -32].  Grills, et al. 
reported an update of these results of HDR monotherapy for the management of 65 
patients with T1a -T2b, and total Gleason Score 7 or less.  The preliminary 
biochemical PSA control  rate was 98% at [ADDRESS_692131] 103Pd low dose rate brachytherapy [40].  In a similar 
experience using HDR, Yashioka and colleagues from Japan used higher total 
doses up to [ADDRESS_692132] toxicity [33 -34].  Considering all of these experiences as basis for 
dose selection, we will use a starting dose of [ADDRESS_692133] 
dose per fraction escalation of 0.5 Gy (e.g., 9 Gy to 9.5 Gy to 10 Gy per fraction, 
etc).  We hope to reach as high of biologically potent dose as possible without 
exceeding tolerance (i.e., a [ADDRESS_692134] 100 Gy) that would be 
delivered in around 2 weeks rather than 10 -12 weeks as would be required with 
conventional fractionation.

2.0  OBJECTIVES  
2.1 In phase I, to the primary objective is to escalate the dose of stereotactic radiotherapy 
to a tumor cidal dose without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with 
organ confined prostate cancer.  
 
2.2 In phase I, a secondary objective is to determine the dose -limiting toxicity (if the 
maximum tolerated dose is reached).  
 
2.3 In phase II, the pri mary objective is to determine the l ate severe grade 3 -5 GU and GI 
toxicity from 270 -540 days (i.e., 9 -18 months) from the start of the protocol treatment. It 
is graded based on CTCAE v3.0.    
 
2.4 In phase II, secondary objectives will be to determine the  2 year biochemical (PSA) 
control (freedom from PSA failure), disease free and overall survival, local control, 
freedom from distant metastases, and the incidence of high grade adverse events of 
any type from the therapy in the treated patients in order to  determine if the therapy 
is promising enough for further clinical investigation.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_692135] hav e appropriate staging studies identifying them as AJCC 
stage T1 (a, b, or c) or T2 (a and b only) adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. The 
patient should not have direct evidence of regional or distant metastases after 
appropriate staging studies.  Histol ogic confirmation of cancer will be required by 
[CONTACT_9256].  
 
3.3 The patient’s Zubrod performance status must be 0 -2 
 
3.4 The Gleason score should be less than or equal to 7  
 
3.5 The serum PSA should be less than or equal to 20 ng/ml prior to starting hormonal  
therapy (if given) for patients with Gleason score 2 -6.  For patients with Gleason 
score of 7, PSA should be less than or equal to 15 ng/ml prior to starting hormonal 
therapy (if given).  As such, the risk of pelvic lymph node involvement according to 
the Roach formula would be under 20%.

5.3 Accreditation  
5.3.1  Institutional Processes  
Prior to treating patients on protocol, the institution’s specific methods for 
immobilization (e.g., frame vs. framel ess), targeting, dose construction, daily 
verification of accuracy, ongoing assessment of accuracy and Quality Assurance 
policies must be described to and approved by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_533033].  The primary purpose of accreditation will be to insure that dose is 
delivered to the targets and avoiding normal tissues according to protocol criteria.  
This accreditation may be assessed by [CONTACT_424445], conference calls, or 
direct observation via site visits.  Additional data may be required of institutions to 
verify that techniques are performing as intended.  
  
6.0 RADIATION THERAP Y 
6.1 Dose Specifications  
6.1.1  Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
The term “stereotactic” for the purposes of this protocol implies the targeting, 
planning, and directing of therapy using beams of radiation along any trajectory in 
3-D space guided by [CONTACT_533069] [ADDRESS_692145] skin 
marks or bon y landmarks and assumed to correlate to the actual tumor target 
based on a historical simulation.  It should be understood that Stereotactic Body 
Version 15   17 
 Radiation Therapy (SBRT) has become a treatment that is well beyond just 
stereotactic targeting.   Indeed SBRT  is mostly about ablative range dose per 
fraction, accounting properly for errors including motion, careful construction of 
dosimetry that compacts high dose into the tumor and not normal tissues, and 
extra careful treatment conduct.  This protocol will re quire treatments to be 
conducted with the use of a fixed 3 -D coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_424446].  The 
coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_533070] (e.g., couch and gantry) in a reproducible and  secure 
fashion.   Capability should exist to define the position of targets within the patient 
according to this same [ADDRESS_692146] an isocent er or 
target according to the known 3 -D coordinates as determined in the process of 
treatment planning.  The nature of the fiducials themselves may include radio -
opaque markers or rods placed at known locations in a frame or fixed structure 
adjacent to the  patient as well as use of the tumor itself as a fiducial (e.g. acquiring 
tomographic views of the tumor simultaneously with the treatment).  Metallic 
“seeds” or markers placed within the tumor will be allowed so long as they are not 
prone to migration mov ement.   
6.1.2  Dose Fractionation  
Patients will receive 5 fractions of radiation.  A minimum of 36 hours and a 
maximum of 8 days should separate each treatment.  No more than 3 fractions will 
be delivered per week (7 consecutive days).  Total dose will dep end on the phase 
of the study (see schema).  
6.1.3  Premedications  
Unless contraindicated, it is recommended that all patients receive corticosteroid 
premedication (e.g. Decadron 4 mg p.o. in a single dose, or equivalent) 15 -60 
minutes prior to each of the f ive treatments for the intended purpose of modulating 
immediate acute inflammatory effects. It is strongly recommended that all patients 
be treated prophylactically with drugs intended to avoid urinary retention 
associated with SBRT.  This class of drugs i nclude alpha blockers (e.g., tamsulosin 
aka Flomax, doxazosin aka Cardura, terazosin aka Hytrin, etc) and 5 -alpha 
reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride aka Proscar, dutasteride aka Avodart, etc), or 
drugs with similar intended effect.  It is recommended to start the therapy at least 
one day prior o the first SBRT treatment and continue for [ADDRESS_692147] doses for obstructive 
indications, and contraindications to these drugs should be respe cted.  Analgesic 
premedication, such as Tylenol 650 mg 30 minutes prior to therapy and as needed 
every 6 hours, to avoid general discomfort during long treatment durations also is 
recommended when appropriate.   
6.1.4  Supportive medicines  
Consider Tamsulos in (e.g., Flomax) during treatment period to reduce urinary 
symptoms.  Consider using 5 -alpha reductase inhibitor like Finasteride (e.g. 
Proscar) to relieve potential obstructive issues.  For both drugs, standard doses 
will be utilized as needed unless con traindicated. Also consider 1 tablespoon of 
Milk of Magnesia, taken the night before simulation/treatment ( Note: Inform patient 
that this will cause diarrhea ). Fleet’s enema should be taken 2 hrs , before 
simulation/treatment. An antibiotic (Bactrim or simi lar) may be prescribed to 
alleviate UTI if necessary.  This should be taken at standard doses as needed.  
6.2 Technical Factors  
6.2.1  Physical Factors  
Version 15   18 
 Only photon (x -ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_533071], betatrons, or microtron 
accelerators with photo n energies 6 -21 MV will be allowed.  Cobalt -60 and charged 
particle beams (including electrons, protons, and heavier ions) are not allowed.  
6.2.1  Dose Verification at Treatment  
Personal dosimeter measurements (e.g. diode, TLD, etc.) may be obtained for 
surface dose verification for accessible beams as per institutional preference.  This 
information is not required by [CONTACT_760].  
6.3 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
6.3.1  Patient Positioning  
Patients will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a stable posit ion capable of allowing accurate 
reproducibility of the target position from treatment to treatment.  Positions 
uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled 
movement during treatments.  A variety of immobilization systems m ay be utilized 
including stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three sides and large 
rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients external contours) with reference to the 
stereotactic coordinate system (see Section 6.1).  All positioning systems must b e 
validated and accredited by [CONTACT_49005] (Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_533034]) prior to enrolling or treating patients on this trial.  Patient 
immobilization must be reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume 
(GTV) does not dev iate beyond the confines of the Planning Treatment Volume 
(PTV) as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_692148] of i nternal organ 
motion (i.e., breathing, etc.) on target positioning and reproducibility.  In some 
cases, the intrafractional tumor motion is small and no special maneuvers are 
required to achieve motion limits as defined in section 6.4 (this may be true for  
many cases of prostate cancer).  Treating in the prone position will accentuate 
internal organ motion problems related to breathing and should be avoided unless 
special measures are taken to account for this motion.  When accounting for 
intrafractional mo tion, acceptable maneuvers including reliable abdominal 
compression, accelerator beam gating with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], and active 
breath -holding techniques. Internal organ inhibition maneuvers must be reliable 
enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume  (GTV) does not deviate beyond the 
confines of the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in Section 6.4 with 
any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  Assessment of this motion will be left to the 
institution and may included identifying the position  of radio -opaque seeds 
implanted into the prostate prior to each treatment.  This type of interfractional 
motion analysis with correction is only required by [CONTACT_533072].  Intrafraction assessment during the course of eac h treatment 
(dynamic and adaptive maneuvers) is allowed and encouraged especially if 
treatment times are long.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_692149] method of localization of the prostate gland than conventional 
treatment (i.e., one that uses skin and boney landmarks solely as a surrogate to 
the prostate position) must be used in this protocol.  Acceptable methods would 
include daily ultrasound or placing a radio -opaque seed or marker that can be 
visualized and triangulated using dual  imaging or markers that emit a signal that 
can me used to detect position electronically all placed prior to simulation and 
planning.  Also, it would be acceptable to perform computed tomography such as 
axial, spi[INVESTIGATOR_533035] t reatment position to 
Version 15   19 
 identify the tumor target directly.  Image quality should be good enough to identify 
the prostate borders.  
 
In addition to the identification of the prostate in the preceding paragraph, the 
rectum should also be identified and reliably  repositioned with a large (e.g., around 
60 cc) rectal tube.  Prior to positioning at least 30 minutes and no more than 2 
hours before each treatment, patients should undergo an effective bowel 
evacuation.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this will involve 1 -2 fleet’s enemas.  This maneuver is to 
clear the rectum of stool and significant gas accumulation.  Just prior to 
relocalization and treatment, a rectal tube filled with air should be introduced into 
the rectum to both visualize the rectum and separate the anterior and post erior 
walls.  The rectal balloon and implementation plan must be approved by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_533036].  
 
Isocenter port localization films (anterior/posterior and lateral) should be obtained 
at each treatment on the treatment unit (or patients should undergo a t omographic 
imaging study utilizing the linear accelerator couch, if available) immediately before 
treatment to ensure proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., isocenter) of the 
simulated fields.   Verification CT scans and portal films may be taken at the 
discretion of the participating institution, but are not required for protocol 
participation.  
6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
6.4.1  Image Acquisition  
Computed Tomography (CT) will be the primary image platform for targeting and 
treatment plann ing.  The planning CT scans must allow simultaneous view of the 
patient anatomy and fiducial system for stereotactic targeting.  Treatment planning 
images should be performed in the treatment position using all aids/maneuvers 
described above including uret hral tube, bladder contrast, urethrogram, and rectal 
balloon after bowel evacuation with enemas.  The treatment planning scans must 
use a small caliber radio -opaque urethral catheter to allow visualization of the 
prostatic urethra as it will be a high dose  spi[INVESTIGATOR_533037] 6.4.2 below. Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 
degrees will be required with spacing ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_692150] the contours.  CTV target volume 
(entire prostate g land) will be outlined by [CONTACT_360893].  The 
target will generally be drawn using CT soft tissue windows.  An additional 0.[ADDRESS_692151] (cranio -caudal) will 
be added to the GTV t o constitute the planning treatment volume (PTV) depending 
on the institution’s accuracy and treating physician’s preference.  
6.4.2  Dosimetry  
Three -dimensional coplanar or non -coplanar 3 -D beam, arc rotation, or Intensity 
Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) beam  arrangements will be custom designed for 
each case to deliver highly conformal prescription dose distributions.  Non -
Version 15   20 
 opposing, non -coplanar beams are preferable.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 10 -15 beams of radiation 
will be used with roughly equal weighting.  Generally, m ore beams are used for 
larger lesion sizes.  When static beams are used, a minimum of 10 non -opposing 
beams should be used.  For arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 300 degrees 
(cumulative for all beams) should be utilized.  For this protocol, the isocen ter is 
defined as the common point of gantry and couch rotation for the treatment unit. 
Field aperture size and shape should correspond nearly identically to the projection 
of the PTV along a beam’s eye view (i.e. no additional “margin” for dose build up a t 
the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws beyond the PTV).  As such, prescription lines 
covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 60 -90% line (rather than 95 -100%); however, 
higher isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to occur within the target and not 
in adja cent normal tissue.  The isocenter in stereotactic coordinates will be 
determined from system fiducials (or directly from the tumor) and translated to the 
treatment record.  
 
The treatment dose plan will be made up of multiple static beams or arcs as 
descri bed above.  The plan should be normalized to a defined point corresponding 
closely to the center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the 
isocenter of the beam rotation; however, it is not a protocol requirement for this 
point to be the isocenter.  Regardless, the point identified as COM PTV must have 
defined stereotactic coordinates and receive 100% of the normalized dose.  
Because the beam apertures coincide nearly directly with the edge of the PTV 
(little or no added margin), the ex ternal border of the PTV will be covered by a 
lower isodose surface than usually used in conventional radiotherapy planning, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 80% but ranging from 60 -90%.  The prescription dose in five 
fractions will be delivered to the margin of the PTV a nd fulfill the requirements 
below.  As such, a “hot spot” will exist within the PTV centrally at the COM PTV with 
a magnitude of the prescription dose times the reciprocal of the chosen 
prescription isodose line (i.e., 60 -90%).  
 
For purposes of dose plannin g and calculation of monitor units for actual treatment, 
all tissues within the body should be modeled in the planning system as to their 
electron density.  Proper heterogeneity correction algorithms should be approved 
by [CONTACT_978].  
  
Successful treatment pla nning will require accomplishment of all of the following 
criteria:   
1) Normalization   
The treatment plan should be normalized such that 100% corresponds to the 
center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV).  This point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_424430] 
(but is not requir ed to correspond) to the isocenter of the treatment beams.  
2) Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage  
The prescription isodose surface will be chosen such that 95% of the target 
volume (PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_533073] 
99% of  the target volume (PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the 
prescription dose.  
3) Target Dose Heterogeneity  
The prescription isodose surface selected in number 2 (above) must be ≥ 
60% of the dose at the center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV) and ≤ 90% of the 
dose a t the center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV). The COM PTV corresponds to 
the normalization point (100%) of the plan as noted in 1) above.  
Version 15   21 
 4) High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]  
a)  Location  
Any dose greater than 105% of the prescription dose should occur 
primarily within the PT V itself and not within the normal tissues outside 
of the PTV.  Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outside of 
the PTV receiving a dose greater than 105% of prescription dose 
should be no more than 15% of the PTV volume.  However, if 
possible, a ttempts should be made to avoid higher than the 
prescription isodose to the prostatic urethra within the prostate.  
Ideally, these hot spots will be manipulated to occur within the 
peripheral zones of the prostate.  IMRT and other techniques will be 
encour aged to accomplish this goal.  
b)  Volume  
Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of the 
volume of the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1) through 4) to the 
volume of the PTV is ideally less than 1.3.  
 
5) Respect all critical organ dose -volume limits listed in Section 6.5.1 below.  
6) Urethral “hot spot” avoidance.  It is recommended that efforts be made by [CONTACT_533074].  The prostatic urethra should be id entified as an avoidance structure 
such that dose beyond the prescription dose ideally does not fall on this 
structure.  As an example, if the treatment dose covering the PTV 
corresponds to the 80% isodose line for a given patient, hot spots of 20% 
higher dose will exist within the prostate.  The intensity modulation techniques 
should be employed to distribute these hot spots away from the prostatic 
urethra and more into the peripheral zones of the prostate.  Part of the 
rationale for daily image guidance o n this protocol is to carry out this intention 
of avoiding a “hot spot” to the urethra in practice during treatment as depi[INVESTIGATOR_533038].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Cauda Equina  
The cauda equina will be contoured as one structure based on t he bony limits of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470].  The cauda equina should be contoured starting superiorly at 
the bottom of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] L2 and terminal at the inferior 
extent of the thecal sac (typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] S3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sacral Plexus  
The left and right sacral plexus will be contoured collectively as one structure.  
The location of the sacral plexus will be approximated by [CONTACT_533075] S1 -S3 including contouring within 
the sacral foramina, posteri orly along the limits of the true pelvis, laterally to 2 -3 
Version 15   23 
 cm lateral to the sacral foramina, and anteriorly about 3 -5 mm from the posterior 
limits of the countour.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Peri-prostatic R ectal wall  
The circumference of the rectum adjacent to the prostate  will be divided into 4 
equal quadrants (anterior, left lateral, right lateral, and posterior).  Assigning [ADDRESS_692153], the 
dividing lines between each quadrant will occur at 45, 135, 225, a nd 315 
degrees.  The right and left lateral walls will be combined into a single structure.  
Only the rectal wall will be included in these contours, not the contents of the 
lumen.  Patients will be treated with a rectal balloon filling the lumen which 
should therefore not be included in the contours.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_692154] above the anal sphincter, the anterior quadrant of the 
rectal wall (from 315 to 45 degrees) should be contoured (absent the lumen) 
up to 1  cm above the superior extent of the prostate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_692155] above the anal sphincter, the lateral quadrant of the 
rectal wall (from 45 to 135 degrees and also from 225 to 315 degrees) should 
be conto ured (absent the lumen) up to 1 cm above the superior extent of the 
prostate.  These two structures should be combined as a single structure for 
purposes of dose volume analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_692156] above  the anal sphincter, the posterior quadrant of the 
rectal wall (from 135 to 225 degrees) should be contoured (absent the lumen) 
up to 1 cm above the superior extent of the prostate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rectum Superior to Prostate  
Starting inferiorly at the superior ex tent of the Peri -prostatic Rectal Wall 
described above, the entire wall and lumen of the rectum should be contoured 
up to the level of the sacral promontory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Small Intestine  
The small intestines should be contoured as a conglomerate of all bowel lo ops 
within each CT cut starting at the first appearance of small intestine in the pelvis 
and extending superiorly up to the level of the sacral promontory within each cut.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prostatic Urethra  
The prostatic urethra will be identified by [CONTACT_533076] c atheter plus [ADDRESS_692157] of the prostatic urethra coincides with 
the apex of the prostate (urethrograms may be helpful in identifying the apex).  The 
superior aspect of the prostatic urethra coincides w ith the base of the prostate at the 
bladder inlet.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bladder  
The bladder should be contoured in its entirety absent its contents.  As such, 
only the wall of the bladder is included in the dose volume analysis.  The bladder

10.3  Criteria for Toxicity  
10.3.1   All acute and late adverse events from protocol ra diation therapy will be reported 
and scored for severity using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Version 15   28 
 Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. A copy of the CTCAE v3.0 can be downloaded from 
the CTEP home page ( http://c tep.info.nih.gov ). 
 
Please note that this study will not be using separate toxicity scales for 
acute and late radiation adverse events.  
 
10.4  Measurement of Response  
10.4.1   Although not required, it is encouraged that prostate tumor dimensions in 
centim eters or grams be recorded on the data collection forms for the follow up 
evaluations.  PSA levels should be obtained per study calendar.  
10.4.2   After study entry, disease evaluations will be made and recorded using the 
following criteria:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  No Evi dence of Disease (NED): No clinical evidence of disease on digital rectal 
examination and no PSA failure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Equivocal Disease (ED): This rating will be assigned under the following 
circumstances:  
1) If abnormalities are present on the prostate digit al rectal examination but are 
thought to be abnormal due to treatment and felt not to represent tumor.  
2) If clinical evidence of residual tumor is present but this has regressed from a 
previous examination (initial registration).  
3) PSA 2.1 - 4 ng/mL.  Re biopsy is required, before starting hormone therapy, in 
any patient with PSA failure but with negative bone scan and CT scans. If the 
biopsy is negative, then they will be scored as NED.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive disease will be declar ed if one or more of 
the following criteria are met:  
1) Clinical evidence in the prostate gland of disease progression or recurrence.  
2) Clinical or radiographic evidence of tumor recurrence within the pelvic 
lymphatics or soft tissue beneath the bifurcati on of the common iliac arteries,  
3) Clinical or radiographic evidence of hematogenous (osseous, hepatic, etc.) 
and/or extrapelvic lymphatic of soft tissue relapse.  
 
10.5 Other Response Parameters  
10.5.1   Disease -Free Interval: The disease -free interval wil l be measured from the date of 
accession to the date of documentation of progression or until the date of death 
(from other causes).  
10.5.2  Time to Biochemical Failure: The RTOG -ASTRO definition (also known as the 
Phoenix definition) of PSA failure will be  used. Thus, when the PSA rises by [CONTACT_726] 
2 ng/ml above the lowest level (nadir) achieved after treatment, biochemical failure has 
occurred and the date of the failure is recorded at the time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml level 
is reached.  
10.5.3   Time to Loca l Progression: The time to progression will be measured from the date 
of study entry to the date of documented local progression as determined by 
[CONTACT_461].  
10.5.4   Time to Distant Failure: The time to distant failure will be measured from the date 
of study entry to the date of documented regional nodal recurrence or distant 
disease relapse. Patients with evidence of biochemical failure, but a negative 
prostate biopsy, will be considered as distant failure only.  
10.5.5   Overall Survival: The survival ti me will be measured from the date of accession to 
the date of death. All patients will be followed for survival. Every effort should be 
made to document the cause of death.  
Version 15   29 
 10.5.6   Disease -Specific Survival Disease -specific survival will be measured from t he date 
of study entry to the date of death due to prostate cancer. The following will be 
considered as failure events in assessing disease specific survival:  
Death certified as due to prostatic cancer.  
Death from other causes with active malignancy (clini cal or biochemical 
progression).  
Death due to complications of treatment, irrespective of the status of 
malignancy.  
Death from other causes with previously documented relapse (either clinical or 
biochemical) but inactive at the time of death will not be co nsidered in 
disease -specific survival, but will be analyzed separately.  
10.5.7  Responsibilities of the Medical Monitor:  
The medical monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others, serious adverse events and all subje ct deaths associated with the 
protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event.  At a minimum, the 
medical monitor must comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and in case 
of a serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship  to participation in 
the study.  The medical monitor must also indicate whether he/she concurs with the 
details of the report provided by [CONTACT_458].  Reports for events 
determined by [CONTACT_533078] y or definitely 
related to participation and reports of events resulting in death must be promptly 
forwarded to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC ORP HRPO.

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 13.1 Phase I Study Endpoints  
13.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the phase I portion is to either reach the maximum to lerated 
dose (MTD ) or a dose of 50 Gy total (whichever comes first) by [CONTACT_533079] 50 Gy total .  Patients will be treated in cohorts of 
seven to fifteen,..  Toxicity will be graded using the NCI Common Toxicity  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 3.0.  A dose - limiting toxicity (DLT) is any treatment -
related grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity in the following categories (specific conditions listed 
in section 6.9):  gastrointestinal, renal, genito -urinary, sexual - reproductive, or 
neurological.  A DLT will also include any treatment -related grade 4 or 5 toxicity 
related in the following categories (specific conditions listed in section 6.9):  
constitutional symptoms.  In addition, any other grade [ADDRESS_692171] occurred.   Doses will be escalated an additional 0.5 Gy per treatme nt for 
5 treatments (total 2.5 Gy per increment).  The phase I portion of the study will be 
completed when either of the following events occur:  1) the MTD for a cohort is 
reached or 2) when the highest protocol dose level is treated and tolerated (10 Gy 
per fraction, total 50 Gy) where we consider the therapy likely to be tumorcidal per 
determination of the investigators.  
13.1.2  Phase I Dose Escalation  
The phase I study is designed to end if the rate of DLTs within 90 days from the start 
of treatment is 3 3% or higher.  For each dose level cohorts, a total of seven to fifteen 
patients will be enrolled.  If zero out of the first seven with [ADDRESS_692172] two of nine patients  
will experience a DLT when the true rate of acute DLTs is 33% is 0.80; that is, the 
probability of making the correct decision if the true DLT rate is at least 33% is 0.80.   
 
The sample size of the phase I component of this study will not exceed [ADDRESS_692173] seven (7) patients enrolled to a specific dose level, then dose escalation 
to the next level may proceed.  Patients will continue to be enrolled to  each dose 
level (up to a maximum of 15 patients) with ongoing assessment of those reaching 
90 day follow -up so long as either criteria for defining the MTD (section 13.1.2) or 
criteria for further dose escalation is not reached.  If fifteen patients are enrolled to a 
given dose level yet criteria for adequate  follow -up are not reached in a 
representative sample of patients (section 13.1.2), further enrollment to the protocol 
will be suspended until adequate follow -up is reached.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_692174] dose from the phase I study.  
13.2.1  Primary Endpoint  
Late severe GU and GI toxicity is defined as grade 3 -5 GU and GI toxicity occurring 
between 270 -540 days (i.e., 9 -18 months) from the start of the protocol treatment. It is 
graded based on CTCAE v3.0 .  Grade 3 -5 GU or GI toxicity that originally occurred prior 
to 270 days from start of protocol treatment will only be considered late severe GU or GI 
toxicity if it persists at a severity grade of 3 -5 based on CTCAE v3.0 after 270 days.  
13.2.2   Secondary  Endpoints  
• Acute severe GU and GI toxicity is defined as grade 3 -5 toxicity occurring prior to 270 
days from the start of protocol treatment. It is graded based on CTCAE v3.0.  
• Non GU and GI toxicity.  
• Biochemical failure RTOG -ASTRO definition (also kn own as Phoenix definition) - Thus, 
when the PSA rises by [CONTACT_726] 2 ng/ml above the lowest level (nadir) achieved after 
treatment,, biochemical failure has occurred and the date of the failure is recorded at the 
time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml level is reache d.  
• Overall survival  
• Disease -specific survival  
• Clinical progression including local/regional and distant relapse  
 
13.3 Sample Size  
13.3.1 Overview : The primary goal of this study is to estimate the rate of late grade 3 -5 
genitourinary and gastrointes tinal toxicity following treatment with stereotactic body 
radiation therapy.  For purposes of this phase II study, late toxicity will be defined as 
toxicity occurring 270 -540 days (i.e., 9 -18 months) from the start of radiotherapy. It is 
graded based on CT CAE v 3.0.  
13.3.2 Sample Size Derivation : The phase II component of this study is designed to test 
whether late GU/GI toxicity at 270 -540 days from the start of treatment following the 
protocol treatment is above 10%. The sample size is determined so that the probability 
of rejecting the treatment because of excessive late toxicity is 90% if the true late toxicity 
rate is 23% or higher. Assuming an exponential distribution for time from the end of the 
acute period (270 days from the start of protocol treatm ent) to the occurrence of late 
toxicity, the hazard rate for the expected 10% toxicity rate and the unacceptable 23% 
toxicity rate is 0.006/month and 0.015/month, respectively. Following the asymptotic 
property of the observed hazard and using Z -test for t he logarithm of the hazard ratio 
[35-36], we require 12 cases with severe late GU/GI toxicity. Thus, 47 patients are 
required to be accrued within three to four years and be followed for 270 days after the 
acute period (i.e., a total of 540 days) to have a  statistical power of 90% with a one -sided 
significance level of 0.05. Considering 5% ineligible cases and lack -of-data cases, the 
sample size of the phase II component of this study is [ADDRESS_692175] 270 days 
(i.e., 9 months) of follow -up from the end of the acute period, a total of 540 days (i.e., 18 
month s) of follow -up. For the secondary endpoint of biochemical failure, an additional [ADDRESS_692176] discontinued follow -up procedures. Blood drawn for 
translation research will be kept indefinitely or until exhausted.  
 
13.5 Analysis Plan  
 Interim Reports : Interim reports will be prepared every six months until the resul ts of the 
study are published.  In general, the interim reports will contain information about patient 
accrual rate with projected completion dates of the trial, status of QA review and 
compliance rate of treatment per protocol, and the frequencies and sev erity of toxicity.  
13.5.2 The Analysis of Severe Late GU/GI Toxicity : This analysis will be carried out when each 
patient has had at least 270 days (i.e., 9 months) of follow -up after the end of the acute 
period, a total of 540 days (i.e., 18 months) of fo llow-up. The time to the occurrence of 
severe late GU/GI toxicity is defined as the time interval from start of protocol treatment 
to the date of onset of grade 3 -5 GU/GI toxicity.   The time analysis for recording severe 
late GU/GI toxicity for this proto col will be limited to [ADDRESS_692177] rate of 0.006/month with variance equal to the 
reciprocal of  the number of cases with late toxicity observed. Because of the lead time of 
9 months for the acute period, the 18 -month late toxicity will be estimated by [CONTACT_941] 9 -
month toxicity rate using the cumulative incidence approach [37] to the defined time to 
sever e late GU/GI toxicity.  
13.5.3 Estimation of Secondary Endpoints Related to the Efficacy : Cumulative incidence 
approach [37]  will be used to estimate the failure rate for biochemical, disease -specific, 
local-regional and distant failures. Kaplan -Meier metho d [38] will used to estimate the 
overall survival rate.

14.[ADDRESS_692178] the ability to critically review toxicity events.  This study will use 
this committee to perform ongoing safety assessment at regular defin ed intervals defined in 
the statistics section of this protocol.  Unexpected toxicities occurring between defined 
interim analyses points will be reported to the treating center’s IRB and also to the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern IRB.  
 
14.2 Early Stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_533045] I, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_533046].  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_533047], defined as grade 3 - 5 toxicity related to the following organ systems:  
gastrointestinal, renal, genitor -urinary, sexual, reproductive, neurological, blood, bone 
marrow, or constitutional symptoms OR any other grade 4 or 5 toxicity attributed to the 
therapy occurring in 30% or mo re of treated patients.  If a single patient has more than one 
unacceptable toxicity, they will only be counted as one unacceptable toxicity for this 
analysis.   
 
Three interim analyses of toxicity are planned after 25% (12 patients), 50% (24 patients), 
and 75% (36 patients) of the total number of evaluable patients to be accrued in phase II.  
These interim analyses will be done after patients have finished their toxicity assessment 
periods for each group (i.e., [ADDRESS_692179] therapy follow -up). 
 
The foll owing early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_533048] 10% in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the toxicity rate is at least 30% with an 
overall Type I error rate of no more than 0.055: 
 
[ADDRESS_692180] 47 evaluable patients will be used for this analysis.  
 
If the number of unacceptable toxicities observed demonstrate via the monitoring rules 
above that the  treatment -related unacceptable to xicity rate is 30% or more, consideration 
Version 15   34 
 will be initiated for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  In this case, the study chair, study PIs, and 
statistician will review the toxicity data along with the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and 
make appropriate recommendatio ns about continuing the study.   Additionally, the 
treatment -related unacceptable toxicity rate will continued to be monitored during the five 
year follow -up period.  If the unacceptable toxicity rate exceeds 30% at any time during the 
five year follow -up period, the study chair, study PIs, and statistician will review the toxicity 
data along with the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and make appropriate 
recommendations about reporting the information.

 The standard -of-care for medically  refractory  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188392].  In certain  patients,  
precise  localization  of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188393]  (iEEG)  recording.  In this type 
of EEG  recording,  electrodes  are placed  on the brain  surface  or inserted  into the brain  through  an 
opening  in the skull.  In addition  to standard  electrode  recording,  several  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188394].  Microelectrodes  are only several  
micrometers  thick  and are uniquely  useful  because  they are able to record  the activity  of single  neurons  
in isolation.  Such  recording  has tremendous  clinical  potential  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_188395].  This IRB study  plan outlines  our clinical  and research  
interests  in the use of FDA  approved,  commercially  available,  dual macro -micro  electrode  system  in 
patients  who require  intracranial  EEG  recording  prior  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].  
We have  two fundamental  objectives  and hypotheses.  Our first objective  is to investigate  the usefulness  
of microelectrode  technology  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].  We hypothesize  that microelectrode  recording  will 
provide  unique  and novel  information  on the specific  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188396].  
Our long-term aim is to improve  our paradigms  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].   Our second  objective  is to 
investigate  the activity  of single  neurons  during  specific  cognitive  tasks.  We hypothesize  that such 
analysis  will help to predict  possible  cognitive  deficits  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_188397].  
Patients  who have  recurrent  unprovoked  seizures  despi[INVESTIGATOR_188398]  (1). This condition  affects  approximately  30% of all
patients  diagnosed  with focal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188399].  The standard  of care for this group  of 
patients  is referral  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_188400]  (2). Each  patient  referred  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_188401]  a pre-surgical  evaluation  with 
a goal of precise  localization  of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188402].  The pre-surgical  evaluation  frequently  requires  the recording  of 
seizures  using  intracranial  EEG  (iEEG).  In this technique,  specially  designed  electrodes  are surgically  
implanted  into target  regions  of the patient's  brain  by a trained  neurosurgeon  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_188403].  IEEG  recording  has a long track  record  of being  an effective  method  of seizure  localization  
(3) with a complication  rate of 2-4% (4,5).  This method  has been used successfully  at the DHMC  
CPHS  Template  v. 5.13.2009  
Study  Plan v30Mar2020;  D-HH#[ADDRESS_222495].  Although  macroelectrode  iEEG  recording  is the 
mainstay  of surgical  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188404],  significant  limitations  are known.  
 
Currently,  several  well-established  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188405]  (for instance,  UCLA  and Mayo  
Clinic)  are investigating  the use of microelectrode  systems  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_188406].   Microelectrodes  are ultra thin filament  electrodes  with tip diameters  
of [ADDRESS_222496]  iEEG  recording  with single  unit recording  is to obtain  
additional  information  about  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188407].  Initial  
research  in this area was done  in the 1980’s  at UCLA  Medical  Center  where  microelectrode  recordings  of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_188408],  coupled  neuronal  firing,  and increased  
local  inhibition  (6, 7). At the same  center  in the 1990’s  high frequency  oscillations  called  fast ripples  
were  recorded  in patients  undergoing  pre-surgical  evaluation  (8, 9) and Braquin  et al Annals  of 
Neurology  2002).  Fast ripples  are ultra-fast neuronal  oscillations  in the [ADDRESS_222497]  
been  proposed  to be the exclusive  signatures  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_188409]  (10).  Most  recently,  dual macro - 
micro  system  to record  fast ripples  and determined  that they frequently  appeared  in the microelectrode  
recording  and were  not apparent  in the standard  macroelectrode  recording  (11).  These  findings  suggest  
that fast ripples  are generated  by [CONTACT_188450].  Therefore,  single  unit recording  may offer  clinically  
relevant  information  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].  
 
A second  yet no less important  aim of recording  single  unit potentials  is to gain better  understanding  of 
the role of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188410].  Once  localization  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_188411],  the functional  role of this cortex  and possible  cognitive  deficits  following  resection  must  be 
established.   Present  paradigms  require  assessment  of cognitive  function  during  the electrical  
stimulation  of macroelectrode  contacts  which  can establish  the eloquence  of the underlying  cortex.  
Recording  of single  unit potentials  with microelectrodes  during  specifically  designed  neuropsychological  
tasks  may offer  unique  insight  into the function  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_188409].  For example,  studies  done  at 
UCLA  Medical  Center  have shown  that the recording  of single  unit potentials  during  specific  memory  
tasks  has provided  relevant  information  regarding  the functional  state of the hippocampus  (12).  
Therefore,  recording  of single  unit potential  during  specific  cognitive  tasks  may provide  important  
information  on the functional  integrity  of the region  of the brain  where  resection  is planned.  
 
A third  aim of recording  single  unit potentials  is to investigate  the activity  of single  neurons  during  
specific  cognitive  tasks.  For instance,  single  unit recording  from  the hippocampus  using  the dual macro - 
micro  electrode  system  during  specific  cognitive  tasks  has generated  a novel  insight  into the organization  
of the human  semantic  memory  system  (13).  Currently,  patients  at DHMC  undergoing  iEEG  recording

Use a level  of detail  similar  to what  would  be used when  submitting  an article  for publication  in a peer 
reviewed  journal.  Explain  the study  procedures,  data collection,  and analysis  process.  Please  define  
terms  and explain  concepts  which  might  be confusing  to reviewers  who are not expert  in the area of the 
study.  If a formal  protocol  for the study  exists,  page references  to the protocol  are acceptable.  
 
 
Patient  selection.  Patients  with medically  refractory  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188416].  The first stage  of the evaluation  includes  inpatient  video  EEG  monitoring,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188417],  and a neuropsychological  evaluation.  Following  the initial  evaluation,  each patient’s  case is 
discussed  in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188418].  The conference  is attended  by [CONTACT_188451][INVESTIGATOR_188419].  A consensus  among  all physicians  is reached  regarding  further  
evaluation.  Approximately  50% of patients  require  intracranial  EEG  (iEEG)  recording  prior  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_58785].  If a patient  requires  iEEG,  the strategy  for the exact  type of electrode  implantation  is  
determined  at the same  surgical  conference.  Subsequently,  the need  for iEEG  monitoring  is discussed  
with the patient  in the outpatient  clinic.  Patients  who meet  clinical  indication  for iEEG  recording  will be 
asked  to participate  in the research  study.  If the patient  agrees,  certain  standard  electrodes  will be 
substituted  with the dual micro -macro  electrodes  during  the iEEG  recording.  
 
Electrodes.   Ad-tech is the largest  manufacturer  and supplier  of intracranial  electrodes  for use in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819].  Ad-tech standard  macroelectrodes  have  been used at Dartmouth -Hitchcock  Medical  
Center  since  [ADDRESS_222506]  recording  systems.  Safety  information  for the use of the dual  
electrodes  is provided  from  a single  retrospective  study  of 24 patients  who underwent  the dual electrode  
implantation  at Mayo  Clinic.  The complication  rate for microelectrodes  was 4% compared  to 6% for 
standard  electrode  systems.  Attachment  #1 and Attachment  #2 address  the safety  of the electrodes.  
 
The second  system  (Behnke  Fried/Micro  Inner  Wire  Bundle)  consists  of an outer  macro  contact  [CONTACT_188452].  The micro  contacts  extend  past the tip of 
the macro  depth  electrode.  
 
Data  Recording.  Recording  of iEEG  using  macroelectrodes  has been  routinely  performed  at Dartmouth  
using  the Natus  system.  Recording  of microelectrode  potentials  will be done  using  a separate  Digital  
Lynx system or the clinical  Natus  system.  The two systems  are distinct  and will not share  information.  
The Digital  Lynx system  is a state-of-the-art microelectrode  recording  system  manufactured  by 
[CONTACT_188453].  Neuralynx  provides  the highest  quality  microelectrode  recording  equipment.  The Digital  
Lynx system  is not FDA  approved  for clinical  use. However,  it has been  fully tested  and meets  the

5.Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria:  
Please  provide  detailed  description  of inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  If a formal  protocol  for the study  
exists,  page references  to the protocol  are acceptable.  
 
 
 
 
 
6.Financial  Considerations:  
Disclosure  of financial  impact  on the participant  is critical  to informed  consent.  Insurance  cannot  be 
billed  for research -related  services  outside  the standard  of care or paid for by [CONTACT_188454].  The department,  the study  or the participant  may be responsible  for payment  for research -related  
services.  Participants  should  know  which  tests,  visits,  or procedures  will be billed  to them  or their 
insurance  and which  ones will be paid by [CONTACT_188455].  
 
a) List tests,  visits,  and procedures  performed  for only research  purposes.  These  services  are outside  the 
standard  of care.  They  would  not be performed  if the individual  were  not a research  participant,  and may 
not be billed  to a health  insurance  plan.  
Note:  6a information  must  also be in "How  is this different . . ." section  of the consent  form.  
Cognitive  Tasks.  Patients  who agree  to participate  in microelectrode  studies  may be asked  to participate
in a study  which  involves  a cognitive  task. Each  task will be specifically  designed  to elicit  a specific
cognitive  function  important  to testing  of the regions  where  electrodes  are implanted.  The task could  be
a memory  task, such as remembering  of word  pairs  if electrodes  reside  in the hippocampus.  The task 
may involve  perception  of facial  emotion,  mimicry  of facial  movements,  mimicry  of planned  
movements,  smell  appreciation,  taste appreciation,  appreciation  of disgust,  or visual  spatial  analysis.  
The type of task that a patient  gets will depend  on the region  of the brain  that is implanted  by [CONTACT_188456].  
Data  Analysis.   Data  on neuronal  discharge  characteristics  will be recorded  using  the [ADDRESS_222508] ripples,  and the data on neuronal
firing  characteristics  during  specific  cognitive  tasks  will by [CONTACT_188457].  Data  analysis  will be done  by [CONTACT_188458]/Dartmouth  College,  or by 
[CONTACT_188459].

protocol  are acceptable.  
 
 
 
 
c) Justify  the sample  size, using  the concepts  of power,  type I error,  and effect  size if applicable.  If a 
formal  protocol  for the study  exists,  page references  to the protocol  are acceptable.  There  is no predicted  extra  cost to the patient  if they choose  to participate  in the study.  We will purchase  
the research  portion  of the dual micro -macro  electrode  system  using  research  funds.  Use of Digital  Lynx 
system,  collection  of data,  data analysis,  creating  and administration  of neurocogntive  tasks  will be done  
during  research  time of individuals  in the study.  Nothing  that is done  outside  the standard  of care will be 
billed  to the patients.  
None  
PLEASE  ENCLOSE  THE  DHMC  BILLING  GRID/PLAN.  Also  enclose  the schedule  of events  or 
table  listing  all procedures  from  the sponsor  protocol.  A Billing  Grid  will not be applicable  to this 
study  as there  is not a sponsor  and all procedures are  standard  of care.  There  are only [ADDRESS_222509]  with  the patient  regarding  the study:  1. Consenting  the patient  after  a routine  office  visit 
and 2. Standard  of care surgical  evaluation.  
The primary  hypothesis  is that high oscillations  (fast ripples)  occur  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_188421]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_188409].  Our secondary  hypothesis  is that single  unit activity  recorded  from  
various  electrode  positions  in the brain  will correlate  with specific  cognitive  tasks.  
The recording  of high frequency  oscillations  will require  only basic  statistical  analysis  using  chi-square  
testing.  The analysis  of neuronal  discharge  characteristics  and temporal  association  with specific  
cognitive  tasks  will be done  using  Matlab.

8.Data  and Safety  Monitoring:  
Describe  plans  for data and safety  monitoring  to ensure  the safety  of subjects  and the quality  of the data.  
As described  in federal  guidance  “… a variety  of types  of monitoring  may be anticipated  depending  on 
the nature,  size, and complexity  of the trial. In many  cases,  the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_188422].”  This plan should  include  monitoring  to determine:  
 
The progress  of the trial, including  periodic  assessments  of data quality  and timeliness,  participant  
recruitment,  accrual  and retention,  participant  risk versus  benefit,  and other  factors  that can affect  study  
outcome.  Monitoring  should  also consider  factors  external  to the study  when  interpreting  the data,  such 
as scientific  or therapeutic  developments  that may have  an impact  on the safety  of the participants  or the 
ethics  of the study.

although  conclusive  risk assessment  is not available.  The safety  of dual micro -macro  electrode  systems  
has been  annalyzed  in a retrospective  study  done  at the Mayo Clinic  by [CONTACT_188460]. In this study,  
24 consecutive  patients  underwent  long-term iEEG  monitoring  with implanted  dual depth  and subdural  
grid and strip electrodes;  both clinical  macroelectrodes  and research  microelectrodes  were  used.  The 
patients  included  18 women  and 6 men with an average  age of 35 (range  21–65). The mean  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188425] 11 days (range  5–20), with mean  duration  of implantation  7.0 days (range  3–15). Data from  the [ADDRESS_222512]  clinical  subdural  grid insertion  (prior  to surgery  in the 24 patients  
described  here)  were  used for comparison  to investigate  the relative  risk of complications.  The overall  
complication  rate was 4.2%  (only  1 patient  had a complication),  which  did not significantly  differ  from  
the complication  rate previously  reported  by [CONTACT_188461] 6.6%  when  standard  subdural  and depth  
intracranial  electrodes  were  used.  There  were  no deaths  or permanent  neurological  deficits  related  to 
electrode  implantation.  In conclusion,  he authors  demonstrated  the use of hybrid  subdural  strip and grid 
electrodes  containing  and standard  clinical  macroelectrodes.  In this initial  study  in [ADDRESS_222513]  subdural  and depth  iEEG  electrodes.  Please  refet to

Describe  how subjects  will be recruited  for participation  in this study:  
Eligible  participants  may be identified  from  medical  record  information  as a “preparatory  to research”  
activity  under  the HIPAA  Privacy  Rule.  Protected  health  information  obtained  as a preparatory  to 
research  activity  may not be removed  by a researcher  from  DHMC,  including  on mobile  electronic  
storage  devices.  Contact  [CONTACT_188466],  however,  may not occur  without  prior  D-HH 
approval  of the recruitment  plan for the study.  This plan should  describe  how initial  contact  [CONTACT_188467].  Please  note in general,  individuals  should  not be contact[CONTACT_188468] a research  study  by [CONTACT_188469].

pregnant  are excluded  from  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188431].  
 Patients  will be recruited  from  the clinical   
patient  pool of patients  of the Dartmouth  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_188432]. No specific  or pre-exisisting  database  
will be searched.   
 
CPHS  Template  v. 5.13.2009  
Study  Plan v30Mar2020;  D-HH#[ZIP_CODE]  page 15 of 25  e) Will referral  be utilized  for recruitment?  
Yes No 
If yes, please  be aware  patients  should  first be informed  about  the study  and agree  to the contact  [CONTACT_188471].  
f) Will any other  method  be employed?  
Yes No 
If yes, please  specify,  in detail,  what  those  methods  will be: 
 
 
 
g) Does  the research  plan include  “finder  fees”  or incentives  (bonus  payment,  gift certificates)  offered  to 
study  personnel  for enrollment  of participants?  
Yes No 
Note:  As a rule, finder fees  or incentives  are not acceptable.  Please  justify  any offered  incentives.  If incentives  become  
available  during  the course  of the study, please  notify  D-HH. 
 
 
 
Attach  copi[INVESTIGATOR_188433],  posters,  pamphlets,  print  advertisements,  and scripts  for on-air 
advertisements  or telephone  calls.  All recruitment  materials  should  be approved  by D-HH prior  to use. 
 
Note:  Advertising  should not use terms  such as “new  treatment,”  “new  medication,”  or “new  drug”  without explaining  that  
the test article  is investigational.  A phrase  such as “receive  new treatments”  implies  that research  participants  will be  
receiving  newly  marketed  products  of proven  worth.  Advertisements  should not promise  “free  medical  treatment,”  when  the 
intent  is only to say  participants  will not be charged for taking  part in the investigation.  D-HH will determine  if the promise    
of treatment  without  charge  is an inappropriate  inducement  for study  participation.  Advertisements  may state that participants  
will be paid,  but should  not emphasize the payment or the amount to be paid.  The advertisement  should  include:  the name [CONTACT_188483]; the condition  under study  or the purpose  of the research;  in         
summary  form, the criteria  that will be used to  determine  eligibility  for the study;  a brief  list of participation  benefits,  if any 
(e.g.,  a no-cost health  examination);  the time or other  commitment  required  of the participants;  and the location  of the   
research  activities;  and the person  or office  from  whom  to obtain  further information.  
 
25.Consent  Process:  
The Principal  Investigator  (PI) is responsible  for ensuring  all participants  have provided  informed  
consent  to participate  in this study  unless  the consent  process  is waived  or altered  by D-HH. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_188434].  
 
Please  file the consent  form  in the medical  record  of each research  participant  if study  participation  may 
affect  other  medical  treatment.  
 
Explain  how informed  consent  to research  participation  will be obtained.  Please  describe  the consent  
process,  including  information  about:  
 Who  has been authorized  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_188435]  
 The time interval  between  providing  information  potential  participants  about  a study  and having  
the consent  form  signed  
 Any precautions  taken  to minimize  the possibility  of coercion  or undue  influence  Patients  who are candidates  for intracranial  EEG  monitoring  for presurgical  evaluaion  of medically  
refractory  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188436] a clinical  study.  If they do, they (and their legal  guardian,  if applicable)  will 
be provided  with all pertinent  study  information.

speak  English,  such as the use of a translator  or a translated  consent  form  
 Any aids used to simplify  scientific  or technical  information,  like a diagram  
 Plans  to accommodate  the probable  literacy  level  of potential  participants  
[CONTACT_188491]  or a qualified,  appropriately  trained  person  designated  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jobst  will be responsible  
for the consent  process.  All persons  designated  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jobst  to obtain  consent  will have completed  the 
Protection  of Human  Subjects  training,  or the equivalent  accepted  by D-HH.  The patients  will be seen  
in the outpatient  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188437].  The 
consent  will take place  at the same  clinic  visit.  Patients  who do not have  a clinic  visit scheduled  prior  to 
admission  (usually  due to travel  distance)  will be contact[CONTACT_188472].  If they are 
interested,  a consent  form  will be sent to them  for review,  and their signature  [CONTACT_188484].  Undue  coersion  will be minimized  by [CONTACT_188473] a candidate  
for intracranial  EEG  study.  That is, the decision  for iEEG  and implant  plan is made  during  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188438].  Only  patients  who 
require  iEEG  will be approach  to participate  in the study.  We will not obtain  research  testing  on patient  
who cannot  understand  or speak  English.  We may show  patients  actual  examples  of the electrodes  used 
for routine  clinical  care and the dual electrodes  to help them  make  the decision.  
 
Patients  who are not able to provide  informed  consent  will be considered  for participation  in the study  if: 
1) they meet  the inclusion  criteria;  2) they are interested  in participating  in the study  and; 3) in the 
judgement  of the research  team  they are capable  of performing  the cognitive  tasks.  In those  instances  the 
patient  and their legal  guardian  will both participate  in the informed  consent  process,  with the legal  
guardian  signing  the consent  form.  
 
I intend  to obtain  consent  for research  participation  but I am requesting  a waiver  for the use of a 
signed  and dated  consent  form.  Please  respond  to the criteria  listed  in Attachment  I and include  an 
information  sheet  based  on the D-HH template.  
 
I am requesting  an alteration  of the consent  process  to exclude  certain  information  that is ordinarily  
required.  A list of the essential  elements  of consent  to research  participation  is available  on the CPHS  
website:       http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cphs/tosubmit/ConsentElements.html.  
Please  respond  to Attachment  H. 
 
I am requesting  a waiver  of the entire  consent  process  and use of a consent  form.  Please  respond  to 
Attachment  H. 
 
Explain  why any alteration  or waiver  to the consent  process  or form  is necessary.  
 
 
 
b) Authorization:  Explain  how an authorization  for research  use of protected  health  information  (PHI)  
will be obtained.  PHI is individually  identifiable  health  information  obtained  from  a health  care  
provider  or insurance  plan.  In general,  the HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  permits  the use or disclosure  of PHI for 
research  purposes  only with an authorization  from  each participant  whose  PHI will be involved.  Only  
when  certain  criteria  are satisfied  can D-HH grant  a waiver  of authorization  or of the use of a signed  and 
dated  authorization  form.  A waiver  of authorization  is necessary  for recruitment  procedures  when  
patient  information  is used to identify  and contact  [CONTACT_188474].  A single  
CPHS  Template  v. 5.13.2009  
Study  Plan v30Mar2020;  D-HH#[ZIP_CODE]  page 17 of 25  form  may combine  the essential  information  for both consent  and an authorization.  The D-HH consent  
template  contains  this combination  and is available  on the D-HH website.

authorization  for the research  use of PHI. 
 
 
26.Privacy  and Confidentiality : 
Describe  the plans  to protect  the privacy  of subjects  and maintain  the confidentiality  of the data.  
 
Note:  Under certain  circumstances, an invasion  of privacy  or breach  of confidentiality  may present  a risk of serious  harm  to 
subjects  (e.g.,  as when  the research  obtains  information  about  subjects  that would,  if disclosed  by [CONTACT_3021],  jeopardize  
jobs or lead to prosecution  for criminal behavior).  Under other circumstances,  an invasion  of privacy  or breach  of 
confidentiality  can be a moral  wrong  
 
a) Will any study  activities  involve  an interaction  or reveal  information  for which  protection  of 
participant  privacy  is necessary?  
Yes No 
If yes, please  identify  the activities  and describe  the plan to protect  the privacy  of participants.  For 
example,  a plan for protection  of privacy  might  consist  of conducting  the assent  process  for an 
adolescent  minor  in a private  setting,  rather  than in the presence  of the minor’s  parent.  
 
 
 
 
b) Will the data collected  in the course  of the study  be considered  sensitive,  e.g., include  information  
about  a mental  health  disorder,  HIV status,  or SS#?  
Yes No 
If yes, provide  the rationale  for why these  data are needed:  
 
 Data  recorded  during  the study  will include  the names  of patients,  their dates  of birth,  medical  record  
numbers,  and results  of testing.  This information  will be kept on DHMC  servers.  Data sent from  DHMC  
to collaborators  at Columbia  University  will be de-identified.  Access  to the data will only be available  
for investigators  involved  in the study.  
 
De-identified  EEG  data collected  for this study  will be shared  with other  academic  institutions,  and 
added  to public  databases  of EEG  data.  Data shared  in this way will not include  any identifying  
information.  
CPHS  Template  v. 5.13.2009  
Study  Plan v30Mar2020;  D-HH#[ZIP_CODE]  page 18 of 25  If yes, could  any of these  data,  if disclosed,  damage  financial  standing,  employability,  insurability,  or 
reputation?  
Yes No 
If yes, will a Certificate  of Confidentiality  be obtained?  
Yes No 
Any person  engaged  in research  collecting  information  about  illegal  conduct  from  human  research  subjects  may apply  for a 
Certificate  of Confidentiality.  NIH provides  detailed instructions  for investigators  wishing  to make  an application  at 
http:/ /grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/index.htm . 
 
c) Describe  specific  physical,  administrative,  and technical  safeguards  employed  to protect  
confidentiality  of data,  e.g., coding  with the removal  of identifiers,  limitation  of access  to data,  use of 
locked  file cabinets,  protection  of computer -based  data systems.  
 
 
 
 
d) Will data that identify  individual  subjects  be published  or in any way be disclosed  to third parties  
other  than project  personnel?  
Yes No 
If yes, please  explain  here and incorporate  the information  in consent  form:  
 
 
 
 
27.Responsibility  for costs  of injury  or illness  related  to research:  
Will the sponsor  or other  funding  agency  be responsible  for costs  of injury  or illness  related  to the 
research?  
Yes No 
 
If applicable,  describe  whether  or not the sponsor  will be responsible  for investigational  device  removal  
if required:  
 
 
 
 
If the sponsor  or other  funding  agency  will not be responsible  for costs  of injury  or illness  related  
to research,  please  complete:  
a) The reasons  why the sponsor  or funding  agency  is not accepting  responsibility  for research -related  
injury.  Sensitive  patient  information  will be stored  on DHMC  servers.  
Use of microelectrodes  is generally  considered  safe. A single  retrospective  annalysis  of the use of the 
dual macro -micro  electrode  system  has shown  no significant  complications  above  that for the use of 
macroelectrodes.  Specific  macroelectrode  complications  do occur.  If any complications  such as 
infection  or hemorrhage  occur,  they will be attributable  to the macroelectrode  part, and not the 
microelectrode.  Therefore,  the cost of complications  should  be covered  by [CONTACT_188475].

b) Summary  of risks  as related  to potential  costs  that could  be incurred  as a result  of research -related  
injury  or illness.  
 
 
 
c) Describe  reasons  for requesting  that DHMC  or Dartmouth  College  provide  coverage  for research - 
related  injury  or illness,  which  is not standard  policy.  
 
 
 
 
28.Participant  Remuneration:  
Will participants  be paid for their time,  reimbursed  for travel  or meal  expenses,  or receive  any sort of 
"gift"  for participating  in this study?  
Yes No 
If yes, please  describe  in detail:  
 
Note:  Participant  remuneration  is not considered a benefit  of being  in a research  study.  D-HH will consider the  amount of 
payment  in relation  to the time needed  and any inconvenience  to participants.  Payment,  reimbursement,  or gifts should not be 
in an amount  that would  be coercive  to the participant  population.  
 
If study  is to be done  at the VA, specific  questions  need to be answered  if a participant  is being  paid "in excess  of 
reimbursement  for travel."  Please  contact  [CONTACT_941] D-HH office  if you need  more  information.

Research  Involving  Individuals  With  Impaired  Decision -Making  Capacity  
 
Introductory  Information:  
When  a subject  lacks  capacity  to give informed  consent,  the investigator  should  obtain  written  
permission  from  a legally  authorized  representative  prior  to enrolling  the subject  in a research  study.  
Federal  Regulations  define  legally  authorized  representative  as an "individual  or judicial  or other  body  Each  individual  on the above  list should  complete  a Conflict  of Interest  Disclosure  Form  for Human  
Subject  Research.  The disclosure  should  include  only those  financial  interests  that are specifically  
relevant  to this research  study.  
The Conflict  of Interest  Disclosure  Form  for Human  Subject  Research  is available  on the CPHS  website  
at the following  url: 
http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cphs/tosubmit/forms/  
 
 
Please  complete  and sign the Conflict  of Interest  Disclosure  Form  for Human  Subject  Research  form.  In 
an envelope  marked  "Confidential",  send the form  to the Director  of the Office  of Sponsored  Projects,  
using  the following  address:  
CPHS/COI -HS, Hinman  Box 6254.

participation  in the procedure(s)  involved  in the research"  (45CFR46.102(c)).  Neither  Federal  
Regulations  nor New Hampshire  State  Law provide  specific  information  about  who may or may not 
qualify  as a legally  authorized  representative  in a research  setting.  For the purposes  of this policy  
statement,  the options  of defining  a legally  authorized  representative  include:  
 
a) Durable  power  of attorney  for health  care (DPAHC),  
b) Court  appointed  legal  guardian  
c) Next-of-kin. 
 
A strict  interpretation  of NH state  law does not provide  for the use of next-of-kin as a surrogate  decision  
maker  for investigational  activity.  The argument  for allowing  next-of-kin to consent  to participation  in 
research  activity  for an individual  who lacks  capacity  to consent  is that, without  such an option,  it is 
often  impractical  or impossible  to conduct  important  medical  research  on conditions  where  results  with 
the best current  therapy  are suboptimal.  When  investigational  therapy  represents  the best treatment  
option  or when  risks to the subject  are small  in relation  to the potential  benefit  of research  to society,  a 
policy  which  creates  a major  obstacle  to the conduct  of important  research  activity  is ethically  unsound.  
 
With the above  issues  in mind,  the Dartmouth  CPHS  has established  the following  policy  for research  
studies  that may involve  adult  subjects  who lack capacity  to give informed  consent  to participation  in a 
research  study.  Please  carefully  review  all items.  
 
Submission  requirements:  
When  initially  submitting  a protocol  for review  by [CONTACT_188481],  the investigator  will inform  the CPHS  in 
the appropriate  section  of the CPHS  Study  Plan  (item  #18) if the study  may involve  subjects  who lack 
capacity  to give informed  consent  to participate  in the study  being  proposed.  
 
In addition,  when  a study  may involve  subjects  who lack capacity  to give informed  consent,  the 
investigator  will use the form  provided  below  to inform  the CPHS  of the requested  options  to provide  
permission  for an individual  who lacks  capacity  to participate  in the research  study  and respond  to 
specific  CPHS  questions.  
 
For all requests:  
Even  with the permission  of a DPAHC,  or court  appointed  legal  guardian,  the D-HH will not permit  a 
subject  who lacks  capacity  to give informed  consent  to participate  in a research  study  that offers  little 
chance  of DIRECT  BENEFIT  to the research  subject  over what  they could  receive  outside  the research  
setting  and involves  a meaningful  increase  in the risk of harm  or discomfort,  regardless  of the potential  
gain to future  subjects  or society  in general.  
Please  complete  a) and b): 
a) Does  participating  in this study  offer  the subject  a chance  of direct  benefit  over what  they could  
receive  outside  the research  setting?  
 
 
There is little  chance that data  gathered  using  the microelectrodes will inform  decisions  
being  made about  epi[INVESTIGATOR_188446].  
 
 
CPHS  Template  v. 5.13.2009  
Study  Plan v30Mar2020;  D-HH#[ZIP_CODE]  page 24 of 25  b) Is there  an increase  in the risk of harm  or discomfort  for the subject  over what  they would  
experience  outside  the research  setting?  
 
 
To the best of  our knowledge,  the risk associated  with implanting  electrodes that include  
microelectrode contacts  is no greater  than that associated  with implanting  standard  
electrodes.  
 
The risk associated  with the memory,  speech  and thinking  tasks that participants will 
perform  is very  minimal.  Participants can decline  to continue  the tasks  at any  time.  
 
 
 
When  there  is a meaningful  chance  of DIRECT  BENEFIT  to the research  subject  over what  they could  
receive  outside  the research  setting,  D-HH will make  a judgment  decision  about  who may consent  to 
participation  in the study.  The options  include:  DPAHC,  court  appointed  legal  guardian,  and a 
properly  motivated  next-of-kin. 
 
Please  indicate  the option(s)  requested  to allow  for consent  if a subject  is incompetent  to provide  
consent:  
 
Durable  power  of attorney  for health  care (DPAHC)  YES NO 
Court  appointed  legal  guardian  
Next-of-kin. YES 
YES NO 
NO 
 
If a study  requests  the use of Next -of-Kin as the legally  authorized  representative,  Please  complete  a)  
through  e) below:  
 
a) Could  the subject  receive  the same  management  that they will receive  in the research  study  outside  
the setting  of a research  protocol?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Will participation  in the study  increase  the risk of harm  or discomfort  compared  to what  is expected  
with the management  that the subject  will receive  if they do not participate  in the research  study?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Will participating  in the study  increase  the chance  that the subject  will experience  a favorable  
outcome  compared  to what  is expected  with the management  that the subject  will receive  if they do not 
participate  in the research  study?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) What  is the magnitude  of the benefit  that future  patients,  or society  in general,  may experience  as a 
result  of the subject  participating  in this study?

compromise  patient  care?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CPHS  will use the responses  to the items  a) – e) when  discussing  the option  of allowing  Next-of-Kin 
to enroll  subjects  into a research  study.

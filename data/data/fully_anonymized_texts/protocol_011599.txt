 INTRODUCTION  
 
We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  
 
First, we want you to know that:  
 
 Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary.  
 
 You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time.  In either case, you will not 
lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  However, to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking 
part in a study or be under evaluation for study participation.  
 
 You may  receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that may help people in the 
future.  
 
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research treatments 
they would want to rec eive (such as blood transfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH 
doctors or research team before you agree to the study.  
 
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask 
any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other 
health professional.  
 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
 
Why is this research being done?  
 
Chronic h epatitis C is a disease caused by a virus (known as the hepatitis C virus ) that infects the  liver. Over time, 
inflammation caused by [CONTACT_202781] (fibrosis) of the liver and cirrhosis, which affect s the way 
your liver functions. I n time, if the virus is not treated, some infected people may develop liver cancer and/or need a liver 
transplant.  Current treatments for chronic hepatitis C require the use of drugs that specifically block the production of 
new virus inside the liver. How ever, these drugs must be combined with interferon or ribavirin. Interferon has numerous 
side effects that make it difficult to tolerate and must be given by [CONTACT_17838]. Ribavirin also has side effects such as 
lowering your blood count or causing a rash. Interferon works by [CONTACT_202782][INVESTIGATOR_202764]:

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_241919] by [CONTACT_202783]  –so called direct acting antiviral drugs . Different combinations of these drugs 
are very effective at suppr essing the virus without the need for interferon and ribavirin , a so-called interferon free 
regimen. The advantages of these new drugs are higher efficacy, shorter courses of treatment and fewer side effects. 
These new drugs work better in some persons tha n others. As someone with chronic hepatitis C who has either never 
been treated or previously treated and failed to clear the hepatitis C virus,  you are being invited to participate in this 
research study. The primary aim of this study is to learn more abo ut why these new drugs being developed for treatment 
of hepatitis C sometimes fail to work . Sometimes the drugs don’t work because people take them incorrectly or because 
the virus becomes resistant to the action of the drugs.  Alternatively, the body’s imm une system may be important for 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_202765]. We believe the immune response to the virus in persons who fail 
treatment is different from those who clear the virus successfully. In order to understand this better we plan to  compare 
immune responses of your liver cells to treatment in patients  who fail and those  who respond to treatment. Two liver 
biopsies are needed so we can compare the difference between how your liver cells are working before the treatment  and 
then with the treatment . This will help us to understand what role the immune system plays with clearance of the 
hepatitis C virus and if  so, which part of the immune system plays this role.  Please be aware that the medicines being 
used in this study were approved  by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA)  in May [ADDRESS_241920] important implications for your health.  We will inform you of the results of this study and 
advise you if you need to follow up with your primary healthcare provider.  
 
Who is being asked to take part in this research study?  
 
Subjects with chronic hepatitis C genotype s 1, 2, 3 and 4  infection wh o were either never treated or treated previously 
with any  interferon regimen with or without  ribavirin and failed to eliminate the hepatitis C virus will be eligible to 
participate.  
 
Who is conducting the research study?  
 
The research will be conducted b y The Liver Diseases Branch of t he National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) . The NIH  is providing the funding for this study.  
[COMPANY_009] Sciences , the manufacturer of sofosbu vir and GS-5816, will provide the study medications and perform resistance 
testing on coded samples from subjects whose viral level increase s while on the study drugs or in whom the virus returns 
after the treatment is stopped .

 The study is made up of the following parts:  
 
• Screening Phase:   Includes at least one visit to your study doctor lasting approximately [ADDRESS_241924] up to 20 weeks  from the Screening visit to start 
study treatment.  
 
• Admission for Liver Biopsy:  Admission to the Clinical Center for ~1 1/[ADDRESS_241925] undergone a liver biopsy within 12 weeks of your planned treatment 
start date AND liver tissue was saved in a special preservative (RNAlater) then you will not need to undergo the first 
biopsy. Please understan d that if you recently had a liver biopsy, then the need to repeat a biopsy would be only to 
obtain liver tissue for research.  
 
• Admission for Start of Treatment : Days 0-3 (1st four days of taking study drug)  may be combined with the admission 
for liver bio psy or will require a separate admission to the Clinical Center . 
o Day [ADDRESS_241926] the Clinical Center on pass after your blood draw, returning in the evening.  You will be discharged 
from the clinical center  after the blood draw on day 3.  Your doctor  will provide  you with the study drugs to 
take home  before you are discharged . The study staff will provide you with a schedule for each clinic visit per 
the study plan. You will be given instructions on how to take the study drugs at home . 
 
• Study Treatment Phase: 12 weeks of study drug treatment, including 6 visits lasting 1 to 2 hours each . The details of 
these visits are provided below.  
 
• Admission for Liver B iopsy at Week 4 :  You will be admitted to the Clinical Center at treatment week [ADDRESS_241927] ~1 ½ days and include an overnight stay. This second biopsy is purely for research 
purposes. (See page 6 under What procedures will be performed  for research purposes? for a more detailed 
explanation of the planned research using the liver tissue. ) If after starting the therapy you decide against undergoing 
the second biopsy, you will continue to receive sofosbuvir and GS -[ADDRESS_241928] anned 12 week duration.

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_241930] part of the study called the screening visit. If you qualify for the study, you will be asked to come 
for additional visits as described below.   
 
What procedures are considered experimental?  
The experimental procedure in this study is combining two oral drugs sofosbuvir and GS-5816 in a fixed dose combination 
tablet  for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The approved treatment for hepatitis C genotype s 1 and 4 infection is the 
combination of peginterferon with ribavirin plus sofosbuvir or simeprevir for 12 or 24 weeks . The approved t reatment for 
treatment of genotype 2 is the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks. The approved treatment for treatment 
of genotype 3 is the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 24 weeks.  
 
What procedures will be performed for resear ch purposes?  
A liver biopsy will be performed at week 4 of treatment . The study is trying to understand why some people fail to respond 
to the virus. It is not known if your  immune system is important for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_202766]. We believe that the immune system is important and the immune response to the virus in persons who fail treatment 
is different from those who clear the virus successfully. In order to understand this better we plan to compare the activity 
of genes associated with the immune response to the virus in the liver before and during treatment in persons who fail and 
patients who respond to treatment. This will help us to understand what role the  immune system plays with clearance of 
the hepatitis C vir us and if so, which part of the immune system plays this role.  You may be asked to undergo a procedure 
called a lymphapheresis. This will be explained in a separate consent form.  
 
A description of all procedures performed at each visit appears below:  
 
Screening  
 
At this visit, you will discuss and have time to review this consent form in detail and you will have time to have all of you r 
questions answered. You will be asked to give informed consent by [CONTACT_202784]. In addition, you will be 
asked qu estions about your current and past health and any medications you are taking.  
 
The following procedures will be done at the screening visit(s):

• Blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature will be taken  
• Fatigue questionnaire (Promise 7)  
• Visual analogue scale  to assess your symptoms - a measurement tool used to assess your symptoms during 
treatment . For a particular symptom for example fatigue, you will be asked to make a mark  along a continuous line 
ranging from worse to best , indicating how you feel about that particular symptom.  
• Fibroscan - ultrasound (a procedure that uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside 
of the body) t o measure the stiffness of your liver and determine if cirrhosis  is present  
• Ultrasound, CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan on your liver to rule out liver 
cancer if you have not had one in the last 6 months  
• ECG (or “electroca rdiogram,” which is a recording of the electrical activity of your heart).  You will be a sked about 
what other medications you are taking and if you are experiencing any side effects  
• Blood and urine samples for safety tests (to check how your liver, muscles, kidney, blood cells and other body 
systems are working)   
 
In addition, your blood will be tested for:  
o HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Week s 1, 2, 3, 8 and 12  and early termination visits  
 
You will come back to the Outpatient Clinic  for each of your visits. The following procedures will occur at these study 
treatment phase visits:  
 
• Blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature will be taken  
• Blood samples will be taken by a needle stick into a vein in your arm. During the entire study, approximately [ADDRESS_241935] less than 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_202768]. This volume is consistent with NIH guidelines  which 
specify that no more than approximately one pi[INVESTIGATOR_202769] 8 week period . The 
following tests will be performed:  
 
o The blood will be tested to see if there are changes in safety tests (which check how your liver, muscles, 
kidney, blood cells  and other body systems are working) while you are in the study and any changes in the 
extent of cirrhosis of your liver  
o Blood samples to measure the amount of virus in your body  
o Various measurements of your immune system : 
 
 Your doctor may ask you to retu rn to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202770](s) to confirm any results and you 
may be withdrawn from the study if the amount of hepatitis C virus in your blood increases past a certain level , 
or you do not clear the hepatitis C virus from your blood.  You may have to stop treatment if you develop a 
complication of the study medications such as elevated liver enzymes or if you develop a rash. You will still be 
asked to return for the end of study treatment visit and/or a post treatment follow -up visit . 
 
 Test your blood sample to look for hepatitis C viral resistance (if the virus has become resistant to the study 
drug). This testing will show how the virus is structured and is also known as “viral sequencing.” You will 
continue to have this sample taken a t every visit. This testing is required for the study. Because there is limited 
information on the development of resistance by [CONTACT_91292] C virus to the study drugs, the blood samples 
will be stored indefinitely  in order to allow the researchers to per form additional resistance testing on the virus 
once resistance to the drugs used in this study is better understood . 
 
• Three Health Related Quality of Life questionnaires . These forms ask questions about your health, activities and 
emotional well -being. You will be shown how to complete these forms. You will read the questions yourself and 
write/mark answers directly onto the questionnaire.  
• Urine pregnancy test, if you are a woman who could get pregnant  (weeks 8 and 12 only)  
 
Week 4  
A second liver biopsy will be performed for research purposes to measure activity of liver genes since starting treatment.

After all the follow -up visits and procedures are completed, you will have completed this study.  
 
If you do not clear the hepatitis C virus from your blood, researchers  would be interested in following your HCV viral 
sequence (how the virus is structured) for up to 3 years.  
 
If you clear the hepatitis C virus from your blood by [CONTACT_2054] (24 week follow -up visit), we would be  interested 
in following your HCV status for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_241940] results done at Liver Diseases Branch, Clinical Center, NIH will be shared with you.  
 
Alternative Treatments  
 
Your doctor can provide detailed information about HCV and the benefits of other treatments that are available to you. A 
decision regarding when to begin treatment for your HCV disease should be made after discussion between you and your 
health care provid er.  It is not always necessary to begin treatment immediately, depending on the status of your 
disease.   You are encouraged to discuss treatment options with your doctor.    
 
Sofosbuvir and simeprevir , sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, ombitasvir/parita previr/rit onavir with dasabuvir with or without

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_241942] your ability to respond to 
future drugs if they are similar to sofosbuvir and GS-5816. As with any research study, there may be adverse events or 
side-effects that are currently unknown. It is possible that some of these unknown risks could be  permanent, serious or life 
threatening.  
 
A. Blood draw : The risks of blood drawing  may rarely, in less than 1% of people (or less than 1 out of 100 people) lead 
to infection, fainting, or bleeding or may infrequently, in 1% to 10% of people (or 1 to 10 out of 100 people), lead to 
bruising, soreness, discomfort at the site of the blood draw, or lightheadedness. This may be reduced by [CONTACT_202787].  
 
B. Risks of the study drugs:  
 
Sofosbuvir Common Adverse Events  
The safety profile of sofosbuvir in patients is based on the combined safety data from [ADDRESS_241943] commonly reported adverse drug reactions (≥10%) 
were fatigue (41%), trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (18%), and irritability (10%).  
 
In patients taking sofosbuvir with ribavirin for [ADDRESS_241944] commonly reported adverse drug reactions (≥10%) 
were:    
 
        fatigue ( 24-38%) 
        headache ( 20-30%) 
        nausea ( 18-22%) 
        trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( 4-16%) 
        low red blood cell count ( 0-10%) 
        decreased appetite ( 6-10%) 
        fever ( 0-4%) 
        rash ( 8-9%) 
        chills ( 1-2%) 
        decreases in the blood cells that fight    
infection ( <1%) 
        itchiness ( 8-27%) 
        flu-like illness ( 3-6%) 
        muscle pain ( 0-9%) 
        irritability ( 1-10%) 
        diarrhea ( 6-12%)  
 
         
        
         
         
         
         
Most of these side effects were considered to be mild. These side effects overall were similar to those seen in subjects who 
took pegylated interferon and ribavirin  without sofosbuvir . About one in sixty -five subjects taking sofosbuvir with ribavirin 
had to stop their study medications early because of side effects. Most of these side effects were believed to have been 
caused by [CONTACT_202788] . 
 
GS-[ADDRESS_241945] reported (>10%) in about [ADDRESS_241946] 12 weeks were:  
• Fatigue (Tiredness)  (22%)  
• Headache  (20%)  
• Nausea  (12%)

• Constipation (6%)  
• Insomnia (Trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  (6%) 
• Nasopharyngitis (sore throat and stuffy nose) (5%)  
• Rash (5%)  
 
Most of these side effects were considered to be mild.  
 
Rare, but serious:  
 
• One subject who had a prior history of seizure disorder, received sofosbuvir and GS -[ADDRESS_241947] 
been noncompliant with seizure medication . 
 
• One subject stopped sofosbuvir and GS -[ADDRESS_241948] -treatment 
Day 2. The abdominal pain has not yet resolved. The investigator assessed the events as related to study drug.  
 
• One subject administered sofosbuvir and GS -5816 25 mg + ribavirin, stopped the study drug due to elevated liver 
tests. On Day 71, the subject’s ALT was found to have increased from the previous visit 2 weeks earlier from 95 
U/L to 146 U/L (normal range 6 t o 34 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) from 73 U/L to 114 U/L (normal 
range 9 to 34 U/L). Local laboratory results performed several days later confirmed the ALT and AST elevations 
and the investigator stopped the study medications . The ALT and AST  liver enzymes returned to normal within 30 
days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_202772]. This event was assessed as related to study drugs.  If your ALT rises greater 
than 5 times your baseline value and is confirmed on repeat testing or if your ALT rises more t han 3 times the 
upper limit your baseline value and your bilirubin increases above 2 mg/dL, your study medications will be stopped.  
 
• One subject discontinued study drugs due to eczema and eye inflammation. This subject had an undisclosed recent 
history of allergic eyelid inflammation and eczema on the cheeks and right eyelid. The patient had only received 
study drug for 8 days. The investigator assessed the events as related to study drug.  
 
• One death, due to suicide was reported after completing 12 weeks of  treatment with sofosbuvir and GS -5816. The 
patient a 36 -year-old male had an extensive psychiatric history that included bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, 
anxiety, and drug and alcohol abuse. The investigator assessed the event as not related to stud y drug, but 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_202773] (impending re -incarceration) in the setting of underlying severe psychiatric 
disease.  
 
• Asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase (a muscle enzyme) and lipase (a pancreatic enzyme) have been 
observed in 1 -2 percent (1 -2 per 100) of subjects treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin or sofosbuvir and GS -5816.  
In all cases, these elevations were transient and not associated with symptoms. If you develop elevations in your 
creatine kinase or lipase enzymes, you may  be asked to return for additional visits until the lab tests improve. Your 
study doctor will determine whether it is safe for you to continue taking the study medications or whether you will 
have to stop.

 Sofosbuvir/ GS-5816  
 
The safety profile for Sofosbuvir/GS -[ADDRESS_241949] common adverse events related to Sofosbuvir/GS -5816 were headache (2 
subjects) and diarrhea ([ADDRESS_241950]).  
 
C. Unknown risks:  The possibility exists that complications and side effects which are unknown at this time could occur. You 
will be informed of any significant new findings that may develop with sofosbuvir and GS-[ADDRESS_241951] your 
willingness to continue participation in the study.  
 
D. Allergic reactions : Occasionally, people have allergic reactions to medications.  A severe allergic reaction can be life -
threatening or fatal.  Examples of an allergic reaction include:  rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, sudden drop in blood 
pressure, swelling (around the mouth, throat, or eyes), fast pulse , and sweating.  You should inform the study staff and 
seek medical assistance promptly if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction.  
 
E. Liver biopsy : A liver biopsy is a standard procedure used by [CONTACT_202789]. T he 
procedure involves numbing the skin over the liver with a local anesthetic, followed by [CONTACT_15728] a needle through the skin 
into the liver and removing a small core of liver tissue.  A specialist will examine the tissue carefully under the microscop e.  
There may be some discomfort associated with the procedure. A more detailed explanation of the procedure will now be 
provided:  
 
You will first undergo an ultrasound examination of your liver. This test will identify exactly where your liver is, its size , and 
where the needle should be placed to do the biopsy. The liver biopsy will be performed in your bed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223].  
We often will inject a sedative medication into an arm vein to make you drowsy and relaxed for the biopsy.  This needle 
will be left  in place for the biopsy and for an hour or two thereafter.  
 
For the biopsy, you will lie on your back at the edge of the bed.  The physician will clean the skin over the liver on the ri ght 
side of your lower chest wall and place sterile drapes over the a rea.  The doctor will then inject Xylocaine to numb the skin 
area where the biopsy is done.  Xylocaine is the numbing medication that is most often used for minor surgical or dental 
procedures.  The needlestick needed to inject the Xylocaine may be slightl y uncomfortable. With the skin numbed, the 
doctor will place the liver biopsy needle into the skin in preparation for the biopsy.  The doctor will then ask you to take a 
breath in and then blow it out completely and hold it out.  You will be asked to pract ice this once or twice.  Then when you 
have been prepared, and have exhaled completely, and are holding your breath, the doctor will do the biopsy by [CONTACT_202790][INVESTIGATOR_202774].  The biopsy itself takes about one second.  Y ou may or may not feel it 
happen at all, but some people feel a slight sharp pain when the needle enters the liver.

 red blood cell count; this is to make sure that there is no evidence of internal bleeding. The following morning you will be 
checked by [CONTACT_106224], and if all is well you will be allowed to go home.  You will be asked not to engage in heavy exercise 
or lifting for the next three days.  
 
The following are the known complications of liver biopsy:  
 
(a) Pain.  About 20% of persons who undergo a liver biopsy experience pain in the side of body over the liver after the 
biopsy.  This pain usually lasts from a few minutes to several hours and may require pain medication.  In rare cases, the 
pain lasts a day or two.  
 
(b) Fainting .  Just as some people faint after giving blood, about 2% of persons pass out after a liver biopsy.  Since 
you will be lying in bed, you  are not going to fall down if you faint and this reaction is unlikely to cause you harm.  
Furthermore, we will give you a medication (atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to reverse the cause of fainting if it occurs.  If you are the type of 
person who faints a lot, we can give you  this medication before the biopsy to prevent you from fainting.  
 
The other complications of liver biopsy are very rare.  
 
(c) Infection .  A rare complication of liver biopsy is infection that spreads to the rest of the body because the needle 
goes through skin that is not completely clean or sterile or goes through infected bile (as occurs in patients with gallstones 
sometimes).  Antibiotics can treat such infections.  
 
(d) Biopsy of another organ .  In rare instances, the biopsy needle misses the liver and h its another internal organ, such 
as the lung, gallbladder, kidney, or intestine.  This complication can be avoided by [CONTACT_202791] e biopsy.  Usually, the other 
organ is not damaged by [CONTACT_81825]; however, it is possible that surgery might be needed to repair the hole.  
 
(e) The most important complication of liver biopsy is bleeding .  A small amount of bleeding probably occurs in many 
patients after liver biopsy, but the amount of bleeding is usually too small to be detected or felt.  Severe bleeding occurs in 
about one of every [ADDRESS_241953] contributed to the inability to stop the bleeding.  It is 
because of these possible side effects that you will be kept overnight in the Clinical Center after the liver biopsy with car eful 
monitoring for any evidence of bleeding.  
 
(f) The risks and discomforts of receiving the medications used during liver biopsy :  Three medications are often used 
during a liver biopsy:  Xylocaine to numb the skin, a sedative such as Versed (midazolam) to make you drowsy during the 
biopsy and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_202775] a tendency to faint.  All three medications are s afe when given in the usual doses.  In rare 
instances, they can induce allergic reactions which can be a skin rash, itching, wheezing, an asthma attack, or even 
anaphylaxis - or allergic shock.  [If you have any allergies to medications, you should remind the doctors of these.]  All of 
the allergic complications can and will be treated if they arise.  Xylocaine, when given in high doses can also cause heart 
blockage, seizures, coma, or even death; but, in the doses given in this study it has  no obvious effe ct on the heart beat.  
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_81762], difficulty focusing the eyesight, constipation and difficulty passing urine .  
All these side effects will disappear within a few hours.  Versed or Midazolam which is used for sedation causes sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_202776].  In high doses, it can cause over -sedation with coma and depression of breathing and even death.  This

in the body as late as 4 to 5 years after treatment has ended. It is unknown whether having these resistance mutations 
might reduce the chance of treatment success with future drugs with the same  type of action or with different types of 
action (such as protease inhibitors). It is possible that if you are treated with the drugs in this study and treatment doesn ’t 
work, you might have resistance mutations that would make future treatment less succe ssful. 
 
G. Risks to Reproduction, Unborn Babies and Nursing Infants  
 
General Statement  
 
You must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and you should not become pregnant or breastfeed while you are taking the 
study treatments, and for [ADDRESS_241955] your 
study doctor if there is a change in your method to avoid pregnancy or if you start any prescription drug or other medication  
(including over -the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) not prescribed by [CONTACT_39635].  
 
It is unclear how long the investigational drugs, sofosbuvir and GS-[ADDRESS_241956] in the body’s tissues, and the safety of 
this drug in women who are pregnant or nursing has not yet been established.  If you are a woman who is pregnant or a 
female with the intent of becoming pregnant or a female who is currently nursing (breastfeeding) a child, you cannot be in 
this study.  If you are a man whose partner is currently pregnant or wishin g to become pregnant, you cannot be in this 
study.  
 
You must protect yourself or your partner from becoming pregnant before, during, and after the study.  Women, and men 
with female partners capable of becoming pregnant, must use two effective methods of b irth control as described below.  
Your study doctor will need to document what type(s) of birth control you are using.  
 
Women only:  
 
Women who can get pregnant should not take study drug(s) unless they and their partner do not have intercourse ever or 
are using 2 methods of birth control for the duration of the study (starting 3 weeks prior to the Day 0 visit) and for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_241957] be a condom used correctly by [CONTACT_202792].  Acceptable birth control 
methods (in addition to a male partner who correctly us es a condom) include:  
• an intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year  
• female barrier method: cervical cap or diaphragm with spermicidal agent  
• tubal sterilization (having your tubes tied)  
• hormone containing contraceptives

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_241958] been directed by [CONTACT_202793].  The study d octor will tell 
you about the possible risks to your unborn child and options available to you.   
 
In the event of a positive urine pregnancy result, you will be instructed to stop study drugs immediately and return to the 
study clinic as soon as possible for a serum (blood) pregnancy test.  The pregnancy will be followed to its completion and 
the outcome, including any premature termination, must be reported to your doctor.  
 
You should be counseled and monitored by [CONTACT_3367].  As the risk to the unbo rn baby [CONTACT_111175], it is recommended 
you seek medical supervision from your own doctor during the pregnancy and for the baby [CONTACT_202794].  Neither the 
study doctor nor the provider of the study medications ([COMPANY_009] Sciences) will be responsible for pr oviding routine medical 
care relating to the pregnancy.   
 
Men only:  
 
If you have a female partner who cannot become pregnant, you must still consistently and correctly use a condom.  
 
If you have a female partner who can become pregnant, you and your partn er must use two forms of birth control for the 
entire study and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_241959] dose of study drug, you will be required 
to notify your study doctor immediately .  As the risk to your partner and unborn baby [CONTACT_56830], it is recommended 
for your partner to receive appropriate prenatal care.  If you agree, your partner will be asked to release her  medical 
information related to pregnancy.  Your s tudy doctor may  need to disclose to your partner details of this study and your 
taking part in it.  Neither t he study doctor nor the manufacturer of the study medications ([COMPANY_009] Sciences) will be 
responsible for the costs related to the pregnancy, delivery, or care of y our child.   
 
Male subjects must also agree not to donate sperm from the time you first take your first dose of study medication until [ADDRESS_241960] dose of study medications . 
 
Please note: Hormonal birth control may be more effective when taken for at least 3 months.  Even if you and your female 
partner use a medically proven birth control method, you could still cause your partner to become pregnant.  
 
Please share this informa tion with your partner.  
 
Unforeseeable Risks

 Risk of Embryo -Fetal Abnormalities Based on Laboratory & Animal Findings  
 
While laboratory and animal studies have been conducted to determine possible risks, the results do not necessarily show 
what will happen when the drug is used in humans.  Fertility a nd embryo -fetal development studies in rats indicate that 
doses of sofosbuvir and GS-[ADDRESS_241961] up to 7 pregnancy tests. Pregnancy will be determined on basis of a urine and / or blood 
sample. The pregnancy tests will be at the screen ing assessment, Day 0, treatment weeks 4, [ADDRESS_241962] a negative serum -HCG at screening and a 
negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent uni ts of HCG) within [ADDRESS_241963] a change in your usual 
menstrual cycle (e.g., heavier bleeding during your period or bleeding between periods), you should immediately contact 
[CONTACT_202796] d octor.  
 
Discontinuation from the Study  
 
Should you become pregnant during this study, you will have the investigational products discontinued and be referred for 
obstetric care. The NIH has not set aside any funds to pay for any aspects of obstetric, chil d or related care and does not 
plan to pay for them.  
 
Pregnancy Reporting  
 
In case of a pregnancy, your pregnancy and its outcome will be reported to [COMPANY_009] Sciences , the manufacturer of the study 
medications . 
 
H. Potential risks of a breach of confidentiality  
 
Participation does involve the potential risks of a breach of confidentiality of the information and associated privacy of th e 
participants.  A breach of confidentiality could impact future insurability  and employability. The risks will be  minimized by 
1) removing identifiers (names, social security numbers, medical record numbers) from stored samples; 2) limiting access 
to information linking codes assigned to samples by [CONTACT_202797] a separate location; and 3) limiti ng 
access to information to study investigators at the Liver Diseases Branch, Clinical Center, NIH.  
 
Benefits

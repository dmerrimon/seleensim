determine the ease of receiving and receptiveness of primary care physicians to a summary of clinic recommendations (feasibility and acceptance).  To determine if the PI[INVESTIGATOR_339031] -19 are 
similar to those reported in the literature of non -COVID-19 patients.

from asymptomatic/mild (81%), to severe requiring oxygen (14%) and critical (5%) which requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ventilation and life support.

23,24 For example, in a single center study, 34 discharged ICU patients demonstrated significant 
declines in mobility (p=0.026), ADLs (p<0.001) combined with increased anxiety/depression (p=0.048), yet under half of them sought follow -up care.

healthcare services the main reasons included: unclear how to obtain referral, unable to afford the service, and lack of physical strength or transport to get to the clinic. PI[INVESTIGATOR_339052], which may make it more difficult for them to travel to a clinic .
24 However, like other patients they want to get better.  Interviews of 39 adult 
critical illness survivors revealed the following core patient priorities during recovery: going home, improving mobility, participating in self-care, restoring physical and psychological health, and resuming previous roles and routines.

 Discharged patients with COVID -19 disease may experience increased challenges with transportation 
and treatment at an “in -person” clinics due to current restrictions in place  for public and healthcare 
worker protection.

 3.5 Inclusion of Women 
 
As a matter of operational policy, our studies of volunteers routinely and deliberately include equivalent numbers of women and men. To ensure sufficient enrollment of women, we typi[INVESTIGATOR_339062].  This approach has been highly successful. However , the nat ure of the current study precludes enrollment of a set number of female or male 
patients since the main criteria for inclusion is +COVID-19 admission with an ICU stay.   
3.6 Inclusion of Minorities  
 
All o f our studies actively encourage the participation of minorities in the research.  Our minority 
recruiting typi[INVESTIGATOR_339063] (78% white, 21% Black, <1 % Hispanic).  However, the nature 
of the current study precludes enrollment of a set number of minorities  since the main criteria for 
inclusion is +COVID -19 admission with an ICU stay.

Children <18 yr will not  be studied in this study

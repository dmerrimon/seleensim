Title:  Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255199]  
 
1. Introduction and Purpose:  
 
1. Describe why this research project will be done.  Clearly state the overall objectives, specific 
aims, hypotheses and rationale for performing the study.  
 
Preterm birth, defined as birth at less than 37 weeks, affects 11 - 13% of all births in the [LOCATION_002] 
and results in significant morbidity and mortality for the approximately 500,[ADDRESS_310179] yielded disappointing results. 
(Leveno et al, 1986;  Leveno et al 1990 ; Canadian Preterm Labor Investigator s Group, 1992; Leveno 
and Cunningham, 1992 , Mercer and Merlino , 2009 ). There has been  recent  interest in nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a 
tocolytic for preterm labor (Conde -Agudelo  et al, 2011 ).  In 2008, a survey of maternal -fetal medicine 
specialists reported that 32% we re using nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255200] (Fox et al, 2008), 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_255201]-controlled , randomized  studies  of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255202]  a benefit . 
 
This is  a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255203]. Our objective is to determine whether nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255204] . 
Our null hypothesis is that nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255205].   
 
2. Indicate the Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints. Also indicate the Primary Safety 
Endpoints (unless the study is a safety study).  
 
The primary outcome will be prolongation of pregnancy until at least 37 weeks . Secondary outcomes 
will include 1) number of patients who receive at least 2 doses of betamethasone, 2) delivery within 48 
hours of diagnosis of preterm labor and 3) delivery within 7 days . 
 
3. Explain why the study risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits to su bjects and 
society.   
 
Given the  prevalence  of this off -label use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , it is unlikely that serious adverse events are  
commonly encountered. The main serious risk associated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255206], but in 
the 17 reported cases, this ri sk was reported in the context of other specific risk factors , such as use 
with other tocolytic drugs , use of rapid -acting formulations , prolonged tocolysis, and use when there 
was evidence of preex isting maternal cardiac disease/ dysfunction . Importantly, in 26 published tr ials 
involving isolated use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255207], there were no cases of pulmonary edema 
amon g patients receiving nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (References 8a-aa). 
 
We plan to restrict use to h ealthy, normotensive women with singleton pregnanci es not receiving 
additional tocolytic agents.  We will also not use prolonged or sublingual (rapid acting) administration 
of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  Therefore, these reported adverse reactions are most unlikely . Milder s ide effects 
associated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255208] , flushing and low blood pressure, which resolve  with 
discontinuation of the medication. The balance of benefits and risks favors  performing this study to 
quantify benefits, if any, given the potential for nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255209] h igh use rate in 
the community.

2. Background:  
 
1. State the purpose of the research and describe the related theory/data supporting the intent of 
the study.   
 
The purpose of this research is to determine whether nifepi[INVESTIGATOR_255210] . Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255211] . We believe that uterine relaxation (tocolysis) from nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255212].    
 
2. Describe what is considered standard care (approved and/or customary) for the medical 
condition being studied, if applicable.  
 
Although t ocolysis is not currently used  at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], it is considered within the standard of 
care for physicians caring for women in preterm labor.   
  
3. Explain how the new treatment or procedure may improve standard care, if applicable. Clearly 
delineate what is considered research study items from the “standard care”.  
 
If nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255213], it would be included as 
part of the standard care for women  with preterm labor.  
 
4. Provide a short statement concerning the status of the drug, drug combination, delivery 
method, device, or other interventions/concepts to be studied.  
 
Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255214], but it is wid ely used off -label as 
a tocolytic for preterm labor.  
 
5. Indicate whether the research is confirming or an extension of previous work, or whether it is 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_255215].  Include an evaluation of existing knowledge and identify 
the in formation gaps that the project intends to address.   
 
No placebo controlled , randomized  trials of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255216] (defined as cervical dilatation with contractions)  have been reported, therefore, this stu dy will be 
an important contribution  to the medical literature .  
 
6. Describe published research with animals and/or humans that supports the study hypothesis 
or objectives.  If applicable, include information regarding toxicity.  Include a bibliography of 
key references/citations as applicable.  
 
Ex Vivo Data  
 
In human myometrium collected at the time of cesarean section Nitrendipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], a dihyropyridine calcium 
channel blocker  similar to nifedpi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , depressed myometrial contractions . (Maigaard, 1986).  
 
Randomized Trials of Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255217] (2014) recently reported an unusual study of “randomized women” and “nonrandomized 
eligible women” with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255218] 24 and 34 weeks’ 
gestation with intact membranes, a sho rt cervix by [CONTACT_2207], a negative fetal fibronectin (in theory, 
low risk of preterm birth) and “symptoms of preterm labor” (symptoms were not further defined). This 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 4 of 20 was a non -inferiority trial and the authors reported that placebo was not inferior to nif edipi[INVESTIGATOR_255219]. 
The very small sample size and its very unusual design raise questions about its utility .   
 
No placebo -controlled , randomized  trials of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255199]  (defined as 
cervical dilatation and contractions) have been reported . Published  studies of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a 
treatment for preterm labor are comparisons  to other  tocolytic  agents (References 8a-aa). These 
other agents include magnesium sulfate, atosiban and beta -agonis t drugs such as ritodrine , none of 
which  have been demonstrated to improve birth outcomes.  
 
Meta -Analyses of Trials Involving Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255220] 12 trials (1029 women) comparing calcium 
channel blockers to other tocolytic agents. The relative risk for giving birth within 7 days was  
decreased (RR 0.76, 95% confidence interval, 0.60 -0.97)  with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and t he relative risk for 
maternal side effects was less (RR 0.32 95% CI, 0.24 -0.41). There were fewer adverse neonatal 
outcomes among patients treated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with the relative  risks (95% CI ) for RD S, necrotizing 
enterocolitis &  intraventricular hemorrhage being 0.6 3 (0.46 -0.88), 0.21 (0.05 -0.96),  0.59 (0.36 -0.98).  
 
Other Meta -Analyses  
 
Tsatsaris et al (2001) analyzed 9 randomized trials involving 679 patients comparing nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255221]-agonists. The relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for delaying delivery at least 48 hours, 
side effects, respi[INVESTIGATOR_255222] -agonists were 1.52 (1.03 -2.24), 0.12 (0.05 -0.29), 1.51 (0.63 -3.65) and 0.65 (0.43 -0.97), 
respectively.  Conde -Agudelo et al (2011) reviewed 26 trials  with 2179 women . Compared to beta -
agonists, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255223] 7 days and before 34 weeks, RDS, 
necrotizing enterocolitis, IVH, neonatal jaundice and ICU admission. Compared to magnesium sulfate, 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255224]. Maintenance tocolysis is ineffective.  
 
Safety  
 
Review s of Adverse Outcomes Involving Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] :  In a review of the literature on adverse events 
following the use of calcium channel blockers  like nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255225], Oei (2006) concluded  that: 
1) calcium channel blockers should not be combined with intravenous beta -adrenergic agonists  (such 
as ritodrine hydrochloride or terbutaline) , 2) intravenous nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_255226] e mother is compromised 
cardiovascularly , and 3) b lood pressure should be monitored and cardiotocography should be 
recorded when immediate release tablets are used.  
 
Importantly , in the proposed  study, only healthy women  with singleton  pregnancies will  be consented 
for participation,  sub-lingua l (rapid -acting) administration  will not be use d and multiple tocolytics will 
not be employed.  Compared to the only FDA approved tocolytic (ritodrine), nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255227].   
 
Recently, Xiao et al (20 14) reported the effect of magnesium sulfate and nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255228]: “nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255229] [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.22 (confidence interval (CI) 0.50, 3.01 ), P=0.67]”  
 
Hemodynamic and Metabolic Effects  
 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 5 of 20 Papatsonis et al (2003) compared 95 patients randomized to oral nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_99682] 90 patients random ized 
to intravenous ritodrine. Compared to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], p atients who received ritodrine had significantly 
lower m ean diastolic blood pressures at 24 and 48 hours (65 +/ - 12 versus 70 +/ - 8, p=.001, and 65 
+/- 12 versus 71 +/ -8, p=.004, respectively), and significantly higher mean maternal pulses at 24 and 
48 hours (105 +/ - 17 versus 86 +/ - 13, p<.0001, and 100 +/ - 21 versus 85 +/ - 12, p<.0001).  Gucglu et 
al (2006) studied maternal hemodynamic parameters as well as Doppler waveforms of various fetal 
structures in 28 women who received nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255230] . The maternal and fetal h eart rates 
were unaffected desp ite that maternal mean systolic and diastolic bl ood pressures were  lower at 24 
hours. Changes in the umbilical artery Doppler measurements were “minimal and not sustained.” 
Additionally, De Heus et al (2009) reported the effects of the tocolytics atosiban and nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255231], heart rate and blood flow and concluded: “tocolysis with either atosiban or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255232].”  
 
Recently, Ulubasoglu (2014) reported th at there were no statistically significant differences between 
24-hour values for the umbilical artery  pulsatility index, resistance index (RI), systolic -diastolic (S:D) 
ratio, right uterine artery measures ( pulsatility index, RI, S:D ratio ) or left uterin e artery measures ( RI 
and S:D ratio ), and they concluded that “o ral nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] a safe tocolytic agent with no long -term 
effect on fetomaternal circulation in pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery .” 
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  
 
1. Provide a brief description of the study design.  If applicable, describe the treatment arms, use 
of placebo or comparison  drug/device and randomization.  
 
This will be a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255207] (48 
hours  total duration ) of preterm labor in women with singleton gestations between 28 -0/7 weeks and 
33-6/7 weeks’ gestation. After initial monitoring on Labor & Delivery, a ll women will be  admitted to the 
antepartum ward until  approximately 34 weeks’ gestation  and com pletion of the full  course of 
corticosteroids , although the provider will determine when it is safe  for the patient to be discharged, as 
is our current routine without tocolysis.  Discharge can be affected by [CONTACT_255326] (is she  contracting again?), if her cervical exam has changed (if her cervix has 
increased dilatation, particularly to 4 cm or more, she may not be considered safe for discharge) and if 
she is receiving any other interventions . We will avoid creating an expectati on that by [CONTACT_255327], then an exact or particular discharge date is assured.   
 
2. Include specific details regarding the study drug(s) being used, including the generic/trade 
name [CONTACT_115210]. Include details about drug preparation, pa ckaging, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], storage, 
dispensing, return and destruction. Include details of any dose reductions or dose escalations 
that may occur including the dose change and duration of transition from one dose to another.  
 
The generic name [CONTACT_255348][INVESTIGATOR_255233] i s marketed as Ad alat or Procardia as trade name s. Generic

Pharmacy will be encapsulating the placebo and study drug.  Unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_255235] (IDS) pharmacy.  
 
Women who consent to participate in the above study w ill be randomized by [CONTACT_255328] a loading dose of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_310181] 24 hour period (120 mg the second 24 hour period) , unless delivery occurs sooner . We 
anticipate that women will remain on Labor & Delivery for monitor ing for at least 24 hours prior to 
consideration of transfer to the high -risk antepartum unit.  
 
3. Include information regarding the study drug(s) classification and the mechanism of action, if 
known.   
 
Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] a dihydropyridine cl ass of calcium ch annel blocker, and are selective for smooth muscle. 
The dihydropyridines are thought to inhibit  uterine myometrial contractions by [CONTACT_255329].  
 
4. Include a brief description of outcome variables and study endpoints, as a ppropriate.   
 
The primary outcome will be delay of delivery until 37 weeks’ . Secondary outcomes will include 1) at 
least 2 doses of betamethasone , 2) delivery within  48 hours’  gestation  and 3) delivery  within [ADDRESS_310182] across all sites.  
 
Assuming a 50% consent rate, we will be approaching ap proximately 300 women for consent.   
Sample size calculations indicate we need 75 women per arm or 150 total women to demonstrate a 
33% reduction in preterm birth , based upon 2 prior Randomized Placebo Controlled Trials of tocolysis 
(magnesium sulfate and ritodrine) performed at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Leveno et al, 1986; Cox and 
Leveno, 1990) .   
 
6. If the study involves use of existing charts,  records, or specimens, specify the maximum 
number that will be reviewed to compi[INVESTIGATOR_255236].  
 
This is a prospective trial and existing records will not be reviewed.  
 
7. Provide the total num ber of subjects to be studied at this site and approximate ly how long the 
study will last.  
 
It is anticipated that the study will  take approximately 4-5 years  to consent and study a total of 150 
women  with preterm labor between 28 -0/7 weeks and 33 -6/[ADDRESS_310183] withdrawal of consent, 
disease progression, etc.  
 
This is a n intent to treat study.  Withdrawal of  consent would be the only indication for early exit.  
 
4. Study Procedures:  
 
1. Provide a chronological description of all study procedures.  If applicable, divide procedures 
into pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], screening, and procedures performed at each regular visit.  Indicate how many total 
visits and approximately how long visits will last.  For studies that are providing medication(s), 
give the name(s), dosage, and route of administration.  For studies that have more than one 
arm/part, provide the above information for each.  
 
 
Version 5.[ADDRESS_310184] 2 cm  and 
has uterine  contractions, she will be potentially eligible for study .  Women with a singleton gestation  
between 28 -0/7 weeks and 33 -6/7 will be approached for consent to participat e by [CONTACT_255330] & Gynecology  or [CONTACT_240617] if a Research Nurse is 
unavailable . They will be randomized by [CONTACT_255331] (study drug, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) or 
control (placebo) groups . 
 
Study women  will receive nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_310185] 24 hour period (120 mg the second 24 hour period), unless delivery 
occurs sooner . We anticipate that women will remain on Labor & Delivery for monitoring for at least 24 
hours prior to consideration of transfer to the high -risk an tepartum unit.  
 
There will be a “HOLD DOSE” parameter in which a dose will be held if an enrolled patient:  
 refuses medication  
 has heart rate greater than [ADDRESS_310186]. Wells is noti fied. 
 
There will be a “STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16502]” for further individual participation in the study for any of the 
following criteria: withdrawal of consent, diffuse rash or anaphylaxis reaction to medication (requires 
confirmation by [CONTACT_255332]), hypotension requ iring delivery or medication such as ephedrine, or 
development of any obstetrical outcomes that would normally preclude tocolysis (development of 
ruptured membranes, development of chorioamnionitis, development of preeclampsia/gestational 
hypertension, dev elopment of bleeding suspi[INVESTIGATOR_255237], cervical dilatation of 6 cm or more or 
fetal death) , or if a decision is made to either deliver the patient or to use regional anesthesia . 
 
Women without  further cervical change  after monitorin g on Labor and D elivery will be  admitted to the 
antepartum unit fo r surveillance  until approximately 34 weeks’ gestation  and completion of the full 
course  of corticosteroids , although the provider will determine when it is safe  for the patient to be 
discharged . This is our current practice in such women and is not a study procedure. Discharge can 
be affected by [CONTACT_255333] (is she contracting again?), if her cervical 
exam has changed (if her cervix has increased dilatation, particular ly to 4 cm or more, she may not be 
considered safe for discharge) and if she is receiving any other interventions . We will avoid creating 
an expectation that by [CONTACT_4907], then  an exact or  particular discharge date is assured . 
Some patien ts choose to leave earlier (usually due to family obligations) despi[INVESTIGATOR_255238] 34 weeks’ gestation.  Women who are discharged from the antepartum unit  will be  
followed -up in the OB Complications Clinic of Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255239] u ntil delivery. This method of 
outpatient follow -up for patients after discharge from the antepartum unit  is also our routine and is not 
a study specific procedure.

8. Sources of Research Material:  
 
1. Identify the source(s) of materials/data to be used in the research, such as information or 
specimens  from medical records, databases, repositories or other sources.   If a combination 
of these sources are used, and/or new clinical data generated, describe how the research 
material is acquired.  
 
Data on  obstetrical and neonatal outcomes for all women delivered at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255242]. Leveno’s obstetrical operations database .  Outcomes recorded for study women and

This will be a prospective, double -blind, placebo controlled trial and therefore existing records or 
specimens will not be used.  
 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 10 of 20 9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting  Process:  
 
1. Indicate if the potential subjects will be patients of the investigators.  
 
All investigators are fa culty members and oversee obstetrical care at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
2. Describe and provide details of the recruitment process.  Include when, where, by [CONTACT_255336]. Indicate if non -English speaking subjects are being 
consented and if so, indicate how informed consent process will be con ducted.  
 
Research nurses employed by [CONTACT_255334] & Gynecology, and who are on -call and 
monitoring Labor & Delivery, will identify, approach and provide informed consent to all potential 
participants  (these tasks will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wells if a research nurse is unavailable when a 
patient presents with preterm labor) . If potential participants are non -English speaking, a language -
appropriate translator will be obtained as per current Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology 
research protoc ols. 
 
3. Explain measures that will be taken to respect the privacy of the potential subjects.  
 
Patients will generally be consented in one of the private rooms on L abor & Delivery.  
 
4. Explain what precautions will be taken to minimize the potential for undue i nfluence or 
coercion.  
 
Professional research nurses already on staff with the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, and 
who do not have an interest in a  particular study outcome , will be providing the informed consent  
during weekdays and most weeknights. If a patient presents with active preterm labor when a 
research nurse is unavailable, [CONTACT_240617] will obtain informed consent. [CONTACT_240617] has observed several 
of these nurses obtain  informed consent in a dispassionate and thorough manner, which e mphasizes 
to the patient that the usual care that we provide will not be affected by [CONTACT_255337]. 
 
5. If you are requesting a waiver of informed consent, explain how the criteria for waiver are met.  
N/A 
 
6. If vulnerable populations will b e included, describe the additional protections that will be 
provided, such as methods to obtain surrogate consent (cognitively impaired subjects), and 
plans for obtaining assent and/or the permission of one or both parents (minors).  
N/A 
 
10. Potential Ris ks: 
 
1. Describe the known risks and/or potential discomforts associated with each intervention or 
research procedure.  Risks may be physical, psychological, social or economic.  
 
Mild side effects associated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255243], flushing and low blood pressure, which 
generally resolve with discontinuation of the medication and without further intervention. In a 
systematic review, Khan et al (2010) reported that the use  of calcium channel blockers for tocolysis or 
for hypertension in pregnancy was associated with a 3 -fold increased risk of tachycardia and an 8 to 
9-fold increased risk of hypotension when the dose exceeded 60 mg per day. However, this analysis 
included al l pregnant women receiving all different types of calcium channel blockers (including 
severely hypertensive women , particularly women with preeclampsia and severe gestational 
hypertension , a very different population that we propose to study ), and thus was  not limited to 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 11 of 20 women with preterm labor, the sub -population than we propose to study. Regarding the possibility of 
hypotension, Luewan et al (2010) studied blood pressure in normotensive pregnant women treated 
with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_310189] 15 
mmHg from baseline, and reported up to 17% of patients met these criteria. They concluded that 
“hypotension secondary to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255244], 
suggesting that nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255245].”  
 
Houtzager et al (2006) performed long -term follow -up of children exposed in utero to nif edipi[INVESTIGATOR_255246]: “ The results do not support any differential postnatal effect of 
the tocolytic agents ritodrine or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255247]'s long -term psychosocial and motor functioning. 
The slightly better outcome of c hildren randomised in the nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255248]. ” 
 
More serious side effects are rare when the widespread use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255249].  In the English -language medical l iterature, t here are 22 reported cases of pulmonary 
edema , 1 stillbirth and 2 cases of myocardial infarction  associated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255219] , but these 
risks were  reported in association with other particular risk factors such as use with other tocolytic 
drugs, use of rapid -acting formulations, prolonged tocolysis and use when  there was evidence of 
preexisting maternal cardiac disease/dysfunction  (Bal et al, 2004; Vaast et al, 2004; Abbas et al, 
2006; Van Geijn et al, 2005; Nassar et al, 2007; Ga tault et al, 2008; ; Kutuk et al, 2013; Serena et al, 
2014; Van Veen et al, 2005; Oei et al, 1999; Verhaert and Acker, 2004) . The single report of stillbirth 
was disputed and provoked a series of follow -up letters in response to the controversy (Johnson, 
2005; Kandysamy, 2005; Papatsonis et al, 2005). Importantly, in 26 published trials involving isolated 
use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255207], there were no cases of pulmonary edema or more serious side 
effects among patients receiving nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (References  8a-aa). More recently, Kutuk (2013) reported 
a case of pulmonary edema with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255250] a woman with ruptured membranes at 33 weeks. 
The authors note that the pulmonary edema occurred on the 4th day of her admission in association 
with prolonged toc olysis . In this case report of a single patient, there was prolonged use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255251] a woman with ruptured membranes, which was arguably not acute tocolysis at all since the event 
occurred during a period typi[INVESTIGATOR_255252] s. Our study restricts use to 
acute tocolysis with only 48 hours’ duration, and in women with intact membranes. Four other cases 
of pulmonary edema were reported by [CONTACT_255338] (2014), but these were all in women with 
prolonged intravenous use of nicardip ine, and intravenous tocolysis is a recognized risk factor for 
pulmonary edema (Oei, 2006). We are not using intravenous formulations nor will we be using 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255253] (maximum 48 hours of acute tocolysis).  
 
Recently, Xiao et al (2014) reported the effect of magnesium sulfate and nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255228]: “nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255229] [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.22 (confidence interval (CI) 0.50, 2.01), P =0.67]”. Of 
note, Sciscione et al (2003) reviewed 62,917 consecutive pregnancies delivered between 1989 and 
1999 and reported that acute pulmonary edema due to tocolytics was exclusively in women who 
received multiple simultaneous tocolytic agents “the mos t common combination was intravenous 
magnesium sulfate and subcutaneous terbutaline.” In the current study, we are not using multiple 
tocolytics, and women in this study will not be receiving magnesium sulfate, so this risk is felt to be 
very low.  
 
A sing le case report of severe resistant maternal hypotension following tocolysis with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255254] 2014 (Khoo and Mathur, 2014). There are several aspects of patient 
management within this case report that raise concern, and which are di stinct from protocols in our 
present study. First, the patient in the case report presented with hypotension (87/51 mmHg) and 
ruptured membranes. In our present study, we exclude women with low blood pressure (systolic value 
less than 90 mmHg and/or a dias tolic value less than 50 mmHg), as well as women with ruptured 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 12 of 20 membranes. Second, more aggressive dosing of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255255] (nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10 
mg every 15 minutes for 4 doses). This more aggressive dosing amounted to [ADDRESS_310190], the 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255256] (135 b eats per minute) and persistent hypotension 
(88/43 mmHg). In the case report, despi[INVESTIGATOR_255257] (83/43 mmHg and 121 beats per minute) [ADDRESS_310191] dose of medication, 
the medicatio n was continued. In our study, there is a hold dose parameter for heart rates of 120 
beats per minute or more. In the case report, the blood pressure dropped further to 76/[ADDRESS_310192] dose of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and th e blood pressure at delivery 
was 56/43.  The authors could not be sure of the hypotension being attributable to the nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255258], and her intravenous antibiotics were noted 
to be “oralised” on t he third postoperative day. Again, this single case report was notable for more 
aggressive nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255259] a woman with baseline hypotension and ruptured membranes at the 
outset, and the nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255260] p ersistent tachycardia. 
We exclude women with ruptured membranes and baseline hypotension, and our hold -dose 
parameters offer further protection; therefore, the outcome reported in this single case report is most 
unlikely to occur given the protections set up in the present study.  
 
Two recent reviews of the literature recommend nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255261]:  
1) Van Vliet et al (2014) wrote: “for the initial tocolysis, the use of ato siban or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_310193] profile.”  
2) Haram et al (2014) wrote: “nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255262] a reasonable first choice because it is easy to 
administer and also of limited side effects  relative to Beta2 -mimetics.”  
We plan to restrict use to healthy, normotensive women with singleton pregnancies not receiving 
additional tocolytic agents.  We will also not use sublingual administration of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Therefore, 
these reported adverse rea ctions are most unlikely.  
 
2. Estimate the probability (chance or likelihood of occurrence) that a given harm may occur and 
its severity (mild, moderate or severe) and define risks by [CONTACT_211911], when available, or by 
[CONTACT_255339], unlik ely, likely.  
 
Mild Events:  
Mild headache  or flushing : Likely ;  Moderate h eadache , Dizziness  or Nausea:  Unlikely  
A review (Chan et al, 2008) of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255263] -line tocolysis of [ADDRESS_310194] (9 of the 203 women, 
4.4%). Other side effects included flushing (9 of the 203 women, 4.4%), dizziness (4 of the 203 
women, 2%), nausea (3 of the 203 women, 1.5%), shortness of breath (1 of the 203 women, 0.5%). A 
study by [CONTACT_255340] (2006) found that u p to 71% of patients had flushing and 25% had  headache.  A review 
(Marin et al, 2007) of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255264] 24 patients repo rted that 11 (45.8%) had  mild headache . 
 
Moderate Events:  
Hypotension or Tach ycardia : Unlikely  
A review  (Chan et al, 2008)  of [ADDRESS_310195] -line 
tocolytic in 212 epi[INVESTIGATOR_255265] 90/60 in 3 women (1.5%). One woman (0.5%) developed tachyca rdia of at least 140 BPM.  
 
Pulmonary Edema : Rare  
There are 8 case reports/case  series (Bal et al, 2004; Vaast et al, 2004; Abbas et al, 2006; Van Geijn 
et al, 2005; Nassar et al, 2007; Gatault et al, 2008 ; Kutuk et al, 2013; Serena et al, 2014 ) including a 
total of 22 patients with pulmonary edema  in the English -language medical literature . Risk factors 
appear to be multiple gestation, sublingual (rapid -acting) or intravenous dosing of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255266] 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 13 of 20 nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , use of multiple tocolytics , prolon ged use of tocolysis and maternal cardiac disease or 
dysfunction. These risk factors will be avoided due to our very specific inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and the non-sub-lingual formulation of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255267].  In an expert review of the literature, Oe i (2006) 
recommends that intravenous nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_255268].  Intravenous formulations will 
not be used in this study, and multiple gestat ions will be excluded.  Importantly , in 26 published trials  
involving nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255207], there were no cases of pulmonary edema among patients 
receiving nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . 
 
Severe Events:  
Stillbirth or myocardial infarction : Extremely r are 
Van Veen e t al (2005) reported the only identified case of stillbirth in the English language literature 
after use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Importantly, this patient received multiple tocolytics (atosiban, indomethacin, 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) which will not be the case in our study. Only 2 case reports were found  of myocardial 
infarction associated with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255269] (Oei et al, 1999; Verhaert and Acker, 
2004). In both cases healthy babies were ultimately delivered and there were no abnormalities on 
maternal foll ow-up testing. Importantly, in these cases nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255270] 
(ritodrine), and in one case there were ruptured membranes. W e will not be using nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255271] (in this case ritodrine), nor will we be  using nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255272] (at higher risk for infection ). Of note, t here have been 3  placebo -controlled 
trials of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255273] (Lyell et al, 2008; Parry et al, 
2012; Roos et al, 2013) . Importantly , none of these  reported  severe  adverse events  for nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255274] . 
 
3.  Compare the risks of the research to standard of care.  If placebo controls are used, justify their 
use ov er active or other kinds of controls.  
 
At Parkland Ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patients  receive corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, ampi[INVESTIGATOR_255275] B streptococcus, sedation and hydration. Tocolytic drugs are not used for preterm labor . 
However, use  of tocolytic agents is within the standard of care for women with preterm labor.  Given 
that it is uncertain whether nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255276] a benefit  by [CONTACT_255341] , or only carries risks of side effec ts without benefit s, it is ethical to compare 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_99588].  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
 
1. Describe what measures have been taken and/or will be taken to prevent and minimize any 
risks or discomforts.  
 
Only singleton pregnancies in wome n with preterm labor and unruptured membranes will receive 
either  placebo or  nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  Multiple t ocolytics will not be used. Additionally, i ntravenous or 
sublingual (rapid -acting) forms of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255277]. Only women with preterm labor at 28-0/7 
weeks to 33 -6/7 weeks will be included, as women with preterm labor between 24 -0/7 weeks and 27 -
6/7 weeks receive magnesium sulfate for neu roprophylaxis and magnesium sulfate can synergize w ith 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255278]. Women with hypotension, 
tachycardia or significant maternal cardiac disease  or hypertension treated with antihypertensives  will 
be excluded  at the outset . Women with potential indications for delivery will be excluded.   Hold dose 
parameters and sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_255279] 4(1) above.  
 
2. If applicable, discuss provisions for insuring necessary medical or professional intervention in 
the event of adverse events.   
 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 14 of 20 All study participants will undergo regular vital sign monitoring while on Labor & Delivery and on the 
antepartum unit. Patients on Labor and Delivery will have continuous electronic fetal monitoring and 
tocometer evaluation, and patients on the antepartum unit  will have daily fetal heart testing . If a 
maternal or fetal complication is identified, physicians will be immediately available to intervene on 
behalf of the mother and fetus.  
 
3. Describe the plan for monitoring study data collected to protect subject safety and data 
integrity. Please review Guidance on Data and Safety Monitoring Plans  for instructions on 
what information should be provided.  If desired, the DSMP Template  may be used and 
included in your applicati on packet.  
See DSMP  
 
4. Note: investigator -initiated studies involving administration of an experimental (i.e. not FDA 
approved for the indication/population under study) drug, device or intervention must  submit a 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSMP Template ) and may be required by [CONTACT_255342] a 
Data Safety monitoring Board (DSMB).  
See DSMP  
Summary of Sections 66.0 and 67.0 of the Smart Form for the Data Safety Monitoring Plan and 
Committee  
Who comprises the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)?  
The DSMC is composed of [CONTACT_255349] McIntire, PhD, Professor and Statistician within the 
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as well as two faculty physicians from the 
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology not participating in the study ([CONTACT_255350] ts and 
[CONTACT_255351]).  
When will the DSMC meet:  
The DSMC will meet at least annually during the projected 4 year duration of the study. 
Additionally, after accrual of 75 patients (half of the planned 150 patients for recruitment), an 
interim analysis wi ll be performed.  
What will be analyzed by [CONTACT_6802]?  
The DSMC will monitor study accrual rate, study attrition including participant 
withdrawals/dropouts, patterns of AEs and/or unanticipated events, patterns of protocol 
deviations and/or violations and ch anges in risk/benefit. Efficacy (positive and negative) as 
well as possible futility of further study will be examined at the interim analysis. Significance 
levels for the interim analysis will be altered by [CONTACT_255343] -DeMets. Safety will be 
evaluat ed at each meeting of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.  
How will safety be evaluated and what study -specific stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_255280]?  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_255344] “STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16502]” below.  
The study would be stopped if nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255281], or if a 
significantly greater number of stillbirths or emergency deliveries due to nonreassuring fetal 
heart tracing attributa ble to study drug during the 48 hour period during which the study drug 
will be administered for acute tocolysis of preterm labor.  
What safety mechanisms are built into the Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255282]?  
Apart from the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and the plan to continue maternal and fetal 
monitoring for at least 24 hours after beginning the study, the following safety parameters are 
part of the study protocol:  
There will be a “HOLD DOSE” parameter in which a dose will be held if an enrolled patien t 
either refuses medication or has a heart rate greater than 120.  If a dose is held, the nurse will 
contact [CONTACT_941] 4th year resident who will ensure [CONTACT_240617] is notified.  
There will be a “STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16502]” for further individual participation in the study for any of the 
following criteria: withdrawal of consent, diffuse rash or anaphylaxis reaction to medication 
(requires confirmation by [CONTACT_255332]), hypotension requiring delivery or medication such as 
ephedrine, or development of any obstetrical outcomes th at would normally preclude tocolysis

preeclampsia/gestational hypertension, development of bleeding suspi[INVESTIGATOR_255237], 
cervical dilatation of 6 cm or more or fetal d eath), or if a decision is made to either deliver the 
patient or to give regional anesthesia.  
 
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
 
1. Describe how data/specimens will be collected and stored and the security methods in place.  
Note: the more sensitive the study data, the more sophisticated the methods should be to 
maintain confidentiality.  
 
Data on all obstetrical and neonatal outcomes are routinely entered into [CONTACT_255352]’s obstetrical 
operations database  (a secure, password -protected databas e at UT Southwestern ). 
 
2. If data/specimens will be disclosed to outside persons or entities, list the entities and the 
method used to code or de -identify the data/specimens.  
 
No data or specimens are anticipated to be disclosed to any outside persons or ent ities. 
 
3. State if you intend to apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.  
N/A 
 
13. Potential Benefits:  
 
1.  Describe the potential benefits of the research to the subjects, to others with similar problems, 
and to society.  If there is no prospect of direct benefit to the subjects, state how the knowledge 
to be gained will benefit society enough to justify any risks to subjects.  
 
Potential direct benefits to the  study participant are prolongation of pregnancy and avoidance of 
preterm birth.  Potentia l benefits to society include a  better understanding of whether nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_255283] . 
 
14. Biostatistics: (omit this section for peer -reviewed research such as cooperative group, or NIH - 
sponsored studies, and for industry -sponsored research which has been submitted to FDA)  
  
1.  Describe the statistical methods to be used to answer the study question(s).  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_255284] a method of analysis, but the justification of the target sample size is not required.  
 
T-tests (two -sided) will be used for continuous variables and Chi -squared tests for categorical 
variables.  Power will be 80% and an alpha of 0.05 will be used.  
 
2. Explain how the target sample size was determined.   
 
Previous studies done o n preterm patients at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255285] e t al (1986) , Cox and 
Leveno (1990)  and Chao et al (2011 ). In Chao et al (2011 ), there were 153 patients in 12 months. 
Over 4 years, we would anticipate four -times that (153 x 4 = 612).  In Chao et al (2011 , The Diagnosis 
and Natural History of False Preterm Labor, Obstet Gynecol ), 27% of the patients diagnosed with 
contractions and with cervical dilation of less than 2 cm delivered prior to  37 weeks’ gestation. 
However, this study by [CONTACT_255345] a prospective study. Additionally, it focused on women with 
cervical dilatation less than 2 cm , whereas the current study includes women with cervical dilation of 2 
to 4 cm dilated . Importantly,  women with more cer vical dilation are more likely to deliver early , and it is 
appropriate to revise the target enrollment .  
 
 
Version 5.1 September 18, 2015  
Page 16 of 20 Fortunately, 2 prior Randomized, (placebo) Controlled Trials (RCT) of tocolysis (magnesium and 
ritodrine)  from Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255286] . For the RCT by [CONTACT_255346] (“Single -Centre Randomised Trial of Ritodrine Hydrochloride for Preterm Labour ”, 
Lancet, 1986) in which women with singleton pregnancies and preterm labor with cervical dilation up 
to 4 cm, 39 of 52 ( 75%) patients randomized to the control group delivered b etween [ADDRESS_310196] of magnesium sulfate versus placebo by [CONTACT_255347]  
(“Randomized investigation of magnesium sulfate for prevention of preterm birth” Am J Ob stet 
Gynecol 1990) in which women with singleton pregnancies and preterm labor with cervical dilation 
less  than 5 cm, 55 of 80 (6 8.8%) of patients randomized to the  control group delivered between 27 
and 35 completed  weeks’ gestation. These are important data derived from randomized, placebo -
controlled, prospective trials done here at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255287]. An average of the above preterm birth rates for these 
two RCTs at Park land Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] 7 1.2% (39+55 / 52+80). In slight distinction to the above studies , for 
the current study, we are including women beginning at 28 weeks’ gestation, and we will be assessing 
preterm birth as delivery at less than 37 weeks. In theory, the pre term labor rate for delivery  at less 
than 37 weeks  (the primary outcome of the current trial ) would be higher than this average preterm 
birth rate for women prior to 3 5 completed  weeks’ gestation.  However, using these prospectively 
obtained numbers from pa st studies of preterm labor at Parkland hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we would need 
approximately 150 women (75 women in each of the 2 arms) in order to detect a 1/3 reduction  (from 
71.2% to 47.5%)  in the rate of preterm birth with 80% power and an alpha of 5%.  
 
Analysis of i nternal obstetrics operations data indicates that for the month of March 2015, there were 
10 women between 28 -0/7 weeks and 33 -6/[ADDRESS_310197] udy (2 had diabetes in 
pregnancy, 1 women had a twin gestation, 1 women was only 15 years of age and 1 woman had 
bleeding concerning for abruption). Of the 4 eligible women in March of 2015, 2 elected to participate 
in the study, consistent with our ongoin g consent rate of approximately 50%.  
 
Effective September 17, 2015, there has been a protocol change at the level of the Division of 
Maternal -Fetal Medicine at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This protocol change will be to give corticosteroids for 
fetal lung maturity to women with diabetes and to all women with hypertension who are at risk of 
preterm birth. This MFM Division level protocol change will affect this study of women at risk of 
preterm birth . 
 
Given that 2 of the formerly ineligible women  (due to diabetes)  who presented in March  2015  would 
now be eligible  due to the above protocol change , we estimate that up to 24 additional women (2 x 12 
= 24) would be screene d per year, and up to 12 additional women  (50% of the 24 additional 
screened)  would participate. Gi ven that there were 29 women recruited over the intitial 13 months 
(which equates to approximately 27 over 12 months), under the new practice in which corticosteroids 
will be given more broadly (and women with diabetes and mild hypertension not treated with  
medications are eligible for participation), we estimate that up to 78 -90 women would now be 
screened,  and of these, we estimate that 39-40 women would participate per year.  
 
Therefore, over ~[ADDRESS_310198] a 33% reduction in the rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks’ gestation, assuming 
80% power and a 2 -sided alpha of 5%, a sample size of 75 patients per arm (two arms, study drug 
and placebo) , [ADDRESS_310199] had 
about a 50% consent rate. Assuming a 50% recruiting rate  (50% x 300 = 150), it is estimated th at this 
study will take 4 to 5 years to complete.

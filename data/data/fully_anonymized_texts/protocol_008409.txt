CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:  A Randomized, Double Blind Placebo Controlled, First in Human Study to Evaluate the 
Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Ascending 
Subcutaneous Doses of AMG 570 in Healthy Subjects  
Study Phase:   1   
Indication:  Systemic Lupus Erythematos us 
Primary Objective:   To assess the safety and tolerability of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of 
AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To characterize the PK of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG  570 in healthy 
subjects . 
• To evaluate the PD effect s (B7RP-1 occupancy and inhibition of B cell survival) of single 
subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of AMG 570.  
 Exploratory Objective(s):   
• To evaluate  the relationship between PK, B7RP-1 occupancy,  and changes 
in percentage and absolute counts of naïve and memory B cells following single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
• To evaluate the PD effect of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy 
subjects on serum IgG and IgM. 
Hypotheses:   A single SC dose administration of AMG 570 will achieve an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile in healthy subjects within the proposed dose ranges   
(SC: 7 to 700 mg AMG 570) . 
Primary Endpoint: Subject incidences of treatment -emergent adverse events , including clinically 
significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory safety tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) . 
Secondary Endpoint(s):  
• AMG 570 PK parameters (eg,  maximum observed concentration [C
max], time at 
Cmax [tmax,], and area under the concentration- time curve [AUC]) . 
• Anti-AMG 570 binding antibodies . 
• Peripheral blood B7RP-1 receptor occupancy . 
• Peripheral blood changes in percentage and absolute counts  of naïve and memory 
CD19+ B cells (naïve = IgD+CD27-, memory = IgD-CD27+). 
Exploratory Endpoint(s): Exploratory biomarker s may include but are not limited to the 
following:  
• .  
• Serum IgG and IgM.  
Study Design:   This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, single ascending dose 
(SAD) study in healthy subjects .  The study consists of 7 SC cohorts.  Subjects will be 
randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_57041]:  AMG 570

The actual dose to be administered may be adjusted based on safety , tolerability , and preliminary 
PK and PD data of previous dose levels .  Dose adjustment s may involve either an increase or a 
decrease in the planned dose, but will not exceed pharmacokinetic criteria defined in the rationale 
for dose selection Section 2.4.5 . 
Sample Size:    Approximately 56  healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 
2 placebo in each cohort).  
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:  Subject s in this study will be males and females 
between ages of [ADDRESS_57042] a body mass index of ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2.  For a full list of eligibility 
criteria, please refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_57043] Dosage and Administration:   
This first in human study will utilize sentinel dosing for the first two subjects of each cohort.  The 
sentinel pair (the first 2 subjects in each cohort ) will be dosed with one subject receiving a single 
dose of AMG 570 and the other receiving placebo.  The remaining subjects of each cohort may 
be dosed 24 hours after the sentinel pair.  
For subcutaneous dosing in Cohorts 1 & 2, diluent will be used.  For subcutaneous dosing in 
Cohort s 3 to 5, doses will be administered in a 1.0 mL per injection format (up to 3 x 1 mL 
injections depending on treatment arm).  For subcutaneous dosing in Cohort 6, doses will be administered in a 1.5 mL per injection format (4 x 1.5 mL injections).   For su bcutaneous dosing in 
Cohort 7, doses will be administered in a 2 mL per injection format ( 5 x 2.0 mL injections).

Date:  [ADDRESS_57045] return to the research facility on an outpatient basis at s pecified 
time points for collection of blood samples for PK and PD measurements and completion of safety assessments (including blood samples for antibody analysis).  All adverse events, including serious adverse events, and use of concomitant medication will be collected for the duration of the study.   
Subjects ’ participation in the study will conclude with the completion of the end of study 
procedures .  However, if an end of study test result demonstrates a significant clinical or 
laboratory abnormality, the subject will be followed until resolution of the abnormality or until it is considered clinically stable by [CONTACT_079].  If a subject ’s CD3
-CD19+ B cell count s 
are < 107 cells/ µL (the lower limit of normal for  healthy volunteer s), the subject will return for 
further testing of B cell count s every [ADDRESS_57046] has B cell count s ≥ 107 cells/ µL.  
Such f ollow -up visit (s) for B cell counts will continue every [ADDRESS_57047] of s tudy procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ).   
Statistical Considerations:  Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographics, 
safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and biomarker end points.  Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements will include means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Data will be presented and 
summarized by [CONTACT_53399].

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Disease 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown 
cause with diverse clinical manifestations that disproportionately affects minorities (in 
particular, blacks and Hispanics) and women of childbearing potential ( Tsokos , 2011 ; 
Rahman and Isenberg, 2008; Kotzin, 1996).  The prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] 
varies widely in different studies but is generally thought to be underestimated due to the 
difficulty in diagnosis of the disease and obtaining reliable data to estimate the true 
numbers of subjects with this disease.  The prevalence of SLE in the population varies 
from 20 to 150 cases per 100,000 ( Pons -Estel, 2010; Helmick, 2008 ; Lawrence, 2008 ; 
Chakravarty,  2007).  There are significant racial differences in prevalence rates with 
164 (white) to 406 (African American) per 100,000 ( Chakravarty, 2007).  In the US, 
one-third of patients diagnosed with lupus have moderate to severe SLE.   
SLE is a heterogeneous disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_53404].   It is associated with highly variable inter -individual 
symptoms and can be fatal.  SLE can affect the skin (rash), musculoskeletal system 
(arthritis, bone tissue death), nervous system (seizures, psychosis), lungs (pleuritis, pneumonitis), and the blood (venous or arterial clots, anemia).  In addition, 
approximately 65% of patients will develop lupus nephritis, which is an inflammatory

CONFIDENTIAL    condition of the kidney that can range from mild focal to severe diffuse proliferative 
glomerulonephritis ( Adams et al, 2006 ).  Lupus nephritis can also lead to kidney failure 
and is a serious complication of SLE.   
The treatment options and duration of SLE are highly individualized and depend on 
symptom s, organ involvement, and disease severity.   Antimalarial and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful in the treatment of mild symptoms such as 
arthralgia and cutaneous manifestations .  Oral corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents are 
used in more severe disease.  Other medications (cyclophosphamide, 
immunosuppressive agents, and tacrolimus ) may be used depending on the severity and 
organ systems involved.  Belimumab  (anti-BAFF)  is a newer agent that is approved for 
patients with mild to moderate disease currently taking standard therapy.  
Although the clinical heterogeneity of SLE presents diagnostic challenges, antibodies to  
nuclear components represent a common manifestation of the disease.  The presence of  
class-switche d immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies implicate immune dysregulation 
as a driving force for disease pathogenesis, with T cells appearing to play a role in the 
development of autoantibody production by B cells .  T cells are believed to be drivers of  
many different autoimmune diseases including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) due to 
their central role in the control of immune system function.  Simultaneous blockade of 
the B7- related  protein- 1 (B7RP -1)/ inducible co- stimulator (ICOS) pathway  and 
B cell-activating factor ( BAFF ) with AMG [ADDRESS_57063] Background  
2.2.1  Pharmacology  
AMG 570 is a bispecific molecule inhibiting both BAFF and B7RP -1.  AMG 570 contains 
two tandem copi[INVESTIGATOR_53361]- binding peptides identical to the BAFF binding peptides of 
blisibimod (also known as AMG 623) fused to the C- terminus of AMG 557, a fully human 
IgG2 against B7 RP-[ADDRESS_57064]:  AMG 570

molecule showed dual -target inhibition in vivo and was more efficacious than the single

treatment of SLE.   
2.2.2  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 570 after a single IV or SC administration was 
characterized in male cynomolgus monkeys.  
PK profiles  of AMG  570 and AMG 557 were similar in cynomolgus  monkeys  (Table  1).

CONFIDENTIAL    Serum AMG 557 exposures in the FIH study (Cmax and AUC) increased more than dose 
proportionally at lower doses after either single or multiple SC doses .  However, an 
approximately dose- proportional increase in exposure was observed at higher doses 
(≥ 140 mg for SAD; ≥ 70 mg for MAD) .  Maximum concentration of AMG 557 was 
reached in 3 -7 days ( tmax) after SC administration .  Bioavailability after SC dosing was

CONFIDENTIAL    The assessment of potential side effects of AMG 570 is based on the pre- clinical studies 
conducted to date (Section 2.2.3 ) and by [CONTACT_53405] 557 and blisibimod clinical studies .  Summaries of findings from the pre -clinical 
studies with AMG 570 can be found in the AMG 570 Investigator’s Brochure ( IB).   
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
The proposed risk assessment and management plan for the study has
 been developed 
in accordance with the requirements of regulatory guidelines and strategies to identify 
and mitigate risks for FIH clinical trials with investigational medicinal products.

2.4 Rationale  
The interaction of ICOS on T cells with its sole ligand, B7RP -1 on antigen presenting 
cells, including B cells, plays a role in T cell effector functions including cytokine 
production, T cell differentiation, T cell -dependent help for B cell differentiation and 
immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching ( Moore et al, 2011 ; Paulos  et al, 2010; Dong  and 
Nurieva, 2003; McAdam  et al, 2001; Coyle  et al, 2000).  ICOS is elevated on T cells in 
patients with SLE, RA and Sjögren’ s syndrome ( Ma et al, 2012 ; Simpson et al, 2010 ; 
Approved

CONFIDENTIAL    Hu et al, 2009 ; Hutloff  et al, 2004).   B7RP -1 is expressed on B cells , dendritic cells  
(DCs) , monocytes and macrophages, and  to a lesser degree on T cells and 
non-l ymphoid cells like endothelial cells,  where it is up- regulated by [CONTACT_53406]  
(Kroczek  et al, 2004 ; Groom  et al, 2002 ; Khayyamian et al, 2002; Yoshinaga  et al,  
1999).  
BAFF is mainly expressed by [CONTACT_51920] , neutrophils  and DCs (Chu et al, 2007; 
Rickert  et al, 2011 ).  BAFF supports naïve and transitional B cell survival through binding 
to the BAFF  receptor  expressed on B cells ( Mackay  and Browing, 2002 ).  Increased 
levels of BAFF have been observed in patients with SLE, RA, and Sjögren’s syndrome 
(Mariette et al, 2003; Groom  et al, 2002 ; Cheema et al, 2001, Zhang et al, 2001).  
Elevated levels of BAFF may cause excessive survival signals to autoreactive B cells, 
possibly as they pass through critical tolerance checkpoints while maturing in the spleen and lymphoid tissues .  Indeed, increased dependence on BAFF for autoantigen binding 
B cells was demonstrated in a monoclonal Ig- transgenic model ( Lesley et al, 2004).  At 
target -saturating doses, belimumab has modest efficacy, validating the BAFF pathway  
yet also demonstrating a strong need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53362].   
The combination of a T cell modulator, AMG 557 ([COMPANY_010]’s anti -B7RP -1 mAb) , and 
BAFF binding peptides as in the B7RP -1-BAFF bispecific, AMG 570, has the potential 
for better efficacy  than belimumab.  
Dual BAFF and B7RP -[ADDRESS_57067] on the immune system.  BAFF inhibitors 
(belimumab and blisibimod) are well- tolerated in the clinic.  AMG 557 is in early clinical 
development and has an acceptable safety profile to date. 
For proof -of-concept, a mouse surrogate bispecific molecule was generated by [CONTACT_53407][INVESTIGATOR_53361]- binding peptides from AMG 523 to the C -terminus of 
anti-mouse B7RP -1 blocking antibody 1B7 (described by [CONTACT_53408], 2009 ).  AMG 523 has 
structure similar to blisibimod with two additional amino acids (Leu, Pro) at the 
N-terminus.  AMG 523 has binding specificity, affinity and cellular potency similar to 
blisibimod.  The surrogate bispecific inhibits mouse BAFF induced B cell proliferation with potency similar to the BAFF peptibody AMG 523.  The surrogate also inhibited mouse B7RP -1-Fc binding to ICOS on mouse T cells with potency similar to anti -mouse 
B7RP -1 antibody 1B7.  The surrogate bispecific PK property was evaluated in mouse.  
Male CD- 1 mice were given single dose intravenous (IV) administration via lateral tail 
vein of surrogate bispecific (5mg/kg), anti- B7RP -1 mAb 1B7 (4.68mg/kg), or anti -BAFF

CONFIDENTIAL    peptibody AMG 523 (1.88mg/kg).  Doses of the bispecific and single parental inhibitors 
were adjusted based on MW to be molar equivalents.  The surrogate bispecific has PK 
properties similar to 1B7 in mouse with no detectable clippi[INVESTIGATOR_53363]- binding 
peptides .   
To investigate the dual PD effects of the surrogate bispecific, we evaluated the surrogate 
bispecific effect on B cells, memory T cells and antibody responses in the sheep red 
blood cell (SRBC) challenge model.  BALB/c mice (n=5) were immunized with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) on day 0 and boosted on day 28.  Mice were treated with mIgG1  isotype control (5mpk), anti -mouse B7RP -1 antibody 1B7 (5mpk), anti- BAFF 
peptibody AMG 523 (5mpk), combination of 1B7 (5mpk) and AMG 523 (5mpk), or surrogate bispecific (1, 5 or 10 mpk) twice per week for 5 weeks starting on day 0.  Spleen cells were collected on day 35 for FACS analysis and B cell numbers were measured as a PD marker to monitor BAFF inhibition.  AMG 523 treatment led to more than 50% reduction of splenic B cells, whereas no significant B cell reduction was 
observed with anti- B7RP -[ADDRESS_57068], memory T cells (CD4+CD44hiCD62Lo) in spleen were 
measured by [CONTACT_53409].  Splenic memory T cells were significantly reduced in the 
1B7 treated group, but not in the AMG [ADDRESS_57069] of the surrogate bispecific was comparable to the combination of anti -BAFF and 
anti-B7RP -1 treatment group.  In addition, and importantly for a bispecific approach, the 
effective doses for B cell vs. memory T cell reduc tion were in a similar range.  
The surrogate bispecific was compared with single agent treatment in the NZB/NZW lupus model, a mouse model of spontaneous disease, in both prophylactic and therapeutic mode.  Surrogate bispecific treatment resulted in B cell redu ction similar to 
that observed with combination or AMG 523 treatment and B7RP -1 occupancy similar to 
combination or 1B7 treatment groups.  Altogether, prophylactic treatment with surrogate bispecific was comparable to combination therapy and more efficacious than single agents in the NZB/NZW lupus model.  
The surrogate bispecific was also compared with single agents in NZB/NZW mice with delayed initiation of treatment starting at 7.[ADDRESS_57070] in improving survival, with p=0.0029 compared with isotype control (Kaplan Meier

CONFIDENTIAL    Plot).  Combination treatment also had modest yet significant effect in improving 
survival, with p=0.[ADDRESS_57071] fused to the N -terminus of each 
chain of a human Fc.  The peptides in AMG 570 are BAFF- binding peptides identical to 
those in blisibimod.  Molecular weights of AMG 570, AMG 557 and blisibimod are 
approximately 161, 148 , and 64 kDa, respectively.  
2.4.2  AMG 557 Clinical Background 
Single dose administration of AMG 557 to subjects  with mild, stable SLE with 
subcutaneous (SC) doses of 1.8, 6, 18, 60, 140, and IV dosing o f 210 mg and 18 mg 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no observed neutralizing antibodies (study 20060132).  AMG 557 demonstrated nonlinear pharmacokinetic properties, as 
expected for a therapeutic targeting a cell surface receptor .  The degree  of target 
occupancy was dose/concentration- related, reversible, and achieving maximal levels in 
the 140 mg SC group.  Consistent pharmacodynamic effects on immunophenotype or 
KLH responses were not observed following single doses of AMG 557.   
The estimated mean AMG 557 target occupancy IC
50 was 0. 0888 μg/mL (0. 60 nM), IC 90 
of 0.8 μg/mL (5. 4 nM), and IC 99 of 8.8 μg/mL (59.5  nM). 
2.4.3  Blisibimod Clinical Background 
Subjects with mild to moderate SLE were treated with blisibimod single SC doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0,  or 3.0 mg/kg or IV doses of 1.0, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/k g in a first -in-human study 
(study 20040147) and multiple dose 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 (SC) or 6.0 (IV) mg/kg in phase1b 
(study 20040250) .  Blisibimod treatment led to a significant decrease in naïve B cells 
(IgD
+CD27-) and an increase in class -switched memory B cel ls (IgD-CD27+) (Stohl  et al,  
2015) .  This significant reduction in naïve B -cells was observed when blisibimod 
concentration was 3 μg/mL (47 nM) or higher .  No consistent effects on T cells, NK cells, 
plasmablasts, or plasma cells were evident .  The Phase 2 study of blisibimod in subjects 
with moderate -to-severe SLE ( Furie, 2014) demonstrated significantly higher SLE 
Responder Index  (SRI-5) responses in subjects randomized to the highest dose of 
blisibimod 200 mg once- weekly (QW at Week 20 (p=0.02)).

Preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics results from the cohorts 
receiving 7- 140 mg of study 20140322, are described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. of the 
Investigator’s Br ochure.

based on predicted human exposures utilizing clinical PK and pharmacodynamics ( PD) 
human data from AMG  557,as well as  PK, pharmacology, and toxicology data from 
AMG  570, and data from blisibimod clinical studies . 
The exposure margins were computed from serum AMG 570 exposures at the NOAEL 
of 200 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys determined in a 3 month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study, and from the projected human PK exposures for the 
proposed doses .  AMG 570 and AMG 557 PK in cynomologus monkeys were 
comparable based on PK studies for AMG 570 and AMG 557, as shown in Table 1 .  The 
projected AMG  570 human PK simulations were initially conducted using mean PK/PD 
parameters derived from modeling AMG [ADDRESS_57076] since been updated based on emerging data from this study  (Table 2 ). 
Given the safety and tolerability of AMG 557 and blisibimod, the established PK/PD relationships, and the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg, the first dose level of this study will be 
7 mg SC, derived from  the US FDA guidance on the maximum recommended starting 
dose (MRSD )(CDER, 2005) .  This dose is expected to demonstrate intermediate

CONFIDENTIAL    As outlined in Section 6.1 of the Investigator’s Brochure, preliminary assessment of data 
from this study indicates dose- related and reversible receptor occupancy of B7RP -1 
(now referred to as ICOSL in the Investigator’s Brochure).  Preliminary assessment on total circulating B cells indicates a significant reduction in B cell relative to baseline at day 57 in cohorts 2 (21 mg) and 3 (70 mg) compared to the accumulated placebo.  
Preliminary assessment of IgM and IgG levels indicate that relative to baseline, 
AMG  [ADDRESS_57078] planned SC dose, the 
exposure margins are 44- and 10- fold below the C
max and AUC at the NOAEL in 
monkeys.  Based on interim pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from this 
ongoing study, it is also anticipated that a 700 mg SC dose of AMG  570 is expected to 
result in 90% or more B7RP -1 RO at day 8 and B cell depletion of up to  40% compared 
to baseline by [CONTACT_4475] 57.  Significant changes to circulating IgG and IgM levels are not 
anticipated based on interim data. 
In summary, the dose range of 7 mg to 700  mg SC is projected to result in human 
exposures less than the exposures tested in the cynomolgus monkey 3- month GLP 
toxicology study .  This dose range is expected to be well tolerated and to result in 
pharmacological activity useful for dose selection in subsequent clinical trials.  
2.4.6  Rationale for Key Aspects of Study Design 
Healthy volunteers are to be enrolled in this single ascending dose (SAD) study .  The 
understanding of both targets of AMG 570, B7RP -[ADDRESS_57079]:  AMG 570  
Protocol Number:  20140322  
Date:  24 January 2018  Page 26 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    Biomarkers include B7RP -1 target occupancy on peripheral blood B cells and 
.  The percentage and absolute counts of 
total lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocyte populations including 
CD3+  T cells, CD16/56+ NK cells and naïve and memory CD19+ B cells 
(naïve = IgD+CD27-; memory =  IgD-CD27+)  will be determined.  The levels of serum IgG 
and IgM immunoglobulins and  will also be measured.  
2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
A single SC dose administration of AMG 570 will achieve acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile s in healthy subjects within the proposed dose ranges  (7 to 700 mg SC 
AMG 570).  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, SAD study in healthy subjects. 
The study consists of 7 SC cohorts.  Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 
AMG 570 or placebo according to  Table 3 .  The overall study design is described by a 
study schema  at the end of the protocol  synopsis section.   The study endpoints are 
defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.2 Number of Sites  
Three sites in the US wil l be utilized in this study .  Additional sites may be added at the 
discretion of the medical monitor.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.   Approximately 
56 healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 2 placebo in each cohort).

CONFIDENTIAL    3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects 
The planned length of  participation in the study will be approximately 5 months  (13 visits)  
which includes up to 6 weeks  for screening , 1 day for drug dosing, 15 weeks for 
evaluation of drug distribution, followed by [CONTACT_53410]  (EOS) visit . 
Subject ’s participation in the study will conclude at the completion of the end of s tudy 
procedures.  Once complete, this will conclude the subject’s participation in the study. 
However, if an end of study test result demonstrates a significant clinical or laboratory 
abnormality, the subject will be followed until resolution of the abnorm ality or until it is 
considered clinically stable by [CONTACT_079].  If a subject’s CD3-CD19+ B cell 
count s are  < 107 cells/ µL (the lower  limit of normal for healthy volunteer s 
(Becton,  Dickinson , 2015) ), the subject will return for further testing of B cell count s 
every [ADDRESS_57081] has B cell counts ≥ 107 cells/ µL.  Follow -up visits for 
B cell counts will continue every [ADDRESS_57082] (IRB) will be informed via written correspondence.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion:  the time when the last subject has completed the EOS  visit as 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ). 
End of Trial :  the time when the last subject has completed either the EOS  visit or the 
last safety follow -up visit .  See Section 3.5.[ADDRESS_57083] ELIGIBILITY

Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written i nstitutional review board (IRB) approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form  (ICF) , and all other subject information and/or 
recruitment material, if applicable ( Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign and 
date the ICF before commencement of study -specific procedures .  A subjec t is 
considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all eligibility 
criteria.  
The Investigator is to document the enrollment decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment eCRF.  
Each subject who ent ers into the screening period for the study , which is the first time 
that a subject undergoes  detailed assessments to determine their potential for eligibility 
into the study, receives a unique subject identification number before any study procedures are performed.  The subject identification number will be assigned manually.  
This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  A screen failed subject may be 
rescreened up to two times at the discretion of the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_53367].  
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if  a subject is 
rescreened.  The identification number will be 11 digits: the first 3 are the protocol 
identifier ( 322), the next 5 digits represent the site number which consists of the 2- digit 
country code (66) and 3- digit study -specific site number (001),  and the last 3 digits are 
assigned in sequential order as subjects are screened (eg, 001, 002, 003, etc.).  Thus, 
the first subject screened at site [ADDRESS_57097]:  AMG 570

5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Randomization to AMG [ADDRESS_57098] or designee .  On Day 1 , once eligibility for study participation has been 
confirmed (based on data collected during screening visits and on Day -1), eligible 
subjects will be randomized to receive either AMG [ADDRESS_57099]’s medical record and on the enrollment eCRF.  
Unique randomization numbers will be assigned in sequential order according to when each subject met the eligibility criteria.  At no time will the same randomization number 
be assigned to more than one subject.  
In the event a subject is randomized, but withdraws before receiving study medication, or during the study for reasons other than adverse events ( Section 9.1), a replacement  
subject may be enrolled at the discretion of the [COMPANY_010] Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator .  The unblinded study pharmacist or designee will be notified.  The new 
subject will receive the identical treatment as the replaced subject but will be assigned a replacement number per the randomization list.  
5.[ADDRESS_57100]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the  
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study or may  
potentially impact the safety of subjects currently enrolled or subjects in subsequent cohort s.  Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol  
deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_53413]’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 
[ADDRESS_57101]’s Investigational Product Administration Electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF).

CONFIDENTIAL    The DLRM voting members will be responsible for dosing decisions, which may include:  
1) escalation to the next planned dose  
2) escalation to an intermediate dose (a dose lower than the next planned dose)  
3) de-escalation to a lower dose 
4) continuation, delay, or termination of dosing  
5) repetition or expansion of a cohort.  
Dose adjustments (if any) will be made on a treatment cohort basis and not on an 
individual basis, and will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_53414], PK, 
and/or PD data.  
Dose Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53369] 570 will be either stopped or modified to a lower dose if suspected adverse drug reactions and/or changes in safety data (including but not limited to vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory result s, or laboratory parameters reflecting 
humoral immune status) are observed and these changes pose a health risk.  A DLRM 
is held when a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has occurred.  A DLT is defined as any 
treatment -related fatal, life threatening or disabling serious adverse event (SAE) .  In 
addition, any adverse event or change in vital signs, clinical laboratory test value, or ECG which is considered drug related, and poses a significant health risk, as determined by [CONTACT_53415], would also constitute a DLT and form the basis for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53370] .  If a decision is made not to proceed following 
dosing of sentinel subjects, a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM) will be held.  In addition, dosing will be stopped or modified  if any of the scenarios shown in Table [ADDRESS_57108] safety will be monitored through adherence to rules 
for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53371] a dose cohort (which precludes any further dose escalation).

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table 8) are essential and required for study conduct. 
This section lists the procedure and parameters of each planned study assessment.  
The exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Section 7).  
Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs , and blood draws are scheduled for the same 
nominal time , the assessment should occur in the following order : ECG s, vital signs, 
blood draws.  The timing of the assessment should allow the blood draw to occur at the exact nominal time.  
The timing and number of planned study assessment s, including: Safety, PK, PD and 
Immunogenicity assessment may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg,  to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentration) 
to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
The IRB will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety 
monitoring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form.  
No more than [ADDRESS_57128] of care or as required by  
[CONTACT_53420]’s discretion. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_57129] be met per inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment.  
The following procedures will be completed during the screening period at  time points 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  8).

binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies may be further 
characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  
Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti AMG 570 antibodies during the study .  In the event of safety -related concerns, m ore frequent testing (eg,  every 
month) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested.  Follow -up testing is not 
required where it is established that the subject did not receive AMG 570.  
Subjects who test positive for binding antibodies, and have clinical sequelae that are 
considered potentially related to an anti -AMG 570 antibody response may also be asked 
to return for additional follow -up testing.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  8), as applicable, for specific time points and the laboratory manual for detailed

on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease activity a nd/or responsiveness to AMG 570.  The goals include the use of genetic 
markers to help in the investigation to identify subjects who may have positive or 
negative response to AMG  570.  No additional samples will be collected for this part of 
the study; however for those subjects who consent to these studies, DNA will be extracted from samples already collected from the exploratory biomarker sample.   
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment (Table  8) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.   
This analysis  includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid 
data throughout the course of the study.  The analysis can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for 
method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is  assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.   
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
dose response and/or prediction of response to AMG 570, characterize antibody 
response, and characterize aspec ts of the molecule (eg , mechanism of action/target, 
metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_57144]’s medical record and are not to be

8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal fr om the study.   
8.1.1  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures, or the study as a whole at any time prior to study completion.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.[ADDRESS_57150]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout ) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than expected by [CONTACT_093]’s assessment .  A pre -existing condition 
that has not worsened more than anticipated ( ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) 
during the study, or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event.

Date:  24 January 2018  Page 54 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject requests to 
withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53392], refer to 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_57151] 1 of the following serious criteria.  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically  important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility ( eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but  it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug induced liver injury 
(DILI) (see  Appendix  A for DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an 
emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures 
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do n ot Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_53426].  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• Severity

CONFIDENTIAL    • Assessment of relatedness to investigational product 
• Action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) .  The grading scale used in this study is described in 
Appendix  A.  The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related 
to the investigational produc t.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response 
to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_7198] . 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,  
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF.  The 
investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_53427]’s medical record and are submitted to 
[COMPANY_010] .  All serious adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via fax. 
See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet .   
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedur e”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.

To comp ly with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory 
authorities in accordance with local requirements.   
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adver se events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries ( eg, European Union [EU] 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.

10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Approximately 56 healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 2 placebo in 
each cohort) .  This sample size is based on practical considerations and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_53393] .  For safety considerations, for a cohort, with 6 subjects receiving 
AMG  570, there is an 82% chance of at least one subject experiencing an adverse event 
with a true incidence rate of 25% and a 74% chance of at least one subject experiencing an adverse event with 20% true incidence rate.  With a total of 42 subjects expected to 
receive AMG 570 across all 7 cohorts, there is a 34% chance of at least [ADDRESS_57156] 
experiencing an adverse event with a true incidence rate of 1% and the chance of at least [ADDRESS_57157] experiencing an adverse event increases to 88% and 99% with a true

Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Jou rnals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.  
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publicatio ns (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for corporate review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments 
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3 require 
the following:  
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event ( ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF ( eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver a bnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_57175](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_57176] or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_57177] are to undergo a 
period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed durin g this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve  
• Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have 
been discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic. 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to assess for autoimmune hepatitis

− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for  pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormal ities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to 
continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_57178](s) and protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as  medical history, concomitant

• Length of in- house stay – up to 11 days allowed for in- house residence 
• CDC vaccine recommendation – flu season (October -May)  
• Renal disease exclusion criteria – removal of additional criteria does not pose 
safety risk, does not interfere with ability to assess safety of subject, and does 
not affect scientific integrity of study. 
• Screening IgG below 800 mg/dl  – review with [COMPANY_010] Medical Monitor prior to 
enrollment  
• Delegation of responsibilities to designated physician or nurse practitioner  
• Timing  of consecutively run ECGs –  ECGs should be run in as short a time as 
possible 
• Self-evident correct ions – updated template language  has been  incorporated into 
protocol  
Administrative , typographical  and formatting changes  have been made throughout the

Healthy Subjects 
 
[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number AMG 570 20140322 
 
Change Summary  Date: 27 October 2015 
 
Rationale: The AMG 570 20140322 protocol is being amended in response to FDA concerns for the 
potential of prolonged immune suppression in healthy subjects based on decreases in B 
cells and serum IgG levels observed in the 3-month repeat dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys   and inadequate  nonclinical   toxicology studies to support the IV 
route of administration. 
Specifically, the following major changes are being made: 
• Removal of all language pertaining to 210 mg and 420 mg intravenous (IV) 
administration  
• Update to the Serum AMG 570 concentration-time profile  
• Changes to Section [IP_ADDRESS] to include increasing length of DLRM interval from 28 to 
57 days and addition of Humoral Immune Status Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] 
• Update to Schedule of Assessments (SOA) pertaining to language about IV dosing 
• Alignment of Endpoints listed in Section 10. 1.1 with other sections of the protocol 
 
Minor typographical errors were corrected and clarifications were made.

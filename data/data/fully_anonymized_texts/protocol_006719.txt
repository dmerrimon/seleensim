 2. Protocol Synopsis 
RANGER II SFA:  A 3:1 Randomized Trial Comparing th e [LOCATION_011] Scientific RANGER™ 
Paclitaxel Coated Balloon vs Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of S uperficial 
Femoral A rteries (SFA) and Proximal Popliteal Arteries (PPA)  
Trial  
Objective(s)  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Ranger ™ Paclitaxel Coated 
Balloon for treating lesions located in the superficial femoral and 
proximal popliteal arteries (SFA/PPA).  
Planned 
Indication(s) for Use The Ranger drug coated balloon (DCB) is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), after successful pre -dilatation, of de novo 
or restenotic lesions up to 180 mm in length located in native superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries (SFA/PPA) with reference vessel diameters of [ADDRESS_398320] Device  Ranger ™ Paclitaxel Coated PTA Balloon Catheter ( Ranger DCB)  
Control Device  Standard Percutaneous Angioplasty (PTA) Balloon: Balloon Angioplasty  
Device Sizes  I. Ranger ™ Paclitaxel Coated PTA Balloon Cathet er (Test Device)  
The working catheter length is 135 cm for all diameters  with two 
exceptions:   The 4 mm  diameter balloons (80 mm and 100 mm length 
balloons) are only  available with a working shaft length of 80 cm. 
 
The R anger  DCB  balloons (test device) are provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
 
 Balloon Length  (mm)  
30 40 60 80 100 
Balloon  
Diameter  
(mm)  4.[ADDRESS_398321] PTA (Control Device)  
Standard PTA  (non- scoring)  device size (diameter, balloon and 
catheter lengths)  utilization is determined by [CONTACT_322622]. 
Standard PTA balloons (non- scoring) are commercially available 
balloons that the investigative sites utilize from their inventory.  
Note: Drug coated balloons must  be overlapped to cover targeted lesion(s) 
as specified in the inclusion criteria.  
Trial Design  The clinical trial is a global, prospective, multicenter, single -blind, 
superiority, 3:1 ( Ranger  DCB vs. Standard PTA) controlled randomized

 clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Ranger  
DCB in subjects with claudication  and/or rest pain and with a positive 
diagnostic finding of de novo , non- stented  and  non- atherectomy -treated  
or restenotic lesion (s) in the SFA and/or PPA.  
Pharmacokin etic Substudy 
Concurrently, a human pharmacokinetics (PK) investigation (substudy) of 
this trial is also planned. This substudy is a prospective, multicenter, non-
randomized study arm ( Ranger  DCB), conducted at multiple pre -specified 
investigational sites designed to evaluate the levels of paclitaxel in the systemic circulation of subjects at multiple time points after treatment with the R anger  DCB.  
Although an investigative center can participate in both the RCT and PK trial arms, a subject can either be enrolled in the RCT study arm or the PK sub-study, but not both. 
Blinding  / 
Unblinding  The RANGER II SFA trial is conducted as single blind. Subjects will be blinded to treatment assigned and treatment received. All subjects must remain blinded until completion of all 12 month follow -up visits (primary 
endpoint). 
Packaging of the investigati onal R anger  DCB and control PTA devices 
differ. Therefore the Investigator and staff performing the procedure will 
not be blinded to the assigned treatment arm or resulting treatment.  
Trial  center personnel will be trained not to disclose the treatment 
assignment to the subject in order to minimize the potential unblinding of 
the subjects.  
The Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) Core Laboratory personnel, Angiography Core Laboratory personnel, and Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will remain blinded to each subject’s tr eatment assignment through primary 
endpoint. 
Those involved in data analysis for the Sponsor will remain blinded until 
the primary endpoint interim analysis.  
Planned Number of Subjects  Up to [ADDRESS_398322] 376 subjects will be enrolled into the randomized arm of the trial 
to yield:  
 282 subjects to receive treatment with the R anger  DCB; 
investigational test device  
 [ADDRESS_398323] PTA; control device  
From 12 to 20 subj ects will receive treatment with the R anger  DCB for 
the non- randomized PK substudy.  Approximately 25% of those enrolled 
into the PK substudy will have long lesions ( ≥100 mm) treated with the 
Ranger  DCB.

 Planned 
Number of 
Investigational 
Sites / Countries  Up to 80 trial centers worldwide may enroll subjects into the RANGER  II 
SFA global  pi[INVESTIGATOR_322599]. Countries that may participate include 
centers located in Australia, Canada, European Union, Japan, New Zealand and the [LOCATION_002].  
Approximately 10 trial centers may enroll subjects into the PK substudy.  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint  The primary safety endpoint assesses the occurrence of Major Adverse Events (MAE) defined as all -cause death through 1 month, target limb 
major amputation through 12 months, a nd/or target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) through [ADDRESS_398324] -index procedure.  Primary effectiveness is defined 
as a binary endpoint determined by [CONTACT_136665] (DUS) peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_398325] group is superior to the 
control group.  
Notes : 
 Lesion patency is defined as freedom from more than 50% stenosis based on DUS PSVR comparing data within the treated segment to 
the proximal normal arterial segment.  
 PSVR >2.4 suggests >50% stenosis. 
The treated segment will be assessed for patency as a single segment regardless of the number of tandem lesions within the ballooned segment.  
Secondary Endpoints   Technical success defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation and deflation and retrieval of the intact trial device without burst below the rated burst pressure (RBP)  
 Procedural success defined as residual stenosis of ≤ 50% (non- stented 
subjects) or ≤ 30% (stented subjects) by [CONTACT_322623] (if core laboratory assessment is not available then the site -reported 
estimate is used)  
 Clinical success defined as p rocedural success without procedural 
complications (i.e. death, major target limb amputation, thrombosis of the target lesion, or clinically -driven TLR) prior to discharge  
 Major Adverse Events (MAE) through [ADDRESS_398326]-index procedure, TLR, and major target limb 
amputation  
 Death of any cause within 30 days, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months  
 TVR rates at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months  
 TLR rates at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months

Method of  
Assigning Patients to Treatment  Subjects presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain, an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral and/or proximal popliteal artery and a patent outflow artery to the foot are considered for the trial.  
If after consenting, meeting inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, confirmed angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral and/or proximal popliteal artery and successful protocol -defined 
pre-dilatation, subjects are randomized 3:1 to either a  Ranger DCB (test) 
or a Standard PTA balloon (control).  
In the PK substudy, subjects will not be randomized; all subjects will be treated with the R anger  DCB.  
Subjects are considered enrolled when the R anger  DCB or Standard PTA 
is introduced into the subj ect’s vasculature.  
Note : If the subject is found to meet exclusion criteria during the 
angiographic eligibility assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not be entered into this trial (no randomization nor enrollment) The subj ect should be cared for and followed outside of 
the trial based on the physician’s treatment plan.  
Note : If the balloon angioplasty attempt  with the assigned treatment 
device ( the test device R anger  DCB or control device Standard PTA)  is 
not successful, follow -up through the 1 month visit only will occur  as part 
of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population.  Data for assessment of MAE will be collected for these subjects.  No other testing or follow up is required.

Note : A subject is exempt from the above -mentioned antiplatelet 
requirements if he/she requires Coumadin or other similar anti -coagulant 
due to known comorbidities and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the combination of a ntiplatelet and anticoagulant could put the subject at an 
unreasonable risk of bleeding.

Multiple Interventions During Index Procedure  Contralateral & Ipsilateral Limb Lesions  
Using  the same access site, iliac l esion(s) in the contralateral and 
ipsilateral limb may be treated during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially (non -drug coated) available device 
occurs prior to randomization of the  target SFA/PPA lesion(s); 
 Treatment of the lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae (success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_142184]) and  
If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be randomized  into 
the trial but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
Note: Provisional stenting of the target lesion with bare -metal stents can 
be completed in cases where adequate results could not be obtained after using post -dilatation balloons; such as  in the case of remaining residual 
stenosis[≥ 50%] or major [≥ Grade D] flow -limiting dissection after post-
dilatation.

 Adaptive 
Sequential  
Testing 
Hypotheses 
Strategy  The primary effectiveness and safety hypothes es will be tested 
simultaneously in an adaptive group sequential manner at the overall significance level of one -sided 2.5%. The Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function by  [CONTACT_322626] M ethod with Rho=2 will be used to determine 
the interim and the final type I error adjustment. With a minimum of 75% 
of 12- month required subjects planned to be assessed in the interim 
analysis, the adjusted type I error will be distributed as 1.41% for the interim analysis  (i.e. 75%) and 1.92% for the final analysis  (i.e. 100%) . 
The actual interim and final alpha  adjustments  will be calculated based on 
the alpha spending function when the exact interim proportion is observed  
(e.g. >75%).  
Note: when Rho=2, the alpha adjustments are between Pocock’s method 
(Rho=1) and O’Brien- Fleming’s method (Rho=3 ). 
Primary 
Effectiveness  
Statistical Hypothes is The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be tested is that 12- month 
primary patency in subjects treated with R anger  DCB is superior to 
subjects treated with Standard PTA at an overall one- sided significance 
level of 2.5%.  
Primary  
Effectiveness Statisti cal Test 
Method Parameters  The Chi -Square Test will be used to assess the hypothesis of superiority in 
proportions:  
H
0: Pt -  Pc  ≤  0 
H1: Pt -  Pc  > [ADDRESS_398336] PTA  at an overall one -sided significance level of 2.5%.  
Primary Safety Statistical Test Method  The Chi -Square Test will be used to assess the hypothesis of non-
inferiority in proportions:  
H
0: Pt -  Pc  ≤  ∆ 
H1: Pt -  Pc  > ∆  
where Pt and Pc are the [ADDRESS_398337] PTA , respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non- inferiority 
margin of - 10%.  
Success Criteria 
for the RCT  Success Criteria for the Interim Analysis  
(for example, 75% subjects to be assessed at the interim analysis)  
Range r DCB will be concluded to be superior to Standard PTA  for device 
effectiveness in the interim analysis if the one -sided lower 98.59% 
confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups (R anger  
DCB – Standard PTA ) in 12 -month primary patency is gre ater than zero.

sided lower 98.59% confidence bound on the difference between 
treatment groups (R anger  DCB – Standard PTA ) in 12- month MAE -free 
is greater than -0.1. 
The study success will be concluded as both primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints being achieved in the interim analysis.  
Success Criteria for the Final Analysis  
(all subjects to be assessed at the final analysis  when the interim analysis 
is not able to be concluded)   
If for any reason the final analysis is required to demonstrate  superiority, 
Ranger  DCB will be concluded to be superior to Standard PTA  for device 
effectiveness in the final analysis if the one- sided lower 98.08% 
confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups (R anger 
DCB – Standard PTA ) in [ADDRESS_398339] PTA  if the one -
sided lower 98.08% confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups (R anger  DCB – Standard PTA ) in 12- month MAE -free 
is greater than -0.1. 
As required, the study success will be concluded as both primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints being achieved in the final analysis.

 4. Introduction  
Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity after 
myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Current estimates state that there are over 8 million US 
and 200 million global patients with PAD1, 2 with an age –adjusted prevalence ranging from 12 to 
20 percent3, 4. The p revalence of PAD among individuals age 65- 69 years is 10.08% for women 
and 10.33% for men with advances to 18.38% for women and 18.83% for men by [CONTACT_654] 85- [ADDRESS_398349], or critical limb ischemia (CLI) (i.e., rest pain, ulceration or gangrene); whereas, another third have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_322600]. In very serious cases, this blocked blood flow can lead to leg 
amputation .  
PAD is a progressive disease of the circulatory system; excluding the heart and brain.  Atherosclerosis is a build -up of plaque in the circulatory system. Over time, plaque hardens 
narrowing the arteries and limiting oxygen -rich blood flow to parts of the body. Treatment 
include s lifestyle interventions, medical treatment to prevent cardiovascular events as well as 
surgery and endovascular interventions. The majority of the patients remain stable or improve in respo nse to lifestyle modification . But there are also patients who do not improve with this 
conservative management. They need revascularisation procedures to restore or improve their peripheral circulation. Notably, the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is equally high in patients with PAD, regardless of the pr esence of symptoms
6.  Non -revascularized lower 
extremity PAD is the most common cause of lower extremity amputation7. 
Endovascular Treatment of PAD in the  SFA/PPA  
In general, the debate for state- of-the-art therapy in SFA disease involves endovascular 
intervention versus by[CONTACT_4897]. Historically, surgery is generally reserved for resting pain 
and critical limb ischemia.  However, surgical therapy carries significant morbidity, including 
wound infection, MI and even death. In addition, up to [ADDRESS_398350] also  increased with the use of atherectomy devices 
and drug -eluting stents (DES). Often, patients with PAD have comorbidities that increase the 
risk of cardiovascular complications with surgical procedures. These factors have led to the 
adoption of an endovasc ular first strategy with surgical management reserved for selected 
patients2, 9. 
Patients with very short pain -free walking distance are typi[INVESTIGATOR_322601]. 
According to American College of Cardiologists/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, endovascular treatment of SFA disease is indicated for individuals with significant disability due to intermittent claudication (IC) or CLI.  
The femoropopliteal segment is a challenging vascular territory and has been among the least effective of all endovascular procedures in terms of long -term patency
10,11,12.  The SFA is the 
longest artery in the human body and is located be tween two major flexion points, the knee and 
the hip. The relatively small vessel lumen, in conjunction with a high plaque burden, slow flow, and a high frequency of primary occlusions, contributes to considerable technical difficulties. In

                                                                                                                       Page [ADDRESS_398351], the current evolution towar ds 
treating more complex femoropopliteal lesions as seen in the renewed TransAtlantic Inter -
Society Consensus (TASC) II recommendations clearly reflects the continuous evolutions in 
femoropopliteal stent design15. In most cases, the progression of atherosc lerotic flow -limiting 
lesions in the blood vessels of the legs frequently involves the infra -popliteal arteries, resulting in 
a worsening diagnosis of CLI.  
In the past, balloon angioplasty alone was the treatment of choice for the femoropopliteal artery segment
14. Percuteous t ransluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a procedure that can open up a blocked 
blood vessel using a small, flexible plastic tube, or catheter, with a "balloon" at the end of it. When the tube is in place, it inflates to open the blood vessel , or artery, so that blood flow is 
restored. The TASC working group suggested that primary success rates were above 90% with a very low rate of complications (< 4%)
14,15. However, within one year, patency failure rates above 
70% were observed after balloon angioplasty in lesions longer than [ADDRESS_398352] flexible nitinol stent is needed to mitigate stent fracture that often occurs in the femoropopliteal arteries.  
Although above the knee use of nitinol bare metal stents (BMS) is safe and feasible, it is evidently associated with significant neointimal hyperplasia and early restenosis
 20, 21 which  may 
be due to the chronic external forces on the vessel/stent interface resulting in a chronic stimulus for restenosis
22. Therefore, the interest of investigators turned towards the pharmaceutical 
ingredients such as paclitaxel and everolimus to suppress neointimal growth and restenosis after stent deployment. DES technology was developed to prevent early thrombosis and late luminal loss to potentially improve long -term patency rates for SFA
23.  
The use of drug coated balloon (DCB) treatment has emerged as  a therapeutic alternative in the 
treatment of PVD/PAD  in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries (SFA/PPA) . In 
many European countries, DCBs have been utilized to treat PAD since 200 3. Based on the 
results of the following three clinical trials, two DCBs are approved for use in the [LOCATION_002]. 
LEVANT I (Lutonix Paclitaxel- Coated Balloon for the Prevention of Femoropopliteal 
Restenosis) was a prospective, single blind (to patient), randomized (1:1) trial comparing LLL in 
femoropopliteal l esions treated with the Lutonix DCB versus an uncoated balloon. Demographic, 
peripheral vascular disease, and lesion characteristics were matched, with mean lesion length of 8.1 ± 3.8 cm and 42% total occlusions. At 6 months, late lumen loss was 58%  lower for the 
Lutonix DCB group (0.46 ± 1.13 mm) than for the control group (1.09 ± 1.07 mm; p = 0.016). Composite 24- month major adverse events were 39% for the DCB group, including 15 target 
lesion revascularizations, 1 amputation, and 4 deaths versus 46% for uncoated balloon group, with 20 target lesion revascularizations, 1 thrombosis, and 5 deaths. Pharmacokinetics showed

angioplasty with a drug -coated balloon (316 patients) or standard angioplasty (160). With respect 
to the primary composite safety end point, the proportion of patients free from perioperative death from any cause or free at 1 2 months from index -limb amputation, index -limb 
reintervention, and index -limb–related death was 83.9% in the drug -coated –balloon group versus 
79.0% in the standard- angioplasty group, which met the prespecified criterion for noninferiority 
(P=0.005 for noninferiority). The proportion of patients who had primary patency at 12 months (the primary efficacy end point) was significantly greater with the drug -coated balloon than with 
the standard angioplasty balloon (65.2% vs. 52.6%, P=0.02)

popliteal peripheral artery disease (PAD) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio  to treatment with 
DCB or PTA.   One year (12 mth) data results are as follows: The DCB resulted in higher 
primary patency vs. PTA (82.2% vs. 52.4%; P <.001). The rate of clinically -driven target lesion 
revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm compared with  20.6% in the PTA arm ( P<.001). 
There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA 
(P=.10)). There were no device - or procedure -related deaths and no major amputations26. 
4.1. Clinical Program Development  
4.1.1. Ranger DCB Platform  
The Ranger DCB is  a paclitaxel -coated Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) balloon 
catheter developed as a collaborative effort between BSC and Hemoteq AG [HTQ, Wuerselen, [LOCATION_013]]. This co -development relationship leverages BSC’s extensive  Sterling™ catheter 
experience and HTQ’s coating expertise for DCBs. The Ranger DCB is based on BSC’s well 
characterized Sterling PTA balloon catheters. These catheters are coated with the paclitaxel 
(active ingredient) drug that is formulated with the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_322602] (ATBC) to 
effectively deliver paclitaxel to the vessel wall. Paclitaxel has been widely used for both stent 
and DCB applications as a safe and effective drug to inhibit neointimal proliferation and thereby 
[CONTACT_322629] r estenosis.  
In some countries, t he Ranger Paclitaxel -Coated PTA balloon catheter is  CE Marked and  
indicated for Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) in the peripheral vasculature, including iliac and infrainguinal arteries.

 The justification of the leveraged data regulatory strategy for Ranger DCB ’s current  indicated 
use is based on the following:  
 The safety and performance of PTA balloon catheters in the revascularization of peripheral 
artery disease have been demonstrated with over 20 years of clini cal experience with these 
devices.  
 The safety and performance of the predicate device: Sterling PTA balloon catheter in  the 
treatment of the peripheral vasculature is established via the extensive market experience 
with these devices. Field experience with  the catheters demonstrates a favorable and 
reliable safety profile.  
 The Ranger experience since CE -mark certification in July, 2014, demonstrates a favorable 
and reliable safety profile.  
 The usefulness of paclitaxel in the treatment of peripheral arterial  disease has been 
clinically established. Review of the literature demonstrates that paclitaxel is safe in 
peripheral applications and effective when delivered from a stent or a DCB platform. Both paclitaxel -coated drug -eluting stents
[ADDRESS_398355] -in-man clinical feasibility trial with the Ranger  DCB completed the enrollment of 105 
subjects from centers located in [LOCATION_013], Austria, and [LOCATION_009] in October 2015.  The trial design was a prospective, randomized;  multicenter  controlled (2:1 Ranger DCB vs uncoated balloon) 
clinical trial of the Ran ger™ Paclitaxel -Coated PTA Balloon Catheter in comparison to uncoated 
PTA balloons in femoropopliteal lesions.  The objective  of the trial was to prove the superior 
performance of the Ranger DCB for angioplasty in femoropopliteal artery lesions when compar ed to non- coated balloons at six months post -procedure when comparing Late Lumen 
Loss (LLL). The primary endpoint was  in-segment late lumen loss of the treated segment, as 
observed by [CONTACT_322630] -procedure. Subject elig ibility 
criteria included clinically significant symptomatic limb ischemia defined as Rutherford classification  2, 3, or 4, and de novo, non- stented and non- atherectomy treated  or restenotic 
lesions (≥ 70% stenosis) located in the native superficial femoral  artery or proximal popliteal 
artery with a total lesion length ≥ 20 mm and ≤ 150 mm. The trial’s Clinical Study Report (CSR) 
with results will be provided with the investigational device exemption  submission.

5.1. Ranger ™ Paclitaxe l Coated PTA Balloon Catheter  
The Ranger Paclitaxel -Coated PTA balloon catheter (Figure 1) is an Over -the-Wire (OTW) 
Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheter with a semi -compliant balloon 
coated with a formulation of paclitaxel (drug) and  ATBC (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]).  
The Ranger catheter is designed to inhibit restenosis by [CONTACT_322631] .

 The Ranger DCB catheter has a coaxial shaft design. The outer lumen is used for inflation of the 
balloon, and the wire lumen permits the use of guide wires 0.014 in (0.36 mm) or 0.018 in (0.46 mm) to facilitate advancement of the catheter. The balloon is designed to provide an inflatable segment of known diameter and length at recommended pressures. The Ranger DCB  catheter  
includes a tape red tip to facilitate advancement of the catheter to and through the stenosis. 
The Ranger DCB  catheter has two radiopaque marker bands (one proximal and one distal) 
which, in conjunction with fluoroscopy, aid in the placement of the balloon. The working lengths of the Ranger  DCB  catheters are [ADDRESS_398356] the drug coating prior to sheath insertion and minimize the potential handing of the coated balloon by [CONTACT_73693].  A n image of

 5.1.1. Drug Component s Description  
The balloon coating  consists of paclitaxel  (PTx) and the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC) . 
PTx is a widely utilized  drug in both stent and drug -coated balloon applications for reducing the 
rate of neointimal proliferation and thereby [CONTACT_322633].  The drug to excipi[INVESTIGATOR_322603] 80:20 PTx/ATBC .  The resulting drug dose density (total weight of drug per 
unit of balloon surface area) on the coated balloon is 2 µ g/mm2. 
Paclitaxel (PTx) is the active pharmaceutical ingredient on the Ranger  DCB . Paclitaxel is a wh ite 
powder, isolated from a spectrum of TAXUS species and hybrids. It is a terpenoid with a 
characteristic taxane skeleton of 20 carbon atoms, a molecular weight of 853.91 g/mol, and a 
molecular formula of C 47H51NO 14 as shown in Figure 5 -2 below . It is highly lipophilic and 
insoluble in water, but is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl sulfoxide.

 8. Trial Design  
The RANGER II SFA clinical trial is a global, prospective, multicenter, single -blind, superiority, 
3:1 (R anger  DCB vs. Standard PTA) co ntrolled randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the 
safety and effectiveness of the Ranger  DCB in subjects with claudication and/or rest pain and 
with a positive diagnostic finding of de novo, non -stented  and non- atherectomy -treated or 
restenotic lesio n(s) in the SFA and/or PPA.  
8.1. Pharmacokinetic Subs tudy 
Concurrently, a human pharmacokinetics (PK) investigation (substudy) of this trial is also 
planned in the U.S . This substudy is a prospective, multicenter, non- randomized substudy arm 
(Ranger  DCB), conducted at multiple pre -specified investigational sites . This substudy is  
designed to evaluate the level s of paclitaxel in the systemic circulation of subjects at multiple 
time points after treatment with the R anger  DCB.  
Although an investigative center can participate in both the RCT and PK trial arms, a subject can either be enrolled in the RCT study arm or the PK sub- study, but not both.”  
8.2. Required Medication Therapy  
There is risk of acute, sub -acute, or late thrombosis, vascular complications, a nd/or bleeding 
events. It is strongly advised that the treatin g physician follow the Inter -Society Consensus 
(TASC II) Guidelines recommendations (or other applicable country guidelines) for antiplatelet therapy pre – and post –procedure to reduce the risk  of thrombosis.  Anti -platelet therapy is 
recommended throughout the length of the trial participation. Investigators must prescribe concomitant anti -coagulant and anti -platelet medications consistent with current local clinical 
practice.  
Antiplatelet medication and peripheral artery disease (PAD) medication usage will be collected 
and reported for compliance throughout the trial.  
Minimum protocol requirements:  
 Anti-coagulation therapy administered prior to and during the procedure should be 
consistent with current clinical practi ce
33. 
 A minimum of 30 days of dual antiplatelet therapy for non- stented subjects and a minimum 
of 3 months (90 days) dual antiplatelet therapy for stented subjects  post index procedure .  
Minimum recommendation:  
 Antiplatelet monotherapy is recommended for administration throughout the 5 year follow -
up (trial completion).  
 
All enrolled subjects (RCT: Ranger DCB, Standard PTA and PK sub- study) should follow  the 
above -mentioned antiplatelet requirements .

Coumadin or other similar anti -coagulant due to known comorbidities and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant could put  the subject at an 
unreasonable risk of bleeding.  
A subject is also exempt from the above -mentioned antiplatelet requirements if the randomized 
angioplasty treatment is unsuccessful.  
8.3. Scale and Duration  
The RANGER II SFA trial plans to enroll up to [ADDRESS_398364] 376 of the subjects will be 
enrolled into the randomized arm of the trial to yield:  
 282 subjects to receive treatment with the Ranger  DCB; investigational test device and  
 [ADDRESS_398365] PTA; control device  
From 12 to 20 subjects w ill receive treatment with the Ranger  DCB for the non- randomized PK 
substudy.  Approximately 25% of those enrolled into the PK substudy will have long lesions (≥100 mm) treated with the Ranger  DCB.   
Up to 80 study centers worldwide may enroll subjects  into the RANGER II SFA pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. 
Countries that may participate include centers located in Australia, Canada, European Union, Japan, New Zealand and the [LOCATION_002].  
Approximately 10 study centers may enroll subjects into  the PK subs tudy.  
All subje cts will be screened according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects 
meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_398366] PTA , respectively.  
For subjects undergoing successful balloon deployment , clinical follow up assessments are 
required at the following time points:  pre -discharge, Day 7, [ADDRESS_398367] index procedure. Office or clinic visits are 
required for testing during each protocol required follow -up visit, with the exception of the 48 
and 60 month visits.  These two visits can be conducted in the office/clinic or by [CONTACT_322637].  
Subjects for whom  the deployment of the randomly assigned balloon is unsuccessful ( the test 
device Ranger DCB or control device Standard PTA ) will be included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) 
population and followed for MAEs through 1 month.  
In addition, for those enrolled into the PK substudy, PK sampling from venous blood are 
required at the following time points:  pre -Ranger  DCB deployment, [ADDRESS_398368] patient is enrolled.  
Approximately f ifty percent (50%) of the subjects enrolled will come from the [LOCATION_002]. 
The trial will be considered complete (with regard to the primary endpoint) after all enrolled subjects have completed the [ADDRESS_398369] 12 month follow -up visit window is closed.

 The trial will be considered complete (with r egard to all follow -up) after all enrolled  subjects 
have completed the 60 month (5 year) follow -up assessment , were discontinued prior to the 60 
month (5 year) follow -up visit, have died, or the last 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit window is 
closed.  
It is estimated that it will take approx imately [ADDRESS_398370] and PK substudy designs , respectively.

If after consenting, meeting inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, conf irmed 
angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral and/or proximal popliteal artery and 
successful protocol -defined pre -dilatation, subjects are randomized 3:1 to either a Ranger  DCB

Investigator and st aff performing the procedure will not be blinded to the assigned treatment arm 
or resulting treatment.  
Study center personnel will be trained not to disclose the treatment assignment to the subject in order to minimize the potential unblinding of the subj ects.

 8.6. Target Lesions  
The RANGER  II SFA trial is designed to treat lesions located in  the superficial femoral and /or 
proximal popliteal arteries  (SFA/PPA) . These arteries are located in the lower extremities above 
the knee. The arteries , with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of  ≥ 4 mm and ≤ 8 mm by [CONTACT_306060]  (use of a radiopaque ruler is recommended) , must show angiographic evidence of a 
single de novo, non -stented  and non- atherectomy -treated or restenotic lesion (or tandem lesions 
or a combination lesion as defined below) that is:  
 ≥ 70% - 99% stenotic  with total lesion length up to180 mm  by [CONTACT_13729] . Use of a 
radiopaque ruler is recommended. 
 Occluded  with total lesion length ≤ 100 mm by [CONTACT_13729] . Use of a radiopaque ruler 
is recommended.  
 If lesion is restenotic, most recent PTA treatment must be >  3 months   prior to  enrollment  
Combination lesions (a non- occlusive lesion that includes a totally occluded segment along its 
length) are eligible provided that the total combined lesion length is ≤180 mm .  
Tandem (or “adjacent”) lesions may be enrolled providing they meet all of the following criteria:  
 Separated by a gap of ≤ 30 mm (3 cm)  
 Total c ombined lesion length meets requirements ( Angiographic inclusion criteria (7) 
including 30 mm gap); and 
 Able t o be treated as a single lesion  
The Ranger DCB  must be overlapped to cover targeted lesion(s) as specified in the inclusion 
criteria.  
Provisional stenting of the target lesion with bare -metal stents can be completed in cases where 
adequate results could not be obtained after using post -dilatation balloons; such as in the case of 
remaining residual stenosis[≥ 50%] or major [≥ Grade D] flow -limiting d issection after post -
dilatation.  
8.7. Non-target Lesions  
Multiple interventions  using the same access site may occur at the time of the index procedure.  
Using the same access site, iliac l esion(s) in the contralateral and ipsilateral limb may be treated 
during  the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially (non -drug coated) available device occurs prior to 
randomization of the target SFA/PPA lesion(s);  
 Treatment of the lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae 
(success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_142184])  
If the above criteria are not met, the subject may n ot be randomized into the trial but may be 
rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.

 8.8. Justification for the Trial Desi gn 
The RANGER II SFA trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Ranger  DCB balloon 
for the treatment of atherosclerotic lesion(s) in native SFA and/or PPA vessels compared with 
Standard PTA balloons. Standard PTA balloons have been utilized to treat atherosclerotic lesions in these arteries for more than [ADDRESS_398378] PTA balloons.  Further, the two DCBs, approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] (US) have patency rates that differ 
significantly.  This significant patency variance makes it extraordinarily difficult to ascertain  
which of the two approved US DCBs to compare with the Ranger  DCB.  Therefore a randomized 
controlled trial was required by [CONTACT_3133].

10. Subject Accountabili ty 
10.1. Point of Enrollment  
Once the subject has signed the IRB/IEC/REB -approved trial informed consent (ICF), and has 
met all clinical inclusion  and no clinical exclusion criteria, the subject will be considered eligible 
to be enrolled in the trial. If the subject does  not meet inclusion criteria during the angiographic 
eligibility assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and s hould not be 
enrolled/randomized or receive an investigational device, nor should the subject be followed post-procedure per protocol.

Testing (including CBC, platelets, ABI, and Rutherford Classification) completed as a part  of the 
subject’s standard of care, within 30 days of the index procedure and that m eets the study 
(inclusion/exclusion) criteria, are not required to be repeated after consenting is complete.  
 
10.2. Withdrawal  
All subjects enrolled in the clinical trial (including those withdrawn from the clinical trial or lost 
to follow -up) shall be accounted for and documented. 
While trial withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may choose to withdraw from the trial at any time, with or without reason and without prejudice to furt her treatment. Withdrawn subjects will 
not undergo any additional trial follow -up, nor will they be replaced (the justified sample size 
considers an estimated allowance for attrition). The reason for withdrawal will be recorded (if given) in all cases of w ithdrawal. The Investigator may discontinue a subject from participation 
in the trial if the Investigator feels that the subject can no longer fully comply with the requirements of the trial or if any of the trial procedures are deemed potentially harmful to the subject. Data that have already been collected on withdrawn subjects will be retained and used for analysis but no new data will be collected after withdrawal.  
10.3. Enrollment Controls  
The RANGER II SFA trial will develop a formal Enrollment Communication Plan.  The plan 
will outline the specific activities and responsibilities of BSC employees and representatives, the  
nature and timing of communications to Investigators during the enrollment period and as enrollment draws to a close.  
The objective of the  plan is to minimize the risk of enrollment beyond the protocol -specified 
overall enrollment cap, including regional and site -specific caps.

local clinical practice.  
Antiplatelet medication and peripheral artery disease (PAD) medication usage will be collected 
and reported for compliance throughout the trial.  
Anti-coagulation therapy administered prior to and during the procedure should be consistent 
with current clinical practice.  
Note : A subject is exempt from the above -mentioned antiplatelet requirement if he/she requires 
Coumadin or other similar anti -coagulant due to known comorbidities and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the combination of antiplatelet and an ticoagulant could put the subject at an 
unreasonable risk of bleeding.  
11.7. Index Procedure  
Investigators will manage the cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities for all patients 
according to standard s of care.  Investigators should ensure close monitoring of the amount of 
contrast for su bjects with elevated serum creatinine levels and consider preventive measures 
(medication and hydration) to reduce the risk of contrast -induced nephropathy (CIN).  
The start of the index procedure is defined as the time the guide (catheter or sheath) is inserted.  
11.7.1. Treatment of Non -target Lesions  
Multiple interventions may occur  using the same access site at the time of the index procedure.  
Using the same access site iliac l esion(s) in the contralateral and ipsilateral limb may be treated 
during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially (non -drug coated) available device occurs prior to 
randomization of the target SFA/PPA lesion(s);  
 Treatment of the lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae 
(success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_142184])  
If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be randomized into the trial but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
11.7.2. Angiographic Imaging of Target Lesion(s)  
Diagnostic angiography of the lower extremities must be performed using standar d techniques to 
confirm angiographic eligibility of the target lesion. Visual angiographic assessment  may be 
used to determine if criteria are met.  
Refer to the BIDMC Angiographic Core Lab Protocol for Angiographic Film Acquisition.  This 
manual is located in the RANGER II SFA manual of operations  and has detailed trial 
requirements . 
A few key steps  are b elow:

  Obtain both pre -procedure (2 views) and post -procedure (2 views) utilizing the standard 
DICOM 3.  The first frame of the series should be unmasked.  
 A ruler or radiopaque marking tape with centimeter markings should be used as the 
calibration source t o determine the image calibration.  The core lab will need to observe  the 
ruler for analysis.  
 Perform run -off vessel images demonstrating patenc y to the foot . This imaging  should be 
taken once at the beginning (pre -procedural views), and once at the end of the procedure, 
after all target lesions have been treated (post -procedural views) . 
 For the most accurate analysis of lesions, it is necessary to have matching projection angles 
in the pre -procedural and post -intervention angiographic projections. 
Angiographic images must be sent to the BIDMC Angiographic Core Laboratory for evaluation.  
If the core lab is unable to analyze the angiogram, then site reported assessment is us ed. 
11.7.3. Enrollment  
Prior to enrollment, a subject must meet all of the clinical and angiographic inclusion criteria and none of the clinical and angiographic exclusion criteria.  
If the subject is found to meet the eligibility criteria during the angiographic p hase of the 
procedure, the subject will be considered eligible to be enrolled. After the Investigator successfully crosses the target lesion with the guidewire and successfully pre- dilates the target 
lesion , a randomization custom function within the Rave EDC database will be used to assign 
randomized subjects to the Ranger DCB ( test) or Standard PTA ( control treatment group) . The 
Ranger DCB balloons are provided by [CONTACT_1034].  Standard PTA balloons are commercially available balloons that the investigative sites utilize from their inventory.  Subjects are considered enrolled when the R anger  DCB or Standard PTA is introduced into the subject’s

If the balloon angioplasty attempt  with the assigned treatment device (the test device R anger  
DCB or control device Standard PTA) is not successful, follow -up through the 1 month visit only 
will occur  as part of the ITT population.  Data for assessment of MAE will be collected for these 
subjects.  No other testing or follow up is required. 
11.7.4. Treatment of Ta rget Lesion(s) 
The Directions For Use (DFU) for the Ranger  DCB  is located  in the Manual of Operations. Prior 
to use of the device, the treating physician must carefully read and be familiar with the entire 
DFU. The R anger DFU must be followed for deploying  the investigational DCB .  
Procedural information must be reported (specific data fields are noted in the electronic database). Refer to the DFU for detailed instructions about delivery system preparation and 
placement of the R anger  DCB .

 dilatation o ccurs when the selected balloon opens vessel entry at nominal pressure without major 
(≥ Grade D)  flow -limiting  dissection  or need for intervention (i.e. stenting) . 
Note: If major dissection occurs at this step, subject should not be enrolled into the trial.   
No follow up is required.  
Record the following information on pre -dilatat ion balloon(s) used:  
 Maximum balloon diameter (mm) inflated  
 Maximum pressure (atmospheres) inflated  
 Maximum length of time (seconds) inflated  
The recommended Ranger DCB inflation time is three (3) minutes to ensure apposition to the 
arterial wall and to reduce the chance of vessel recoil. P ost-dilatation may be performed at the 
discretion of the Investigator.   
Record the following information on post -dilatat ion balloon(s) , if utiliz ed: 
 Maximum balloon diameter (mm) inflated  
 Maximum pressure (atmospheres) inflated  
 Maximum length of time (seconds) inflated  
Peri-procedure  dissections should be treated conservatively, with low pressure prolonged balloon 
inflation, or with provisional ste nting of the target lesion with bare -metal stents . Bare metal 
stents  can be utilized in cases where adequate results could not be obtained after using post -
dilatation balloons; such as in the case of remaining residual stenosis  [≥ 50%] or major [≥ Grade 
D] flow -limiting dissection after post- dilatation.  
Haziness, lucency, or filling defects within or adjacent to the ballooned area , and angiographic 
complications such as distal thromboemboli or no reflow, should also be treated per standard 
practice. All ang iographic complications that occur should be documented by [CONTACT_322638].  
For subjects randomized to the Standard PTA  (non -scoring) , treatment with commercially 
available Standard PTA ( control) balloons should be completed according to each individual  
device label ling. 
11.7.5. Post-procedure Angiogram  
Perform  the post -procedure angiography according to BIDMC Angiographic Core Laboratory 
protocol . The final angiogram must be performed and recorded, including distal run -off to the 
foot. Angiographic images must be sent to the angiographic core laboratory for evaluation. 
11.8. End of the Index Procedure  
The end of the index procedure is defined as the time the guide (catheter or sheath) is removed 
(post fina l angiography). The introducer(s) sheaths should be removed as per standard local 
practice. The following procedures must be completed:

Assessment of Whole Blood Paclitaxel Levels  
The PK profile of the Ranger  DCB  will be analyzed for subjects enrolled in the PK substudy. 
Nine  (9) venous blood samples will be drawn according to the schedule shown in Table 11- 2. 
Treatment of the SFA/PPA with a drug coated or uncoated balloon is most often performed as an out-patient procedure and sampling time points greater than [ADDRESS_398392] subjects to return to the research site for blood draws.  
To encourage all enrolled PK subjects to comply with the PK sampling schedule after release 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility , the research team will allow the subject to choose to return for either  
the [ADDRESS_398393] to be provided to cover lodging or tra vel expenses incurred by [CONTACT_71659] a 
result of participation in the PK substudy in accordance with pertinent country laws and 
regulations and per the trial site’s regulations.  
All samples must be forwarded to the PK core laboratory for analysis of whole blood paclitaxel 
levels . 
Instructions for blood sample collection, storage, and shipment are provided in the PK core laboratory Instruction Manual. This manual is located in the Manual of Operations.

Bioanalytical Method  
The blood samples collected from patients at the specified time points will be analyzed for levels 
of paclitaxel using HPLC/GC with UV/Fluorescence/MS/MS detection by [CONTACT_322639].  
Pharmacokinetics Parameters  
Values for the following paclitaxel PK parameters will be calculated by a standard non-compartment analysis for subjects in the PK substudy.  
 Maximum observed blood concentration (C
max) 
 First time of occurrence of C max (tmax) will be the actual observed values  
 Terminal phase rate constant (λz) will be estimated from log- linear regression analysis of 
the terminal phase of the blood concentration- time profile  
 Associated apparent terminal phase half -life (t ½) will be calculated as t ½ = ln(2/λz)  
 Area under the blood concentration versus time curve from time zero to 1 hour  (AUC 0-1), 
time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24), time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration 
(AUC 0-t) and extrapolated to infinite time (AUC 0-∞) will be calculated by a combination of 
linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods  
 Percentage of AUC 0-∞ obtained by [CONTACT_5259] (%AUC ex) will be calculated as [(AUC 0 ∞ 
– AUC 0-t)/AUC 0-∞] × 100 
 Total blood clearance (CL)  
For AUC calculation, the linear method will be employed for all incremental trapezoids arising from increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal method will be used for those arising from decreasing concentrations.  
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample size, 95% confidence interval) will be used to summarize these parameters for subjects in the PK substudy . No formal statistical testing 
will be done for these parameters.

 11.10. Follow -up Visits   
RANGER II SFA trial is a single blind trial. Subjects will be blinded to treatment assigned and 
treatment received. All subjects (excluding subjects in the PK substudy) mu st remain blinded 
until completion of all 12 month follow -up visits (primary endpoint).  
It is important that trial site personnel review the trial requirements with the subject to maximize compliance with the follow -up schedule and required medication reg imen. It is also important 
that trial site personnel instruct subjects to return for follow -up assessments according to the trial 
event schedule in Table 11- 1. Trial  staff should establish a date for the follow -up visit with the 
subject and if possible, schedule the visit prior to  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
All randomized and enrolled subjects who receive a test or control balloon, R anger  DCB or 
Standard PTA, will continue to be evaluated at [ADDRESS_398394] PTA into the body but 
deployment was unsuccessful, will be considered enrolled under Intent to Treat population and will be followed for safety through the 1 -month follow -up visit only. Data for assessment of 
MAE will be collected for these subjects; other testing  is not required.  
For each follow -up visit , the results of the subjects’ clinical status and functional testing 
(Rutherford Classification  and ABI) should be completed prior to initiating the DUS imaging, if 
required.  Subjects requiring reintervention should be treated according to the Investigator’s discretion and standard of care. These subjects should receive an approved, commercially available treatment (if appropriate) and must not receive an investigational device for 
retreatment.  
Note : Follow -up angiograms  and ultrasounds will not be required for any subject who under goes 
by[CONTACT_322640] a documented occlud ed lesion  during the 60 month 
follow -up timeframe .

11.10.3. Duplex Ultrasound Assessment of Target Lesion(s)  
DUS are utilized to assess the primary effectiveness endpoint of the RANGER II SFA trial.  The 
primary effectiveness endpoint assesses the primary lesion patency within [ADDRESS_398395] -index 
procedure.   
Primary effectiveness is defined as a binary endpoint determined by (DUS) peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≤ 2.4 in the absence of clinically -driven TLR.  
Clinically -driven TLR is defined as any re -intervention at the target lesion due to recurrent  
symp toms ( ≥ [ADDRESS_398396] Classification or associated with decreased  ABI/TBI of ≥ 
20% or > 0.[ADDRESS_398397] -procedure baseline ABI/TBI in the treated segment . TBI 
allowed in c ases of incompressible vessels ). 
This effectiveness endpoint is designed to demonstrate that the 12- month primary patency for the 
Ranger DCB  treated test group is superior to the control group.  
Lesion patency is defined as freedom from more than 50% stenosis based on DUS PSVR comparing data within the treated segment to the proximal normal arterial segment. PSVR >2.4 suggests >50% stenosis.  
It is imperative that the DUS examinations be completed according to the VASCORE  Vascular 
Core Lab protocol. The DUS protocol  will be located in the Manual of Operations.

will be recorded as Protocol Deviations. For subjects who miss their 12 Month follow -up visit 
(primary endpoint), BSC may provide sites access to a patient locator service (if allowed by [CONTACT_39722]’s IRB/IEC/REB).  A subject will be considered lost to follow -up after the subject misses [ADDRESS_398401] evaluable 
data for the primary endpoint. 
11.13. Source Documents  
It is preferable that original source documents (see Section 27.2 for definition) are maintained, 
when available. Where copi[INVESTIGATOR_322610], it is required that the copi[INVESTIGATOR_142156] a member of the investigation center team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document.  
12. Statistical Considerations  
The sample size justification and the power analyses for the primary endpoints described in this section are mainly for the RCT. For the PK substudy, the sample size determination is arbitrary and the analysis is based on observation. The det ails of all statistical analyses will be described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
12.1. Primary Endpoint s 
The overall sample size in the RCT is justified by [CONTACT_322642] 12- month endpoint to preserve adequate statistical testing power for both 
primary effectiveness and safety endpoints.  
The prima ry effectiveness and safety hypotheses are planned for being tested simultaneously in 
an adaptive group sequential manner at the overall significance level of one -sided 2.5%. The 
Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with Power Family  Method will be used to determine the 
interim and the final type I error adjustment. 
For the PK sub- study, the sample size determination is arbitrary and the analysis is based on 
observation. There is no primary endpoint for the PK substudy.  
12.1.1. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The 12- month primary patency is chosen to be assessed for the primary effectiveness endpoint in 
the RCT. The goal is set to demonstrate that the primary patency for the Ranger  DCB treatment 
group (i.e. Test) is superior to the Standard PTA treatment group (i.e. Control) through [ADDRESS_398402] -procedure. For the definition of primary patency, refer to the section 7.1 Primary 
Endpoints.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Hypotheses  
The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be tested is that 12- month primary patency in subjects 
treated with Ranger  DCB is superior  to subjects treated with  Standard PTA  at an overall  one-
sided significance level of 2.5%.  
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no pre -specified treatment effect of Ranger  DCB  vs. 
Standard PTA  as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) which states that there  is a pre-
specified treatment effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt -  Pc  ≤  0 
H1: Pt -  Pc  > 0 (superior)  
where Pt and Pc are the [ADDRESS_398403] PTA, 
respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Sample Size 
The overall sample size is driven by [CONTACT_322643].  Approximately [ADDRESS_398404] is 
based on the following assumptions.  
 Power ≥ 85%  
 One-sided overall significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
 Lan-DeMets  alpha spending function with Power Family  Method:  
– One assessment for a minimum of 75% subjects to be assessed  subjects to be assessed  
– The final assessment  for the overall subjects  
 Expected Standard PTA  12-month primary patency = 52.5%  
 Ranger  DCB to demonstrate 20% treatment effect  
 Allocation ( Ranger  DCB vs.  Standard PTA ) = 3:1  
 Attrition rate in 12 months = 15%  
 N = 320 (total) evaluable subjects are required at 12 months ([ADDRESS_398405] PTA)  
 N = 376 (total) subjects to be randomized prior to the procedure ([ADDRESS_398406] PTA ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Statistical Methods  
A Chi -Square T est for the difference in 12 -month primary patency will be used to assess the 
effectiveness hypotheses.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Hypotheses  
The primary safety hypothesis to be tested is that 12- month MAE -free rate in subjects treated 
with Ranger  DCB is as safe as the subjects treated with  Standard PTA at an overall one- sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no mar ginal treatment effect of RANGER DCB vs. 
Standard PTA as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) states that there is a marginal 
treatment effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt -  Pc  ≤  ∆  
H1: Pt -  Pc  > ∆ (non- inferior)  
where Pt an d Pc are the [ADDRESS_398408] PTA, 
respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non- inferiority margin of - 10%.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Sample Siz e/Power Analysis  
The power analysis for the primary safety endpoint is based on the following assumptions.  
 One-sided overall significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
 The primary safety endpoint will be tested simultaneously with the primary effectiveness 
endpoint at the same significance level for the interim analysis and/or for the final analysis as need ed 
 Expected Standard PTA 12- month MAE -free = 75%  
 Expected R anger  DCB 12 -month MAE -free rate = 90%  
 Non-inferiority margin (∆) = - 10%*  
The sample size is driven by [CONTACT_322628] 94% power to assess the primary safety endpoint. 
* The margin of -10% is clinically meaningful for the safety endpoint per physicians’ consensus. Due to the interim alpha 
adjustment, the observed Ranger  DCB will require to outperform the Standard PTA  such that the lower confidence bound of 
the observed difference within the margin  to claim a success. For an example of 75% subjects to be assessed for the interim 
analysis, the margin of -10% will require the observed MAE -free rate of 7 9.4% in Ranger  DCB when the Standard PTA is 
observed as 75% to demonstrate non -inferiority at interim alpha level of one -sided 1.41%. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Statistical Methods  
A Chi-Square Test will be used to assess the hypothesis of for the difference in 12- month MAE -
free rate will be used to assess the safety hypotheses .

minimum of 75% evaluable subjects are required for the interim analysis. Since the Lan -DeMets  
alpha spending function is continuous , the confidence levels a nd adjusted alpha levels will 
depend on the actual observed proportion of subjects ( e.g. >75%). Without loss of generality, an 
example of 75% subjects is described below.  
12.2.1. Success Crit eria for the Interim Analysis  
For example, exact 75 % subjects are to be a ssessed at the interim analysis . 
Ranger DCB will be concluded to be superior to Standard PTA for device effectiveness in the 
interim analysis if the one -sided lower 98.59% confidence bound on the difference between 
treatment groups ( Ranger DCB – Standard P TA) in 12- month primary patency is greater than 
zero.  
Ranger DCB will be concluded to be as safe as Standard PTA if the one -sided lower 98.59% 
confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups ( Ranger DCB – Standard PTA) in 
12-month MAE -free is g reater than - 0.1. 
The study success will be concluded as both primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints being achieved in the interim analysis.  
12.2.2. Success Criteria for the Final Analysis  
All subjects are to be assessed at the final analysis  when the interim analysis is not able to be 
concluded.  
If for any reason, the final analysis is required to prove superiority, Ranger DCB will be 
concluded to be superior to Standard PTA for device effectiveness in the final analysis if the one -
sided lower 98.08% c onfidence bound on the difference between treatment groups ( Ranger DCB 
– Standard PTA) in 12- month primary patency is greater than zero.  
Ranger DCB will be concluded to be as safe as Standard PTA if the one -sided lower 98.08% 
confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups ( Ranger DCB – Standard PTA) in 
12-month MAE -free is greater than - 0.1. 
As required, the study success will be concluded as both primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints being achieved in the final analysis. 
12.3. General Statistical Methods  
12.3.1. Analysis Sets  
The intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis set will be the primary analys is set for assessing superiority 
of Ranger DCB  to the  Standard PTA  in the RCT . The per -protocol and/or the as -treated analysis 
sets will be assess ed in RCT  for reference.  However per -protocol analysis will be performed 
only when the ITT and the per -protocol analysis set s are not identical. As -treated analysis will be 
performed as deemed necessary.

                                                                                                                       Page 59  of 110  
  
  
 All subjects who sign the informed consent form  (ICF) and are randomized in the RCT  will be 
included in the ITT analysis set , regardless of whether the subjects receive the assigned 
treatment.  
For per -protocol analysis, only randomized subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and receive 
the assigned treatment will be included in the per -protocol analysis set . For subjects who do not 
receive randomized devices will be excluded from the per -protocol analysis set. 
For as -treated analysis, all subjects who actual ly receive either  Ranger DCB or Standard PTA  at 
procedure will be included in the as -treated analysis set. For subjects who do not receive Ranger 
DCB or PTA will be excluded from the as -treated analysis set . 
12.3.2. Randomization Scheme  
Randomization to treatment s will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885]. A compute r generated random 
treatment allocations (i.e., a randomization schedule) will be used to assign subjects to treatments 
in a 3:[ADDRESS_398410]’s site. 
Random permuted blocks of varying sizes will be employed to ensure approximate balance of treatment allocation within each site.  
12.3.3. Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of subjects will be made from the Investigators’ general or professional referral population. All subjects meeting the inclu sion/exclusion criteria and have signed the protocol -
specific ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the trial. Consecutively eligible subjects should be enrolled into the trial to minimize selection bias. Trial subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group within the investigational site. In determining subject eligibility for the trail, the investigator’s assessment of imaging will be used. However, BIDMC Angiographic Core Laboratory will independently analyze the angiograms and the data obtaine d from the core 
laboratory will be utilized for analyses.  
An independent CEC composed of medical experts will adjudicate safety assessments, as defined in the CEC Charter.  In addition, an i ndependent data reviewer (IDR) is responsible for the 
oversight re view of the aggregate safety data, as defined in the IDR charter. The IDR will not 
participate in the trial and who have no affiliation with BSC.  
12.3.4. Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  
Study sites will not be allowed to randomize more than 10% (N= 37) of the total number of 
randomized subjects without prior approval from the sponsor. No study center will be allowed to 
enroll more than 20% (N= 76) of the total number of randomized subjects.  
12.4. Baseline Data Analyses  
Baseline covariates will be summarized for R CT and PK sub- study. Subject baseline 
demographics and clinical characteristics, site -reported and core lab reported lesion 
characteristics, procedure assessment, device information, and medication compliance will be summarized using descriptive statistics . The analysis unit may be (but will not be limited to) by 
[CONTACT_1130], lesion, procedure, or device.

 For continuous and/or ordinal variables, the descriptive statistics will include mean, standard 
deviation, number evaluated, minimum and maximum. Some specific variables may also include additional statistics such as median and confidence intervals. For binary or categorical variables, the descriptive statistics will include percentage, numerator, denominator, and number evaluated. Some variables may inc lude confidence intervals as needed .   
12.4.1. Secondary Endpoint Assessments  
Secondary  assessments may refer to (but not limited  to) technical/procedural success, 
safety/effectiveness endpoints, any type of AE rates, distribution of Rutherford classification, hemodynamic improvement, walking improvement at time points that data is collected  (refer to 
Section 7.2) . All additional assessments are observationa l. 
12.4.2. Interim Analyses  
One interim analysis is planned for the purpose of early declaring device effectiveness and safety. The interim analysis data will be used as submission for approval.  The RCT will proceed 
to the study end for all planned number of subj ects regardless of the interim result. The Lan-
DeMets alpha spending function with Power Family  Method is pre -specified for the type I error 
adjustment to determine the interim and the final significance levels  to retain the overall 
significance level under one -sided 2.5% . Both levels are adaptive based on accumulating study 
data in the interim. However a minimum of 75% of 12- month required subjects for the interim 
analysis is recommended.  
Without loss of generality, for 75% of subjects to be assessed in the interim analysis, the adjusted type I error will be distributed (i.e. spending) as 1.41% and 1.92% for the interim and the final analyses respectively.  Due to the nature of continuous function, the adjusted alphas  will be 
based on the observed interim proportion (e.g. >75%) .  
 
The primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoint s will be tested simu ltaneously at the same 
significance level for the interim analysis and/or for the final analysis as needed.  
12.4.3. Subgroup Analyses  
Primary endpoints and/or additional assessments will be summarized and treatment groups m ay 
be compared in each subgroup identified by [CONTACT_68180] (but not limit to):  
 Region  (e.g. by [INVESTIGATOR_28936]/OUS, by [CONTACT_1606], by [CONTACT_3725])  
 Race  
 Gender (male vs. female)  
 Age (≥  65 and <  65) 
 Diabetic status (medically -treated vs. non -diabetic)  
 Lesion characteristics (vessel diameter/lesion length)  
 Balloon matrix ( balloon diameter/length)  
 Adjunctive devices used (e.g. provisional stents)

  Other significant predictors identified by [CONTACT_142212] -adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will not be used. 
In addition, an interaction test for the primary efficacy assessment at two -sided significanc e level 
of 0.15 will be performed for the following subgroups:  
 Region (e.g. US/OUS)  
 Gender (male vs. female)  
12.4.4. Justification of Pooling  
The poolability analysis regarding the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoint across sites  
as well as between US and OUS  will be assessed  only when the success criteria are met, by [CONTACT_322644] a two -sided significance level of 0.15. If the p -value of an 
interaction test is greater than  or equal to 0.15, the non- significance suggests that the 
homogeneity  of treatment effect is shown and the primary endpoints data are poolable. However , 
when the p- value of an interaction test is smaller than 0.15, the significance suggests that the 
heterogeneity of treatment effect is detected and poolability analysis regarding prognostic factors 
and/or poolability adjusted for prognostic factors will be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Site Poolability  
 Due to the 3:1 randomization scheme using random permuted blocks (i.e. blocks of 4 and 8) employed within  each site, ideally there will be [ADDRESS_398411] 2 subjects in each treatment group, the pooling 
of this super -site should stop and the pooling of the next super -site should start.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. US vs. OUS Poolability  
The focus is mostly on the applicability of OUS data to the US population. If the treatment effect is significantly different between US and OUS, pos sible/plausible explanation is required and/or 
potential bias needs to be addressed.  
12.4.5. Missing Data, Drop -Outs, and Protocol Deviation Handling  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific will employ robust oversight in order to minimize the loss of subjects throughout any trial follow -up.  Additionally, we have created easy -to-follow case report forms 
that maximize the data collection required at each follow -up visit without placing undue burden 
on the subject. Strategies that are planned to be utilized in the RCT include:  
• Ensure  that site personnel are properly trained on the data that is required to be collected 
and the importance of planning for the follow -up visits.

 • Tools in the site’s Manual of Operations to assist with follow -up visit planning (e.g. 
follow -up wheels or simil ar tools).  
• The use of trial reports and newsletters to remind sites of upcoming visits and other 
project -related milestones to ensure data is being entered promptly and is complete.  
12.4.6. Sensitivity Analyses for Missing Outcome Data  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoints assessment will be 
conducted to assess the impact of missing data on the result’s robustness. In addition to the use 
of the worst -case analysis, the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_322611] s set to 
consider all combinations of present/absent for all subjects with missing primary outcome in 
Ranger DCB  and Standard PTA  groups . 
12.4.7. Multivariable Analyses  
Univari ate and multivariable analyses will be performed as post -hoc analysis after unblinding  to 
assess the effect of potential predictors for the primary outcomes  in a logistic regression model.  
Clinically  and/or statistically  meaningful baseline covariates will be selected in the regression 
model. No formal conclusion will be made by [CONTACT_322645] -hoc analysis.  
12.4.8. Analyses  Software  
All statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 
9.2 or later (Copyright © 2002- 2010 by [CONTACT_142214]., Cary, North Carolina [ZIP_CODE], [LOCATION_003]. 
All rights reserved).  
12.4.9. Chan ges to Planned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the interim and full 
primary analyses (i.e. unblinding) will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses. C hanges from the planned statistical methods after 
performing the analyses will be documented in the clinical trial report along with a reason for the deviation. 
13. Data Management  
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a  limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by [CONTACT_322646] . 
All changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by [CONTACT_322647]. The associated RAVE software and database have 
been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studi es pertaining to the 
use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.

 The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_262483] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature [CONTACT_5761] [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_5732]. 
Visual an d/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. 
Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will be issued to the site 
for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving a ll queries in the database.  
13.2. Data Retention  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee or Investigational site will maintain, at the 
investigative site, all essential trial documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the trial subjects in compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_398412] 2 years  (at least 3 years in Japan)  have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the c linical 
investigation of the product. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by [CONTACT_71643]. It is BSC’s responsibility to 
inform the Investigator when these documents no longer nee d to be maintained. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are required to inform [LOCATION_011] Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not 
readily available.  
In Japan, BSC must maintain necessary essential documents for 5 years from the date of the 
marketing application approval (or during the per iod of use -results evaluation, if applicable and 
if longer than 5 years) or until [ADDRESS_398413] been assigned for this trial:

adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741] (from either the trial  site or a non- trial institu tion, if applicable) must 
also be made available for submission to the BSC Safety  Group.  
The trial may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by [CONTACT_5742], as well as inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. It is important that the Investigator and relevant trial personnel are available during on -site monitoring visits or audits and that sufficient time is 
devoted to the process. 
19. Potential Risks and Benefits  
19.1. Anticipated Adverse E vents  and Risks Associated with Use of the Ranger  DCB  
The following anticipated adverse events (AE) have been identified for this trial.  These adverse events include but are not limited to, the following:  
 Allergic reaction (device, contrast medium, medications)  
 Arrhythmias  
 Arteriovenous fistula  
 Death  
 Hematoma  
 Hemodynamic instability  
 Hemorrhage  
 Pseudoaneurysm  
 Sepsis/infection  
 Thromboembolic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
 Vascular thrombosis  
 Vessel injury (e.g., dissection, perforation, rupture)  
 Vessel occlusion  
 Vessel spasm

 19.2. Risks Associated with the Trial Device(s) Unique to Paclitaxel 
Certain side effects and discomforts have been reported in subjects that have received paclitaxel 
in intravenous forms as part of chemotherapy treatment.  These subjects may have other comorbid conditions and/or have received concomitant medications that may also contribute to the reported side effects.  Under these circumstances the dose is delivered throughout the body by [CONTACT_322654]. Potential adverse events that may be unique to the paclitaxel 
drug coating  include but are not limited to the following:  
 Allergic/immunologic reactions to drug (paclitaxel or structurally -related compounds) or 
coating or its individual components  
 Alopecia  
 Anemia  
 Gastrointestinal symptoms  
 Hematologic dyscrasia (including leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia)  
 Hepatic enzyme changes  
 Histologic changes in the vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage or necrosis  
 Myalgia/arthralgia  
 Peripheral neuropathy  
It is unlikely with the total dosages and the way paclitaxel is coated onto the balloon and delivered in the vessel that the side effects associated with intravenous, high dose chemotherapy would occur. There may be other potential adverse events that are unforeseen at this time.  
19.3. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Trial  
There may be additional risks linked to the procedure, and follow -up testing which are 
unforeseen at this time. All testing planned for the first year of follow -up is standard of care in 
the [LOCATION_002]. Follow up assessments after the first year are included to monitor the long term effectiveness and safety profile of the SFA/PPA treatment.  These additional requirements should not create additional r isk to the subject. 
In addition, risks associated with venipuncture and the additional blood draws required in the PK substudy include, but are not limited to:  
 Ecchymosis  
 Hematoma  
 Infection/inflammation   
 Pain 
19.4. Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  
In addition to the aforementioned risks associated with the treatment of drug coated balloons  and 
the use of paclitaxel, the use of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after the index procedure may

                                                                                                                       Page 71  of 110  
  
  
 increase the risk of bleeding. Refer to the local package insert for further information on drug 
interactions and side effects associated with paclitaxel or antithrombotic/antiplatelet medications.  
19.5. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Do not utilize in pregnant or breastfeeding women, or in men intending to father children, as this product has not been tested in this population. Birth control/pregnancy prevention should be utilized for up to ninety (90) days after the index procedure.  
Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adherence to subject selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow -ups and by [CONTACT_322655].  
19.6. Anticipated Benefits  
Potential anticipated benefits include the effective treatment of atherosclerotic SFA/PPA lesions with improvement in the symptoms of disease. However, the Ranger  DCB  is an investigational 
device and these potential benefits may or may not actually be present.  
19.7. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The Ranger  DCB  is expected to be suitable for its intended purpose. There are no unacceptable 
residual risks/intolerable risks and all applicable risks have bee n addressed through the provision 
of appropriate Directions for Use (DFU). Evaluation of the risks and benefits that are expected to be associated with the use of the Ranger  DCB  demonstrate that when used under the conditions 
intended, the benefits associa ted with the use of the Ranger  DCB  should outweigh the risks. 
20. Safety Reporting

 If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be 
isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
Any AE event required by [CONTACT_760] , experienced by [CONTACT_322657] (as defined in trial subject classification section), whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity of frequency during the course of the investigation. For centers in Austria , cancer must always be reported as a 
Serious Adverse Event. Death should not be rec orded as an AE, but should only be reflected as 
an outcome of ONE (1) specific SAE (see Table 20 .2-1 for AE definitions). 
Refer to Section 1 9 for the known risks associated with the trial device(s).  
Device deficiencies and other device issues should not be  reported as AEs. Instead, they should 
be reported on the appropriate eCRF per the trial CRF Completion Guidelines. If an AE results 
from a device deficiency or other device issue, the AE should be reported on the appropriate eCRF.  
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322614] (≥ 24 hours), 
with the following exceptions.  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142167] -up per standard of care.  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142168]/planned (i.e., planned prior to enrollment) does not have to be reported as an SAE or AE.  
 If complications or AEs occur during an elective/planned (i.e., planned prior to enrollment) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142169], the complications and AEs must be reported as AEs or SAEs if they meet the protocol -specified definitions. However, the original 
elective/planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059](s) itself should not be reported as an SAE.

 Classification  Description  
Probably 
Related  The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
Causal Relationship  The event is associated with the device or with procedure beyond reasonable doubt when:  
 the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures;  
 the event has a temporal relationship with device use/application or procedure;  
 the event involves a body -site or organ that  
– the device or procedure are applied to;  
– the device or procedure have an effect on;  
 the event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known);  
 the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinicall y feasible); 
 other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition or/and 
an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
 harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
 the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_132621], when 
applicable;  
 In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
 
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the antiplatelet medication as related 
or unrelated.  Criteria are defined in Table 20- 3. 
Table 20- 3: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Antiplatelet Medication to AE  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of a device/drug 
and is not determined to be potentially related to the antiplatelet medication.  
Related  The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the antiplatelet medication, and 
an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to 
antiplatelet medication.

 20.5. [LOCATION_011] Scientific Device Deficiencies  
All device deficiencies ( including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, use errors , product 
nonconformities , and inadequacy in the information supplied by [CONTACT_3455] ) will be 
documented and reported to BSC. If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for 
analysis. Instructions for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not 
possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned 
and the final disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be 
documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Device deficiencies  (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product 
nonconformities ) are not  adverse events. However, an adverse event that results from a device 
failure or malfunction would be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate e CRF.  
Any Device Deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action had 
not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate is considered a reportable event.  
Device deficiencies may include, but are not limited to the following:  
 Packaging or labeling deficiency  
 Difficulty advancing or tracking device  
20.6. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities/IRBs/ECs/REB  Investigators  
BSC will notify all participating study centers if SAEs/SADEs occur which imply a possible increase in the anticipated risk of the procedure or use of the device or if the occurrence of certain SAEs/SADEs demands changes to the protocol or the conduct of the trial in order to further minimize the unanticipated risks.  
BSC is responsible for reporting AE and device deficiencies information to all participating 
investigators, IRBs/ IECs/REBs, and regulatory authorities as applicable according to local 
reporting requirements.  
BSC, Investigator, or Site must notify the IRB/IEC/REB of any UADEs, [LOCATION_003]DEs, SADEs, SAEs, device deficiencies, and other CEC events as applicable according to lo cal reporting 
requirements  (refer to section 22.3)  for information pertaining to the CEC and CEC Events). A 
copy of the Investigator’s reports and other relevant reports (if applicable) to the IRB/IEC/REB must be provided to BSC in accordance with local re quirements.  
Safety reporting on the control device, which is approved in all regions at the time of the trial initiation, will be handled separately according to local regulations.  
21. Informed Consent  
Subject participation in this clinical trial is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from  each 
subject or his/her legally authorized representative . The Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any investigational devices, study -required 
procedures and/or testing, or data collection. Testing (including CBC, platelets, ABI, and Rutherford Classification) completed as a part of the subject’s standard of care, within 30 days of

 the index procedure and that meet s the study (inclusion/exclusion) criteria, are not required to be 
repeated after consenting is complete.   
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO [ZIP_CODE], any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority body, as applicable. The ICF must be accepted  by [CONTACT_322658] (e.g. CRO), and approved by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB/EC /REB  or central IRB, if applicable.  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific will provide a trial- specific template of the ICF to investigators participating in 
this trial. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the investigative site’s IRB/EC /REB .  Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to use of the form.  The 
ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC /REB  
approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included in t he body of the form or as a 
separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall  at a minimum include the following steps, as 
well as any other steps required by [CONTACT_5751], rules, regulations and guidelines : 
 be conducted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_5704],  
 include a description of all aspects of the clinical trial  that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical trial, 
 avoid any coercion of or undue i nfluence of subjects to participate,  
 not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights, 
 use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her legal 
representative,  
 provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if necessary,  
 ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the 
clinical trial. 
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_322659] s ign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by [CONTACT_36284]/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent 
process.  If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide i nformed consent for 
continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_313763] a copy of the signed and dated document  and any other written 
information  must be given to the person signing the form. In Japan, Informed Consent signature 
[CONTACT_142239] [CONTACT_322660]. 
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by [CONTACT_307981] (e.g. , FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning of 
such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC /REB ), as appropr iate. 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a

 addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a trial, 
other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a chan ge in P rincipal Investigator , administrative changes, or 
following annual review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC /REB . The new version of the ICF must be approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]/EC /REB . Acceptance by [CONTACT_322661] e site’s  IRB/EC /REB . The IRB/EC /REB  will determine the subject population to 
be re- consented.  
Trial  personnel should explain to the subject that even if the subject agrees to participate in the 
trial and signs the ICF, catheterization may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate for the trial. A Screening Log will be maintained by [CONTACT_322662], including, but not limited to, the reason for screen failure.  
22. Committees 
22.1. Executive Committee 
An Executive Committee composed of BSC Clinical Management and selected Global and National Principal Investigators has been developed . This committee will be responsible for the 
overall conduct of the tr ial which will include protocol development, trial progress, subject 
safety, overall data quality and integrity, and timely dissemination of trial results through appropriate scientific sessions and publications. As appropriate the Executive Committee may request participation of RANGER II SFA Investigators on the committee.  
22.2. Safety Monitoring Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, the i ndependent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) 
and Independent Data Review (IDR) will provide evaluations of safety events. Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. Thi s is 
expedited through BSC’ s Safety Group, which is responsible for coordinating the collection of 
information for the subject dossier from Medidata Rave EDC database that is entered by [CONTACT_142227]. During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, clinical researc h 
monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of source document information  
22.3. Clinical Events  Committee (CEC)  
The CEC is an independent group of individuals with no affiliation with BSC. Committee membership will include expert practitioners of peripheral endovascular procedures, as well as other experts with the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to review and adjudicate the following endpoints and major adverse events reported by [CONTACT_142228]:  
 All Dea ths

22.4. Independent Data Review (IDR)  
The independent data reviewer (IDR) provides external oversight and review for potential safety concerns. The IDR is a physician expert in peripheral interventional therapy who is not participating in the clinical trial and is independent to BSC.  
Aggregate accumulating safety data will be reviewed to monitor for the incidence of MAEs  and 
other trends that would warrant modification or termination of the trial. During the course of the trial, data will be supplied to and reviewed by [CONTACT_142230] (i.e., group A and group B). If, after review of blinded data, the IDR wants to review unblinded data, a request will be made to  the Executive Committee for consideration and final decision.  
Any IDR recommendations for clinical trial modification or termination because of concerns over subject safety or issues relating to data monitoring or quality control will be submitted in writing to BSC  for consideration.  
Contact [CONTACT_322664].  
23. Suspension or Termination  
23.1. Premature Termination of the Trial  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation reserves the right to terminate the trial at any stage but intends to exercise this right only for valid scientific or administrative reasons and reasons related to protection of subjects.  Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities, as 
applicable, will be notified in writing in the event of trial termination.  
23.1.1. Criteria for Premature  Termination of the Trial  
Possible reasons for premature trial termination include, but are not limited to, the following.  
 The occurrence of unanticipated adverse device effects that present a significant or unreasonable risk to subjects enrolled in the trial.  
 An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the trial.  
 A decision on the part of [LOCATION_011] Scientific to suspend or discontinue development of the device.  
23.2. Termination of Trial Participation by [CONTACT_5717]/EC /REB 
Approval

In the event of premature trial termination a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participating sites by [CONTACT_5756]. The 
IRB/EC /REB  and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified. Detailed information on 
how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided.  
In the event an IRB or EC terminates participation in the trial, participating investigators, 
associated IRBs/ECs, and regu latory authorities, as applicable, will be notified in writing. 
Detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided by [CONTACT_5756].  
In the event a Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_322615], tri al responsibility will 
be transferred to a nother investigator, if possible. In the event there are no opportunities to 
transfer Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5705]; detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided  by [CONTACT_5739] C. 
The Principal I nvestigator or his/her designee must return all study -related documents and 
investigational product to [LOCATION_011] Scientific, unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects.  
23.4. Criteria for Suspending/Te rminating a Study Center  
BSC  reserves the right to stop the inclusion of subjects at a trial site at any time after the trial  
initiation visit if no subjects have been enrolled for  a period beyond 2 months after site initiation, 
or if the site has multiple  or severe protocol violations/noncompliance without justification 
and/or fails to follow remedial actions.  
In the event of termination of site  participation, all trial devices and testing equipment, as 
applicable, will be returned to BSC unless this actio n would jeopardize the rights, safety or well -
being of the subjects. The IRB/EC /REB  and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be 
notified. All subjects enrolled in the trial at the site  will continue to be followed as required by 
[CONTACT_322665] s chedule . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_322616] -up visits unless BSC notifies the investigational site  otherwise.  
24. Publication Policy  
BSC requires disclosure of its involvement as a sponsor or financial supporter in any publication or presentation relating to a BSC trial or its results. BSC will submit trial results for publication (regardless of trial outcome) following the conclusion or termination of the trial. [LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation adheres to the Contributorship Criteria set forth in the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE; http://www.icmje.org).

ASSISTED PRIMARY PATENCY  Percentage (%) of lesions without clinically -driven TLR and those 
with clinically -driven TLR (not due to complete occlusion or by -
pass) that reach endpoint without restenosis. 
BLEEDING COMPLICATION Includes, but is not limited to, intracranial hemorrhage, GI bleeding, hematoma, bleeding at percutaneous catheterization site, and/or retroperitoneal bleeding. Bleeding that requires surgery qualifies as an SAE.

COMPLETE BLOOD 
COUNT (CBC)  A blood test used to measure several components and features of blood, including:  Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit and Platelets.  
COMPLICATION An undesirable clinical event that results in death, injury, or invasive intervention. Complications may include, but are not limited to perforation, occlusion, intimal flap, dissection, loss of side branch, distal embolization, hypotension, hematoma, 
arrhythmias, etc. Complications may or may not be related to the 
investigational product(s). 
DEATH  All deaths are considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non-
cardiac cause can be established. Specifically, an unexpected death in subjects with co existing potentially fatal non -cardiac diseases 
(e.g. Cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.  
All death events will be submitted to CEC and will be categorized as: 
Cardiac death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low-output fai lure, fatal arrhythmia). Unwitnessed death and death 
of unknown cause will be classified as cardiac death. This includes all procedure related deaths including those related to concomitant treatment.  
Vascular death: death due to cerebrovascular disease, pu lmonary 
embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.  
Non-cardiovascular death:  any death not covered by [CONTACT_142232], including death due to infection, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide, or trauma.  
DIAMETER STENOSIS  The maximal narrowing of the target lesion relative to the reference vessel diameter.  
DISSECTION-  
NHLBI GRADE TYPES  Type A : Small radiolucent area within the lumen of the vessel disappearing with the passage of the contrast material.  
Type B: Appearance of contrast medium parallel to the lumen of 
the vessel disappearing within a few cardiac cycles.  
Type C : Dissection protruding outside the lumen of the vessel 
persisting after passage of the contrast material.  
Type D : Spi[INVESTIGATOR_13716]-off of the contrast material in the antegrade flow.  
Type E : Persistent luminal filling defect with delayed run -off of 
the contrast material in the distal lumen.  
Type F : Filling defect accompanied by [CONTACT_322666] .

EQ-5D™  Descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting 
of five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. 
END OF INDEX PROCEDURE (TIME)  The end of the index procedure is defined as the time the guide 
(catheter or sheath) is removed (post final angiography).

the pre -procedure value without the need for repeat 
revascularization.  
HYPOTENSION  Systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg lasting more than 30 minutes or requiring intervent ion (e.g. pacing, IABP, intra venous 
vasopressors to sustain systolic blood pressure). This excludes transient hypotension or vagal reactions, which are self -limited or 
readily reversible.  
INTIMAL FLAP  An extension of the vessel wall into the arterial lumen.  
LESION LENGTH  Measured as the distance from the proximal shoulder to the distal shoulder of the lesion, in the view that demonstrates the stenosis in its most elongated projection.  
MINIMAL LUMEN DIAMETER  The vessel diameter as measured at the most narrow point of the lesion. 
OCCLUSION Lesion with no flow; implies 100% diameter stenosis.  
PERFORATION  Perforations are classified as follows:  
Angiographic perforation : perforation detected by [CONTACT_142233].  
Clinical perforation : perforation requiring additional treatment 
(including efforts to seal the perforation), or resulting in significant 
hemodynamic compromise, abrupt closure, or death. 
PRIMARY

Substudy 
Design  A non -blinded, non -randomized, Long Balloon substudy run concurrent to 
the RANGER II SFA Global Pi[INVESTIGATOR_322617]’s Post -Market Clinical Follow -up (PMCF) 
Requirement.  
Although an investigative center can participate in both the RCT and Long Balloon trial arms, a subje ct can either be enrolled in the RCT study arm 
or the RANGER Long Balloon substudy, but not both.   
Blinding  / 
Unblinding  All subjects in the RANGER Long Balloon substudy will be treated with 
the Ranger DCB.  Therefore, all subjects, Investigators, trial center personnel, Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) Core Laboratory personnel, Angiography Core Laboratory personnel, and Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will not be blinded to the assigned treatment arm.

Planned 
Number of Investigational Sites / Countries  Up to 12 trial centers in Europe and New Zealand may enroll subjects into 
the RANGER Long Balloon substudy.  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint  The primary safety endpoint assesses the occurrence of Major Adverse 
Events (MAE) defined as all -cause death through 1 month, target limb 
major amputation and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR) at [ADDRESS_398439].  The MAE -free rate as well as its individual components will 
be reported separately for this subgroup.  
Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint  The primar y effectiveness endpoint assesses primary lesion patency at 6 
months as determined by [CONTACT_136665] (DUS). 
Primary effectiveness is defined as a binary endpoint determined by [CONTACT_136665] (DUS) peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≤ 2.4 in the absence of clinically -driven TLR.  
Notes : 
 Lesion patency is defined as freedom from more than 50% stenosis based on DUS PSVR comparing data within the treated segment to the proximal normal arterial segment.  
 PSVR >2.4 suggests >50% stenosis. 
The treated segment will be assessed for patency as a single segment regardless of the number of tandem lesions within the ballooned segment.  
Secondary 
Endpoints   Technical success defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation 
and deflation and retrieval of the intact trial device without burst below the rated burst pressure (RBP)  
 Procedural success defined as residual stenosis of ≤ 50% (non- stented 
subjects) or ≤ 30% (stented subjects) by [CONTACT_322623] (if core laboratory assessment is not available t hen the site -reported 
estimate is used)  
 Clinical success defined as procedural success without procedural complications (i.e. death, major target limb amputation, thrombosis of the target lesion, or clinically -driven TLR) prior to discharge  
 Major Adverse Events (MAE) through [ADDRESS_398440] -index procedure, TLR, and major target limb 
amputation

 Duplex -defined binary restenosis (PSVR > 2.4) of the target lesion at 
1, 6, 12 months  
Method of 
Assigning Patients to Treatment  In the RANGER Long Balloon substudy, subjects will not be randomized; 
all subjects will be treated with the Ranger D CB. Subjects are considered 
enrolled when the Ranger DCB is introduced into the subject’s vasculature.  
Note : If the subject is found to meet exclusion criteria during the 
angiographic eligibility assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not be entered into this substudy. The subject should be cared for and followed outside of the trial based on the physician’s treatment plan.  
Note : If the balloon angioplasty attempt with the assigned treatment 
device (the test device Ranger DCB ) is not successful, follow -up through 
the 1 month visit only will occur as part of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population.  Data for assessment of MAE will be collected for these subjects.  No other testing or follow up is required. 
Follow -up 
Schedule  Follow -up visits for the RANGER Long Balloon substudy will occur at 
pre-discharge, [ADDRESS_398443] -index procedure.  
Office or clinic visits are required for testing during each protocol required follow -up visit. Planned procedures and testing include the 
following:  
 Physical Exam at  screening, pre -discharge, 1 month, 6 month, and 12 
month 
 Angiogram at time of index procedure and during any subsequent revascularization procedure (up to12 months post index procedure)  
 Duplex Ultrasound a t 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month  
 Rutherford Classification at screening, 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month  
 Resting ABI exam at screening, 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month

  Lab tests:  
– Complete Blood Count (CBC) containing WBC, RBC and PLT at 
screening  
– Serum creatinine at screening  
– Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) within 24 hrs prior to index procedure if of child bearing age  
 Medication compliance at screening, procedure, pre- discharge, 1 
month, 6 month, and 12 month,  
 Adverse event monitoring at proc edure, pre -discharge, [ADDRESS_398444] prescribe concomitant anti- coagulant and 
anti-platelet medications consistent with current local clinical practice.  
Antiplatelet medication and peripheral artery disease (PAD) medication usage will be collected and reported for compliance throughout the trial.  
Minimum protocol requirements:  
 Anti-coagulation therapy administered prior to and during the 
procedure should be consistent with current clinical practice.  
 A minimum of 30 days of dual antiplatelet therapy for non- stented 
subjects and a minimum of 3 months (90 days) dual antiplatelet therapy for stented s ubjects post index procedure.  
Minimum recommendation: 
 Antiplatelet monotherapy is recommended for administration 
throughout the 12 month follow -up (trial completion). 
Note : A subject is exempt from the above -mentioned antiplatelet 
requirements if he/she r equires Coumadin or other similar anti -coagulant 
due to known comorbidities and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant could put the subject at an unreasonable risk of bleeding.

Multiple 
Interventions During Index Procedure  Contralateral & Ipsilateral Limb Lesions  
Using the same access site, iliac lesion(s) in the contralateral and ipsilateral limb may be treated during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially (non -drug coated) available device 
occurs prior to enrollment of the target SFA/PPA lesion(s); 
 Treatment of the lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae (success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_142184]) and  
If the above criteria are n ot met, the subject may not be enrolled  into the 
substudy  but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
Note : Provisional stenting of the target lesion with bare- metal stents can 
be completed in cases where adequate results could not be obtained after using post -dilatation balloons; such as in the case of remaining residual 
stenosis [≥ 50%] or major [≥ Grade D] flow -limiting dissection after post-
dilatation.  
Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics will be used in the RANGER Long Balloon 
substudy.  
Sample Size and 
Statistical Method for Long Balloon substudy  In order to support the stated objectives for the RANGER Long Balloon 
substudy, the sample size for this substudy will be a minimum of 50 subjects; 20 subjects will be treated with a 200 mm Long Balloon.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented to describe the Long Balloon substudy results.

4. Statistical Considerations  
The RANGER Long Balloon Substudy is an observational substudy.  The non- statistically driven 
performance goal will be compared against the observed 6 -month and 12 -month primary patency 
in the evaluable long balloon subjects.  
4.1. Primary Endpoint  
The sample size determination for the RANGER Long Balloon substudy is arbitrary and not 
statistically driven.  
4.1.1. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint assesses 6 -month primary patency as determined by [CONTACT_322668] (DUS).  Lesion patency is defined as freedom from greater than 50% stenosis in the 
S2062                              Form/Template 90702637 Rev/ Ver A J

                                                                                                                       Page 109  of 110  
  
  
 absence of clinically -driven TLR. Primary effectiveness is defined as a binary endpoint 
determined by [CONTACT_136665] (DUS) peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_398460] the observed 6 -month 
primary patency in the evaluable long balloon subjects. If the observed 6 -month primary patency 
is greater than or equal to 50%, the RANGER DCB will be considered to have acceptable effectiveness performance in the long balloon population. 
4.1.2. Primary Safety Endp oint 
The primary safety endpoint assesses the occurrence of Major Adverse Events (MAE) defined as 
all-cause death through 1 month, target limb major amputation and/or target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) at [ADDRESS_398461].  The MAE -free rate as well as its individual components will be 
reported separately for this subgroup.  
4.2. Additional Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints that will be evaluated, but are not necessarily powered to make statistically -
based conclusions, will be reported separately for this subgroup including:  
 Technical success defined as successful delivery, balloon inflation and deflation and retrieval of the intact trial device without burst below the rated burst pressure (RBP)  
 Procedural success defined as residual stenosis of ≤ 50% (non- stented subjects) o r ≤ 30% 
(stented subjects) by [CONTACT_322623] (if core laboratory assessment is not available then the site -reported estimate is used)  
 Clinical success defined as procedural success without procedural complications (i.e. death, major target limb amputation, thrombosis of the target lesion, or clinically -driven TLR) prior 
to discharge  
 Major Adverse Events (MAE) through [ADDRESS_398462]-index procedure, TLR, and  major target limb amputation   
 Death of any cause within 30 days, 6, and 12 months  
 TVR rates at 6, and 12 months  
 TLR rates at 6, and 12 months  
 Rate of Primary and Secondary sustained clinical improvement as assessed by [CONTACT_142178] 1, [ADDRESS_398463] -proce dure 
 Rate of Hemodynamic Improvement as assessed by [CONTACT_142179] -Brachial Index (ABI) 
from baseline at 1, [ADDRESS_398464] -procedure  
 Duplex -defined binary restenosis (PSVR > 2.4) of the target lesion at 1, 6 and 12 months

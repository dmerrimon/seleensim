2. STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES
2.1. Objectives 
Primary Objective(s)
To evaluate the clinical performance of etaf ilcon A contact [CONTACT_129800] a novel molding 
process by [CONTACT_739860] A contact [CONTACT_739861]: 
xOverall comfort  
xOverall quality of vision
Secondary Objective(s)
To evaluate the clinical perfor mance of etafilcon A lenses made with a new molding process 
by [CONTACT_739854] A lenses made with the existing molding process in the following 
area:
xAverage daily wear time
xMonocular distance visual performance
2.2. Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint(s)
CLUE Comfort and Vision Scores: 
The co-primary endpoints for th is study are subjective assessme nt of comfort and quality of 
vision after 7±[ADDRESS_1010860] Lens User 
ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire.  CLUE  is a validated patient reported outcomes 
(PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient e xperience attributes of soft contact [CONTACT_13276] 
(comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 
18 and 65 years of age.  CLUE composite scor es are derived using Item Response Theory 
(IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where 
higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response.  A 5-point increase in an average 
CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the di stribution of scores fo r the population of soft 
disposable contact [CONTACT_19554].
Secondary Endpoint(s) 
Average daily wear time (in hours): 
Average daily wear time will be calculated as the number of hours betw een subjects reported 
time of insertion and time of removal of the study lenses, on an average day, at 1-Week Follow up evaluation. 
Visual performance
Visual performance will be calculated as mono cular contact [CONTACT_13293]-corrected distance visual 
acuity using a logMAR visual acu ity scale.  This will be ev aluated under high luminance and 
high contrast conditions at 4 meters from Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) charts at the 1 Week Follow-up visit.  
CR-6307, v2.0

The following will be monitored and descriptively evaluated 
xAdverse events 
xReasons for discontinuation 
xLens damage
2.3. Hypotheses
Primary Hypotheses: 
There are two co-primary hypotheses in this st udy. Both of them must be me to satisfy the 
primary objective of the study. 
1. The Test lens will be non-inferior to the Control lens with respect to overall CLUE 
comfort score at the follow-up visit.  A non- inferiority margin of -[ADDRESS_1010861] to overall CLUE 
vision score at the follow-up visit.  A non-in feriority margin of -5 points will be used. 
Secondary Hypotheses:
1. The Test lens will be non-inferior to the Control lens with respect to average daily 
wear time at 1-week follow-up visit.  A non- inferiority margin of [ADDRESS_1010862] to logMAR visual 
performance (using ETDRS visual acuity ch arts) at the follow-up visit.  A non-
inferiority margin of 0.05 logMAR will be used.

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study DesignThis study is a multi-site, group sequential,  adaptive, randomized, double-masked, 2×[ADDRESS_1010867] and 
Control lenses in a random order for 1-week each as a daily disposable modality with a wash-
out period of 1 week between the wearing periods.   
Period 1: 
At study Visit 1, subjects will be consented and scr eened for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If a 
subject is found to meet all eligibility criter ia (see Section 3.4.), they will be randomly 
assigned to either Test/Control or Control/Test sequence using 1:1 ratio (i.e. 1/[ADDRESS_1010868]/Control sequence and 1/2 on the Control/Test sequence). Subjects will fit the first 
pair of lens in both eyes based on the sequ ence assigned; otherwise, the subject will be 
deemed ineligible for this study. Subjects will be  advised to wear the study lenses at least 8 
hours a day for a minimum of 6 days. 
Successfully dispensed subjects at the Visit 1 will  be scheduled for a follow-up visit (Visit 2).  
The follow-up visit will occur approximately 7±2 days after the Visit 1.  Unscheduled 
follow-up visits may occur during the study.  At this visit, CLUE comfort and vision, slit 
lamp findings will be captured. 
Wash-out period: 
After completion of Visit 2, ther e is a 7 to 9 day washout peri od during which subjects may 
use their habitual products.Period 2: 
Following the washout period, the subject returns for Visit [ADDRESS_1010869] 7±[ADDRESS_1010870], a 7 to 9 days washout period was considered between the wearing periods.  
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 21 of 164JJVC Confidential
Historical data (see Sample Size Justification Section 14.2) showed that the variances of 
CLUE comfort and vision scores of the Cont rol lens were ranging between [ADDRESS_1010871] completed Phase 1. The interim analysis will be used to estimate if more subjects are 
needed. If needed, additional subjects will be added to the study, in phase 2, up to a 
maximum of 260.  
The population to be studied will be healthy ma le and female volunteers (at least 18 and not 
more than 70 years old) who are habitual wear ers of daily disposable (approximately 80% [ADDRESS_1010872], approximately 20% any other brand of hydrogel daily disposable 
contact [CONTACT_13293]) and have a spectacle astigmatism of <0.75 D in both eyes.  Up to 165 subjects 
will be enrolled to ensure approximately 150 subjects successfully complete the study.   
There will be a total of 4 visits and the study duration for Phase 1 will be approximately 3 
months: 
Visit 1: (Day 0): Baseline Screening and Initi al Randomization/Dispensing Visit 
Treatment #1
Visit 2: (Day 5-9): 1-Week Follow-Up Vi sit with first pair of study 
lenses/Dispensing Visit Treatment #2
Visit 3: (Approximately 1 Week from Visit 2):  Post wash-out baseline and 
Dispensing Visit for Treatment #2
Visit 4: (Day 5-9 from Visit 3): 1-Week Follow- up Visit with second pair of study 
lenses and study exit 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring th at all subjects entering the study conform to 
subject selection criteri a.  The number of subjects target ed for randomization and completion 
are as follows:

The study lenses will be worn in a bilate ral and random fashion using a 2×2 crossover 
design.  A computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to randomly assign 
subjects, in block of 2, to one of the two possible lens we ar sequences: Test/Control or 
Control/Lens.  The random scheme will be ge nerated using the PROC PLAN procedure from 
Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
The study site must follow the randomization sc heme provided and complete enrollment per 
the randomization list and not pr e-select or assign subjects.  The randomized assignment of 
subjects will be performed at th e first visit prior to the first fi tting.  The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization:
xInformed consent has been obtained 
xSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
xSubject history and baseline in formation has been collected. 
5.2. Masking
This is a double-masked study where subjects, investigators are masked to the identity of the 
study lenses during the study period.  Every attemp t will be made to keep the other clinical 
trial personnel involved in the study (e.g. data  management, biostatistician) unaware of the 
identity of the study lenses. 
The identity of the study lenses will be masked by [CONTACT_739868] a label 
containing the study number, lot number, sphere power, expi[INVESTIGATOR_129798].  Only the personnel involved in the over labeling and the statistician 
generating the randomization scheme will have access to the decode information translating 
the randomization codes into Test and Contro l groups.  The Biostati stician performing the 
interim analysis will have access to the decode information to run the interim analysis.  The 
medical monitor will also have access to the dec ode information in case breaking the mask is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010875] 
completed the study and the database is finalized.  Otherwise, the mask should be broken 
only if specific emergency tr eatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_184903].  In such cases , the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact 
[CONTACT_7195].  In the ev ent the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon 
as possible.  The date, time, and reason for the unmasking must  be documented in the subject 
record.  The Investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the 
clinical site or Sponsor personnel. 
Subjects who have had their tr eatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued will not be replaced. 
5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
The test articles mask shall not be broken unl ess information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  The Sponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.  The Biostatistician perf orming the interim analysis should keep the 
decode information in a secure location and should not share it with the personnel involved 
in the study until the all subjec ts have completed the study and the database is finalized. 
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule/randomization scheme to obtai n the test article assignment for that 
subject prior to dispensing 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of 
the randomization scheme 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropr iate test articles from the study supply.  
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or  not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010876]/Investigators to the identity of the lens . The test articles will 
be in investigational cartons sealed with a ta mper evident seal, commercial cartons, or in 
plastic bags as the secondary packaging form. Th e sample study label is shown below:       
6.5. Storage Conditions Test articles will be maintained at ambient temper atures at the clinical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions. 
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples 
Lenses that are being collected will be stored wet (using saline solution) in separate glass 
vials with labels that minimally contain st udy number, date, subject number, and eye from 
which the lens was removed.
When possible, any lens or test article associ ated with an Adverse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return back to JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficien t quantities of study articles and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to  retain all lens shipment 
documentation for the test artic le accountability records.  
Test article must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator ma y delegate this activity to authorized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test articles must be accounted.  This 
includes: 
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fi tting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace a ppropriately between visits  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused 3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements   
CR-6307, v2.0

8.2. Withdrawal/Discontinuation from the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
xSubject death during the study period 
xSubject withdrawal of consent
xSubject not compliant to protocol 
xSubject lost to follow-up 
xSubject no longer meets elig ibility criteria (e .g. the subject becomes pregnant)
xSubject develops significant or serious adverse events causing discontinuation of 
study lens wear 
xSubjects who have experienced a Corneal Infiltrative Event (CIE)
xInvestigator’s clinical judgment  regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the 
best interest of the subject to stop treatment)
xSubject misses any study visits   
xSubject not compliant with study lens wear schedule 
xSubject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor 
vision, poor comfort, or unacceptable fit.
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will: 
xComplete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
xComplete the Final Evaluation, indica ting the reason that the subject was
discontinued from the study. 
xRecord the spherocylindrical refraction with  best corrected distance visual acuity 
xCollect used test article(s) (w orn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1010877] article(s) from the subject.
An additional subject will be enrolled if a s ubject discontinues from the study prematurely.  
In cases where a subject is lost to follow-up, every possible effort must be made to contact 
[CONTACT_739869] r eason for discontinuation/withdrawal.  The measures taken to 
follow up must be documented including two wr itten attempts and a certified letter (or 
equivalent) as the final attempt. 
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT  INTERVENTION/MEDICATION
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study.  
Disallowed medications for this study include: See Section 3.3   
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_739845]: See Section 3.[ADDRESS_1010878] be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours af ter discovery of the 
protocol deviation.  The Investig ator will report deviations per IRB/IEC requirements.  All 
deviations will be tracked and corrective actions implemented as appropriate. 
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010879] notify and pr ovide the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.  
11. STUDY TERMINATION
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out, ma y result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446].  In the ev ent of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be  stopped.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_312773]’s results are compromised.JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the stud y if an unreasonable risk is determined.  The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_312796] i ndividual clinical  site due to 
specific clinical observations, if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is 
determined that it would be unwise to  continue at the clinical site.   
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an un reasonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, as soon as possible. 
Should the study be terminated (either prematur ely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_739870]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to a ny written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the iden tity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles af ter they have been released for clinical trial 
use.   
Potential complaints may come from a variet y of sources including  but not limited to 
subjects, clinical research associates (CRA),  clinical operations managers (COM), medical 
monitors, and site personnel, etc. The fo llowing are not considered product quality 
complaints: 
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010880] satisfaction inquiries reported vi a “Subjective Questionna ires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)” 
xClinical test articles that are stored im properly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site
xLens replacements that o ccur due to drops/fall-outs
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i .e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations 
where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_739871] [ADDRESS_1010881] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trig ger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinic al QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send au tomatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for no tifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_312798]:  
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)
xWho received the complaint 
xStudy number 
xClinical site information (contac t name, site ID, telephone number)
xLot number(s) 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s)
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject)
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted
xAny related AE numb er if applicable 
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/u nscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) 
xEye Care Provider objective (sl it lamp) findings if applicable 
xConfirmation of product availability fo r return (and tracking information, if 
available), or rationale if produc t is not availa ble for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious  Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow Section 13 of this protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the re sult of a product quality  related deficiency, 
these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in ED C by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Inten tionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented.

13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including ab normal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investigationa l medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes events re lated to the investig ational medical device 
or the comparator.
Note 2  to entry: This definition includes even ts related to the pr ocedures involved. 
Note 3 to entry: For users or other pe rsons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.”1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that:
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appe ared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study  
2. Was present prior to the study, but wors ened during the study. This would include 
any condition resulting from concomitant illnesses, reactions to concomitant 
medications, or progression of disease states 
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an a dverse event and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning of the event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
xResults in death
xIs life threatening
xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739846]/incapacity (e.g., a sight threatening 
event, a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or 
disruption to the subject’s body)
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
xRequires intervention to prevent permanent damage (the use of the test article 
resulting in a condition which requires medical  or surgical interv ention to preclude 
permanent impairment of the body structure or a body function).  Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71154], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may re quire medical or surg ical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition 
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 47 of 164JJVC Confidential
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Serious Adverse Events include, but not 
limited to:
xMicrobial Keratitis (MK)
xIritis (including cells in the anterior chamber)
xPermanent decrease in best spectacle correc ted visual acuity equivalent to 2 acuity 
lines or greater
xCentral Corneal Opacity
xCentral Corneal Neovascularization
xUveitis
xEndophthalmitis 
xHypopyon 
xHyphemia 
xPenetration of Bowman’s Membrane 
xPersistent Epi[INVESTIGATOR_739847]  – Those events that are usually symptomatic and warrant 
discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article (excluding Serious Adverse 
Events).   Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Oc ular Significant Adverse Events include, but 
not limited to the following: 
xContact [CONTACT_35516] (CLPU)
xSignificant Infiltrative Events (SIE)
xSuperior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_32955] (SEALs)
xAny Temporary Loss of > [ADDRESS_1010882] lens related co rneal events - e.g. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_71155] (EKC) 
xAsymptomatic Corneal Scar
xAny corneal event which necessitates te mporary lens discontinuation > 2 weeks
Non-Significant Adverse Events  – Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and 
usually do not warrant discon tinuation (temporary or permanen t) of the test article.  
However, the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionary measure.  Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non- Significant Adverse Events 
include, but not limited to the following: 
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)
xContact [CONTACT_19573][INVESTIGATOR_19534] (CLPC)
xSuperficial Punctate Keratitis (SPK)
xConjunctivitis: Bacterial, Viral, Allergic
xBlepharitis
xMeibomianitis
xContact [CONTACT_739872], 
which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_1010883] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adve rse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment , implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the i nvestigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_1010884] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening pr oblem or death caused by, or asso ciated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously iden tified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigationa l plan, Investigator’s Brochur e or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in Section 13.1) 
xCausality or Relatedness – i .e. the relationship between  the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures and the advers e event (not related; unlikely related; 
possibly related; related - s ee definition in Section 13.2.1) 
xAdverse Event Severity – Advers e event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate ; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 13.2.2)
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolved ; recovering or resolving; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or re solved; death related to adverse event;
unknown 
xActions Taken – none; temporarily disconti nued; permanently discontinued; other 
13.2.1. Causality AssessmentCausality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_739873]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for whic h an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal re lationship is not likely
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be  due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedur es. An alternative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease( s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, the ca usal relationship cannot be excluded
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 49 of 164JJVC Confidential
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_376706], e.g. concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is c onfirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challe nge and re-challenge 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the de gree of intensity of an adverse 
event as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/he r by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure 
relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following 
scale:
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but  is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subj ect’s daily activities
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy and interferes with the subject’s daily activities
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if th e condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded  and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse even ts at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropr iate case report form  or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while th e subject is enrolled in the study must be 
documented appropriately rega rdless of relationship.   
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to maintain docum entation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followe d in accordance with applicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documentation will include the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom) 
xDrawings or photographs (whe re appropriate) that deta il the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.)  
xDate the clinical site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and time of resolution
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010885] articles, as applicable
xTreatment regimen instituted, including c oncomitant medications  prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements 
xAny referral to another h ealth care provider if needed
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any) 
xLikely etiology 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the disc overy of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present,  he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate 
Assessment eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of  the corneal lesion will be collected to 
determine if the infection is microbial in nature .  If cultures are collect ed, the date of culture 
collection and laboratory u tilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be  performed.  Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have return ed to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If  further treatment beyond licensure  is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Investig ator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with  an adverse event will continue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation.  The Inve stigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Ev ent eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test ar ticle, study treatment or study proc edures, as of the final study 
visit date, should be followed to resolution of  the adverse event or un til referral to an 
appropriate health care provide r, as recommended by [CONTACT_57748]. Non-ocular adverse 
events that are not related to the test article, study treatment,  or study procedures may be 
recorded as “ongoing” w ithout further follow-up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later th an 24 hours from discovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event.  
In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB 
according to their requirements (Section 13.4. 2).  The report will comment whether the 
adverse event was considered to be related to  the test article, study treatment or study 
procedures. 
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 51 of 164JJVC Confidential
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of al l serious/significant ad verse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All subjects experiencing a serious/significant  adverse event must be  followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately 
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s reco rds all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted  in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject 
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to
whether the event was or was not rela ted to the use of the test article
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Un anticipated (Serious) Adverse Device  Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE  to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_1010886] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1010887].
Non-Serious Adverse EventsAll non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_312801] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requireme nts for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical  site will refer to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_169768]. 
The Sponsor will report applicab le Adverse Events to  the local health au thorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010888]
None 
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) dur ing the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_739874]. However, this data 
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_129815], but due to 
general concerns relatin g to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_78617] e.  Specifically, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the 
mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will be unde rtaken by [CONTACT_739875].  
A general description of the stat istical methods to be implemente d in this clinical trial is 
outlined below.  A stand-alone Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP) with more details will be 
finalized before the interim analysis is undertaken.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software 
Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Throughout the analysis of data, the results 
for each subject/eye will be used when availabl e for summarization and statistical analysis.  
Unscheduled visits will be summarized separa tely and will be excluded from the statistical 
analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or  frequency tables) will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and sa fety variables as appropriate.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum and maximum).  Frequency c ount and percentage of subjects or eyes 
within each category will be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification
An adaptive sample size approach is used to allow for modifications based on interim results, 
with a maximum of [ADDRESS_1010889] completed the study.  This interim analysis will be 
used for an early claim of success (i.e. demonstr ate non-inferiority).  If needed, additional 
subjects will be added to th e study, in phase 2, up to a maximu m of 260 (see Interim Analysis 
Section for more details).

14.3. Analysis Populations
Safety Population:
All subjects who were administer ed any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At leas t one observation shou ld be recorded.
Per-Protocol Population:  All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_739876] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
per-protocol population set will be documented in a memo to file. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:All randomized subjects rega rdless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from 
study or deviation from prot ocol. At least one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an overall type  I error rate of 5%. 
Type I error will be controlled for multiplicity ac ross interim analysis and final analysis.  The 
operating characteristics of this adapti ve trial will be provided in the SAP.
14.5. Primary Analysis  The co-primary endpoints for this study are the CLUE comfort and the CLUE vision scores 
evaluated after 1-week of lens wear.  The prim ary analysis will be conducted on per-protocol 
and ITT populations.  Both prim ary hypotheses must be met to meet the primary objective of 
the study. 
CLUE Comfort and Vision scores 
CLUE comfort and vision scores will be anal yzed separately using a Bayesian repeated 
measurement random-effects model to compare between Test and Control lenses.  Each 
regression model will include baseline values, lens type, lens wearing sequence and lens 
wearing period as fixed effects and investiga tional site as random effect.  Other subject 
characteristics such as age, gender and wi ll also be included as fixed effects when 
appropriate.  Unstructured  covariance matrix will be used  to model the re sidual errors among 
observations within subjects.  Non-informativ e prior distributions will be used for the 
coefficients in the models as well as fo r the error terms.  Independent vague normal 
N(0,1000) priors will be used for the regres sion coefficients, inverse gamma IG(0.001, 
0.001) for the variance of the random  effect site and inverse Wish art for the residual errors.  
The Metropolis sampler algorithm as implem ented in the SAS MCMC Procedure will be 
used to carry out parameter estimation.  Results will be reported as regression coefficient 
mean estimates with credible intervals.

mean difference between Test and Control is greater than -5.  S uperiority will be declared if 
the lower bound of the credible interval of the mean difference between Test and Control is 
greater than 0.  The superiority test will be performed only if non-inferiority is established.
14.6. Secondary Analysis  
Average Daily Wearing Time
Average daily wear time will be analyzed using the same Bayesian model described in the 
primary analysis.
The null and alternative hypotheses for non-inferior ity of Test lens rela tive to Control are as

interval of the mean difference between Test and Control is grea ter than -1.  Superiority will 
be declared if the lower bound of the credible interval of the mean difference between Test 
and Control is greater th an 0.  The superiority te st will be performed onl y if non-inferiority is 
established.
Visual Performance
Monocular distance visual perfor mance in logMAR scale will be analyzed using a Bayesian 
repeated measurement random-effects model to compare between Test and Control lenses.  
The regression model will include baseline values, lens type, lens wearing sequence and lens wearing period as fixed effects; and investigational si te and patient as ra ndom effects.  Other 
subject characteristics such as age, gender and will also be included as fixed effects when appropriate. Unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the residual errors among 
observations within same eye and subject across wearing pe riods.  Non-informative prior 
distributions will be used for the coefficients in  the models as well as for the error terms.  
Independent vague normal N(0,1000) priors will be used for the regression coefficients, 
inverse gamma IG(0.001, 0.001) for the variance of the random effect site and inverse 
Wishart for the residual errors.  The Metropo lis sampler algorithm as implemented in the 
SAS MCMC Procedure will be used to carry out parameter estimation.  Results will be 
reported as regression coefficient mean estimates with credible intervals.

Speciﬁ  c Instructions for Use and Warnings:
• Water Activity
Instruction for Use
Do not expose contact [CONTACT_35551].
WARNING:
Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness. If lenses have been submersed in water when participating in water sports or swimming in pools, hot tubs, lakes, or oceans, the patient should be instructed to discard them and replace them with a new pair. The Eye Care Professional should be consulted for recommendations regarding wearing lenses during any activity involving water.
PRECAUTIONS
Special Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:
• Due to the small number of patients enrolled in clinical investigation of 
lenses, all refractive powers, design conﬁ  gurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in signiﬁ  cant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the Eye Care Professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone diameter.
The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular health 
should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for refractive correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the patient and lens performance on the eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_71187].
• Patients who wear these lenses to correct presby[CONTACT_615583] 
(or modiﬁ  ed monovision using 1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST Brand 
MULTIFOCAL) may not achieve the best corrected visual acuity for either far or near vision. Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each patient.
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 82 of 164JJVC Confidential
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses are on 
the eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and become discolored. Whenever 
ﬂ  uorescein is used in eyes, the eyes should be ﬂ  ushed with a sterile saline solution that is recommended for in-eye use.
• Eye Care Professionals should instruct the patient to remove lenses 
immediately if the eyes become red or irritated. 
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients about the 
following care regimen and safety precautions.
Handling Precautions:
• Before leaving the Eye Care Professional’s ofﬁ  ce, the patient should 
be able to promptly remove the lenses or should have someone else 
available who can remove the lenses for him or her.
• DO NOT use if the sterile blister package is opened or damaged.
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get 
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or 
on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup.
• DO NOT touch contact [CONTACT_35554] ﬁ  ngers or hands if the hands are 
not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to the eye.
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing instructions 
in the Patient Instruction Guide for these lenses and those prescribed by [CONTACT_35578].
• Always handle lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens 
container. Slide the lens up the side of the bowl until it is free of the 
container.
• Do not touch the lens with ﬁ  ngernails.
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended 
directions in “Care for Sticking (Non-Moving) Lenses.” The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should be instructed to immediately consult his or her Eye Care Professional.
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_35555].
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 83 of 164JJVC Confidential
• The patient should be advised to never allow anyone else to wear their 
lenses. They have been prescribed to ﬁ  t their eyes and to correct their 
vision to the degree necessary. Sharing lenses greatly increases the chance of eye infections.
• If aerosol products, such as hairspray, are used while wearing lenses, 
exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled.
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing lenses.
Lens Care Precautions:
• The patient should be informed that no cleaning or disinfection is needed 
when lenses are worn for daily disposable wear. Patients should always dispose of lenses when removed and have spare lenses or spectacles available.
Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Always contact [CONTACT_739889].
• Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, diuretics, 
muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion sickness may cause dryness of the eye, increased lens awareness, or blurred vision. Should such conditions exist, proper remedial measures should be prescribed. 
• Oral contraceptive users could develop visual changes or changes in 
lens tolerance when using contact [CONTACT_13276]. Patients should be cautioned accordingly.
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure the 
continuing health of the patient’s eyes. The patient should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule.
Who Should Know That the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]?
• Patients should inform all doctors (Health Care Professionals) about 
being a contact [CONTACT_35560].
• Patients should always inform their employer of being a contact [CONTACT_253452]. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equipment or may require that the patient not wear contact [CONTACT_13276].
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010906] lenses:
• The eye may burn, sting, and/or itch.
• There may be less comfort than when the lens was ﬁ  rst placed on the 
eye.
• There may be a feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched 
area).
• There may be the potential for some temporary impairment due to 
peripheral inﬁ  ltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers, or corneal erosion. There 
may be the potential for other physiological observations, such as local or generalized edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, injection, tarsal abnormalities, iritis, and conjunctivitis, some of which are clinically acceptable in low amounts.
• There may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or redness 
of the eye.
• Poor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects, 
photophobia, or dry eyes may also occur if the lenses are worn continuously or for too long a time.
The patient should be instructed to conduct a simple 3-part self-examination at least once a day. They should ask themselves:
• How do the lenses feel on my eyes?
• How do my eyes look?• Have I noticed a change in my vision? 
If the patient reports any problems, he or she should be instructed to 
IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS. If the problem or discomfort stops, the patient should discard the lens and place a new fresh lens on the eye.
If after inserting the new lens, the problem continues, the patient should be 
directed to IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS AND CONTACT [CONTACT_35561].
The patient should be advised that when any of the above symptoms occur, 
a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. He or she should be instructed to seek immediate professional identiﬁ  cation of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.

GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES
A. Patient Selection
Patients selected to wear these lenses should be chosen based on: 
• Motivation to wear lenses 
• Ability to follow instructions regarding lens wear
• General health 
• Ability to adequately handle and care for the lenses 
• Ability to understand the risks and beneﬁ  ts of lens wear
Patients who do not meet the above criteria should not be provided with contact 
[CONTACT_13276]. 
B. Pre-ﬁ  tting Examination
Initial evaluation of the patient should begin with a thorough case history 
to determine if there are any contraindications to contact [CONTACT_13279]. During the case history, the patient’s visual needs and expectations should be determined as well as an assessment of their overall ocular, physical, and mental health. 
Preceding the initial selection of trial contact [CONTACT_13276], a comprehensive ocular 
evaluation should be performed that includes, but is not limited to, the measurement of distance and near visual acuity, distance and near refractive prescription (including determining the preferred reading distance for presby[CONTACT_35562]), keratometry, and biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Based on this evaluation, if it is determined that the patient is eligible to wear 
these lenses, the Eye Care Professional should proceed to the lens ﬁ  tting instructions as outlined below. 
C. Initial Power Determination
A spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction is greater than ±4.00D.
D. Base Curve Selection (Trial Lens Fitting)
The following trial lenses should be selected for patients regardless of keratometry readings. However, corneal curvature measurements should be performed to establish the p ular status. 
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 86 of 164JJVC Confidential
• 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST: 8.5 mm/14.2 mm
• 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST for ASTIGMATISM: 8.5 mm/14.5 mm
• 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST MULTIFOCAL: 8.4 mm/14.3 mm
The trial lens should be placed on each of the patient’s eyes and evaluated 
after the patient has adjusted to the lenses.
1. Criteria of a Properly Fit Lens
A properly ﬁ  t lens will center and completely cover the cornea (i.e., no 
limbal exposure), have sufﬁ  cient movement to provide tear exchange under the contact [CONTACT_35563], and be comfortable. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to its properly centered position when released.
2. Criteria of a Flat Fitting Lens
A ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: decentration, incomplete corneal coverage (i.e., limbal exposure), excessive movement with the blink and/or edge standoff. If the lens is judged to be ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
3. Criteria of a Steep Fitting Lens
A steep ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: insufﬁ  cient movement with the blink, conjunctival indentation, and resistance when pushing the lens up digitally with the lower lid. If the lens is judged to be steep ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
If the initial trial base curve is judged to be ﬂ  at or steep ﬁ  tting, the alternate base curve, if available, should be trial ﬁ  t and evaluated after the patient has adjusted to the lens. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to a properly centered position when released. If resistance is encountered when pushing the lens up, the lens is ﬁ  tting tightly and should not be dispensed to the patient.
E. Final Lens Power (Spherical)
A spherical over-refraction should be performed to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power after the lens ﬁ  t is judged acceptable. The spherical over-refraction should be combined with the trial lens power to determine the ﬁ  nal lens prescription. The patient should experience good visual acuity with the correct lens power unless there is excessive residual astigmatism.
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 87 of 164JJVC Confidential
Example 1
Diagnostic lens: -2.00D
Spherical over-refraction: -0.25D
Final lens power: -2.25D
Example 2
Diagnostic lens: -2.00D

Final lens power: -1.75D
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess adequate ﬁ  t 
(centration and movement). If the ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses and instruct the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see PATIENT 
MANAGEMENT section).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
Although most aspects of the ﬁ  tting procedure are identical for all types of soft 
contact [CONTACT_13276], including toric lenses, there are some additional steps and/or rules to follow to assure the proper ﬁ  t of toric lenses. 
The only new steps you must follow in prescribing 1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST 
for ASTIGMATISM are that you must determine the stability, repeatability, and 
drift angle of the lens axis so that you can prescribe the correct lens axis for the patient. 
A. How to Determine Lens Cylinder and Axis Orientation
1.   Locate the Orientation Marks 
To help determine the proper orientation of the toric lens, you’ll ﬁ  nd two 
primary marks approximately 1 mm from the lens edge representing the vertical position on opposite ends of the lens at 6 and 12 o’clock (Fig. 1). Because of the lens’ ballasting system, either mark can represent the ver-tical position – there is no “top” and “bottom” as in a prism-ballasted lens. You don’t need to view both marks to assess orientation; simply look for the 6 o’clock mark as you would with a prism-ballasted lens.TORIC FITTING GUIDELINES
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 88 of 164JJVC Confidential
     Figure 1
You’ll need a slit lamp biomicroscope with a 1 to 2 mm parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_739850] ﬁ  tted to the eye. There are a number of techniques you can use to improve the visibility of the 6 o’clock mark. Using a parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35463]ﬁ  cation (10x or 15x), slowly pan down the lens, looking just below the direct illumination at the retroilluminated area. Backlighting the mark this way should make it more visible. Sometimes manipulating the lower lid may be necessary to uncover the mark.
2.   Observe Lens Rotation and Stability 
Observe the position and stability of the “bottom” mark. It usually stabilizes at the 6 o’clock position. If it does, calculation of the lens power will be straightforward. The 6 o’clock position is not a “must”; however, the absolute requirement is that the axis position be stable and repeatable. 
The mark may stabilize somewhat left or right (drift) of the vertical meridian 
and still enable you to ﬁ  t a toric lens for that eye, as long as the lens always returns to the same “drift axis” position after settling. The deviation can be compensated for in the ﬁ  nal prescription. Your objective is to ensure that whatever position the initial lens assumes near 6 o’clock, this position must be stable and repeatable. With full eye movement or heavy blink, you may see the marks swing away, but they must return quickly to the original stable position. If the lens does not return quickly, you may need to select a different lens. 
3.  Assessing Rotation 
Imagine the eye as a clock dial and every hour represents a 30° interval. If the orientation mark of the initial lens stabilizes somewhat left or right of the vertical position, the ﬁ  nal lens will orient on the eye with the same deviation. You can use an axis reticule in the slit lamp or use a line-scribed lens in a spectacle trial frame to measure or estimate the “drift angle” of the cylinder axis. 
To compensate for this “drift,” measure or estimate the “drift,” then add 
or subtract it from the refractive axis to determine the correct cylinder axis. Use the LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) method to determine which direction to compensate.
  
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 89 of 164JJVC Confidential
B. Final Lens Power
When the diagnostic lens has its axis aligned in the same meridian as the 
patient’s refractive axis, a spherocylindrical over-refraction may be performed and visual acuity determined. However, in the case of crossed axes, such as when the diagnostic lens axis is different from the spectacle cylinder axis, it is not advisable to perform a full spherocylindrical over-refraction because of the difﬁ  culty in computing the resultant power. A spherical over-refraction without cylinder refraction may be performed.
If the required cylinder correction falls between two available cylinder powers, 
it is recommended to prescribe the lower cylinder power lens. See below for instructions on how to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power.
1.  For the Sphere 
If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx > 4.00D, compensate for vertex distance. If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx < ±4.00D, vertex compensation is not necessary.
2.  For the Cylinder
Adjust the axis by [CONTACT_35564]. Choose a cylinder that is ≤ 0.50D from the refractive cylinder.
3.  Case Examples
Example [ADDRESS_1010907] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180° 20/20
O.S. -2.00D / -1.00D x 180° 20/20
Choose a diagnostic lens for each eye with axis 180°. Place the lens on 
each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient’s initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Check the orientation of the axis mark. If the bottom axis mark is in the 6 
o’clock position on both eyes, choose the appropriate cylinder as listed previously. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Here is the Rx prescribed:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180°
O.S. -2.00D / -0.75D x 180°
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010908] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -3.00D / -1.00D x 90° 20/20
O.S. -4.75D / -2.00D x 90° 20/20
Choose diagnostic lenses of -3.00D / -0.75D x 90° for the right eye and 
-4.50D / -1.75D x 90° for the left eye, the nearest lenses available to the spherical power and axis needed. For the left eye, since the manifest refraction called for -4.75D, compensating for vertex distance the sphere is reduced by 0.25D to -4.50D. The cylinder power will be -1.75D. Place the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient's initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Right Eye
The orientation mark on the right lens rotates left from the 6 o’clock position 
by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows:
Compensate the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_615588].Here is the Rx prescribed:
O.D. -3.00D / -0.75D x 100°
Left Eye
The orientation mark on the left lens rotates right from the 6 o’clock position 
by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows:
Compensate for the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_739890]. 
Here is the Rx prescribed:
O.S. -4.50D / -1.75D x 80°

A.  Presby[CONTACT_253453] & Patient Education
Multifocal contact [CONTACT_739891] ﬁ  nd their vision acceptable in speciﬁ  c situations (i.e., reading a menu in a dim restaurant, driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). Therefore, caution should be exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rst time until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually challenging environments. Occupational and environmental visual demands should be considered. If the patient requires critical visual acuity and stereopsis, it should be determined by [CONTACT_739892] 1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST MULTIFOCAL. Wearing these lenses may not 
be optimal for activities such as:
• Visually demanding situations such as operating potentially dangerous machinery or performing other potentially hazardous activities; and
• Driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot meet their state driver’s license requirements with the 1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST 
MULTIFOCAL should be advised to not drive with this correction, OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST MULTIFOCAL is not recommended for patients 
who have -1.00D or greater of refractive cylinder as this level of uncorrected cylinder may lead to additional visual compromise. These lenses are available in the following ADD powers: 
• Lens “LOW” = low near ADD lens (Max ADD +1.25) 
• Lens “MID” = medium near ADD lens (Max ADD +1.75) 
• Lens “HGH” = high near ADD lens (Max ADD +2.50)
B.  Initial Power Determination
A spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction is greater than ±4.00D. Determine the spherical equivalent distance prescription for a multifocal patient. Determine the eye dominance using one of the methods below:MULTIFOCAL FITTING GUIDELINES
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 92 of 164JJVC Confidential
Method 1    Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the patient point 
to an object at the far end of the room. Cover one eye. If the 
patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method [ADDRESS_1010909] a 
+1.00D hand-held trial lens in front of one eye and then the other while the distance refractive error correction is in place for both eyes while the patient is viewing the distance visual acuity chart. The eye with the plus over it that the patient notices the greatest reduction in vision is determined to be the dominant eye.
C. Select the Initial Trial Lens 
1.  For each eye, select the trial lens distance power that is closest to the 
patient’s distance spherical equivalent. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction is greater than ±4.00D.
2.  Select the near power of the lens based on the patients ADD range as 
follows: 
• ADD: +0.75D to +1.25D use a low near ADD (LOW) lens on each eye 
• ADD: +1.50D to +1.75D use a medium near ADD (MID) lens on each eye 
• ADD: +2.00D to +2.50D use a medium near ADD (MID) on the dominant eye and a high near ADD (HGH) lens on the non-dominant eye
3.  Allow the lenses to settle for a minimum of 10 minutes. 
4.  Assess distance and near vision binocularly and monocularly. 5.  Demonstrate the vision under various lighting conditions (normal and 
decreased illumination) and at distance, intermediate, and near. 
6.  Make adjustments in power as necessary based on the distance over-
refraction. The use of hand-held trial lenses is recommended. Check the 
impact on distance and near vision.
7. If vision is still unacceptable, make adjustments in power as necessary 
(see "Multifocal Troubleshooting" below). If distance and near vision are acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess adequate ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses instructing the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see PATIENT MANAGEMENT section).
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 93 of 164JJVC Confidential
D. Multifocal Troubleshooting
Unacceptable Near Vision
If it has been determined that no change is required based on the over-
refraction, then add +0.25D to the spherical power of the non-dominant eye.
Unacceptable Distance Vision
If it has been determined that no change is required based on the over-
refraction, then make the changes as listed below:
• If the patient is wearing two "LOW" ADD lenses, change the dominant eye to a 1-DAY ACUVUE
® MOIST sphere lens with a power equal to the 
spherical equivalent distance prescription.
• If the patient is wearing two "MID" ADD lenses, change the ADD power in the dominant eye to the "LOW" ADD power.
• If the patient is wearing a "MID" ADD lens in the dominant eye and a "HGH" ADD lens in the non-dominant eye, change the non-dominant eye to a "MID" ADD lens and add +0.25D to the distance power.
E. Adaptation
Visually demanding situations should be avoided during the initial wearing period. A patient may at ﬁ  rst experience some mild blurred vision, dizziness, headaches and a feeling of slight imbalance. You should explain the adaptational symptoms to the patient. These symptoms may last for a brief minute or for several weeks. The longer these symptoms persist, the poorer the prognosis for successful adaptation.
To help in the adaptation process, the patient can be advised to ﬁ  rst use the 
lenses in a comfortable, familiar environment such as in the home.
Some patients feel that automobile driving performance may not be optimal 
during the adaptation process. This is particularly true when driving at night. Before driving a motor vehicle, it may be recommended that the patient be a passenger ﬁ  rst to make sure that their vision is satisfactory for operating an automobile. During the ﬁ  rst several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), it may be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal driving conditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, the patient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.

• Driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot meet their state driver’s license requirements with monovision correction should be advised to not drive with this correction, OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
2. Patient Education
All patients do not function equally well with monovision correction. Patients may not perform as well for certain tasks with this correction as they have with spectacles (multifocal, bifocal, trifocal, readers, progressives). Each patient should understand that monovision, as well as other presby[CONTACT_35569], can create a vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity and depth perception for distance and near tasks. Therefore, caution should be exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rst time until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually challenging environments (e.g., reading a menu in a dimly lit restaurant, driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). During the ﬁ  tting process, it is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantages as well as the advantages of clear near vision, and straight ahead and upward gaze that monovision contact [CONTACT_35570].MONOVISION FITTING GUIDELINES

B. Eye Selection
1. Ocular Preference Determination Methods
Generally, the non-dominant eye is corrected for near vision. The following 
two methods for eye dominance can be used.
Method 1    Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the patient 
point to an object at the far end of the room. Cover one eye. 
If the patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method [ADDRESS_1010911] with the near ADD lens over the right or left eye.
2. Other Eye Selection Methods
Other methods include the “Refractive Error Method” and the “Visual Demands Method.”
Refractive Error Method
For anisometropic correction, it is generally best to ﬁ  t the more hyperopic 
(less myopic) eye for distance and the more myopic (less hyperopic) eye for near.
Visual Demands Method
Consider the patient’s occupation during the eye selection process to 
determine the critical vision requirements. If a patient’s gaze for near tasks is usually in one direction, correct the eye on that side for near.
Example: A secretary who places copy to the left side of the desk will 
function best with the near lens on the left eye.
C.  Special Fitting Characteristics
1. Unilateral Vision Correction
There are circumstances where only one contact [CONTACT_35571]. As an example, an emmetropic patient would only require a near lens, whereas a bilateral myope would require corrective lenses on both eyes. 
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 96 of 164JJVC Confidential
Examples:
A presby[CONTACT_35572] a +1.75D ADD would 
have a +1.75D lens on the near eye and the other eye left without correction.
A presby[CONTACT_35573] a +1.50D ADD who is -2.50D myopic in 
the right eye and -1.50D myopic in the left eye may have the right eye corrected for distance and the left eye uncorrected for near.
2. Near ADD Determination
Always prescribe the lens power for the near eye that provides optimal near acuity at the midpoint of the patient’s habitual reading distance. However, when more than one power provides optimal reading performance, prescribe the least plus (most minus) of the powers.
3. Trial Lens Fitting
A trial ﬁ  tting is performed in the ofﬁ  ce to allow the patient to experience monovision correction. Lenses are ﬁ  t according to the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES for base curve selection described in this Package Insert.
Case history and a standard clinical evaluation procedure should be used 
to determine the prognosis. Determine the distance correction and the near correction. Next, determine the near ADD. With trial lenses of the proper power in place, observe the reaction to this mode of correction.
Allow the lenses to settle for about [ADDRESS_1010912] the patient look at you. Assess the patient’s reaction to distance vision under these circumstances. Then have the patient look at familiar near objects such as a watch face or ﬁ  ngernails. Again assess the reaction. As the patient continues to look around the room at both near and distance objects, observe the reactions. Only after these vision tests are completed, should the patient be asked to read print. Evaluate the patient’s reaction to large print (e.g., typewritten copy) at ﬁ  rst and then graduate to newsprint and ﬁ  nally smaller type sizes.
After the patient’s performance under the above conditions is completed, 
tests of visual acuity and reading ability under conditions of moderately dim illumination should be attempted.
CR-6307, v2.[ADDRESS_1010913] several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), it may be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal driving conditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, the patient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.
D. Other Suggestions
The success of the monovision technique may be further improved by [CONTACT_618439]:
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (distance power) to use when critical distance viewing is needed.
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (near power) to use when critical near viewing is needed.
• Have supplemental spectacles to wear over the monovision contact [CONTACT_35575]ﬁ  c visual tasks may improve the success of monovision correction. This is particularly applicable for those patients who cannot meet state driver’s licensing requirements with monovision correction.
• Make use of proper illumination when carrying out visual tasks.
CR-6307, v2.0  
Page 98 of 164JJVC Confidential
Monovision ﬁ  tting success can be improved by [CONTACT_615595]:
• Reverse the distance and near eyes if a patient is having trouble 
adapting.
• Reﬁ  ne the lens powers if there is trouble with adaptation. Accurate lens power is critical for presby[CONTACT_35577].
• Emphasize the beneﬁ  ts of clear near vision, and straight ahead and upward gaze with monovision.
The decision to ﬁ  t a patient with monovision correction is most appropriately left to the Eye Care Professional in conjunction with the patient after carefully considering the patient’s needs.
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
PATIENT MANAGEMENT
• Follow the accepted standard of care in ﬁ  tting and following up with your patient, e.g., American Optometric Association standard of care. 
• Schedule the appropriate follow-up examination. 
• Preferably, at the follow-up visits, lenses should have been worn for at least six hours. 
• Provide the patient with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses, which can be found at www.acuvue.com. REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO THAT HE OR SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESCRIBED WEARING AND REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES.
The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_35578]. Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_35578], are also extremely important.
Patients tend to over wear the lenses initially. The Eye Care Professional should 
emphasize the importance of adhering to the initial maximum wearing schedule. Maximum wearing time should be determined by [CONTACT_35579]’s physiological eye condition, because individual response to contact [CONTACT_35580]. WEARING SCHEDULE

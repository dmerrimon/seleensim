 PROTOCOL: STUDY 3  
Establish the efficacy of online perceptual training for children with RSE and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95200] : 
Evaluate whether online perceptual training improves percept ion and production of /r/ in children with 
Residual Speech Errors (RSE) who have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95201], as identified by [CONTACT_95205] -based 
classification norms.  
Participants  
• Sample:  10 children with RSE affecting /r/  
• Age range:  9;0–15;11 years, native Eng lish speakers  
Eligibility  
Residual Speech Errors (RSE):  
Must have persistent speech errors specifically a ffecting the English rhotic /r/ sound.  
• Perceptual Classification:  
Must be classified as having atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95202] a laboratory -developed classification 
model applied to standardized perception tasks.  
• Language Background:  
Native speakers of Englis h. 
• Cognitive and Language Proficiency:  
Must demonstrate adequate nonverbal cognitive and language skills as assessed by 
[CONTACT_95206], including:  
o Goldman -Fristoe Test of Articulation —Third Edition (GFTA -3): Assesses articulation of 
speech sounds.  
o Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals —Fifth Edition (CELF -5), Recalling 
Sentences (RS) and Formulated Sentences (FS) subtests:  Evaluates expressive and 
receptive language functioning, focusing on sentence recall and formulation.  
o LinguiSystems Articulati on Test (LAT):  Measures production of specific speech sounds.  
2 
 o Sentence Repetition Task (SRT):  Assesses verbal memory and grammatical processing 
through sentence repetition.  
• Hearing Screening:  
Must pass an online pure -tone hearing screening at frequencies 1 000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 6000 
Hz, at 30 dB intensity.  
• Medical History:  
Must not have a history of major neurobehavioral disorders or developmental disabilities.  
• DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
• Design:  Multiple -baseline across -subjects design; participants randomly assigned to varying 
baseli ne durations (4 –10 sessions).  
• Phases:  
o Baseline:  Perception and production of /r/ are probed repeatedly without intervention.  
o Treatment:  All participants complete 12 sessions of online perceptual training (3x/week, 4 
weeks).  
o Maintenance:  Post-treatment, per ception and production are monitored for 3 sessions ; no 
further training.  
Assessment Measures:  
• Perception:  
o Online identification and category goodness judgment tasks  
o For ongoing assessment, 75 items are randomly drawn (with proper balance and difficulty 
stratification) to avoid item memorization  
• Production:  
o Standardized word probes  
o Perceptual ratings are obtained from blinded online listeners  
Perception Training (Treatment Phase)  
• 12 sessions  (30 minutes each, over 4 weeks; mostly self -administered online)  
3 
 o Task 1:  Focused perceptual training in a specific /r/ context with feedback; di fficulty 
increases with improved accuracy.  
o Task 2:  Identification of items along a synthetic rake -wake continuum with feedback based 
on typi[INVESTIGATOR_95203].  
o Task 3:  Broad perceptual training with a randomized set of items across all /r/ contexts and 
difficulties, with feedback.  
• Clinician Monitoring:  A study clinician virtually attends one session per participant each week 
to ensure engagement.  
Summary  Statement:  
This study will rigorously test whether online perceptual training leads to measurable improvements in 
both perception and production of /r/ in children with RSE and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95204], using a robust, 
randomized multiple -baseline design and b linded standardized outcome measures.

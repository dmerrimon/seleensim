CONFIDENTIAL 5Safety  Objective
To evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of FS Grifols in pediatric subjects undergoing surgery
Overall Study Design and Description:
This is a prospective, randomized, active -controlled, single- blind, parallel group clinical trial 
to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of FS Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during surgery  in 
pediatric subjects.
Pediatric subjects (<18 years of age) requiring an elective (non -emergent), open (non-
laparoscopic), pelvic, abdominal, or thoracic (non -cardiac) surgical procedure, wherein a 
TBS is identified, and a topic al hemostatic agent is indicated, will be eligible to participate in 
the clinical trial.
Preterm (up to gestational age <37 weeks) and term newborn infants (0 to 27 day s)requiring 
either an elective (non -emergent) or an emergency , open (non -laparoscopic) pelvic, 
abdominal or thoracic (non -cardiac) surgical procedure wherein a TBS is identified, and a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_422316], will be eligible to participate in the clinical trial. The 
study  treatments will be applied on the cut parenchy mous surface of a solid organ ( i.e., liver) 
and in soft tissue ( i.e., fat, muscle, or connective tissue).
A specific bleeding site will be defined as the TBS when it is determined by [CONTACT_093] 
(the surgeon) that control of bleeding b y conventional surgical techniques (including suture, 
ligature, and cautery ) is ineffective or impractical and requires an adjunct treatment to 
achieve hemostasis.
When the TBS is identified, the investigator will record the precise anatomical location of the 
TBS, rate the intensity  of the bleeding at the TBS (Grade 1-4 according to the 5-point 
validated bleeding severity  scale), and record the size of the approximate bleeding surface, 
(small, medium , and large). For soft tissue surgery only , the investigator will also record the 
type of soft tissue ( i.e.
, fat, muscle, or connective tissue). In this clinical trial, only  subjects 
with a TBS with bleeding of Grade 1 ( mild)or Grade 2 ( moderate )intensity  will be enrolled.
Subjects will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups: FS Grifols or 
EVICEL. The first 24 subjects to be enrolled in the study  will be adolescents (age range 12 to 
17 years). The term “enrolled” implies that the subject was actually  randomized to and 
treated with either the FS Grifols or EVI CEL. Enrollment will be monitored by  [CONTACT_422349] 50% of the surgical procedures are hepatic.
Number of Subjects Planned:
Approximately 172 subjects (86 subjects in the FS Grifols treatment group and 86 subjects in 
the EVI CEL  treat ment group) are planned to be enrolled. In case an y of the age subgroups 
mentioned below is underrepresented when the target of 172 enrolled subjects is met, the 
sponsor may  allow over -enrollment of a few additional subjects (i.e. ,not more than 10
additio nal subjects) in the specific age subgroup.
The approximate number of subjects planned to be randomized according to age range will 
be as follows: 5 of 74

CONFIDENTIAL 10Study Assessments and Procedures:
This study  consists of a Screening Visit, B aseline Visit , Surgical Visit , and Post-Operative 
Visits
.
Screening Visit (within 21 days prior to surgical p rocedure )
Following signature [CONTACT_35596] e Informed Consent Form ( ICF
), screening procedures will be 
performed. The Screening Visit assessments and activities will include: allocation of subject 
number ,adding subject’s data into the Screening Log, documentation of demographics ,
medical and surgical history  for the last 12 months ,life time history  for the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_422318] (including inquiry  into previous surgery  and trauma 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_422319] ),medications that the subject is taking or has taken within the 
last 3 months (includ ingtransfusion of blood or any blood -derived product) , review of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject eligibility .
If suitable due to logistic reasons, procedures scheduled at the Screening Visit ma y be 
performed during the Baseline Assessments Visit (i.e., within 24 hours prior to the surgical 
procedure ). In this case, the Screening Visit will be combined with the Baseline Assessments 
Visit. Assessments required during both visits (Screening and Bas eline) must be performed.
Baseline Assessment Visit (within 24 hours prior to surgical procedure)
Baseline assessments will be performed within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery ( i.e.,
the baseline assessments can be performed the same day  of the sur gery).At this visit, 
confirmation of existing and recording of an y new events or changes in the Screening Visit
assessments , confirmation of bleeding abnormalities and topi[INVESTIGATOR_422320], recording of 
height and weight ,
physical assessment , recording of vital signs , pregnancy test for women of 
childbearing potential
, coagulation panel, hematology , serum clinical chemistry ,assessment 
of AEs ,and r eview of inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject eligibility will be 
performed . Once all these assess ments have been completed and confirmed, the subject will 
be randomized .
Surgical Procedure Day 1
Prior to surgery , FS Grifols or EVI CEL  will be prepared. Confirmation of existing and 
recording of an y new medications (not including gaseous anesthetics ), or changes in 
medications administered to the subject since Baseline Visit assessments (including an y 
blood product administered to the subject) and the u se of anticoagulants and any  neutralizing 
agent should also be recorded in detail including dose and time of administration.

connective tissue).
•If the subject presents with multiple appropriate bleeding sites, the TBS will be the larger 
or more clinicall y relevant site, as judged b y the investigator (surgeon) .
•If the subject does not have an identifiable TBS, the subject should be withdrawn from 
the study . The subject will be considered a screen failure as they  do not meet the intra -
operative criteria and will be treated according ly.
•The TBS will be the onl y site to be evaluated for hemostasis in this study .
At the time of surgery , the following will be performed:
•Verification of intra -operative inclusion and exclusion criteria.
•Recording of vital signs will be measured and recorded at the time of TBS identification ,

CONFIDENTIAL 13Statistical Methods:
Four analysis populations will be defined for efficacy  and safet y anal yses as follows:
The Intent -to-Treat ( ITT) population will include all subjects who are randomized, regardless 
of meeting intra- operative enrollment criteria and regardless of whether the I P was 
administered to the subject. 
The Modified ITT (m ITT) population will include all subjects in the ITT population who 
meet the intra -operative enrollment criteria, and thus tre ated with an y amount of I P.
The P er Protocol (PP) population will include all subjects in the mI TT population who do not 
have an ymajor protocol deviations (to be determined at a data review meeting prior to 
unblinding )which could impact the primary  efficacy  endpoint. 
The Safety population will include all subjects who receive an y amount of IP.
Primary  Efficacy  Anal yses
The efficacy anal yses will be performed using the mI TT population. Additionally , the 
primary  efficac y endpoint will be also analyzed using the PP population (if different from the 
mITT population). Forsensitivity  analy sis, the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be anal yzed 
using ITTpopulation. For subjects in both treatment groups in the ITT population who do not 
meet the intra -operative criteria and do not receive the study  treatment, they  will be deemed 
as not achieving hemostasis for the primary  efficacy  endpoint.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of hemostasis at TBS by  T4will be analy zed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by  [CONTACT_422351]  (i.e.,parench ymous 
versus soft tissue surgery).The ratio of the proportion of subjects meeting the primary  
efficacy  endpoint in the 2 treatment groups (FS Grifols relative to EVICEL) and its 2
-sided 
asymptotic 95% confidence interval ( CI) will be provided. The non- inferiority  will be 
deemed to have been demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI  exceeds 0.8. After the 
non-inferiorit y of FS Grifols to EVI CEL is established, its superiority  may  be additionally  
claimed if the 95% CI for the ratio is entirel y above 1. 
Secondary  Efficacy  Analy ses
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be analy zed by [CONTACT_422352] ( i.e., T 7and T10minutes). 
Exploratory  Efficac y Analy ses
Exploratory  efficacy  endpoints will be descriptively  summarized by  [CONTACT_1570]. The

Safety and Efficacy of Fibrin Sealant Grifols (FS Grifols) as an Adjunct to Haemostasis during Surgery in
Paediatric Subjects
Effective
CONFIDENTIAL 14Safety  Anal ysis
The safet y analyses will be based on the Safet y population. The safet y analy ses will be 
addressed b y listing and tabulation of AEs and will include suspected ADRs, vital signs, 
physical assessments, and clinical laboratory  tests. Data will be described using descriptive 
analyses.
Determination of Sample Size
The sample size of the study  was estimated to provide sufficient power (at least 80%) to 
demonstrate the hemostatic efficacy  of FS Grifols in parenchy mous and soft tissue surgery .
Assuming that the true response rate is 80% for the FS Grifols group, and 80% for the 
EVICEL group, it can be shown that a sample size of 172 subjects (86 subjects in the FS 
Grifols group and 86 subjects in the EVICEL group, with a 1:1 assignment ratio) would give 
a power of at least 80% to establish non- inferiority , with lower 95 % CI for the ratio of the 
proportion of subjects with hemostasis success b y 4 minutes in the 2 treatment groups 
(FSGrifols relative to EVI CEL) above 0.80.14 of 74

CONFIDENTIAL 23program consisted of three pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 clinical trials: I G1101 (vascular surgery ), IG1102 
(parench ymous surgery ), and IG1103 (soft tissue surgery ).
All [ADDRESS_533388] ingof 2 parts: a 
Preliminary  Part (I) and a Primary  Part (II). The purpose of the Preliminary Part (I) was to 
ensure that local study  teams familiarized themselves with the technique for FS Grifols 
application a nd with intraoperative procedures required by  [CONTACT_422354] . 
In stud y IG1101, all subjects enrolled in the Preliminary Part (I) were treated with FSGrifols
and in Primary Part (II) subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either FS Grifols or 
manual compression (MC), respectivel y. In studies IG1102 and IG1103, subjects were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups: FS Grifols solution 
or Surgicel®
oxidized cellulose pads.
In both parts of the clinical stud ies, subjects undergoing an elective (non -emergency ), open 
(non-laparoscopic), vascular (non- endovascular) surgical procedure (study  IG1101), 
parench ymous tissue ( i.e.,hepatic) surgical procedure (stud y IG1102), or soft tissue surgical 
procedure (stud y IG1103), wherein a target bleeding site ( TBS)was identified and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_422323], were initially eligible to participate.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for all 3 clinical trials was the proportion of subjects in the 
Primary  Part (II) of the study  achievin g hemostasis (Yes/No) at the TBS b y 4 minutes (T 4) 
following the start of treatment application (T Start), without occurrence of rebleeding and 
reapplication of stud y treatment after T 4and until the completion of the surgical closure by  
[CONTACT_422355] (T Closure ), brisk bleeding, and use of 
alternative hemostatic treatment after T Startand until T Closure .
The secondary  endpoints for all 3 clinical trials were the time to hemostasis (TTH) , the 
cumulative p roportion of s ubjects a chieving hemostasis at the TBS by  2 (T 2), 3 (T 3), 5 (T 5), 7 
(T7), and 10 (T 10)minutes after T Start(the T 2and T 3time points were not applicable to study  
IG1101) , and the prevalence of treatment failures.
In the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], approximately 500 subjects were treated with FS Grifols . The results 
from all 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_422324] 1101, IG1102, and IG1103 demonstrated that FS Grifols was 
effective, safe,and well tolerated as a local hemostatic agent in various surgery  types.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety of Fibrin Sealant Grifols in Pediatric Subjects in Studies IG1101, IG1102, 
and IG1103
Only  23pediatric subjects were evaluated in 2 of the 3 clinical trials. A total of 22 pediatric 
subjects were randomized in Preliminary  Part (I) of studies IG1102 a nd IG1103 and only  [ADDRESS_533389] was enrolled in Primary  Part ( II)in study  IG1103. No pediatric subjects were 
enrolled in Study  IG1101 as there is a low prevalence of pediatric subjects undergoing 
vascular surgery . For the pediatric subjects evaluated, there wereno unique safet y concern s.
Overall , 11pediatric subjects ranging from 3 to 16 y ears old were enrolled in the FS Grifols 
treatment group in clinical studies IG1102 and IG1103 . Similarly ,12 pediatric subjects were 
also enrolled in the Surgicel treatment group. 
Treatment -emergent AEs were summarized separately  for pediatric subjects ( ≤16 y ears of 
age) and for adults (>16 y ears of age). The small number of pediatric subjects and the large 
imbalance in 
the number of adult and pediatric subjects m akes a comparison of the TEAE 
incidence rates betwe en these subgroups difficult. Manyof the most frequent TEAEs 
reported in adults were either not reported in pediatric subjects or were reported in only  a 
single pediatric subject within a treatment group.
In addition, there were no major differences

2.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
2.3.1 Benefits
The data obtained through the three pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 studies I G1101, IG1102, and IG1103, 
provides substantial evidence of the efficacy /benefit of FSGrifols as an effective local 
hemostasis agent in surgery . The benefits of FS Grifols as an effective local hemostasis agent 
in surgery  include the following: 
Superiority  of FS Grifols relative to MC in Achieving Hemostasis in Vascular Surgery
(Study  IG1101)
The anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint indicated that t he rate of hemostasis at the TBS 
by T4in the FS Grifols treatment group in vascular surgery  was 76.1% , which was
statistically  and significantly  higher 
than the rate of hemostasis of 22.8% in the MC treatment 
group (p -value <0.001). This result demonstrated that FS Grifols is superior to MC in 
achieving hemostasis in vascular surgery .
The anal ysis of the secondary  endpoints provided further evidence that FS Grifols is superior 
to MC in achieving hemostasis. The results showed that FS Grifols is superior to MC in t he 
median TTH ( 4.0 minutes in the FS treatment group ver s us ≥10.0 minutes in the MC 
treatment group) (p-value <0.001).
FS Grifols was superior to MC in the rates of hemostasis at all time points evaluated (by  T5, 
T7, and T 10). In the FS Grifols treatment group, the rates of hemostasis at the TBS by  T5, T7, 
and T 10were 80.7%, 84.4%, and 88.1%, respectively . In the MC treatment group, the rates of 
hemostasis at the TBS b y T 5, T7, and T 10were 28.1%, 35.1%, and 45.6%, respectivel y. At 
each time point, t he rates of hemostasis were statistically  and significantl y higher in the 
FSGrifols treatment group compared to the MC treatment group (p -value <0.001).
In the Primary  Part (II) of the study , the rate of treatment failures was significantly  lower 
(p-value <0.001) in the FS Grifols treatment group ( 23.9% ) compare d tothe MC treatment 
group (77.2%). The estimated ratio of proportion of treatment failure in subjects receiving FS 
Grifols relative to MC was 0.309 ( 95% CI: 0.215, 0. 445).
Superiority  of FS Grifols Relative to Surgicel in Achieving Hemostasis in P arench ymous 
(Hepatic) Tissue Surgery (Study  IG1102)
The anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint indicated that the rate of hemostasis at the TBS 
by T4in the FS Grifols treatment group in parenchym ous (hepatic) tissue surgery  was 92.8%, 26 of 74

Non-inferiorit y of FS Grifols Relative to Surgicel in Achieving Hemostasis in Soft Tissue 
Surgery (Study  IG1103)
The anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint indicated that the rate of hemostasis at the TBS

receiving FS Grifols relative to Surgicel was 1.260 (95% CI : 1.048, 1.516), demonstrating 
that FS Grifols is superior to Surgicel by  T3.The rate of hemostasis at the TBS by  [CONTACT_941] T 2, T5, 
T7, and T 10time points was higher in the FS Grifols treatment group, but not statistically  
superior, as compared 
to the Surgicel treatment group .

Improved Safety  Profile
Similar marketed FS products have shown a good safet y profile for more than 25 years of use
(3,4). FS Grifols preparation has additional features that are designed to improve its safet y 
profile.
FS Grifols exclusively  contains non -
ruminant origin products. In subjects where preparations 
containing bovine thrombin had been used, inhibitory antibodies occurred against bovine 
thrombin and contaminating bovine factor V, with cross -reactivity  to human factor V, 
causing severe bleeding. Antibodies that cross -react with human thrombin may  promote 
thrombosis by  [CONTACT_422359] (5,6,7). Although 
such cases have not been observed, antibod y formation could theoreticall y occur after use of
human FSproducts. No immunogenicit y occurred from the treatment with FS Grifols ,
Surgicel ,orMC in studies I G1101, IG1102, and IG1103 .
Rare and serious complications associated with human FS products include cardiovascular 
collapse after use of FSproducts containing bovine thrombin on parench ymous organs and 
severe immune globulin E class
-mediated anaph ylactic reaction (8,9,10).
FS Grifols does not contain tranexamic acid. Fibrin sealant products used in neurosurgery  
shoul d not contain tranexamic acid since cerebral edema and seizures have occurred (11). 
2.3.2 Risks
Analy sis of 5 -year data of AEs associated with the use of other FSproducts (not including 
FSGrifols) showed that the incidence of AEs was 1 in every  98,933 applications. From a 
total of 16 suspected AEs, only  6 were related to FSproducts and were allergic/anaph ylactic 
responses (12).
Because FS Grifols is made from human plasma, it may  carry a risk of transmitting infectious 
agents. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been reduced b y screening plasma 
donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, b y testing for the presence of certain current 
viral infections, and b y incorporation in the production process of specific steps with 
validated (demonstrated) capacity  to inactivate and/or remove potential viral contaminations. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], such products may  still potentially  transmit disease. There is also the 
possibility  that unknown infectious agents may  be present in such products. In the three
pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 studies (IG1101, IG1102, and IG1103) , all enrolled subjects regardless of 
treatment assignments were monitored for potential transmission of hepatitis A virus ( HAV
), 
hepatitis B virus ( HBV ), hepatitis C virus ( HCV ), human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ), 
and parvovirus ( B19V ). No treatment- emergent viral infection was detected by  [CONTACT_422360] I G1101, IG1102, and IG1103.
Anaph ylactic/allergic reactions have occurred to aprotinin contained in FSproducts, 
especiall y after re -exposure. In such subjects, antibodies to aprotinin were found ( 13,14) . FS 
Grifols does not contain aprotinin. However, as with any  protein product, allergic t ype 28 of 74

include, but are not limited to, hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing,

hypersen sitivity  reactions were reported in the course of studies IG1101, IG1102 and 
IG1103, they  were considered either not related or unlikely  related to FS Grifols treatment .
Thromboembolic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur, and there is 
also a risk of anaph ylactic reaction if human plasma -derived FSis unintentionally  applied 
intravascularl y. 
Asummary  ofadverse drug reactions ( ADRs )can be found in the IB (1).

4minutes 
(T4) following T Start, additional amounts of FS Grifols may  have been applied at 
the TBS up to the maximum allowed volume of 12 mL (equivalent to the full content of 2 
FSGrifols kits), if necessary .
2.4.2 Justification for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products
In the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_328899], the safet y and efficacy of FS Grifols was shown in adult 
subjects (see Section 2.2). I n subjects randomized to the FS Grifols group, study  drug was 
applied to the 
TBS to sufficient lycover the intended application area b y a thin, even lay er. 
For every  subject, FS Grifols was administered by  [CONTACT_422361][INVESTIGATOR_33096] b y spray ing onto the TBS with 
the use of an applicator. Before application of FS Grifols to the TBS, the TBS should have 
been as dry  as possible. If FS Grifols was applied by  [CONTACT_422361][INVESTIGATOR_007], the tip of the applicator should 
have been kept as close to the tissue surface as possible without touching the tissue during 
application. If FS Grifols was applied b y spray ing, the recommended distance be tween the 
spray  applicator and the surface of the target area was [ADDRESS_533392] been regulated at a pressure of 15 psi (1 bar) to 25 psi (1.75 bar).
If the hemostatic effect was incomplete after T Startand before the primary  efficacy  endpoint 
assessment time point, T 4, additional amounts of FS Grifols may
 have been applied at the 
TBS up to the maximum allowed volume. It was recommended to remove accumulated blood 
from the surrounding tissues and the target area to be treated a ccording to normal practice in 
order to have a dry  field prior to application of FS Grifols ( e.g., by [CONTACT_422362], 
sponges, or sterile gauzes). These additional applications of FS Grifols may  have been done 29 of 74

2.[ADDRESS_533393] century . The 
concept of using plasma fibrinogen mixed with thrombin to form adhesive was reported over 
70 years ago ( 3). Commercial concentrates rich in clottable fibrinogen became available in 
Europe in the late 1970s. More recentl y, commercial FS products were also licensed for use 
in the U nited States (US) (2, 4, 15- 19). The intended benefits of FS application are to support 
local hemostasis and sutures, “glue” surfaces of injured tissues in order to obtain adaptation 
or sealing of surfaces, or improve repa ir or healing ( 4, 15- 18).
Fibrin Sealant products may  be used in a variet y of clinical situations and surgical fields, 
including but not limited to, cardiac and vascular surgery , thoracic surgery , neurosurgery , 
plastic and reconstruction surgery , gastrointestinal surgery , hepatic and splenic surgery , and 
dental surgery . Practical applications of FS products in orthopedic surgery , interventional 
radiology ,and minimally invasive endoscop y are growing ( 2, 4, 15-19).
Fibrin Sealant Grifols is a 2 -
component FS solution composed of purified sterile frozen 
solut ions of human fibrinogen and human thrombin with calcium chloride. The purification 
process of both components from human plasma is a procedure based on Cohn’s method; 
fibrinogen is obtained from Fraction I and thrombin is obtained from the supernatant of 
Fraction I ( 1). 
Nonclinical studies in animal models supported the safet y and efficacy  of FS Grifols in liver 
and vascular surgery  (1) and a clinical development plan was designed to assess the safet y 
and efficacy  of FS Grifols in the surgical setting as an adjunct to local hemostasis. FS 
products may  differ in their composition, application sets, and technique of use ( 20-23). 30 of 74

The study  treatments will be applied o n the cut parenchy mous surface of a solid organ 
(i.e.,liver) and in soft tissue (i.e., fat, muscle, or connective tissue).
A specific bleeding site will be defined as the TBS when it is determined by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator 
(the surgeon) that control of bleeding b y conventional surgical techniques (including suture, 
ligature ,and cautery ) is ineffective or impractical and requires an adjunct treatment to 
achieve hemostasis.
When the TBS is identified, the investigator will record the precise anatomical location of the 
TBS, rate the intensit y of the bleeding at the TBS (Grade 1- 4 according to the 5-point 
validated bleeding severity scale shown in Table 7

[IP_ADDRESS] FS Grifols
FS Grifols is a frozen, sterile, 2 -component FSsolution obtained from human plasma pools. 
FS Grifols consists of human fibrinogen (component 1) and human thrombin with calcium 
chloride (component 2) solutions filled in sy ringes, assembled on a s yringe holder. When 
applied, the solutions generate a cro ss-linked fibrin clot in a process that mimics the last 
stage of the human coagulation sy stem.
After thawing, the human fibrinogen and human thrombin solutions are clear or slightly  
opalescent and colorless or pale yellow. FS Grifols does not contain an y preservatives.
The human fibrinogen solution contains:
•Human fibrinogen: 80 mg/mL solution
•Other ingredients: sodium citrate, sodium chloride, arginine, L- isoleucine, L -glutamic 
acid monosodium, and water for injection (WFI) .
The human thrombin solution co ntains:

fibrinog en and thrombin travel through the cannula without making contact [CONTACT_422368]. To drip, the spray tip is unscrewed from the threaded connector at the distal end of 
the device. As the plungers of the s yringe holder are depressed, the fibrinogen and thrombin 
solutions travel through the device in separate lumens and do not mix until after they exit the 
threaded connector. In spray  mode, the 
dual applicator mixes the fibrinogen and thrombin in

The BAC2 and thrombin components appear as white to slightly  yellowish opaque masses 
when frozen and as clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly  yellowish solutions 
when thawed. The components contain no preservatives.
BAC2 is a sterile solution consisting mainly of a concentrate of human fibrinogen; the
protein from human blood that forms a clot when combined with thrombin. The composition 
of the BAC2 solution is as follows:
Active ingredient: Concentrate of human fibrinogen (55 -85 mg/ mL)
Other Ingredients: Arginine hy drochloride, gl ycine, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, calcium 
chloride, and WFI.
Thrombin is a sterile solution containing purified human thrombin that activates clotting of 
the final combined product. Thrombin is a specific protease that transforms the fibrinogen 
contained in BAC2 into fibrin. The composition of the thrombin solution is as follows:
Active Ingredient: Human thrombin (800
-1200 IU/ mL)
Other Ingredients: Calcium chloride, human albumin, mannitol, sodium acetate, and WFI.

performed. Subject number and date of birth will be recorded in the Subject Screening Log. 
If a subject is ineligible for participation, their demographic data and specific reason for 
ineligibility  will be captured in the subject’s source documents and eCRF.
The Screening Visit assessments and activ ities will include:
•Allocation of s ubject number
•Adding subjec t’s data into the Screening Log
•Documentation of demographics: year of birth, age at randomization (number of years, 
number of months) , sex,race, and ethn icity
•Documentation of the medical and surgical history for the last 12 months
•Documentation of the lifetime history  for the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_422334] (including inquiry  into previous surgery  and trauma epi[INVESTIGATOR_422335] )
•Documentation of medications that the subject is taking or has taken within the last 3 
months (it includes transfusion of bloo d or an y blood -derived product)
•Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject eligibility
•Type of intervention
•Age group : (Adolescents (12 t o 17 y ears); Children (2 to 11 y ears) ; Infants and toddlers 
(28 day s to 23 months) orPreterm (up to gestational age <37 weeks) and term newborn 
infants (0 to 27 day s)
If suitable due to logistic reasons, procedures scheduled at the Screening Visit may  be 
performed during the B aseline Assessments Visit (see S ection [IP_ADDRESS]), i.e., within 24 hours 
prior to the surgical procedure. In this case, the Screening Visit will be combined with the 
Baseline Assessments Visit. Assessments required during both visits (Screening and

If the nature of the bleeding from the parench ymous or soft tissue isGrade 3 (severe) , the 
surgeon may use standard conventional surgical techniques ( e.g., cautery , sutures, clips, 
or ligation) again in order to control the bleeding. If t he nature of the bleeding becomes
Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate ) once those primary  hem ostatic measures are taken, 
the subject may be considered eligible for enrollment. If t he nature of the bleeding 
becomes

Hemostasis at the TBS will be assessed b y the investigator (surgeon) at T4, T7, andT10. 
Hemostasis is defined as an absence/cessation of bleeding (Grade 0) at the TBS 
according to the investigator’s (the surgeon’s) ju dgment, so that the surgical closure of 
the exposed field could begin.
In order to facilitate the observation of hemostasis, investigators should remove an y 
excess of accumulated blood around the TBS area by  [CONTACT_422379][INVESTIGATOR_1516]/suction and/or 
gentle spongin g with the edge of a sterile pad, for instance.
Rebleeding isdefined as Grade ≥1 bleeding from the TBS that require sfurther 
hemostatic intervention ( e.g., manual pressure) after hemostasis ispreviously  achieved at 
the TBS. If the TBS reble edsbut cessat ion of rebleeding isagain achieved at a later time

8.3.3 Adverse Event Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
have a causal re lationship with this administration . An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not consider ed 
related to the medicinal product.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Reactions
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered suspected 
ADRs . The phrase “responses to a medi cinal 
product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or study  treatment and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility . A suspected ADR with a causal relationship of 
“definite ly” will be labeled as an AR; thus, ARs are a subset of su spected ADRs.
8.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Event
The i
nvestigator is required to provide a causalit y assessment for each AE reported to the 
sponsor . The sponsor will consider the investigator ’s causality  assessment and also provide
its own assessment . 54 of 74

Paediatric Subjects
Effective
CONFIDENTIAL 55Causal relationship to the study  drug will be established according to medical judgment on 
whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the AE and 
study treatment administration :
The investigator must determine and classify the AE causalit y according to the following 
categories:
Unrelated /Not related :there is no t areasonable possibility  of causal relationship between 
the AE and the stud y treatment.
Possibly related: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship betwee n the study  
treatment and the AE.
Definitively related: there is a reason to conclude that the study  treatment caused the AE.
Criteria to assess the 
causal relationship should take into account of the following conditions: 
1.a plausible temporal sequence from the study  treatment administration to the AE onset; 
6.whether the event follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; 
7.whether the AE could be reasonabl y explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
comorbidit ies, or concomitant medications, as well as 
8.
the occurrence of improvement on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/reducing the treatment (positive 
dechallenge) and/or reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (positive 
rechallenge).
For expedited safety  reporting purposes, AEs assessed as ei ther “definitively  related” or 
“possibly  related” will be considered just RELATED or POTENTIALLY REL ATED .
8.3.5 Severity of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
Adverse event s and suspected ADRs will be classified depending on their severit y according 
to the following definitions:
Mild : the subject is aware of signs or s ymptoms causing minimum discomfort but no 
disruption of usual daily  activities consistent with what would be expected in an uneventful 
postoperative course
Moderate : the AE is sufficiently  discomforting to the subject that it interferes with usual 
daily  activities consistent with what would be expected in an uneventful postoperative course 
(disturbing)
Severe : due to the AE, the subject is unable to perform usual daily activities consistent with 
what would be expected in an uneventful postoperative course (prevents)
AE and suspected ADR severit y gradation must be distinguished from AE and suspected 
ADR seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event consequen ce. For example, 
headache can be mild, moderate ,or severe but not necessarily  serious in all these cases.55 of 74

CONFIDENTIAL 61For summary  purpose, AEs will be classified as TEAEs or non -treatment -emergent AEs 
(non-TEAEs) depending on the comparison of AE onset date/time with the start date/time of

Safety and Efficacy of Fibrin Sealant Grifols (FS Grifols) as an Adjunct to Haemostasis during Surgery in
Paediatric Subjects
Effective
CONFIDENTIAL 629.2 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size of the study  was estimated to provide sufficient power (at least 80%) to 
demonstrate the hemostatic efficacy  of FS Grifols in parench ymousand soft tissue surgery .
Assuming that the true response rate is 80% for the FS Grifols group and 80% for the 
EVICEL group, it can be shown that a sample size of 172 subjects (86 subjects in the FS 
Grifols treatment group and 86 subjects in the EVICEL  treatment group, with a 1:1 
assignment ratio) would give a power of at least 80% to establish non- inferio rity, with lower 
95% CI  for the ratio of th
e proportion of subjects with h emostasis success by  4 minutes in the 
2treatment groups (FS Grifols relative to EVICEL) above 0.80 ( 25-27).
The approximate number of subjects planned to be randomized according to age range will 
be as follows: 
-Adolescents (12 
to 17 years): up to 100, and not less than 50
-Children (2 to 11 years): up to 100, and not less than 
50
-Infants and toddlers (28 day s to 23 months): up to100, and not less than 16
-Preterm (up to gestational age <37 weeks) a nd term newborn infants (0 to27 day s): 
up to 10
In case an y of the age subgroups mentioned above is underrepresented when the target of 172 
enrolled 
(treated) subjects is met, the sponsor may allow over -enrollment of few additional 
subjects (i.e., not more than 10additional subjects) bey ond this figure in the specific age 
subgroup.
9.3 Procedure for A ccounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
Unless otherwise noted, if an observation is missing at a specific scheduled visit/time point, 
the value at that visit should not be imputed and should be reported as “missing”. Hemostasis 
assessment is an exception. A missing hemostasis assessment at an y scheduled time point 
will be deemed not to have achieved hemostasis at that specific time point only .
9.4 Reporting Deviation sfrom the S tatistical Analysis Plan
The detailed statistical analy sis methodologies will be documented in the SAP.If there are 
any deviations from the originall y planned anal yses in the SAP , they  will be fully  described 
and justified in the protocol amendment(s) and/or final Clinical St udy Report.

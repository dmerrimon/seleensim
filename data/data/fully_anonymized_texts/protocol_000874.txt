Recruitment. As in previous studies, we will recruit persons with 
stroke from the Greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky area by 
[CONTACT_70985][INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
physicians and support groups and by [CONTACT_70986] >300 local persons with stroke who are interested in 
participating in research. Clinician referrals can be done in two 
ways: 1) the clinicians may provide our name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_70987]; 2) if the potential subject 
verbally approves, the clinician can give us their name [CONTACT_13255] [CONTACT_3031].  
 
For persons interested in participating, we will further explain the 
study, confirm initial eligibility and perform informed consent. 
After a research staff member explains the purpose of study and 
the consent, potential participants  will be given at lea st [ADDRESS_77321] 
understands the study before consenting.  The consent  form also 
includes a HIPAA authorization.    
 
Eligibility Criteria . Based on our research experience, previous 
studies and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 
guidelines,3 we wil l observe the following eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria : 1) age 30 -90 years; 2) unilateral 
stroke experienced >6 months prior to enrollment in middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with out complete 
disruption of the putamen on the lesion side ;4 3) walking speed <1.0 m/s on the [ADDRESS_77322];5,6 4) able to 
walk 10m over ground with assistive devices as needed and no physical assistance.7 Exclusion criteria : 1) MRI 
incompatibility (e.g. metallic or electronic implants, severe claustrophobia); 2) inability to perform mental 
imagery (time dependent motor imagery screening test [TDMI]);8,9 3) evidence of significant arrhythmia or 
myocardial ischemia on treadmill ECG stress test , or significant baseline ECG abnormalities that would make 
an exercise ECG uninterpretable ;3 4) recent (<3 months) cardiopulmonary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 5) unable to 
communicate with investigators or correctly answer consent comprehension questions;  6) significant ataxia or 
neglect (score of 2 o n NIH stroke scale item 7 or 11);10 7) severe lower extremity (LE) spasticity (Ashworth 
>2);11 8) recent (<3 months) illicit drug or alcohol abuse or significant mental illness; 9 ) major post -stroke 
depression (PHQ -9 ≥10)12 in the absence of management of the depression by a health care provider (either 
anti-depressant medication or psychotherapy);  10) participating in physical therapy or a nother interventional 
research study; 11) recent (<3 months) paretic LE botulinum toxin injection; 12) concurrent progressive 
neurologic disorder or other major medical, orthopedic or peripheral vascular conditions that would limit 
improvement; 13) pregnan cy. 
 
Screening. After informed consent, subjects will undergo a screen including: medical record review, a history 
and physical, a depression screen (PHQ -9),12 stroke-specific testing of mental imagery ability (TDM I),8,9 
aphasia screening (Western Aphasia Battery Screening Test13), a motor impairment assessment (Fugl -
Page 3 
 Meyer14), a 10m walk test ,5,15 a resting ECG, a treadmill screening test15 and a stroke -specific treadmill ECG 
stress test16 to confirm eligibility and to obtain baseline characteristics and potential cofactors.   
 
Stress testing will be performed, according to published guidelines,3,17,18 by [CONTACT_70988], experienced clinical 
staff of the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70980] (UH -CSL), with assistance from a licensed 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_70981]. Subjects will wear a harness secured to an  overhead support system for 
safety in case of loss of balance (not for body weight support). ECG and vitals will be monitored according to 
published guidelines.3,17,[ADDRESS_77323] 
will be conducted without oxygen uptake (VO2) measurement to maximize subject communication and 
comfort.[ADDRESS_77324] is done and found to be 
negative.  
 
The Locomotor HIT Intervention  was developed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]. Subjects  will train 45 minutes, 3 times per 
week for 4 weeks. A h arness connected to an overhead support system will be used for fall protection (not 
weight support) during all treadmill walking and subjects will be closely guarded by a licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_70982]. Each training session will consist of a 3 minute wa rm up (30 -50% HR reserve), [ADDRESS_77325].  One or more activit y monitor(s)  (see clinical Outcome Testing below) and a heart rate monitor will 
be worn during training sessions to characterize and monitor training intensity.  
 
Clinical Outcome Testing  will be done before and after the [ADDRESS_77326] approximately 2 hours and may include 
the following  measures : 
 
Walking speed  is the gold standard measure of post -stroke walking function that reflects overall mobility19-21 
and health status.22 It is r eliable and valid after stroke.23,24 Walking speed w ill be captured with a stopwatch 
and/or wit h the GaitRITE, a commercially available [ADDRESS_77327] 
and/or GaitRITE , using assistive devices, orthotics and guarding  as needed . Each  test may be performed 
twice at comfortable speed and twice as fast as  safely possible.  Comfortable walking speed will be the 
primary clinical outcome measure.   
 
The 6-minute walk test involves walking back and  forth around two cones , using assistive devices, 
orthotics, guarding and rest breaks as needed.[ADDRESS_77328]  involves holding  up to 5 standing positions for 50 seconds each 
(http://www.nihtoolbox.org/WhatAndWhy/Motor/Balance/Pages/Balance.aspx ). The sequence is: eyes 
Page [ADDRESS_77329] provides raw scores and age adjusted scores using national normative data.  Elements of the NIH 
Toolbox  Cognit ion B attery  (http://www.nihtoolbox.org/WhatAndWhy/Cognition/Pages/default.aspx ) may 
also be used.  
   
The metabolic cost of gait  is assessed using  oxygen consumption rate ( VO2) measurement during quiet 
sitting followed by [CONTACT_70989]2 measurement during treadmill walking at comfortable speed .[ADDRESS_77330]’s individualized fastes t safe speed. Increases in speed and/or 
grade will be used to gradually increase the workload to find each subject’s peak exercise capacity.[ADDRESS_77331] period, subjects may complete a verification 
phase to determine whether maximum physiologic capacity (a true VO 2-max) was  reached.[ADDRESS_77332] as possible for approximately 3 minutes. VO 2 
data will be examined for a plateau, which would indicate VO 2-max.32  
 
Daily physical activity  assessment involves wearing a n activity monitor continuously during waking hours 
for ≥3 days  and recording sleep/wake times .33-36 The monitor(s) will be worn around the non -paretic ankle 
and/or on the wrist or in a pocket. This monitor ing records the number of steps taken and patterns of 
walking activity , and up loads data to computer software for anal ysis.  
 
The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ -10) involves having the participant perform 5 
different movements followed by [CONTACT_70990]. The participant is asked to rate the 
clarity of the visual imagery and the intensity of the imagined sensations for each movement on separate 5 
point scales. The KVIQ -10 has been shown to be reliable and valid for persons with stroke.37  
 
The Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale  is a reliable and valid self -report quantitative survey that 
includes up to 53  questions about quality of life related to stroke  and was designed to maximize response 
feasibility for persons with and without aphasia .38,39  
 
The Global Rating of Change (GROC)40 is a questionnaire that assesses overall impressions of change in 
health status from the perspective of the participant . The GROC is a 15 point ordinal scale with −7 
indicating “a very great deal worse,” 0 indicating “no change,” a nd +7 indicating “a very great deal better”. 
The GROC is not applicable at baseline testing because it measures change only.   
 
Brain Imaging Procedures  
Like clinical outcomes, brain imaging will be performed before and after the 4 -week control period and after the 
locomotor HIT intervention  for subjects with stroke . All scans will be performed on a 3.0T MRI  system  in the 
Imaging Research Center at CCHMC . Each imaging session will involve approximately one hour of brain 
scanning. During scanning, subjec ts will be positioned in a custom scaffold  to stabilize the body and control leg 
movement . Initial alignment scans will be performed, followed by h igh-resolution anatomical scans , diffusion 
scans, functional scans and perfusion  scans . The functional scans will be focused on the assessment of brain 
activation during imagined walking,41,42 knee extension43,44 and cognitive tasks . These tasks may  involve 
Page 5 
 presentation of visual or auditory stimuli  and subj ects may be asked to respond by [CONTACT_70991], a cognitive task or by [CONTACT_70992]-press . Subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_70993].  Subjects will also practice task condition s prior to brain imaging.  
 
Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
Each study visit, subject voluntary reporting of AEs will be encouraged and AEs of interest will be specifically 
queried  for subjects with stroke , including: falls, orthopedic injuries, faintness, new /increased pain and muscle 
soreness. During clinical testing and training sessions, subjects will also have monitoring and post -session 
questioning to identify any signs or symptoms of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], new/worsening neurological 
impairments  or orthopedic injury.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
 
Clinical Trial Hypothes es. From PRE -[ADDRESS_77333], subjects will exhibit a significant increase in walking speed 
(primary hypothesis ) and other outcomes  (secondary hypotheses) .  
 
Statistical Analysis. A mixed effects  general  linear model will be used with the outcome of interest (e.g. 
walking speed) as the dependent variable, a fixed (categorical) effect for time (PRE -1, PRE -2, POST)  and an 
unstructured covariance matrix to account  for repeated measures within the same participant. Hypotheses will 
be tested by [CONTACT_70994] -[ADDRESS_77334] reliability  and the a bsence of spontaneous changes  
during the control period.

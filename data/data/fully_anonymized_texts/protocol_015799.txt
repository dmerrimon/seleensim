PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Reducing the Transition from Acute to Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain 
among Older Adults (BETTER from Pain)  
Funder  NIH National Institute on Aging  
Clinical Phase  Phase III  
Study Rationale  The NIH has identified reducing the transition from acute to chronic 
musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_385509].  The most common site of care for older adults 
with acute MSP is the emergency department (ED); ~9 million adults ≥[ADDRESS_482298] of these 
patients are discharged home, 10 -25% of discharged patients transition 
to chronic MSP, and these patients are at risk for functional decline and long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Interventions are urgently needed to prevent this 
transition, reduce suffering, and maintain independence.
 
Effective treatment of acute MSP can reduce progression to chronic MSP 
in older adults but  is often not achieved for two major reasons. First, 
education on the use of commonly used  analgesics is rarely provided, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_385510]-related adverse e vents are 
common (e.g.,  constipation, falls, addiction ). Second, recovery-promoting 
behaviors are rarely discussed by [CONTACT_39487], despi[INVESTIGATOR_385511].  
Therefore, we have developed an  intervention to address these gaps 
which uses an educational video, telecare, and communication with a patient’s primary care provider to improve patient education regarding 
medication use and recovery -promoting behaviors. 
Study Objective(s) Primary  
• To determine the effectiveness of two shared decision-making 
(SDM), ED-based interventions (full intervention and video -only) 
compared to usual care in reducing the transition from acute to chronic MSP in older adults  
Secondary  
• To test the efficacy of two SDM intervention s in reducing long -term 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_385512]  
• To assess the mechanisms by [CONTACT_385545] ( why are they effective or ineffective?)  
• To compare the cost- effectiveness of a full SDM -based intervention 
and a video-only intervention for managing acute MSP relative to usual care  
[ADDRESS_482299] Article(s)  
 • Video: ~15-minute interactive video focused on education related to 
acute pain management strategies  
• Telecare: ~1 5-minute follow-up phone call by a nurse occurring 48 -72 
hours after the ED visit to assess patient’s pain management 
strategies and provide recommendations  
• Primary Care Provide (PCP) Communication:  s ummary of patient’s  
ED visit and telecare call will be provided to patient’s PCP  
Study Design  This is a three -arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial.  
Subject Population 
Key Criteria for Inclusion 
and Exclusion:  Inclusion Criteria  
1. ED patients age [ADDRESS_482300]’s participation will last [ADDRESS_482301] 5 years. 
Study Phases  
Screening  
Study Treatment Follow -Up   1. Screening:  screening for eligibility, obtaining consent and  HIPPA 
agreement will occur over the phone at the time of enrollment  
2. Baseline: da ta collection will occur for subjects in all arms of the 
study over the phone within 24 hours of their ED or OrthoNow 
visit  
3. Randomization: s ubjects wil l be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 
study arms  at enrollment  
4. Intervention:   
a. an educational video shown to subjects in the full and video -
only intervention arms of the study  
b. telecare phone call ~48  -72 hours  after s tudy  enrollment for 
subjects in the full intervention group  
c. PCP communication  for subjects in the full intervention 
group  
5. Fo llow up: data collection will occur via phone interview for 
subjects in all arms of the study at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 
months  
Efficacy Evaluations  The Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form ( BPI-SF), which uses 11 questions 
each assessed on a 0 -10 scale measures patient’s pain severity and pain 
interference over the past week . The BPI-SF will be used to assess 
intervention efficacy. An average score will be cal culated from the 
patients’ answers to [ADDRESS_482302] an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
controlling for  site type (emergency department vs. urgent care)  index 
visit pain  severity, age, gender, race, medical comorbidities  (as the Gagne 
score) , baseline intermittent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], a history of chronic pain, and 
access to a PCP. This model will include all BPI -SF average  scores (1, 3, 
and 6) as outcomes , will include fixed effects for group, time, and group-
by-time , as well as all of the control variables,  and will use an 
unstructured covariance matrix for the error terms. We will specify a 6 
degrees of freedom (df) linear contrast to test the overall null hypothesis 
of no mean difference in BPI -SF score at any follow-up visit across the 3 
groups at the 5% significance level. If the overall null hypothesis is rejected, we will then conduct separate 3 df contrasts to compare each of 
the intervention groups with the control group using a Bonferroni -
adjusted 2.5% significance level. We will estimate mean pairwise 
differences along with 95% confidence intervals at each time point. 
Missing BPI-SF data will be ignored for the primary comparison. The 
primary analysis will be conducted using the intention -to-treat ( ITT) 
population but wi ll also be repeated using the per  protocol (PP ) 
population.  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan  Please see separate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Briefly, a Safety 
Officer ([CONTACT_385566]) will review the protocol and interventions prior to initiating the study. The Safety Officer  (SO)  will also 
review adverse events. Criteria and procedures for recording adverse events are described in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
The NIH has identified reducing the transition from acute to chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and reducing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_385513].1-[ADDRESS_482303] common site of care for older adults with 
acute MSP is the emergency department (ED); ~9 million adul ts ≥[ADDRESS_482304] of these patients are discharged home, 10 -25% of discharged patients transition to 
chronic MSP, and these patients are at risk for functional decline6-[ADDRESS_482305] that individual contraindications to specific medicines frequently exist14,15 and substantial 
medication -related adverse events are common (e.g., constipation16, falls4,16,17, addiction9,18). Second, recovery -
promoting behaviors are rarely discussed by [CONTACT_39487], despi[INVESTIGATOR_385514].19-[ADDRESS_482306] developed a simple, scalable intervention that addresses these gaps. The intervention addresses 
knowledge about analgesics and encourages recovery -promoting behaviors using a shared decision -making 
(SDM) approach. SDM offers an ideal clinical approach for older adults with acute MSP because (1) multiple 
treatment options exist, (2) patient experiences, values, and preferences should inform their MSP treatment 
decisions, (3) most decisions regarding MSP management occur after the ED visit and reflect a mix of physician 
advice and patient choice, and (4) observational studies indicate SDM is associated with improved recovery for 
ED patients with MSP.
13,24 
 Patients will be recruited and enrolled from emergency departments at UNC  Medical Center in Chapel Hill, 
Hillsborough,  and UNC REX Healthcare.  Patients will also be enrolled from UNC OrthoNow clinics  in Chapel Hill, 
NC.  Eligibility screening, baseline data, intervention, and social support data will be collected over the phone 
within 24 hours of the patient’s acute care visit . Telecare and follow -up data collection at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 
months  after discharge  will oc cur by [CONTACT_648].  
 
1.2 Name [CONTACT_385562] , Brief Educational Tool t o Enhance Recovery (BETTER from Pain), in 
addition to telecare and primary care provider (PCP communication).  
BETTER from Pain Vide o: A ~1 5-minute  interactive  educational video s ent to  patients via email or text 
after study baseline questions are completed. Patients watch the video within 24 hours of their acute care visit.  The video provides information about acute pain management strategies that can be used at 
home including medications (aceta minophen, NSAIDs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) and behaviors (sleep, staying active, 
relaxation, and social support ).  
Telecare:  A ~15-minute protocol -guided  phone call from  a research nurse ~48-72 hours after the 
patient’s  enrollment in the study . Telecare is designed t o assess the patient’s pain severity and 
interference with daily activities, review analgesic  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_385515], review recovery-
promoting behaviors  discussed in the video (sleep, staying active, relaxation, and social support), discuss 
adjustments to the patient’s treatment, and link the patient to PCP follow -up.  
9 
 PCP Communication:  The research nurse will provide a summary of the ED /OrthoNow  visit and telecare 
call to the patient’s primary care provider (PCP) in order to convey information about the patient’s 
condition and treatment plan with the intent of supporting a transition of care . Patients without a PCP 
provider will be provided resources for one. 
 
This study entails two intervention groups: Full intervention  and video -only intervention. The Full intervention 
group will receive all three components of the intervention (video + telecare + PCP communication) while the 
video-only group will only receive the video . 
  
1.3 Non -Clinical and Clinical Study Findings  
Potential Benefits : It is our hypothesis that older adults that receive  video education and telecare regarding 
effective and safe pharmacologic and non -pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385516] 6 months  than patients viewing the video -only; video -only  patients will have less pain than usual care 
patients. If this study establishes the value of the video plus/minus telecare , this information may be used to 
improve emergency care for patients with acute MSP by [CONTACT_385546], reducing side 
effects, and potential ly reducing long- term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Patients that receive the video education intervention 
plus telecare  may potentially benefit due to an increased understanding of the effective and safe use of 
pharmacologic and non- pharmac ologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385517] . Whether and to what extent there is a benefit 
is unknown, which is the reason for the study.  
 
Potential Risks: T his trial entails interventions to support shared decision-making between provider and patients 
to enhance reco very for older patients with acute MSP . As such, the risks to subjects participating in the study 
are low. However, the risk of breach of confidentiality exists because human subjects are giving personal 
information. The following steps have been taken to minimize this risk. Research personnel collecting data will 
have completed all required CITI trainings, including Good Clinical Practice. R esearch activit ies and follow -up 
data collection will occur in areas where the conversation with the patient cannot be overheard by [CONTACT_2312].  
Follow-up data will be collected via phone interviews in a private setting  and entered directly into REDCap . 
When conducting analyses, only de-identified data will be downloaded from REDCap. The UNC REDCap data 
system meets or exceeds all NIH security requirements. A ny paper documents associated with the study will be 
destroyed 3 years after the completion of the study. D e-identified data from the study will be made publicly 
available within 12 months of study completion and archived on the Open Science Framework.  
 C
ompleting the baseline and follow -up interviews may be inconvenient for some respondents, but it requires 
approximately 2 0 minutes of their time for each interview. Viewing the video takes approximately 15 minutes, 
thus, patients randomized to view the video will spend about 35 minutes engaged in these study activities.  
 
The consent process will describe these risks and is designed to ensure comprehension prior to patient 
enrollment. Patients will also be informed that 1) participation is voluntary and will not affect any medical  care 
they receive, and 2) they may choose not to answer any questions for an y reason and can withdraw from the 
study at any point.  
  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE S  
2.1 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this project is to test the efficacy of this intervention to reduce the 
transition from acute to chronic MSP and reduce long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_385518]. The 
primary outcome will be pain, measured using the 11 -item Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form ( BPI-SF), assessed 
longitudinally over the course of 6 months following the ED /OrthoNow  visit ( i.e., at 1, 3, and 6 months).  
 
10 
 2.2 Secondary Objective: Secondary outcomes will include individual components of the BPI -SF (at 1, 3, and 6  
months  for longitudinal analysis ), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], physical function, and overall health at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; 
analgesic side e ffects at 1 week and 1 month; and healthcare utilization through 6 and 12 months. The long-term 
goal of this work is to identify and implement effective interventions into clinical care to improve outcomes for 
older adults with acute musculoskeletal pain.  
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN (brief overview)   
3.[ADDRESS_482307] and analysis of an assessor -blinded three-arm 
randomized controlled trial  and includes the following study phases:  
Screening:  s creening for eligibility, obtaining consent and HIP AA agreement will occur within 24 hours of 
 the ED/OrthoNow visit.  
Baseline: data collection will occur for subjects in all arms of the study over the phone within 24 hours of  
the ED/OrthoNow visit.  
Randomization:  s ubjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study arms : full intervention, video -only 
intervention, and usual care. 
Intervention:  vi deo intervention will occur  within 24 hours of the acute care  visit for subjects assigned to 
the full and vi deo-only intervention. Telecare will occur via phone call ~48  hour s – [ADDRESS_482308]’s enrollment  for those in the full intervention arm . Communication with PCP will occur after 
telecare for subjects in the full intervention arm. 
Follow up: data collection will occur via phone interview for subjects in all arms of the study at 1 week, 
1, 3, 6, and 12  months . 
3.2 Allo cation to Treatment  Groups and Blinding  
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: f ull intervention, vi deo-only, an d usual care. 
Assignment will occur via 1:1:1 randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_363407] a PCP  (patients with and without access to 
a PCP within 2 weeks of study enrollment) and age (50 -64 and over 65).  The randomization sequence will be 
generated in SAS, vers ion 9.4, using computer -generated random numbers. The original randomization program 
will be  written by [CONTACT_385547]; however, the study Data Manager will change the randomization 
program seed and then use the program to generate the final ra ndomization lists in order to keep the Principal 
Statistician blinded to true treatment group until after the primary analyses have been programmed. Primary 
analyses will initially be programmed using dummy treatment codes to maintain blinding. The generat ed 
randomization lists will be imported into REDCap’s integrated randomization module.  
 
Anyone who conducts the study enrollment call and randomizes the patient or who becomes unblinded to the participant ’s treatment arm will not conduct follow -up calls.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_482309]’s participation lasting 12 months . The targeted 
enrollment goal is 400 subjects with ~133 subjects randomized to each study arm.    
3.4 Study Population 
11 
 Four hundred  patients aged 50 years and older presenting to UNC ED s or OrthoNow clinics with acute MSP  will 
be recruited for the study. Subjects will be recruited from all gender/race/ethnic groups. The video intervention 
is presented in English via an oral format and uses graphics with written text to emphasize key points. In 
addition, data measures are in English and will be collected via interview with subjects. As a result, patients who are unable to read or speak English or have difficulty seeing or hearing will not be included in the study.   
 
Inclusionary Criteria  
• ≥50 years of age  
• primary complaint of acute MSP  
• if in the ED, discharge to home is anticipated  
• average pain score ≥4 (0-10 scale) since pain onset  
 
Exclusionary Criteria 
• patient does not speak English  
• primary pain located in the head, chest, or abdomen  
• pain due to ischemia, infection, or some other cause not due to MSP (blood clot, kidney stone, etc.)  
• primary pain due to self -injury 
• patient is critically ill dete rmined by [CONTACT_385548] [ADDRESS_482310]
25  
• diagnosis of somatoform disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or bipolar disorder  
• patient is a prisoner  or in police custody  
• self-reported daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_354979] 2 weeks prior to the acute care visit 
• resides in a nursing home or is homeless  
• at-risk alcohol use26 
• speech, hearing, vision problems  
• cognitively impaired (6 -item Brief Screener)27 
• nonworking phone number (follow -up occurs via phone calls)  
 
*Note: It is possible that a small number of patients with pain thought to be musculoskeletal will be  enrolled in 
the study but later found to have non -MSP ; they will remain in the study. Similarly, patients who had access to a 
technological device to watch the video, but who do not watch the video within 24 hours  of their acute care visit  
will also remain in the study.  The primary analysis will be of the  intention-to -treat population . Thus, all subjects, 
including those with non -MSP , those who do not watch the video within 24 hours of their visit,  or those who are 
later found to meet any other exclusionary criteria, will be included in the primary analysis . We will also define a 
priori a per-protocol analysis that excludes patients  who were enrolled but later found to meet exclusionary 
criteria.    
4 STUDY PROCEDURES (what will be done)  
4.1 Recruitment   
Recruitment Screening:  Recruitment will occur via a two -step process. In the first step, potential subjects will be 
identified for recruitment using the electronic health record (EHR) to determine if they meet the initial  
recruitment criteria . Patients who meet all recruitment inclusionary criteria and do not meet any of the 
exclusionary criteria will be contact[CONTACT_385549]. No further recruitment will occur for patients who are not eligible based on the criter ia obtained from the 
EHR.  
Recruitment Inclusionary Criteria  from EHR  
12 
 • ≥50 years of age  
• primary complaint of acute MSP  
• discharge from ED to home is anticipated  
 
Recruitment Exclusionary Criteria  from EHR  
• language other than  English  
• primary pain located in the head, chest, or abdomen  
• pain due to ischemia, infection, or some other cause not due to MSP (blood clot, kidney stone, etc.)  
• primary pain due to self -injury 
• patient is critically ill determined by [CONTACT_385548] 1 in the ED tracking boar d25  
• diagnosis of somatoform disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or bipolar disorder  
• patient is a prisoner  
 
4.2 Eligibility Screening Interview:  The second step of the recruitment process, entails an eligibility screening 
interview and will occur for patients meeting the initial recruitment criteria noted above. Patients will be 
contact[CONTACT_3012] w ithin [ADDRESS_482311] the eligibility screening interview. The inclusionary/exclusionary 
criteria addressed in the interview is noted be low:  
Inclusionary Criteria Assessed via Screening Interview  
• average pain score ≥4 (0-10 scale) since pain onset  
 
Exclusionary Criteria  Assessed via Screening Interview  
• self-reporte d daily  opi[INVESTIGATOR_354979] 2 weeks prior to the acute care visit 
• resides in a nursing home or is homeless  
• at-risk alcohol use26 
• speech, hearing, vision problems  
• cognitively impaired (6 -item Brief Screener)27 
• no internet connection needed to watch the video   
 
There may be additional reasons a potential subject is deemed ineligible that we have not anticipated. As a 
result, we will consider for exclusion anything that, in the op inion of the research screener or investigator, 
would place the patient at increased risk or preclude the potential subject’s full compliance with or completion 
of the study.   
 The eligibility screening interview will be completed in full even if a subject  meets an exclusion criterion. These 
data will be retained in order to help track and characterize patients who pass/fail the eligibility screening stage of the study.  
 Patients not meeting eligibility screening criteria will be informed they do not meet the criteria for the study and 
recruitment/screening activities will end. Patients meeting criteria for the study will be informed if they are 
eligible and the consent process will begin. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_482312] the baseline interview questionnaire 
during  the same enrollment call. D ata collection will entail questionnaires and data abstracted from the 
13 
 patient’s medical record. The questionnaires will be administered in an interview  format . Data abstracted from 
the patient’s EHR in Epic will occur after the  enrollment phone call . 
 
After consent is obtained and baseline data is collected by [CONTACT_385550] , the SC/RA  will randomize the patient 
and provide a video link and instructions on how to watch the video if the patient is randomized to watch it . This 
is to ensure that any RA who is blind to the patient’s study arm  remains blinded and is able to complete follow -
up interviews .  
 
4.4 Intervention procedures  (by [CONTACT_41995])  
 1. Administering the BETTER from pain video  (Full intervention and Video -only arms)  
   At the end of the enrollment call, the SC/RA will send the video link to the participant via text on an  
 encrypted study phone and/or by [CONTACT_199577]. Patients  are asked to watch the video within [ADDRESS_482313] answers to the video multiple- 
 choice questions within 24 hours of their acute care visit.  If the participant does not provide their answers to the 
 multiple- choice questions within  24 hours, they will be placed into the  intention-to -treat  analysis and excluded 
 from the per -protocol analysis.  
 
2. Conducting the telecare call  (Full intervention arm)  
 The full intervention group will also receive telecare following a protocol-guided phon e call from a research 
nurse (RN) ~48 - 72 hours after study enrollment  (or after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385519])  with an extension of [ADDRESS_482314].   
 Prior to the call, the RN  will review the EHR data abstraction instrument in REDCap, which provides a 
summary of the patient’s  medical visit, co -morbid conditions, allergies, prescribed medications, and a 
treatment plan. The RN will also review any pertinent notes in the EHR. The RN will then call the patient and 
proceed through the telecare script,  addressing pain management goals, current analgesic use,  and non-
pharmacologic methods of pain management. Based on the patient’s answers, the RN will make 
recommendations as needed. The patient’s responses and the RN’ s recommendations will be recorded in 
REDCap under the t elecare instrument  as well as the number of minutes of the call .  
 The telecare call is designed to last ~[ADDRESS_482315] 
medical clinics for uninsured patients.  
 
3. PCP Communication  (Full intervention arm)  
 Following the telecare call, the RN will enter a note in the subject’s EHR that documents the patient’s 
current clinical status, information reviewed, and any recommendations or referrals made. The RN will 
report  the (1) Date, time, location and reason for the ED/OrthoNow  visit; (2) Results of diagnostics studies; 
(3) Discharge prescriptions/recommendations; (4) Summary of and link to the video; (5) Summary of the telecare conversation; and (6) Encouragement for follow-up. If the patient’s PCP is a UNC-affiliated provider, 
they will send the note  through an electronic message in the EHR. If the pati ent’s PCP is not affiliated with 
UNC, the RN will send the note  via the US Postal Service. At the end of the note, PCPs will be asked to 
confirm the note  has been received and reviewed by [CONTACT_21122].  
 
14 
 4.5 Follow - up procedures  (by [CONTACT_150746] ) 
Follow-up data will be obtained for subjects in all arms of the study by a RA who is blind to the subject’s group 
allocation. Data collected at all follow -up time points  will include  a phone interview  with the patient and data 
obtained from the patient’s EHR. Prior to each phone interview , data will be extracted from the  patient’s  EHR by 
[CONTACT_385551].  
 
1-Week Follow - up: This call can take place anytime from  the 7th day through the 12th day after study enrollment 
(or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385520]) . Following the phone script, the RA  will make a total of [ADDRESS_482316] for the follow -up interview. This phone interview will 
take ~20 minutes and include the questionnaires noted below . The purpose of this call is to assess the 
mechanisms that might contribute to patient recovery.  However, some outcomes (pain, healthcare use) will also 
be assessed at this time point.

 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION     
6.1 Statistical Methods  
Analysis Plan Summary : A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be developed and approved by [CONTACT_385553], PI, and other key members  of the study team prior to summarizing any data by [CONTACT_385554]; the following is a summary of the proposed plan.  
Preliminary analyses of complete data will describe the sample and compare characteristics of study participants 
w
ith individuals who were eligible but declined consent. Baseline variables will then be tabulated by [CONTACT_30157]. 
For outcomes that are based on  patient self -report, we will calculate the loss to follow -up rate for each arm and 
assess for non-response bias by [CONTACT_385555]-up.  
Analysis Populations : We will define the following two analysis populations:  
• Intention-to -treat (ITT) Population: This population will include all randomized patients based on the 
arm to which they were randomized, regardless of the extent of intervention actually received and 
regardless of whether they were at a later point found to meet an exclusion criterion . 
• Per-Protocol (PP) Population: This population will be a subset of the Intention -to-Treat Population, and 
will exclude patients who received the incorrect intervention (e.g., viewed less than 50% of the video, 
were not reached for the telecare call)  or who  meet an exclusion criteria after randomization (e.g., were 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385529], had non -MSP). 
Objective 1 : 
To evaluate the primary outcome by [CONTACT_385556] m, we will use a linear mixed model to conduct an analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for  site type (ED vs. Urgent Care),  index visit pain severity, age, gender, 
race, medical comorbidities  (as the Gagne score) , baseline intermittent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], a  history of chronic pain,  and 
access to a PCP. These control variables were selected a priori based on prior evidence of prognostic value and 
will not be subjected to significance testing. This model will include all BPI-SF average  scores (1, 3, and 6) as 
outcomes , will include fixed effects for group, time, and group -by-time , as well as all of the control variables,  
and will use an unstructured covariance matrix for the error terms. We will specify a 6 degrees of freedom (df) 
linear contrast to test the o verall null hypothesis of no mean difference in BPI -SF score at any follow-up visit 
across the 3 groups at the 5% significance level. If the overall null hypothesis is rejected, we will then conduct separate 3 df contrasts to compare each of the interventi on groups with the control group using a Bonferroni -
adjusted 2.5% significance level. We will estimate mean pairwise differences along with 95% confidence intervals at each time point. Missing BPI -SF data will be ignored for the primary comparison. The pri mary 
analysis will be conducted using the ITT Population, but will also be repeated using the PP Population.  
We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the primary comparisons using a multiple imputation approach. Pain scores for patients taking analgesics in the past week will be imputed using demographic characteristics, 
history of chronic pain, pain location, pain etiology (traumatic vs. not traumatic), baseline pain severity, 
analgesics used, and treatment group.  
We will use similar ANCOVA models to test the intervention effects on the secondary outcomes. For continuous or ordinal outcomes, we will use generalized estimating equations  models and contrast tests. For any binary 
variables (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_385530] -use) we will also use ANCOVA model but will fit mixed-effect logistic regression 
models.  
[ADDRESS_482324] . Separate models will be used to assess each interaction. Interpretation of differential effects of the 
intervention will be limited to subgroups for which an interaction is significant at the 5% level. (Because 
available data suggest that Hispanics will constitute ~2.5% of the study sample, we do not anticipate the ability 
to analyze differential effects by [CONTACT_385557] .) 
Objective 2:  
To examine potential mechanisms by [CONTACT_385558], we will apply a structural equation model (specifically, a path analysis with manifest variables) with all variables incorporated 
appropriately for their  scale. The model will use data from all patients and will control for demographic and 
clinical characteristics used for adjusting the Objective  [ADDRESS_482325] effects of the interventions on the outcome through  potential mediating variables ( self-efficacy , use of 
specific analgesics or behaviors) to allow for assessment of whether mediation is present, and if so, if it is complete or partial. No structural relationship will be imposed relating the mediating vari ables to one another, 
beyond simple correlations. We will first test each of the path coefficients from the interventions to the mediator variables separately at the p=0.[ADDRESS_482326] model fit indices (i.e., RMSEA, Bollen’s Incremental I ndex, and the Tucker -
Lewis index) will be reported.  
As an exploratory analysis, t o assess whether the use of specific medications or recovery promoting behaviors 
during the first w eek or the first month mediate pain recovery, these variables will also be examined as potential 
mediator s following the methods described above . 
6.2 Sample Size and Power  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Sample Size Calculation:  We calculated power for comparing mean change in pain severity across the three trial 
arms using a standard approach for linear mixed models.46 We used data from a previous study by [CONTACT_27156],6 
restricted to participants with ED /OrthoNow visit  pain severity of at least 4, to obtain mean pain values for our 
usual care condition as well as variance and covariance values for an unstructured covariance matrix (see Fi gures 
X and Y).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_482327]-randomization mean pain scores of 20% or 15%, respectively, 
lower than that in the usual care group. We 
assumed that loss-to -follow-up times would be 
exponentially distributed such that the total loss would be 20% at [ADDRESS_482328] 90% power for 
testing the overall null hypothesis of no 
difference ac ross the three groups in mean 
change from baseline to any follow -up visit 
through the [ADDRESS_482329] 
tested at the 5% significance level (Figure Z).  
Furthermore, this sample size would provide about 93% power for the comparison betwee n the full intervention 
and the usual care group and 67% power for the comparison between the video -only group and the usual care 
group under these same assumptions, each tested at Bonferroni -adjusted 2.5% significance levels. Because we 
would like our sam ple size to support both the intention to treat analysis and the per protocol analysis 
(restricted to non -admitted patients) and assuming that up to 10% of enrolled patients will be admitted, we plan 
to enroll 400 patients. The sample size is not calculate d based on secondary outcomes. In order to avoid 
selective reporting of secondary outcomes, we will register and report all secondary outcomes regardless of 
what is found. The MIXED Procedure in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for calcu lations. 
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION (intervention details ) 
Full Intervention (Video + Telecare + PCP Communication)  
BETTER from Pain Video :  The educational video is designed to educate individuals about pharmacologic 
management of acute MSP pain and recovery-promoting behaviors (see video script). Each section of the video is 
followed by a multiple- choice question to promote interaction and reinforce learning. The actress for the ~1 5-
minute video is a 56 -year- old mixed-race woman who presents herself as a healthcare provider.  
 

23 
 Telecare: T he full intervention group will also receive telecare following a protocol -guided phone call (see 
telecare protocol) from a research nurse (RN) [ADDRESS_482330] ~15 minutes . 
PCP Communication : Fo llowing the telecare conversation, the RN will send a message to the subject’s PCP 
through the EHR using a standard template that documents the subject’s  current clinical status, information 
reviewed, and any recommendations or referrals made . If the PCP cannot be contact[CONTACT_385559] , the RN 
will send a letter to the PCP through US mail.  This communication will also include: (1) Date, time, location and 
reason for the visit; (2) Results of ED diagnostics studies; (3) Discharge prescriptions/recommendations; (4) 
Summary of and link to the video; (5) Summary of the telecare conversation; and (6) Encouragement for follow -
up. PCPs or their representatives will be asked to confirm the message has been received and reviewed by [CONTACT_21122].  
 
Video -
 only   
Subjects in the video -only arm will watch the BETTER from Pain video (same video shown to subjects in the full 
intervention) and the SC/RA  will implement all the same procedures noted above in the full intervention.  
 
Usual Care  
Patients randomized to the usual care arm will receive education, prescriptions, and advice on recovery 
promoting behaviors as typi[INVESTIGATOR_385531]. We have chosen not to include a sham 
intervention or enhanced usual care because the intent of th e study is to determine if the intervention improves 
upon what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_385532].47 Consistent with this intent, no restrictions will be placed on the 
care from providers for any of the study arms.  
8 STUDY INTERVENTION ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Randomization  procedures   
Patients will be assigned to one of the three treatment arms using 1:1:1 randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_363407] a 
PCP within (patients with and without access to a PCP within 2 weeks ) and age (50-64 and over 65). The 
randomization sequence will be generated in SAS, version 9.4, using computer -generated random numbers. The 
original randomization program was written by [CONTACT_385547]; however, the study Data Manager will change the randomization program seed and then use the program to generate the final randomization lists in order to keep the Principal Statistician blinded to true treatment group until after the primary analyses have 
been programmed. Primary analyses will initially be programmed using dummy treatment codes to main tain 
blinding. The generated randomization lists will be imported into REDCap’s integrated randomization module. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_482331]’s study arm and thus, will not run 
the randomization in REDCap or conduct the video and telecare intervention with subjects. REDCap will be set up to ensure that study personnel are not unblinded when entering data (they will not be able to see which arm 
the subject was allocated to). See below for study tasks by [CONTACT_10757]:  
 
RAs (blinded): Follow up data collection, collect data from the subject’s EHR, and enter data.  
 
24 
  
SC/RA (unblinded):  Recruit, screen for eligibility, consent, conduct baseline  data collection, d etermine which arm 
of the study the subject will be in (via randomization module in REDCap), conduct the video intervention with subjects in the Full and Video -only intervention arms of the study, and enter data related to intervention, and 
collect data from the subject’s EHR, and enter data.  Conduct the telecare portion of the intervention, submit 
EHR (or secure email) note to subject’s PCP summarizing the medical  visit and telecare call, and enter telecare 
data.  
  
Database manager (unblinded): Will create the final randomization list that is loaded into REDCap on a secure server.  Principal Statistician (blinded): W ill not have direct access to the accruing study data. Any datasets provided to 
the Principal Statistician prior to the final analysis of the data will not have any variables indicating the true randomization groups. The primary analysis for the primary  objective will be programmed and validated using 
dummy treatment codes generated by [CONTACT_385547]. Only after the primary analysis has been finalized and all analytic decisions made regarding a) analysis population membership, b) exclusion of any data from the primary analysis, and c) the structure of the final analysis model will true randomization group be 
revealed to the Principal Statistician.  
 
PI: (unblinded)  Will be notified to any AEs or SAEs that may be related to the intervention; manage any 
unexpected issues that may arise, which may require knowing to which intervention arm a patient is randomized.  
 
9 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
9. 1 Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse e vents (AEs) and serious adverse e vents (SAEs) that  are spontaneously reported to study personnel 
(SC, RN, RAs , or investigators) or elicited by [CONTACT_385560]  [INVESTIGATOR_100987]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_385533].  AEs will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_385534] 24-
48 hours of the event; SAEs will be reported to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_385535].   AE/SAE information 
will be recorded in REDCap . The RN will maintain a tracking log of AEs and SAEs which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis. The tracking log will also be summarized and reported to the IRB annually and to the SO and 
NIA twice yearly in biannual reports. Serious Adverse events  will be reported by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_385536], IRB and 
NIA within [ADDRESS_482332] common AE’s will include :  
• Side effects related to analgesic medications being  reco mmended as part of the study  
• Emergency department visits  
• Other events about which study personnel are uncertain should be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_385537] a reportable AE  
 
AEs will be classified according to severity, which is based on their impact on the patient. An AE will be termed 
“mild” if it does not have a major impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor 
inconvenience, and “severe” if it causes a substantial disruption to the patient’s well-being.  All AEs will be 
documented in REDCap.  
25 
 AEs requiring prompt reporting will include the following 3 criteria:  
• Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physic al, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  Please note that 
such events routinely warrant consideration of substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or other  
• Related or possibly related to the research  
o Adverse events meeting all 3 criteria will be reported by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_385538] 1 
week of the event.  
SAEs are defined as : 
• Death  
• A life -threatening experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly  
• Birth defect  
• May require medical, surgical, behavioral, social or other  intervention to prevent one of the above 
outcomes.  
o Serious Adverse events  will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_385539], IRB and NIA within 24 hours of 
notification  
 
9.2 Medical Emergencies: Suicidality  
 If a subject express es symptoms of depression during telecare or telephone interviews, the RA or RN will ask a 
series of questions  adapted from the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale Primary Care Screening with Triage 
Points  to assess for suicidality. Subjects who are determined to be at low risk  for suicide  will be encouraged by 
[CONTACT_21118]/RN to follow -up with a mental health provider or PCP within [ADDRESS_482333] been seen by a medical provider. 
Subjects deemed high risk for suicide will be asked to confirm their location and EMS will be called. The RA/RN 
will remain on the telephone with the subject until EMS arrives.  
 In all cases, regardless of level of risk , the RA/RN will  notify the P I or SO immediately. The subject’s PCP will also 
be notified of the event. All  suicide assessment s will be documented in REDCap and will be recorded as adverse 
events. 
 
[ADDRESS_482334] been taken to maximize privacy. All research activity  (screening, consent, questionnaire 
interview) will be completed in a private area where study staff cannot be overheard. Subjects will be informed 
that at any time during the study, they may choose to not answer a question for any reason. Subjects will be  
assured that refusal to participate will not affect  medical  care in any way. Patient identifying information will be 
flagged in REDCap and will not be downloaded for analyses. All research personnel involved in any way in this 
[ADDRESS_482335] during the patient’s enrollment call following the screening interview.  The SC/RA  will 
verbally review each section of the consent and HIPAA authorization with the patient  and provide ample time 
for the patient to ask any questions. The SC/RA  will also assess capacity to consent with the following two 
questions: “What is this study abo ut?” and “Can you drop out of the study at any time? ”  If necessary, the SC/ RA 
will review relevant information about the study to facilitate subject’s comprehension. The subject is 
determined to have capacity to consent if they correctly answered both que stions by [CONTACT_385561]. Please 
note that subjects will have already passed a cognitive screener as part of the eligibility screening interview. If a subject passes the capacity to consent and has no further questions, the SC/RA  will date and print the  patient’s 
name [CONTACT_385564]. They will also date, sign, and print the patient’s name 
[CONTACT_385565]. Based on patient preference, a copy of both forms will be sent to the 
patient via secure email and/or postal mail. Depending on if the patient opted for email or mail, an electronic or paper version will also be retained for study records, secured in a protected area or secured on the study share drive.

2 Synopsis  
Purpose  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_858547] (ICU), few studies have addressed the needs of older 
adults in the ICU; for example, sensory impairment, functional decline, and deprescribing 
of potentially inappropriate medications (PI[CONTACT_18854]) are rarely addressed in routine ICU 
practice. We have developed a geriatrics bundle for the ICU that implements evidence -
based interventions from geri atric models of care (occupational therapy, assessment and 
treatment of hearing impairment, and deprescribing PI[INVESTIGATOR_858548]) and 
complements existing ICU best practices. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_858549], 
acceptability, and barriers and facilitators to implementing these interventions in the ICU . 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_858550] a future hybrid effectiveness -
implementation study of the geriatrics bundle in the ICU, with a long -term goal of adding 
the geriat rics bundle as the “G” component of the ABCDEF bundle (the existing standard 
of care) to facilitate widespread implementation  across ICUs.  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
barriers to implementing a “geriatrics bundle” in the ICU as an addition  to the current 
bundle of ICU interventions (the “ABCDEF bundle”).  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is to describe (as preliminary data) the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650760] (such as incidence of delirium, mobility level, muscle strength at discharge, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]) among patients who have received the geriatric bundle . 
Study Design  
This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_858551] 65 and older from the 36 -
bed medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the main campus of Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(YNHH). This study will use a pre -/post -intervention design; fi rst, 30 control patients will 
be enrolled, and subsequently the geriatrics bundle will be implemented in 50 patients.  A 
patient (or proxy) interview and medical record review will be performed at the time of 
enrollment by a research nurse. For patients in  the intervention group, t he research nurse 
will then orient the patient, proxy, and ICU nurse to the components of the geriatrics 
bundle. All patients in the intervention group will receive all 3 bundle components: 
occupational therapy (in addition to phy sical therapy delivered via our established early 
mobilization program, which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_858552]) , a portable amplifying device to help with 
hearing,  and a deprescribing intervention by [CONTACT_858582] (in conjunction with the 
medical team) upon ICU -to-floor transfer.  
Study Date Range and Duration  
3 years (1 year s for field activities, 2 years for data analysis and manuscript preparation)  
Number of Study Sites  
1 – the York Street campus MICU of YNHH  
Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary outcomes are all implementation outcomes; therefore, they will only be 
evaluated among participants and providers enrolled during the intervention phase  of the

                                          4/7/2021   V4 
 
3 study. To evaluate the feasibility of bundle delivery in the ICU ( SA1), we will assess the 
delivery of each bundl e component separately. For the occupational therapy intervention 
(Component 1 ), we will review the electronic medical record (EMR) for OT notes from 
study enrollment through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In addition to gathering data on numbers of 
patients receivin g OT, we will gather data about the frequency of and which OT 
interventions are performed. For the hearing impairment intervention ( Component 2 ), we 
will perform a daily audit of use of the hearing amplifier (by [CONTACT_858583], 
patient, and checki ng the  bedside log). For the deprescribing intervention ( Component 3) , 
we will review the chart for the ICU pharmacist’s note. We will also gather data on the 
details of the deprescribing intervention (i.e. the number and type of medications that 
were chan ged or discontinued) as preliminary data for future studies.  
To evaluate the acceptability of the geriatrics bundle among providers who are 
responsible for delivering and using the individual components ( SA2), we will administer a 
survey with a 5-point Likert scale (range 1 -5, where 5 indicates that the bundle is 
completely acceptable for use in its current form) to the providers who are responsible for 
delivering the intervention: occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OT; Component 1 ), nurses (primarily, 
but also other ICU providers such as physici ans and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]; Component 2 ), 
and ICU pharmacists ( Component 3 ). 
To evaluate facilitators and barriers to implementation of the geriatrics bundle ( SA3), we 
will use qualitative methods to allow for a more comprehensive understanding of barrier s 
and facilitators encountered by [CONTACT_20900] (OT, nursing, and ICU pharmacy) 
during bundle delivery. We will approach all participating OT and Pharmacy providers and 
use purposive sampling for the nursing group (given the large number of ICU nurse s). 
Focus groups will be recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_858584].  
Secondar y and Exploratory Outcome Variables  
From the intervention and control groups, w e will gather data on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858553], including but not limited to delirium, mobility level, muscle 
strength at discharge, functional status  at discharge, and ICU/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110011].   We 
will also ask patients about perceived benefit of the hearing impairment intervention.  
Study Population  
This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_858551] 65 and older from the 36 -
bed me dical intensive care unit (MICU) of the main campus of Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(YNHH).  All patients aged >=65 who are admitted to the MICU will be screened for 
enrollment.   Nursing providers, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and ICU pharmacists delivering 
the bun dle components will also be enrolled as study participants (“provider participants”).  
Number of Participants  
We plan to enroll 80 patient participants  (30 in the control group, 50 in the intervention 
group) .  Of the providers, we plan to enroll 75 nurses and all of the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_858554] ( approximately 3 -5 in each group) who deliver the interventions . 
Study Schedule  
Each patient participant will have [ADDRESS_1196405], prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Each interview /assessment will take 
approximately 45 minutes.   Approximately one month after  discharge, there will be one

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
Observational Study of Individual or Group Template  
1 Background/Literature Review  and 2 Rationale/Study Significance  
1.1 Background /Rationale and 2.1 Study Significance  
Millions of older adults are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) every year, and 
this numbe r is only expected to increase as the population ages.[ADDRESS_1196406] editorial noted that 
“survivorship will be the defining challenge of critical care in the 21st century.”9 
Older adults are more likely to present to the ICU with multifactorial health conditions 
that c onfer increased vulnerability to  adverse outcomes .  Older adults with p re-ICU 
vulnerability factors  (e.g. frailty, cognitive impairment) are at greater risk of poor outcomes 
when exposed to a high acuity insult such as a critical illness , compounded with insults from 
the ICU environment (e.g. immobility and  polypharmacy ). Our work  has demonstrated the 
importance of frailty, cognitive impairment, and their interaction on post -ICU disability among 
older adults,10-12 established  the strong association  of an older person's pre -ICU functional 
trajectory with post-ICU disability,[ADDRESS_1196407] strongly associated with (a lack of) functional recovery after an ICU 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].[ADDRESS_1196408] decade, the 
“ABCDEF bundle” ((A)ssess/manage pain, (B)oth spontaneous awakening and spontaneous 
breathing trials, (C)hoice of analgesia/sedation, (D)elirium assessment, prevention, and 
management, (E)arly Mobilization, (F)amily engagement) h as become a core part of ICU 
practice, with each bundle component supported by a strong evidence base.16-[ADDRESS_1196409] components to the needs of older ICU patients.  
To address the needs of critically ill older adults, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_858555] -based 
(G)eriatrics bundle , with a long -term goal of adding this bundle as the  “G” component of the 
ABCDEF  bundle . The bundle includes occupational therapy evaluation and treatment (in 
addition to physical therapy already being delivered through early mobi lization), the 
assessment and treatment of hearing impairment, and a deprescribing intervention of 
potentially inappropriate medications (PI[CONTACT_18854]) started in the ICU upon the ICU-to-floor 
transition .  
The evidence base for this bundle is strong. Early mobiliz ation, usually delivered by [CONTACT_858585], is already part of ICU practice through the ABCDEF bundle.  We will add 
occupational therapy, a skilled service that focuses on daily functional tasks, and one that 
has previously shown benefit in improving fun ctional outcomes among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39449]21 and in the ICU population,[ADDRESS_1196410] -ICU functional outcomes.14 Finally, the continuation of potentially inappropriate 
medications (PI[CONTACT_18854]) initiated in the ICU is common,[ADDRESS_1196411] intervention may be effective i n reducing PIM continuation.26 The proposed work 
will evaluate the feasibility of the healthcare team to deliver the geriatrics bundle to older

8 patients in the  ICU ( Specific Aim 1 ) and assess the bundle’s acceptability among provi ders 
who are responsible for delivering and using t he individual components (nurses, physicians, 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and ICU pharmacists ; Specific Aim 2 ). We will also evaluate 
facilitators and barriers to implementation of the geriatrics bundle in th e ICU setting (Specific 
Aim 3 ).  The results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_858556] R01 application 
evaluating the bundle’s effectiveness in improving in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212052] -ICU outcomes 
(primary aim) while also evaluating implementation  outcomes (secondary aim).   
 
Prior Experience (if applicable)  
[CONTACT_858608] has extensive experience conducting patient -oriented outcomes research in the 
intensive care unit.  Other active protocols enrolling in the ICU include the PREDICT study 
(PI: [INVESTIGATOR_858557], protocol #[PHONE_17797]) and the VALIANT study (mPI: [CONTACT_30822], Ferrante, 
Hajduk, protocol #[PHONE_17798]).   
 
2.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_858558], most of these components  have never been studied or 
implemented in the ICU environment. This study leverages strategies (bundles and 
checklists) that have been known to work in the ICU to build on existing evidence -based 
interventions (the ABCDEF bundle) to improve outcomes for o lder ICU patients.  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_858559], acceptability, 
facilitators, and barriers to implementation that will be used to support a hybrid effectiveness -
implementation R01 of the geriatrics bundle in the ICU setting. Long -term, the overarching 
goal is to leverage the existing ABCDEF bundle by [CONTACT_858586] “G” 
component to facilitate its widespread implementation.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1196412] in ICU practice, but are underutilized.  Occupational therapy has been part 
of the STEPS -ICU program (a YNHH quality improvement program) since its incep tion in 
March of 2015 .  This study does not change anything about the OT or STEPS -ICU program 
itself; the study only ensures that all patients age 65 and older (in the intervention group) are 
prescribed OT  (since most physicians only remember to order PT, but forget about OT) . Of 
note, [CONTACT_858608] has been the physician lead of  YNHH's early mobilization program in the 
MICU (the "STEPS -ICU" program) since its inception in [ADDRESS_1196413] been available in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858560] , so the minimal risk is that the patient may find the headphones bothersome.  We will 
provide a laminated instruction sheet at each patient’s bedside so that the nurse and patient 
have a resource for use of the device.  In terms of the deprescribing intervention, there is a 
small risk of a patient having a home medication discontinued, but this risk will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_858587], so that they ensure that 
only medications started in the MICU (that are now inappropriate) are discontinued.  As with 
any study, there is a small risk of breach of confidentiality, but we will m inimize this risk 
through our use of secure data practices.    
There are no risks to the provider participants in this study, other than the inconvenience 
associated with the 5 -10 minute survey and/or the 1 -hour focus group.  
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/[ADDRESS_1196414], ensuring the default receipt of occupational therapy (OT) is likely to 
identify impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) and ins trumental activities of daily 
living (IADLs) that may not have been observed without an OT evaluation. Second, the 
receipt of a portable amplifying device for hearing -impaired patients is likely to benefit their 
ability to hear in the short -term (and poten tially the long -term, if they continue to use a 
portable amplifier after discharge).  Provision of the device may also benefit patients who do 
not report hearing impairment, as they may have objective hearing impairment (but not 
subjective hearing impairme nt) and may still benefit from use of the device and realize the 
benefit once they have tried it.  Third, the deprescribing component will actually prevent 
potential harm from reaching the patient, because it is discontinuing medications started in 
the MIC U that are no longer appropriate for the patient.  There are no benefits to the patient 
participants in the control group.  However, i f the bundle is (eventually) successfully 
implemented into clinical practice, there will be potential benefit to future pa tients.  
There is potential benefit to the nursing and occupational therapy provider participants, as 
provision of the portable amplifying device to the patient may help improve their ability to 
communicate with a hearing -impaired older patient.  There is no potential benefit to the ICU 
pharmacy providers, though the knowledge gained in this study may improve ICU 
pharmacy practice in the future.  
[ADDRESS_1196415] ement among older patients 
in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), and that the bundle will be acceptable to the 
providers responsible for its implementation.  We hypothesize that the qualitative aim will 
uncover additional barriers and facilitators to the bundle’s implementation that were not 
identified in the first two aims.  
3.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and barriers 
to implementing a “geriatrics bundle” in the ICU as an add ition to the standard of care (the 
“ABCDEF” bundle).  
3.3 Secondary O bjective  (if applicable)  
The secondary objective of this study is to describe (as preliminary data) the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650760] (such as delirium, mobility level, muscle strength at discharge , ICU/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807228]) among patients who have received the geriatric bundle , as well as their 30 -day 
functional outcomes and health outcomes (i.e. readmissions) .  An additional secondary 
objective is to describe the ongoing use of the portable amp lifying device after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858561] .  
 
4 Study Design  
4.1.1 General Design Description  
This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_858551] 65 and older from the 36 -bed 
medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the main campus of Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(YNHH). The study uses a pre -/post -intervention design.  First, 30 consecutive patients will 
be recruited for the control group (during the “control phase” of the study).  The geriatrics 
bundle will then be implemented, and then 50 intervention group participants will be enrolled 
(during the “intervention phase” of the study).  For a ll study participants, a  patient (or proxy) 
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/[ADDRESS_1196416] review will be performed at the time of enrollment by a 
research nurse. All participants will undergo another interview and assessment prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and will receive a brief follow -up phone assessment at approximately 30 
days after discharge.  
For participants in the intervention group, the research nurse will orient the patient, proxy, 
and ICU nurse to the components of the geriatrics bundle  during the baseline interview  in 
the ICU . All intervention group  participants  will receive all 3 bundle components: 
occupational therapy (in addition to physical therapy delivered via our established early 
mobilization program, which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_858552]) , a portable amplifying device to he lp with hearing,  
and a deprescribing intervention by [CONTACT_858582] (in conjunction with the medical 
team) upon ICU -to-floor transfer.   Providers who are delivering the bundle components 
(nurses, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and ICU pharmacists) will also be enrolled as study 
participants, hereafter referred to as “provider participants.”   Participants enrolled during the 
intervention phase will also undergo brief “check -in” assessments between enrollment and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858562].

4.2 Outcome Variables  
4.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary outcomes are all implementation outcomes; therefore, they will only be 
evaluated among participants and providers enrolled during the intervention phase of the 
study. To evaluate the feasibility of bundle delivery in the ICU ( SA1), we will asse ss the 
delivery of each bundle component separately. For the occupational therapy intervention 
(Component 1 ), we will review the electronic medical record (EMR) for OT notes from study 
enrollment through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In addition to gathering data on  numbers of patients 
receiving OT, we will gather data about the frequency of and which OT interventions are 
performed. For the hearing impairment intervention ( Component 2 ), we will perform a daily 
audit of use of the portable amplifying device. The daily  audit will include asking the 
participant and nurse about use of the device, as well as checking a daily bedside log where 
use of the device is recorded.  For the deprescribing intervention ( Component 3) , we will 
review the chart for the ICU pharmacist’s n ote. We will also gather data on the details of the 
deprescribing intervention (i.e. the number and type of medications that were changed or 
discontinued) as preliminary data for future studies.  
To evaluate the acceptability of the geriatrics bundle among providers who are responsible 
for delivering and using the individual components ( SA2), we will administer a survey with a 
5-point Likert scale (range 1 -5, where 5 indicates that the bundle is completely acceptable 
for use in its current form) to the provi ders who are responsible for delivering the 
intervention: occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OT; Component 1 ), nurses (primarily, but also other 
ICU providers such as physicians and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]; Component 2 ), and ICU 
pharmacists ( Component 3 ). 
To evaluate fa cilitators and barriers to implementation of the geriatrics bundle ( SA3), we will 
use qualitative methods to allow for a more comprehensive understanding of barriers and

11 facilitators encountered by [CONTACT_20900] (OT, nursing, and ICU pharmacy) during  
bundle delivery. We will approach all participating OT and Pharmacy provider s and use 
purposive sampling for the nursing group (given the large number of ICU nurses). Focus 
groups will be recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts will be review ed by [CONTACT_858588].  
4.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables (if applicable)  
From the intervention and control g roups, w e will gather data on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858553], including but not limited to delirium, mobility level, muscle 
strength at discharge, functional status at discharge, and ICU/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] l engths of stay.   We 
aill also  submit a JDAT request for deidentified, aggregate historical data from the York 
Street MICU on the same in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209].   
From the intervention and control groups, a t approximately 30 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
we will also gather data on functional outco mes, cognitive outcomes, and health outcomes 
(including, but not limited to, readmissions) . From the intervention group only, we will gather 
feedback and data about  ongoing use of the portable amplifying device since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
 
4.3 Study Population  
This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_858551] 65 and older from the 36 -bed 
medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the main campus of Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(YNHH).  All patients aged >=65 who are admitted to the MICU will be  screened for 
enrollment.  
Nursing providers, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and ICU pharmacists delivering the bundle 
components will also be enrolled as study participants (“provider participants”).  
4.3.1 Number of Participants  
We plan to enroll 80 patient participants  (30 in the control group, and 50 in the intervention 
group) . Of the providers, we plan to enroll 75 nurses and all of the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_858554] ( approximately 3 -5 in each group) who deliver the interventions . 
4.3.2 Eligibilit y Criteria/Vulnerable Populations  
This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_858563] 36 -bed medical intensive 
care unit (MICU) of the main campus of Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (YNHH), where 
approximately half of the 2900 annual admissions are among patients age 65 and older.  All 
patients age 65 and older who are admitted to the YNHH MICU will be screened for 
enrollment.   Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patient participants are outlined in the 
table below.    
For the provider partici pants, all nurses, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and ICU pharmacists 
delivering the bundle components will be eligible for inclusion.  The only exclusion criterion 
for the nurses is if the nurse encountered by [CONTACT_858589]’s primary 
nurse (such as if the nurse is covering for the primary nurse’s lunch break).

of medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients age [ADDRESS_1196417]  on a daily basis to screen for eligible patients.  
For screened patients, basic demographic information will be captured in a REDCap 
screening form as this is a feasibility study and we will need to provide descriptive statistics 
for the patients s creened and enrolled.  Study personnel will apply the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria from Table 1 (above in section 4.3.2) and identify eligible patients.  
Once an eligible patient is identified, a  research nurse or research assistant will assess the 
patient for his/her ability to consent and participate in the study interventions by [CONTACT_858590] -Sedation Scale (RASS) .  For p atients 
who are too deeply sedated (RASS -2 to -5) or agitated (+2 to +5) , as often occu rs in the 
ICU due to severity of illness or the need for mechanical ventilation, a proxy will be 
approached for consent.  Patients with an acceptable RASS score ( -1, 0, or +1) will undergo 
an assessment of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM -ICU).  
For p atients who are delirious according to the CAM -ICU, as often occurs in the ICU due to 
severity of illness, a proxy will be approached for consent .  Patients who have acceptable 
RASS scores and a negative CAM -ICU will be approached for  enrollment.  If study 
personnel have any concerns about the patient’s capacity to consent once they begin 
speaking to the patient, they will administer the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Brief 
Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  If the patient  is found to lack decisional 
capacity, a proxy will be approached for consent.

13 Participants will be provided with a copy of the consent  form. Proxies who sign the consent 
form in person will also be provided with a copy of the consent form.  In light of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_858565] -19, and considering that many proxies will not want to 
visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858566] -19 pandemic, we will allow for verbal consent by [CONTACT_355088]. If 
verbal consent by [CONTACT_858591], we will log this in the RE DCap database and mail the 
proxy a  key information sheet .  The consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_858592].   The research nurse will be required to check the following 
attestation in REDCap: “I verbally explained the purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, 
confidentiality, and voluntary nature of the ACE -ICU study.  The proxy was given time to ask 
any questions and agreed to have the participant take part in the study.”  
Baseline interview and pr ovision of portable amplifying device  ([ADDRESS_1196418])  
After consent is obtained, the research nurse will perform a baseline interview that includes 
an assessment of geriatric factors, demographics, and in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858567].  This interview is expected to take approximately 45 
minutes.  Data will be collected about demographics, health conditions, pre -ICU functional 
status, healthcare utilization, frailty, falls, social support, living situation, depressi ve 
symptoms, cognitive function, hearing impairment, and vision impairment.  Hearing 
impairment will be assessed with the single -item hearing question in the National Health and 
Nutrition Assessment Survey (NHANES) , which asks the participant or proxy to b est 
describe the participant’s hearing without a hearing aid or other listening device.   
For participants enrolled during the intervention phase of the s tudy, research  personnel will 
then orient the participant and the nurse to the portable amplifying dev ice and help set up 
the amplifier for the patient. A bedside laminated sheet with instructions on how to use the 
device will be provided and left at the bedside so that the participant and nurse have a 
resource for reference.  Due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1196419] of the participant’s 
enrollment in the study , so that an O T order is placed in the EMR.  The ICU pharmacy team 
will also be notified of the participant’s enrollment.  
Daily in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858568] ([ADDRESS_1196420]/day)  
For participants enrolled during the intervention phase of the study, s tudy personnel  will 
perform a daily audit of use of the portable amplifying device.  Participants will be asked a 
short series of questions about their device use.  Study personnel will also ask the nurse 
about use of the device and will check the bedside log of device use. 
Occupational therapy  
For participants enrolled during the intervention phase of the study , the occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668445]’s need for OT and develop a treatment plan as they normally 
would in clinical practice.  This study does not alter any aspect of the OT assessment or 
treatment plan; the study only ensures that OT is ordered as a default for all enrolled 
participants.  
Deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PI[CONTACT_18854])  started in the ICU  
When a participant in the interv ention arm  is ready for transfer to the floor (as indicated by 
[CONTACT_858593] a transfer order or indicating that they will place a transfer 
order that day), the ICU pharmacy team will review the active medication list for PI[INVESTIGATOR_858569].  Common examples include 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (often inappropriately started for ICU delirium) and acid suppressants 
(which are indicated for stress ulcer prophylaxis during mechanical ventilation, but are no 
longer indicated after discharge unless they are a home medication).  The ICU pharmacist

14 will review the patient’s home medication list to ensure that PI[INVESTIGATOR_858570]. The ICU pharmacist will then write a  brief note in the EMR 
documenting which PI[INVESTIGATOR_858571].   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858572] ([ADDRESS_1196421])  
Prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], all participants will undergo an assessment of functional status, 
cognitive status ( with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ), and 3 objective assessments: 
manual muscle testing according to the 6 -point Medical Research Council (MRC) system,[ADDRESS_1196422].   We will also ask participants in the 
intervention arm about perceived benefit of the portable amplifying device, their comfort with 
the device, and acceptability of the device.  
• Manual muscle testing via the 6 -point MRC system: Strength in each of 12 muscle 
groups is assessed via a 6 -point system,  in which a score of 0=no contraction, 
1=flicker of a contraction, 2=active movement with gravity eliminated, 3=active 
movement against gravity, 4=active movement against gravity and resistance, 5= 
normal power.  
30-day interview ([ADDRESS_1196423])  
At approximately 30 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], we will call all participant s (or their 
proxies) to ask about functional status, cognitive status, and health events  (such as, but not 
limited to,  readmissions) . We will also ask participants in the intervention arm about ongoing 
use of the portable amplifying device since  discharge.  
Medical record abstraction  
Study personnel will review the EMR s of all participants  to gather data about the patient’s 
demographics, health conditions, and clinical course in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410090], but not limited 
to, medications, ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363468], h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], deliriu m, physical 
therapy treatments , SOFA score (a measure of severity of illness) , as well as ICU tre atments 
and complications ( e.g.  mechanical ventilation, tethering devices (e.g. lines, tubes, and 
restraints) , and the need for dialysis).  After the follow -up phone interview (or, if the patient 
cannot be reached, after the window for that follow -up inter view has closed), stud y 
personnel will again review the EMR to capture data on health outcomes such as 
readmissions and mortality.  
Payment for study participation  
All participants will be given a $[ADDRESS_1196424] will be mailed to the participant 
after completion of the follow -up interview.  If there are any concerns about the participant’s 
ability to reliably receive the gift ca rd after discharge (such as if the participant is being 
discharged to a short -term rehab facility), we will provide the gift card prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
Screening and enrollment of provider  participants  
Occupational therapy providers  
At least one occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT) is assigned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit 
(MICU) as part of the quarterly rotation for rehab personnel who staff the MICU’s STEPS -
ICU early mobilization program.  Research personnel will identify the occupation al 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541](s) rotating through the MICU during the study period and approach them for 
inclusion in the survey and focus groups.  The appropriate information sheet (survey only or 
survey and focus group) will be provided.  We estimate that up to [ADDRESS_1196425] providers  
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/2021   V4 
 
15 There are three ICU pharmacists who are dedicated to the MICU. Research personnel will 
approach the three ICU pharmacists for inclusion in the survey and focus groups. The 
appropriat e information sheet will be provided.   
Nursing providers  
Research personnel will identify the patient’s primary nurse by [CONTACT_858594], including the patient’s primary team in Mobile Heartbeat.  Nurses in the ICU 
or who are carin g for the patient on the ward (after ICU transfer) may be approached for 
inclusion in the survey and focus groups.  The appropriate information sheet will be 
provided.  
Payment for study participation  
Focus group participants will be provided with a $[ADDRESS_1196426] at the conclusion of study 
activities to thank them for their participation.  Survey respondents will not be compensated . 
5.1.1 Data Collection  
Location of data storage  
The majority of the research data will be entered directly into a data management software 
program (REDCap), using either an on -site computer or an iPad on the Yale secure network.  
Paper collection materials (such as parts of the MoCA ) will be scanned int o REDCap and 
then stored in locked file cabinets. Data coordination, data management and database 
design will occur within the Yale School of Medicine’s Program on Aging (POA). All data will 
be collected and maintained electronically. Data management proce dures will ensure 
accurate and efficient data collection and analysis; confidentiality and real -time, on -demand 
study monitoring reports. Patient identifiers will be collected to facilitate gathering of 
complete data from the electronic medical record (EMR ), but all participants will be assigned 
a unique REDCap study ID for identification in the study.  Data will be maintained in 
accordance with HIPAA guidelines for participant confidentiality and privacy. All data will 
reside on secure, HIPAA -compliant data base and file -sharing resources managed by [CONTACT_858595] (DMIC) of the POA and by [CONTACT_34756]. Access to data 
resources will be strictly limited to research staff and investigators.  
Data collection and data elements  
The data element s and method of collection during the study visits and for the EMR 
abstraction are outlined above in Section 5.1 ; therefore, in  this section we will add these 
details for data elements related to the primary outcomes.  To evaluate the feasibility of 
bundle  delivery in the ICU ( SA1), we will assess the delivery of each bundle component 
separately. For the occupational therapy intervention ( Component 1 ), we will review the 
electronic medical record (EMR) for OT notes /flowsheet data  from study enrollment 
throu gh hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In addition to gathering data on numbers of patients receiving 
OT, we will gather data about the frequency of and which OT interventions are performed. 
For the hearing impairment intervention ( Component 2 ), we will sum data from the daily 
audit . Of note, if the patient is deeply sedated or unconscious due to critical illness, that 
day would not count as an eligible day of hearing amplifier use. For the deprescribing 
intervention ( Component 3 ), we will review the chart for the ICU phar macist’s note. We 
will also gather data on the details of the deprescribing intervention (i.e. the number and 
type of medications that were changed or discontinued) as preliminary data for future 
studies.  
To evaluate the acceptability of the geriatrics bun dle among providers who are 
responsible for delivering and using the individual components (occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], nurses, physicians, and ICU pharmacists), we will administer a survey with 
a 5-point Likert scale (range 1 -5, where 5 indicates that the bu ndle is completely 
acceptable for use in its current form) to the providers who are responsible for 
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/2021   V4 
 
16 delivering the intervention: occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OT; Component 1 ), nurses 
(primarily, but also other ICU providers such as physicians and physical ther api[INVESTIGATOR_11437]; 
Component 2 ), and ICU pharmacists ( Component 3 ). The survey will include 
questions about whether the device improved workflow (e.g. For PT, did it help 
facilitate early mobilization?) and ask for feedback that may help adapt the intervention 
to imp rove its utility. For the deprescribing component, we will administer the survey to 
the ICU pharmacist after they have performed the intervention.   The acceptability 
survey will be developed during the study to allow the investigator team to observe 
implem entation of the geriatrics bundle and ensure that the survey is assessing all 
important workflow elements.  
To evaluate facilitators and barriers to implementation of the geriatrics bundle using a 
qualitative approach, we will use qualitative methods to allow for a more 
comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators encountered by [CONTACT_20899] ( OT, nursing, and ICU pharmacy) during bundle delivery. This aim of 
the study will be conducted in collaboration with [CONTACT_26021], a qualitative and mixed - 
methods expert. We will select participants for focus groups organized by [CONTACT_69319]. 
Because the goal of qualitative research is to obtain a broad representation of 
experiences and perceptions, we will use purposive sampling to identify nursing 
participants with diverse viewpoints regarding the acceptability of the intervention, as 
indicated by [CONTACT_858596] 2. (Purposive sampling will be needed for the nursing 
group because the YNHH MICU employs well over 100 nurses.) For the OT and ICU 
pharmacy focus groups, all providers who implemented the bundle will be included. 
During the first [ADDRESS_1196427] elaborate on their role caring for older adults in the MICU, and how 
implementation of the geriatrics bun dle changed (or did not change) their workflow. 
We will then ask more specific questions about bundle implementation, including: 
whether/how other care processes were affected, perceived effects on workload, 
perceived benefit to the patient, ease/difficult y of using any new technology (e.g. the 
portable amplifying devices), whether/how the bundle components interacted with 
each other, and suggestions for improvement. At the end of the study, [CONTACT_26021] will 
conduct the focus groups by [CONTACT_69319]. As the OT a nd ICU pharmacy groups are fairly 
small, we anticipate that only 1 focus group will be needed for each of these 
disciplines. We anticipate that 3 -4 focus groups (of 4 -6 people) will be needed for 
nursing. Focus groups will be recorded and professionally tr anscribed. Transcripts will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_6283]. Ferrante, Cohen, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63868], with coding occurring according to 
the methods of Strauss and Corbin and analysis conducted using the constant 
comparative method .[ADDRESS_1196428] been identified. These themes will provide 
invaluable data to help us refine and improve the geriatrics bundle for a future hybrid 
effectiveness -implementation study.   
5.1.2 Adverse Events Definition and Reportin g 
a. Attribution of Adverse Events:  
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to 
the study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] ( [CONTACT_858608] ) according to 
the following categories:  
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).  
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).  
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to inves tigational procedures(s)/agent(s).  
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/2021   V4 
 
17 d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).  
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).  
 
b. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:  
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events:  
1. Mild adverse event  
2. Moderate adverse event  
3. Severe  
 
c. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:  
Serious Adverse Events:  
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_238340] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is 
considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death;  
2. A life -threatening experience in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929];  
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR  
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this definition.  
An adverse event may be graded as s evere but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.  
d. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]:  
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets A LL 3 of the following criteria:  
Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
protocol and informed consent document and (b) t he characteristics of the subject 
population being studied; AND  
Is related or possibly related to participation in the research ( possibly related  means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_858597]); AND  
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
Unanticipated Problems Inv olving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or 
non-medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and 
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]  
                                          4/7/[ADDRESS_1196429], prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  All patient participants will also receive a brief follow -up 
phone call at appr oximately 30 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  For participants in the 
intervention arm, s tudy personnel will also perform a daily 5 -minute audit of hearing amplifier 
device use  and gather data about acceptability from the participant and nurse (when 
availab le). 
The study schedule for provider participants will include a brief survey (5 -10 minutes), and, 
for the subset that agree to participate in focus groups, one additional study visit for the 
focus group (lasting approximately 1 hour on a separate date).  
5.3 Informed Consent  
For patient participation in the study, we will obtain informed consent.  T he patient and/or 
their proxy will be approached in the ICU by [CONTACT_3462].  All patient rooms in the ICU 
are private rooms.  The patient's ability to make a n informed decision will be assessed 
through multiple methods, including (1) speaking with the care team to ensure that there are 
no concerns about capacity, (2) assessing the potential participant’s mental status (for coma 
or agitation) via the Richmond A gitation Sedation Scale (RASS), and (3) performing a CAM -
ICU to ensure that the patient is not delirious.  If the patient is able to provide informed 
consent, study personnel will leave a copy of the signed consent form with the patient. If the 
patient is not able to make an informed decision the proxy will be approached for consent.  
As noted above, if  consent is obtained from the proxy via telephone, we will mail the proxy 
an information sheet which serves as a copy of the consent .   
Because this is a fea sibility study that is gathering preliminary data, we need to gather basic 
data on the patients who are screened for this study; therefore, we are requesting a waiver 
of HIPAA authorization for screening/recruitment purposes only .  A waiver of HIPAA 
author ization for recruitment/screening purposes will lessen burden on patients and families 
(since we only intend to enroll patients who meet basic inclusion criteria), and still allow us to 
accurately report the number and characteristics of screened patients.  
For provider participation in this study, we will provide the appropriate information sheet 
(survey only, or survey and focus group) as this part of the study meets criteria for a waiver 
of documentation of consent.  Research personnel will review the info rmation sheet with the 
potential participant and answer any questions about the study.  
5.3.1 Screening   
The Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (YNHH) Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) will provide a list 
of medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients at the York Stre et campus who are age [ADDRESS_1196430] with an extra check to ensure that the patient has not 
opted out of research,  to screen for eligibl e patients.   As noted in the prior section, because 
this is a feasibility study that is gathering preliminary data, we need to gather basic data on 
the patients who are screened for this study; therefore, we are requesting a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization f or screening/recruitment purposes only .  Study personnel will record basic 
demographic information and basic identifying information about the screened participants. 
The basic identifying information is necessary because we need to know if participants are  
screened more than once for this study, which is likely to happen since readmissions to the 
ICU are common.

19 A waiver of HIPAA authorization for recruitment/screening purposes will lessen burden on 
patients and families (since we only intend to enroll pati ents who meet basic inclusion 
criteria), and still allow us to accurately report the number and characteristics of screened 
patients.  
5.3.2 Recruitment, Enrollment and Retention   
Study personnel will review the JDAT -provided screening report and MICU roste r (with an 
additional check to ensure that the patient has not opted out of research) each day and 
review the list for eligible patients by [CONTACT_858598] 4.3.2. As outlined above in the Study Proced ures (section 5.1), once an 
eligible patient is identified, a  research nurse or research assistant will assess the patient for 
his/her ability to consent and participate in the study interventions by [CONTACT_858599] -Sedation Scale (RASS) .  For patients who are too deeply 
sedated (RASS -2 to -5) or agitated (+2 to +5), as often occurs in the ICU due to severity of 
illness or the need for mechanical ventilation, a proxy will be approached for consent.  
Patients with an  acceptable RASS score ( -1, 0, or +1) will undergo an assessment of 
delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU  (CAM -ICU).  For patients who are 
delirious according to the CAM -ICU, as often occurs in the ICU due to severity of illness, a 
proxy w ill be approached for consent.   Patients who have acceptable RASS scores and a 
negative CAM -ICU will be approached for enrollment.  If study personnel have any concerns 
about the patient’s capacity to consent once they begin speaking to the patient, they w ill 
administer the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent 
(UBACC).  If the patient is found to lack decisional capacity, a proxy will be approached for 
consent.   Because we are studying a critically ill population, it is  essential that we allow for 
consent by [CONTACT_858600].  
All participants and/or proxies will be provided with a copy of the consent.  In light of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858565] -19, and considering that many proxies will not want to 
visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858566] -[ADDRESS_1196431] been described in detail in section 5.1; as such, in this section we are 
providing the bulleted list of visits only.  The estimated time for participant contact [CONTACT_858601].  
Patient participant study visits  
• Baseline  interview  and provision of the portable amplifying device : 45 minutes  
• Daily audit: 5 minutes/day . 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858572] : 45 minutes  
• Follow -up phone interview approximately 30 days after discharge: 15 minutes  
Provider participant study visits  
• One 5 -10 minute survey  
• If the provider is recruited for and agrees to participate i n a focus group, one 
additional study visit for the focus group: 1 hour on a separate date

5.4.1 Statistical Design , 5.4.2 Sample Size Considerations, and 5.4.3 Planned Analyses  
SA1 Statistical Analysis:  First, we will compi[INVESTIGATOR_858573].  We will report the proportion of eligible patients receiving each 
Protocol Number [PHONE_17796]

20 component, as well as the number of “doses” (for OT) and usage (for the hearing 
component) as outlined above. As a secondary analysis, we will evaluate delivery of the 
overall bundle. A feasibility threshold of 70% will be used for the individual bundle 
components, as well as the combined bundle (all 3 components).  
The null hypothesis will be that  <70% of patients will have received the bundle, with the 
alternative hypothesis that >= 70% of the patients will have received the bundle. Analysis 
consists of a simple comparison of the post -delivery proportion of patients who have 
received the bundle. U sing PASS [ADDRESS_1196432] based on 
normal approximation per the method of Fleiss, Levin and Palk (2003) with a one -sided 
alpha of 5%, we will have 100% power to detect a minimal proportion of 70%. To show 
robustness, if w e lower power to 80%, with a sample of [ADDRESS_1196433] a 
proportion of 75% and with a sample of [ADDRESS_1196434] a minimal proportion of 
78%. This implies our sample of [ADDRESS_1196435] meaningful rates at or 
above 70%.  
SA2 Statistical Analysis:  For each bundle component, we will define acceptability as a 
minimum average score of 7/10 on the Likert Scale (i.e., the minimum average over all Likert 
measurements for that component). As described in the grant, the pharm acists will rate 
acceptability at one timepoint (since the deprescribing intervention occurs once), whereas 
the nurses and occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_858574]. For the 
latter two groups, we will calculate the overall mean  count (i.e. the mean Likert score) over 
time, again using a minimum average of [ADDRESS_1196436] of a single 
mean, based on the methods of Machin, Campbell, Fayers and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_164998] (1997) and Zar (1984), 
and assuming a one -sided alpha of 5% and a null mean of 7, with a sample of [ADDRESS_1196437] 90% power to  detect mean counts of 7.3 or greater. To show robustness, if we lower 
power to 80%, with a sample of [ADDRESS_1196438] mean outcomes at or above 7.  
 
SA3, Statistical Analysis:  Focus groups will be recorded and professionally transcribed. 
Transcripts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6283]. Ferrante, Cohen, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63868], with coding occurring 
according to the methods of Strauss and Corbin and analysis conducted using the cons tant 
comparative method .[ADDRESS_1196439] Characteristics (if applicable)  
Analyses for this prospective cohort study will follow best practices for analyzing and 
accounting for limitations of  observational data. Variables will be examined univariately using 
descriptive  techniques to analyze distributions and missingness. Standard bivariate and 
multi -variable adjusted methods will be used to investigate  hypotheses, including but not 
limited to t -tests/analyses of variance for continuous variables, Wilcoxon/Kruskal -Wallis tes ts 
for ordered/non -normally distributed variables, chi -squared tests for non -ordered categorical  
variables, and regression methods (e.g., linear, logistic) for multivariable -adjusted analyses.  
5.4.5 Interim Analysis – N/A

21 6.1 Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the p articipant  or 
legally authorized representative (LAR) will be asked to read and review the document. The 
study personnel  will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions 
that may arise.  
 
Participants/LAR will have the opportunit y to carefully review the written consent form and 
ask questions prior to signing. The participants/LAR should have the opportunity to discuss 
the study with their family or surrogates, or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The 
participant wi ll sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study. Participants/LAR must be informed that participation is voluntary 
and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the participants/LAR for their records . 
As part of the consent process, trained research staff will review all the required elements of 
informed consent and HIPAA authorization, including the purpose, study procedu res, risks, 
benefits, confidentiality of records, and voluntary nature of the study.  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_858575].  
 
Specific plans for the decisionally impaired : We recognize that  among older hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138592], there may be a proportion of eligible patients who are decisionally impaired (i.e., 
who have a compromised capacity to understand information and make a reasoned decision 
about participation in research) and therefore require additional  protections. We als o 
recognize that t he purpose of identifying eligible patients who may be decisionally impaired 
is not necessarily to exclude them from research, but to seek ways to enable their 
participation in an ethically appropriate manner that is also compliant with r egulatory 
requirements. Therefore, at the time of approaching any potential participant for consent, our 
plans are as follows:  
 
A) Use standardized criteria to determine if the potential participant is capable of 
providing consent.  Members of the study team who are responsible for participant 
recruitment and consent are all highly trained and experienced in obtaining informed 
consent. They will receive training in  the process for  determining capacity to consent in 
aging populations.  Ability to provide informed consent will be assessed using the 
University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC), a 
brief instrument designed to assess decision -making capacity  for research participation 
according to NIH standards. Factors to be considered include the ability to articulate a 
choice regarding study participation, its purpose, and understanding that participation 
does not constitute medical treatment.  
 
B) Follow up with identified proxies when decisional impairment is identified . Proxies 
will be approached for consent because the risks of this study are minimal and the 
potential benefits of developi[INVESTIGATOR_858576]. All potential participants deemed 
decisionally impaired will be notified of that determination before permission is sought 
from their legally authorized surrogate to enroll in the study. Because many proxies will 
not be available in person due to COVID -19 visitor restrictions, we will allow for verbal 
consent by [CONTACT_858602] a copy of the consent/information sheet . 
 
C) Seek assent for potential participants who are decisionally impaired . If permission 
is given  by [CONTACT_858603], the potential participant will be notified 
and their verbal assent will be obtained ( i.e., their active affirmation of a desire to 
participate).  In all cases in which assent is sought, the assent discussion will include the 
following: (1) a simplifi ed description of the purpose of the research, including risks and

22 benefits; (2) a description of the study procedures to which the participant will be 
exposed; ( 3) a statement explaining that participation in this study is voluntary; and ( 4) a 
question an d answer period in which the participant will be encoura ged to ask questions 
about his or her  participation in the study.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1196440] (IRB) Review  
This is a prospective study that is being conducted in a clinical setting (the intensive care 
unit) and includes interviews and standard assessments used in geriatrics research.  The 
protocol will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of the protocol must 
be obtained before initiating any research activity. Any change to th e protocol or study team 
will require an approved IRB amendment before implementation. The IRB will determine 
whether informed consent and HIPAA authorization are required.  A study closure report will 
be submitted to the IRB after all research activities have been completed.  
6.[ADDRESS_1196441] by [CONTACT_3486], 
their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. Therefore, the study protocol, 
docume ntation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No  
data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the 
sponsor.  All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
The study monitor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), or regulatory 
agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clin ic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the 
participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study participant's contact [CONTACT_65246]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a 
secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, or, 
if applicable, sponsor requirements.   
Data for this study will be collected, recorded and stored using REDCa p (Research 
Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure, web application designed to support data 
capture for research studies. Data from any paper study forms will be entered into REDCap 
and then stored in locked file cabinets restricted to the study tea m. Data coordination, data 
management, and database design will occur within the Yale School of Medicine's Program 
on Aging (POA).  
Patient identifiers will be stored within REDCap for research purposes, but upon entry into the 
REDCap system, each study participant will be assigned a unique Study ID that does not 
include identifiers. REDCap includes features for HIPAA compliance includ ing real -time data 
entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), a full audit trail, user -based privileges, 
de-identified data export mechanism to statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata and R), and 
integration with the institutional Active Direc tory. Access to study data in REDCap will be 
restricted to the members of the study team with authentication through University NetID 
credentials. The  REDCap@Yale database and web server are housed on secure platforms 
that are backed up daily. REDCap@Yale meets the security standards for use with high risk 
data as set forth by [CONTACT_673477].   All of these measures minimize risks 
to subjects and decrease the likelihood of potential breaches of confidentiality. At the end of 
the study, all study databases will be de -identified and archived in REDCap at the Yale 
Program on Aging.

23 6.4 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the study protocol. The noncompliance may 
be either on the part of the parti cipant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to identify and report deviations within [ADDRESS_1196442] (IRB) per their policies.  
 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ( “possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and to the study sponsor. The UP report will i nclude the following 
information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI's name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that t he event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:  
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and study 
sponsor, if applicable within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and study  sponsor within [ADDRESS_1196443].  This includes training in geriatric assessments.  The risk 
of harm from routine physical assessments performed will be minimized by [CONTACT_858604] (POA) field staff who follow standa rdized procedures outlined in a manual of 
operations. For example, as part of the walk test, research nurses will monitor for stability, 
assess for contraindications, use assistive devices, and will not attempt to complete walk 
test if there is a risk of f all. It is routine practice for POA research nurses to be trained in safe 
mobilization techniques and fall prevention for older adults. Participants will be encouraged 
to walk at a comfortable pace during the test, using assistive devices as needed.

and human subjects protection training will be authorized to access records.  
 
6.8 Data or Specimen Stor age/Security  
All study staff will follow Yale’s guidelines for data protection, which include storing all 
programs, data and documents on Yale -managed central file shares. No files or documents 
will be permitted on unencrypted portable media or on local ha rd drives, or on file shares 
other than those maintained by [CONTACT_858605]. Remote access to central file 
shares will be permitted only by [CONTACT_858606] 
(http://its.yale.edu/services/software -computers -mobile -devices/software -delivery -

Study data  at Yale  will be managed according Yale University Information Technology 
Services  (ITS)  policies for “3 lock data” ( http://its.ya le.edu/secure -computing/security -
standards -and-guidance ). Primary research data across sites  will be managed using 
REDCap . REDCap is a secure, web application designed to support data capture for research 
studies. It includes features for HIPAA compliance including real -time data entry validation 
(e.g. for data types and range checks), a full audit trail, user -based privileges, de -identified 
data export mechanism to statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata and R), and integration with 
the institutional Active  Directory. Access to study data in REDCap will be restricted to the 
members of the study team with authentication through University NetID credentials.  
 
All study staff will be trained in HIPAA and Human Subject Protection and will follow local 
institutio nal guidelines  and policies  for data protection. No files or documents will be permitted 
on unencrypted portable media or on local hard drives, or on file shares other than those 
securely maintained by [CONTACT_858605]. Any paper records will be mai ntained in

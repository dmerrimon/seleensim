SAEStudy  Design  This will be a phase II single arm study of IMRT re -irradiation  in 
combination with nivolumab in the concurrent and maintenance  
setting. Patients with RPA class I and II based on the recursive 
partitioning analysis (RPA) classes reported by [CONTACT_758676]  (ASTRO 
2016) will be enrolled. The allowable treatment approaches  include 
IMRT. Based on this analysis, only patients with RPA classes I  and 
II will be included; Class III patients will be  excluded.  
 
RT will be given as 60 -66Gy in once daily fractions (2 Gy  per 
fraction).  
 
Nivolumab will be administered 2 weeks prior to the beginning of 
radiation therapy (1 dose at Week - 2) and continue every 2 weeks  
during radiation (4 doses at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6) for a total of 5  doses.  
Nivolumab will then be given every 4 weeks for 10 additional  doses  
for a total of 15 doses of  Nivolumab.  
 
 
Number of  Patients  From the MIRI study, the 1 -year PFS rate for class I and II  
combined was 43.8% (95% CI: 38.6 -  49.7%).  Assuming a one 
sided alpha of 0.05 and an 85% power to detect an improvement in 
1-yr PFS from 40% to 55% we estimate 46 patients will need to be 
accrued in 2.5 years and followed for an additional 2 years 
(estimated maximum total of 51 patients). Accounting for a 20% 
drop out rate, 62 patients will need to be consented.

a. Disease assessments  may be done +/- 2 weeks  of specified  time in protocol  to allow for scheduling and/or  transportation  needs  of the patient  
b. If Nivolumab  or radiation has to be permanently  discontinued due to side effects,  H&P must  be done  [ADDRESS_1038777], HGB, PLT, % lymphocytes, % monocytes, %  neutrophils.  
d. Liver function panel includes Alk Phos, total bilirubin, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total  protein.  
e. Fresh biopsy will be obtained before the first treatment when feasible.  If tissue is not obtained, it is not considered a pr otocol  deviation.  
f. Participating sites could have restricted  number  of research  specimens  (up to 6 draws  per patient)  depending on financial  constraints;  
g.. Toxicity assessment: Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.03 will be used. All toxicity grades (including grade 1) should be captured  on 
the case  report  forms.  All toxicities  that occurred  during treatment  and until 100 days  following  completion of therapy  should be followed  until 
resolution.  
h Tumor  measurement:  The scans  may be performed within  +/- 2 weeks  of intended f/u times  (wks 18, 30, 52, and 104).  Additional  scans  should 
be obtained as clinically indicated if progression is suspected or symptoms warrant further investigation. No tumor measurements are  required 
in the postoperative high risk setting where no gross disease is  apparent.  
i. For patients enrolled post salvage surgery, a CT of the Neck and Chest or a PET scan will be required as a baseline study pri or to enrollment.  
The sites can use a simulation CT of the Neck and Chest for this  purpose.  
j. Pregnancy  test should be done in woman  of childbearing age who are sexually  active  and may potentially  be pregnant.  Prior  to study  enrollment,  
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential 
risk factors  for an unintentional  pregnancy.  In addition,  men enrolled on this study  should understand  the risks to any sexual  partner  of childbearing  
potential and should practice an effective method of birth control. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_1038778] they might be pregnant (e.g. , missed or  late 
menstrual period) at any time during study participation. The Investigator must immediately notify BMS in the event of a conf irmed pregnancy  in 
a patient participating in the study.  
k. May allow a window  of 7 days  of delay  for labs (CBC  diff and Chemistries)  and 7 days  of delay  for nivolumab infusion if nivolumab given every 
4 weeks;  may also allow a window  of 3 days  between History,  PE and ECOG  PS status  and nivolumab infusion  (regardless  of the nivolumab  
schedule)

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1. MEDICAL  BACKGROUND  
 
1.1.1.  Treatment  of Recurrent  Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous 
Cell Carcinoma  
Head and neck  squamous  cell carcinoma (HNSCC)  remains  one of the most  devastating  
cancers in the [LOCATION_002]. The sites affected by [CONTACT_758677] (oral cavity,  oropharynx,  
hypopharynx and larynx) are critical to the complex and vital functions of speech and 
swallowing.  Therefore,  HNSCC is clinically  challenging because the treatment  frequently  
alters or destroys a patient’s ability to have oral intake and to communicate verbally. Optimal 
treatment  of HNSCC is based on the site and size of the tumor  as well as clinical assessments  
of the presence or absence of cervical lymph node metastasis. Large tumors or tumors  with 
regional metastases are typi[INVESTIGATOR_758633], including surgery, 
radiation,  and/or  chemotherapy.  Smaller  tumors  without  cervical  metastases  can often  be 
effectively controlled with either surgery or radiation therapy  alone.  
Approximately 30- 40% of patients irradiated for HNSCC will recur with isolated  locoregional  
disease and a substantial number will develop a second primary cancer ( 1, 2). Treatment  of 
these  non-metastatic  patients  with recurrent  or second primary  (RSP)  cancers  originating  
within  a previously  radiated field presents  a challenging clinical scenario.  Historically,  systemic 
therapy alone produced median survival of only [ADDRESS_1038780] improvements. Overall, the risk benefit ratio of re -irradiation was 
questionable in many of these “curable”  patients.  
Therapeutic advances, such as the use of multi -modality therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], have significantly  
improved  survival  of advanced- stage HNSCC patients  over the past 10-15 years  (3-5). 
However, still 30 -40% of patients have recurrences ( 1, 2). There has been little improvement 
in survival  for patients  who have locoregional  or metastatic  recurrence.  Chemotherapeutic  
agents  employed in the management  of locally  recurrent  and/or  metastatic  HNSCC have 
response rates  in the range of 10-40% (6-11). Unfortunately,  the duration of response is 
limited (2 -4 months) and survival advantage has not been shown beyond the median survival 
of 6-10 months ( 12, 13). 
Immunotherapy  has recently  become an attractive  option in HNSCC.  PD-[ADDRESS_1038781]  been  shown  to be expressed  in 
tumor  cells from both preclinical models  and clinical settings  of cancer  patients  undergoing  
immunotherapy ( 14, 15). Tumor expression of PD -L1 was tightly correlated with  clinical  
responsiveness  to nivolumab in the early  clinical trials,  supporting the adaptive immune 
resistance  hypothesis  (16). Both human  papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509]  (HPV) -positive and HPV-negative  
HNSCC have been  shown  to express  PD-L1 (17, 18). Nivolumab  is a potent  and highly  
selective  humanized monoclonal  antibody  that binds  PD-1 and blocks  the interaction between  
PD-1 and its ligands,  PD-L1 and PD-L2. A phase III clinical trial comparing nivolumab vs. 
investigator’s choice (IC) chemotherapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) in  patients  
with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC showed an overall survival (OS) benefit  with 
nivolumab (7.5 months median OS) vs IC chemotherapy (5.1 months) (HR 0.7, P=0.01)  and 
minimal toxicities  (19). Objective  response rate was 13% with nivolumab  versus  5.8%  with IC. 
In a subset analysis, patients with PD -L1 expression had higher response rates compared to 
patients without PD -L1 expression, and HPV -positive patients showed longer OS  compared 
to HPV-negative patients.  Although these are encouraging results,  the clinical benefit  was 
seen in only a limited  number  of patients.  Thus,  identification  of combination regimens  is 
urgent in the management of HNSCC. With long term follow up (a median follow up of   11.4 
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  12 of 55  
  
 
 
months), nivolumab continued to significantly outperform chemotherapy with a significantly  
superior overall survival (p=0.0048) (ASCO 2017 (20)).  
 
1.1.2.  The Role of Reirradiation in HNSCC 
With the advent of advanced radiation planning techniques (e.g. IMRT, VMAT), the feasibility  
and safety of re -irradiation has greatly improved, as has the therapeutic ratio. A recent  multi - 
institutional collaborative study (named MIRI) of over 400 patients treated with IMRT  based  
re-irradiation at 8 institutions, found that the overall acute grade 4- 5 toxicity was only  5.6%,  
and grades  ≥3 late toxicity  was only 13% at two years.  Overall,  the 2-yr (40%)  and 5-yr (22%)  
survival rates compared favorably to historical data ( 21). Most importantly, a recursive 
portioning analysis identified three distinct subgroups of patients with 2 -yr OS of 62%,  40% 
and 17%, respectively, for classes I, II and III ( 21). This finding underscores the  suboptimal  
outcomes  in class  III patients  (e.g. <[ADDRESS_1038782] and planned second RT courses  
and in patients  with pre-re-irradiation  gastrostomy  or tracheostomy  tubes)  for whom  prolonged  
conventionally  fractionated IMRT  based  re-irradiation may not be of benefit.  On the other  
hand,  IMRT  based re-irradiation produces  better  results  in patients  with class I (e.g. >[ADDRESS_1038783] -op re -irradiation) and class II disease (e.g. all others),  the 
associated 2 yr overall survival of 50% underscores the need for further improvements to this 
treatment  paradigm  in these  patients.  In a subset  analysis  of the MIRI  collaborative study,  the 
addition of systemic therapy  (platinum  or cetuximab based)  did not appear  to positively  impact  
outcomes.  
 
1.1.3.  Immunotherapy in  HNSCC 
This study  seeks  to investigate  the potential  benefit  of the addition  of adjuvant  immunotherapy  
to IMRT  based  re-irradiation in RPA Class  I and II patients  with RSP head  and neck  squamous  
cancer  (21). Targeted  immunotherapy  has resulted in improved survival  and durable objective  
responses  in different  solid tumors  and offers  a rationale for use in HNSCC (22). PD-L1 
expression  is observed  in close  to 68% of HNSCC patients  regardless  of HPV status  (23, 24). 
Furthermore immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) such as the PD -[ADDRESS_1038784] a significant  clinical activity  in heavily  pre-treated  patients  with HNSCC  
regardless of the HPV status ( 25). The results from Checkmate -141 a phase III  trial 
randomizing patients with recurrent or metastatic platinum -refractory HNSCC to  nivolumab 
versus  investigator’s  choice (IC) of chemotherapy,  have shown  a doubling of the 1-year overall  
survival  (OS)  (36.0%  versus 16.6%,  p= 0.0101)( 25, 26). The median OS was 7.5 vs. 5.1 
months for nivolumab vs. IC (HR 0.70, p = 0.01). OS by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 status was 8.7 vs. 4.6  months 
for PD -L1+ > 1% versus PD -L1 < 1%. Longer -term follow -up data (presented at ASCO  2017  
(20)) show  that nivolumab continued to show  a significant  survival  benefit  and better  tolerability 
vs IC in patients with platinum -refractory R/M HNSCC. At 11.4 -months minimum  follow- up, 
median OS (95% CI) was 7.7 months (5.7, 8.8) for nivolumab vs 5.1 months (4.0, 6.2) for  IC; 
HR (95%  CI) = 0.71 (0.55,  0.90);  P = 0.0048.  For nivolumab vs IC, the 18-mo OS rate was 
21.5%  vs 8.3%  and ORR was 13.3%  vs 5.8%.  Nivolumab  doubled  the median duration  of 
response vs IC (9.7 vs 4.0 months).  Grade 3–4 treatment -related  adverse event  rates  for 
nivolumab vs IC were 15.3% vs  36.0%.  
 
Data reported at the ESMO 2016 meeting indicated that patients receiving nivolumab had  a 
preservation of their quality of life measures compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. 
This supports  the use of nivolumab in a heavily  pre-treated  patient  population who are at high 
risk of recurrence and disease related mortality such as patients with re-irradiation.  
 
Data  from another  a single  arm study  in recurrent/metastatic  HNSCC treated  with 
pembrolizumab (N=132) showed an ORR 18%; with 71% of responses lasting > 12 months 
and including both PD-L1 + and PD-L1- disease.  The median progression free survival  was 2 
months (17% at 12 months) and median OS was 8 months ( 27). This led the FDA in  August  
Protocol Version 10.[ADDRESS_1038785] with this approach. Further data from a phase II expansion study using a fixed dose  
of pembrolizumab in patients  who failed  platinum  and cetuximab revealed an overall  response 
rate of close to 18% in this heavily pre- treated patient population (28). 
 
Given  these  initial exciting results  in patients  with advanced HNSCC,  there is strong  rationale  
for the addition of PD-[ADDRESS_1038786] IMRT re- irradiation  alone.  
 
1.1.4.  PD-1 and Nivolumab in HNSCC in the context of radiation therapy  
Immunotherapy  has now emerged as an alternative approach based on recent  success  in 
melanoma, lung and renal cell cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors and CTLA -4 inhibitors are  being  
investigated in HNSCC in both the recurrent/metastatic setting with recently  reported 
promising results  (26, 28) and in the definitive  setting with CTLA -4 inhibitors  (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  
Pembrolizumab,  a PD-[ADDRESS_1038787] promising 
response outcomes in HPV+ recurrent  HNSCC.  
The effects  of standard  of care therapy  on immune response (CD4(+),  CD8(+)  T cells, 
regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid- derived suppressor cells (MDSC)) in HNSCC  suggest  
an immunosuppressive effect. Standard chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy to both sites  of 
gross and elective risk nodal regions in HNSCC have been found to reduce circulating T  cell 
responses and upregulate MDSCs. PD -1 expression on CD4(+) T cells is upregulated by  2- 
fold after CRT. PD -1 blockade resulted in downregulation of MDSC, as well as  TAM,  
CD47/SIRP  pathway,  and upregulated  effector  T cells and dendritic  cells.  Lower  doses  of 
radiotherapy  without  chemotherapy  after surgery  for HPV+  OPC  may create  an optimal  
microscopic tumor microenvironment that promotes neo- antigen expression and an  abscopal  
effect without promoting a negative immunosuppressive environment. Combining this 
approach with PD -1 inhibition may lead to non- redundant immune response through  several 
pathways that is additive and sustained.  
PD-L1 and PD 1 expression may be virally  mediated in HNSCC,  and represent  a potential  
biomarker to blockage with checkpoint inhibitors ( 29). PD-L1 expression however is  variable  
and not clearly  understood.  HPV-SCC have also been shown in RNA  sequencing TCGA  data 
to express  PD-L1. It remains  unclear,  as to the optimal  method of PD-L1 measurement  for 
patient  stratification  for future  trials  or whether  PD-L1 expression predicts  for response  to 
checkpoint  inhibitors.  This has led to a search  for other  tumor  biomarkers  in addition  to 
immune cell profiling to refine patient selection. Somatic gene alterations in  HNSCC  
responsible for immune evasion, inflammation, and antigen presentation may play a role in 
response  to checkpoint  inhibition (30). Other  investigations  reported  in metastatic  solid tumors 
include possible association between checkpoint  response and genomic  instability  due to 
mismatch repair deficiency leading to immune stimulation against epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] ( 31), mutational  
burden and improved  outcomes  in melanoma and NSCLC with checkpoint  inhibitors  (32) and 
the possible correlation between neoantigen burden and response to  immunotherapy.

using a CMV -restimulation assay  of human peripheral  blood mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) 
followed  by [CONTACT_6428]- based  detection of IFN-γ production.  These data indicated that nivolumab, 
versus an isotype- matched control antibody, augmented IFN -γ secretion from  CMV -specific 
memory T cells in a dose -dependent  manner.

Summary of Nivolumab Clinical Activity in the Metastatic  Setting:  
The PK, clinical activity,  and safety  of nivolumab have  been  assessed  in approximately  [ADDRESS_1038790]  received nivolumab in 
single - or multiple -dose  Phase 1/2/3  studies  or studies  with nivolumab  in combination  with 
other therapeutics (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti -angiogenics, and targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  
 
In CA209003, the clinical activity of nivolumab was demonstrated in a variety of tumor  types, 
including melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC. Clinical activity was noted across a range of  doses  
(0.1 mg/kg,  0.3 mg/kg,  1 mg/kg,  3 mg/kg,  and 10 mg/kg).  In CA209003,  a total of [ADDRESS_1038791]  active  doses  were  3 and 10 mg/kg.  The overall  ORR of 17% was reported 
with a 48-week  progression- free survival  rate (PFSR)  of 22% (95%  CI: 15-30%),  and a 24- 
month  overall  survival  rate of 24% (95%  CI: 16-32%).  Only a single  response (1/33)  was 
reported at 1 mg/kg.  Durable  responses  were  observed in both squamous  and non-squamous  
subtypes.  
 
Historically,  ORR of 5% to 10% and median PFS (mPFS)  of 2 to 3 months  has been reported 
with docetaxel  treatment  in previously -treated  NSCLC subjects.  A complete response  (CR)  or 
partial  response  (PR) was reported  in 31% (95%  CI: 22% - 41%)  of the 107 response - 
evaluable subjects with melanoma treated with nivolumab monotherapy Q2W at  doses 
ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg  in CA209- 003. Responses  were  durable with a PFSR  at 24 
weeks of 38% (95% CI: 28- 47%) and OS at 24 months of 48% (95% CI:  38-57%).  
 
In CA209017, a phase 3 trial in 272 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC with  
progression on or after platinum -based chemotherapy, subjects were randomized to 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV q2 week  (n=135)  or docetaxel  (n=137)  at 75 mg/m2  every  3 weeks.  
Median OS was 9.2 months in the nivolumab group (95% CI: 7.3- 13.3) vs 6.0 months in the 
docetaxel group (95% CI: 5.1- 7.3) (HR of 0.59,  P=0.[ZIP_CODE]).  
 
Summary of Nivolumab Safety in the Metastatic  Setting  
In clinical trials,  nivolumab has demonstrated an acceptable benefit -risk across  multiple  tumor 
types, including advanced melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, and some lymphomas. The two  clinical 
trials  that have  contributed the most  to the clinical experiences  of nivolumab  monotherapy  are 
studies CA209003 and CA209037. Overall, the safety profile is quite similar between  these 
two studies and is discussed further in the sections below. CA209003 is a completed  Phase 
[ADDRESS_1038792]  previously  treated 
advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and  hormone - 
refractory  prostate  cancer.  Subjects  received  nivolumab at doses  of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg 
intravenously  every  2 weeks,  up to a maximum  of 2 years  of total therapy.  A total of 306 
subjects  were  treated with nivolumab in the dose  range  of 0.1 - 10 mg/kg.  No maximal 
tolerated dose was identified in CA209003.  
 
The incidence,  severity  and relationship of AEs were  generally  similar  across  dose levels  and 
tumor types. Nivolumab related AEs of any grade occurred in 75.2% of subjects. Of the  306 
treated subjects,  303 (99.0%)  subjects  have  at least  [ADDRESS_1038793]  frequently  reported  AEs were fatigue (54.9%),  decreased  appetite  (35.0%),  diarrhea  
(34.3%), nausea (30.1%), and cough (29.4%). Treatment -related AEs were reported in 230 
(75.2%)  of the [ADDRESS_1038794]  frequently  reported treatment -related AEs were  fatigue 
(28.1%), rash (14.7%), diarrhea (13.4%), and pruritus (10.5%). Most treatment -related  AEs 
were low grade. Treatment -related high grade (Grade 3- 4) AEs were reported in 52  (17.0%)  
of subjects.  The most  common treatment -related high grade AEs were  fatigue (2.3%)  and

diarrhea (1%). Drug- related SAEs occurred in 11.5% of subjects. Grade [ADDRESS_1038795]  2  subjects  included:  diarrhea (3 subjects, 1.0%),  pneumonitis  
(3 subjects,  1.0%),  pneumonia (2 subjects,  0.7%)  and lipase  increased  (2 subjects,  0.7%).  
Select AE categories (events with a potential inflammatory mechanism requiring more 
frequent monitoring and/or unique intervention such as immune -suppressants  and/or  
endocrine replacement  therapy)  include:  GI AEs,  pulmonary  AEs,  renal  AEs,  hepatic  AEs,  skin 
AEs, and endocrinopathies. In addition, select AEs include  a  category  for  infusion reactions 
Table 1). Each category is composed of a discrete set of preferred terms,  including those  of 
greatest  clinical relevance.  These  select  AEs are considered events  of interest  based  on the 
mechanism  of action  and were  previously  referred  to as immune -related AEs or immune -
mediated AEs. Most high grade events resolved following the treatment  guidelines  for the 
treatment  of pulmonary  events,  GI events,  hepatic  events,  renal  events,  and endocrine events,  
respectively.  Overall,  the safety  profile  at 3 mg/kg (n = 54) was similar  to safety  profile across 
the dose ranges from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg (n =  306).

study of nivolumab (3 mg/kg administered by [CONTACT_33980] [IV] infusion every 2 weeks  [Q2W]) 
vs investigator’s choice therapy in subjects with previously -treated advanced melanoma.  As 
of 30-Apr-2014,  [ADDRESS_1038798]  been treated  with 3 mg/kg IV nivolumab  in CA209037 with 
safety  results  as outlined below  (source  document  interim  CSR,  DCN930081508)  111 that are 
consistent with the Phase 1 experience of  CA209003.  
 
In CA209037, nivolumab related AEs of any grade occurred in 67.5% of subjects. Of the  268 
subjects treated with nivolumab, 255 (95.1%) subjects had at least [ADDRESS_1038799] frequently reported treatment -related AEs were fatigue (25.0%), 
pruritus  (16.0%),  diarrhea (11.2%),  and nausea (9.3%).  Most  treatment -related AEs were low 
grade.  
 
Treatment -related high grade (Grade 3-4) AEs were  reported in 24 (9.0%)  of subjects.  The 
most  common treatment -related high grade AEs were  fatigue (0.7 %), anemia (0.7%),  diarrhea  
(0.4%),  and vomiting  (0.4%).  Drug -related SAEs  occurred in 4.5%  of subjects.  Grade 3-[ADDRESS_1038800] 2 subjects included diarrhea (2 subjects, 0.7%). In addition,  
drug- related SAE of hyperglycemia occurred in 0.7%.  
 
Select AE categories (events with a potential inflammatory mechanism requiring more 
frequent monitoring and/or unique intervention such as immunosuppressants  and/or  
endocrine replacement therapy)  were:  
• Skin (29.1%) including pruritus (16.0%) and rash  (9.3%)  
• GI (11.6%) including diarrhea (11.2%) and colitis  (1.1%)  
• Endocrine (7.8%) including hypothyroidism (7.8%) and hyperthyroidism  (1.9%)  
• Hepatic (4.5%) including AST increased (4.1%) and ALT increased  (2.6%)  
• Pulmonary (2.2%) including pneumonitis  (1.9%)  
• Hypersensitivity/infusion reaction  (1.9%)  
• Renal (1.5%) including increased creatinine (0.7%), increased urea (0.4%),  and 
tubulointerstitial nephritis  (0.4%)  
 
In general, these select AEs were considered by [CONTACT_41066],  
except  for AEs in the hepatic  and renal  select  AE categories.  There were  few high- grade select  
adverse  events  (n = 20), and the majority  of high- grade  events  (13 of 20) subsequently  
resolved, including those for which immunosuppressive therapy was not initiated.  Treatment - 
related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 6 (2.2%) of the [ADDRESS_1038801] experienced 
drug- related grade 5 hypoxias, possibly pneumonitis, in the setting of lymphangitic spread 
and possible pneumonia.  
 
Taken together, these data from studies from CA209003 and CA209037 highlight  the 
acceptable  safety  profile  with similar  trends  in AEs in the 574 subjects  treated with nivolumab  
in these 2 studies. Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results  from 
other clinical studies, are also available in the BMS -936558 (nivolumab)  IB. 
 
In addition,  Nivolumab  has been studied in the phase I portion of the RTOG  3504  trial in which  
it was seen to be safe to combine with head  and neck  radiotherapy  and cisplatin  based  
chemotherapy. Similarly, other PD -1 inhibitors are being actively investigated in a phase III 
setting with concurrent  radiotherapy  with or without  other  systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As such,  an 
adequate experience of a favorable safety  profile  supports  the anticipated safety  of this 
combination without other cytotoxic chemotherapy and no specific safety run- in is required.

2. RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES, AND BENEFIT -RISK  ASSESSMENT  
 
2.1. RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE  TRIAL  
This study  seeks  to investigate  the potential  benefit  of the addition  of adjuvant  immunotherapy  
to IMRT  based re-irradiation in RPA Class  I and II patients  with locoregional  recurrent  or 
second primary (RSP) head and neck squamous cancer. Our hypothesis is that  nivolumab  
will lead to an improved  disease control  in this population at high risk of relapse which  will 
translate into an improved 1 year progression -free survival (PFS) compared to the  standard 
re-irradiation with IMRT. We also believe based on the recent PRO data presented at  ESMO 
2016, that nivolumab will preserve the quality of life in this heavily pre- treated patient  
population.  Given  these  initial exciting  results  in patients  with advanced head and neck 
squamous cancer, there is strong rationale for the addition of PD -[ADDRESS_1038802]  IMRT 
re-irradiation with or without other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758635].  
 
2.2. TRIAL  OBJECTIVES 
 
2.2.1.  Primary  Objective  
To assess  the 1-year PFS for patients  with recurrent  or second  primary  head  and neck

within [ADDRESS_1038806]  had chemotherapy  or biological  therapy  within  4 weeks  of registration.  
8- Uncontrolled  intercurrent  illness  including,  but not limited  to, ongoing or active  infection, 
autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids, symptomatic congestive heart  failure,  
unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations  that 
would limit compliance with study  requirements.  
9- Patients who are pregnant or  breast -feeding 
10- Patients with known active HIV, Hep B, or Hep C  infection  
11- Subjects  with a condition requiring  systemic  treatment  with either  corticosteroids  (> 10

disease.  
 
3.1.3.  Discontinuation  Criteria  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the following criteria applies:  
- Patients  with grade  [ADDRESS_1038807]  not receive further  treatment  with 
nivolumab 
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  19 of 55  
  
 
 
- If radiotherapy is interrupted for > 3 consecutive weeks, patient’s protocol treatment  will 
be discontinued.  
- Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If at any time the constraints of this protocol  are 
detrimental to the patient's health, the protocol treatment should be discontinued.  
- Patients  who develop progressive  disease  will be discontinued from the protocol  therapy.  
- Patients who develop unacceptable toxicity will be discontinued from the protocol 
therapy.  
- Patients  may withdraw  consent  and withdraw from the study  at any time for any reason.  
 
3.1.4.  Premature Discontinuation of Patients from the Study 
Those who discontinue protocol therapy early will be followed for response until  progression 
and for survival  for [ADDRESS_1038808] be used.  VMAT 
and Cyberknife technologies will be allowed.  
 
Treatment  plan:  
 
RT will be given as 60-66Gy in 30-33 once daily  fractions.  Nivolumab  will be given 2 
weeks  prior  to the initiation  of IMRT  (week  -2), and every  2 weeks  for 4 more  doses 
during radiation (weeks 0, 2, 4, 6) (240 mg over 30- 60 minutes IV each dose, for a  total 
of 5 doses). After the completion of IMRT, nivolumab will be given on a q4wk  schedule  
for  an  additional  10  treatments  ([ADDRESS_1038809] an immobilization device (e.g. Aquaplast mask) made prior to  treatment 
planning CT scan. Use of an immobilizing mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_758637],  or the hard palate/paranasal  region.  It is preferable 
to perform  treatment  planning CT scan  with IV contrast  if there are no medical  
contraindications to the use of contrast. The treatment planning CT scan must be  performed  
with the immobilization  device  and in the treatment  position.  Slice  thickness should be 0.3 cm 
or thinner.  
 
4.2.3.  Target  Delineation  
In setting of gross disease: In the setting of gross disease, the gross tumor volume (GTV)  is 
defined as any tumor visible on imaging and/or physical exam. The Clinical Target  Volume 
(CTV_66) is defined as the GTV plus an additional 3- 5mm expansion that includes  adjacent  
tissue at risk but respects normal tissue boundaries to tumor spread (e.g. bone,  uninvolved 
muscle, etc).   Generally an elective nodal volume will not be targeted.  However, there   are 
Protocol Version 10.[ADDRESS_1038810]  of the nerve to the skull 
base. The Planning Target Volume (PTV_66) should be a 3mm isotropic expansion around 
CTV_66. If a CTV_56.1 is used, then a 3mm isotropic expansion around it will be generated 
to create the PTV_56.1.  This volume should be given in 33 fractions.  
 
In high risk postoperative  setting  
There is no gross tumor volume in the postoperative patient. However, the tumor/involved 
nodal  bed should be included in the CTV_60Gy.  Areas  that are surgically  dissected but 
uninvolved with tumor  (e.g. elective  neck  dissection  that is negative for disease)  should 
generally not be targeted. However, there are several instances where an optional  CTV_54  
can be used to target adjacent tissue for select patients with high risk of microscopic  disease  
extent.  Examples  may include pathologically  proven multifocal  nodal  disease,  in which  a 
CTV_54 can target an adjacent uninvolved nodal echelon to provide margin on the involved  
nodes,  or disease that is grossly  involving  a cranial  nerve for which  a CTV_54 can be used to 
target  the pathway  of the nerve  to the skull base.  The Planning Target  Volume (PTV_60) 
should be a 3mm  isotropic  expansion around CTV_60.  If a CTV_54 is used,  then a 3mm 
isotropic expansion around it will be generated to create the PTV_54. This volume should be 
given in [ADDRESS_1038811],  cochlea,  mandible,  constrictors, 
esophagus, trachea, oral cavity, glottis/supraglottic larynx, supraglottis, lips and parotid  and 
submandibular salivary glands. Any of these structures surgically removed or absent can  be 
ignored.  The carotid artery  should  also be contoured.  For tumors  near the low neck,  the 
brachial  plexus  must  be contoured.  For tumors  near the skull base,  the following  should also 
be included: eyes, lenses, optic nerves, optic chiasm, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117].  
 
4.2.5.  Treatment Planning and Delivery  
Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation is required. Inverse planning using intensity 
modulated  RT or Cyberknife  is mandatory.  Static  beam  intensity  modulation or volumetric  arc 
based planning are acceptable for planning.  Proton therapy is not  allowed.  
 
4.2.6.  Image Guidance for  IGRT  
IGRT with daily conebeam CT is required. If a cone beam CT is not available, portal  images 
or other  on board  imaging  should be used  daily.  Region- of-Interest  (ROI)  or “clip box” for fusion  
should be set to encompass  the PTV and adjacent  spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102].  When  the skull base is 
targeted, the globes and optic nerves should routinely be included, if possible, for  alignment  
purposes. Following the registration, the translational and (if the appropriate technology  is 
available) rotational corrections should be applied to the treatment couch. If all the  variances 
are less than 10 mm (this typi[INVESTIGATOR_758638]),  the 
treatment can proceed with appropriate corrections; however, re- imaging is not mandatory.  If 
one or more  of the corrections  are larger  than [ADDRESS_1038812]  be repeated in addition  
to performing  table/positioning adjustments.  However,  the use of numerous  repeat  IGRT  
studies should be avoided (see next  section).

4.2.7.  Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs)  
NOTE:  Only the parts  of the normal  tissues/organs  at risk outside the PTVs  will be considered 
for dose  optimization  purposes,  except  for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758639].  Only those  OAR  that 
are in proximity  to the treatment  volume  must  be contoured.  Contouring OAR  that are far from 
the treated area and will receive negligible doses is  unnecessary.  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: The cord begins at the cranial -cervical junction (ie, the top of the C1 
vertebral body). Superior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior  
border  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758640]  T3-4 (ie, just below  the lowest  
slice level that has PTV on it). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_758641].  In addition,  however,  a Planning Risk Volume (PRV)  spi[INVESTIGATOR_758642]: 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_280496]_05 = cord + 5 mm in all  directions.  
 
Brain  Stem:  The inferior  most  portion of the brainstem  is at the cranial -cervical  junction where 
it meets  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102].  For the purposes  of this study,  the superior  most  portion of the 
brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior clinoid. The brainstem  shall 
be defined based on the treatment planning CT scan. In addition, however, a Planning Risk 
Volume (PRV)  brainstem  shall be defined as: BrainStem_03  = brainstem  + 3 mm in all 
directions.  
 
Globe of the eye:  Self-explanatory  
Optic Nerve:  Self-explanatory  
Optic Chiasm:  Self-explanatory  
Cochlea:  Self-explanatory  
Carotid  Artery:  This will include the carotid  artery  at the same  level of the PTV plus an 
additional  2cm cranial  and caudal  to the level of the PTV.  When  the PTV is located  above  the 
carotid bifurcation, only the internal carotid artery (not the external branch) should  be 
contoured.  
 
Lips: The definition of lips is  self-explanatory.  
 
Oral Cavity:  The oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure  posterior  to lips consisting 
of the anterior 1/2 to 2/3 of the oral tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and superiorly  the 
palate, and inferiorly to the plane containing the tip of the  mandible.  
 
Parotid  Glands:  Parotid  glands  will be defined in their entirety  (superficial  and deep  lobes)  
based on the treatment planning CT scan.  
 
Submandibular  Glands:  Submandibular  glands  will be defined in their entirety  based  on 
treatment planning CT  scans.  
 
Pharynx:  This will be defined as the pharyngeal  wall plus adjacent  constrictor  muscles deemed  
not to require treatment (external to PTVs). This extends from the superior constrictor  region  
(level  of the inferior  pterygoid plates)  to the cricopharyngeal  inlet (level  of the posterior  cricoid 
cartilage).  
 
Esophagus:  This will be defined as the cervical  or superior  (S) esophagus,  a tubular  structure 
that starts at the bottom of pharynx (cricopharyngeal inlet) and extends to the thoracic  inlet.  
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  22 of 55  
  
 
 
Glottic/Supraglottic  Larynx:  This will be defined as the glottic  and supraglottic  larynx,  including  
the tip of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050],  the aryepi[INVESTIGATOR_696587],  arytenoids,  false  cords,  and true cords,  bounded  
by [CONTACT_758678], anteriorly including the anterior edge of the pre- epi[INVESTIGATOR_758643], 
and posteriorly bounded by [CONTACT_758679]/or cricoid cartilage.  
 
Mandible:  This includes  the entire  bony  structure  of the mandible from TMJ through the 
symphysis. It is recognized that for oral cavity cancers, this may overlap with PTVs.  
 
Brachial  Plexus:  The defined ipsilateral  brachial  plexus  originates  from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758644] C5 to T2. However,  for the 
purposes of this protocol, only the major trunks of the brachial plexus will be contoured  using  
the subclavian and axillary vessels as a surrogate for identifying the location of the  brachial  
plexus. This neurovascular complex will be contoured starting proximally at the bifurcation of 
the brachiocephalic  trunk  into the jugular/subclavian veins  (or carotid/subclavian arteries)  and 
following along the route of the subclavian vein to the axillary vein ending after  the 
neurovascular structures cross the second rib. 
 
Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets  (E-PTV):  This will be defined  as tissue  located  
between the skull base and thoracic inlet external to all PTVs and defined normal  structures 
within the external contour of the patient.  
 
Skin:  This will be defined  as an inner  ring of tissue  comprising the external  skin and the tissue 
3mm underneath it. 
4.2.8.  Dose Prescription  
Doses to  PTVs  
All plans must be normalized such that 95% of the volume of the prescription PTV  (PTV_66 
for gross  disease;  PTV_60  for postoperative  cases)  is covered  with the prescription  dose 
(66Gy or 60Gy respectively). At 1 cc PTV_66 volume or PTV_60 volume on the DVH  curve, 
the dose should not be > 110% of the prescribed dose. Ideally, less than 10% of PTV_66  or 
PTV_60 should receive  105%  of the prescription dose  (69.3Gy  or 63.5Gy  respectively).  
However,  up to 20% of PTV_66 or PTV_60  can receive  105%  of the prescription dose  (69.3Gy 
or 63.5Gy)  to allow for meeting dose constraints.  For any volume  of tissue  outside the PTV(s) 
that has a size of 1 cc or more,  the dose should not be > 66 Gy for definitive  cases  and >60Gy 
for postoperative cases.  
 
Doses to Normal  Structures 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: The cumulatibe dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_62402] 52Gy. In the  event  
that the old plan is not available for review,  the dose  to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758645] 
10Gy  and preferably  be less than 8Gy to any volume  in excess  of 0.03 cc (approximately  3 
mm x 3 mm x  3 mm).  
In treatment planning, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758646].  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_290208] : The cumulative dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_445154] 55Gy.  In 
the event that the old plan is not available for review, the dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_758647]. The Spi[INVESTIGATOR_758648] 16Gy and ideally less than 14Gy.  
Brainstem: The cumulative dose to the brainstem should ideally be limited to 0.03cc to 60Gy.  
However, if disease is in close proximity to brainstem and requires higher doses, especially if 
the original RT course exceeded this dose, this is acceptable.  Ideally the m ax dose per 
fraction to the brainstem should be <1Gy per fraction.  If the disease mandates exceeding this 
constraint, the patient should be informed of the risks of severe or life threatening toxicity.    In 
the event that the old plan is not available fo r review the brainstem should not exceed 12Gy to 
any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm) and preferably should be less than 10Gy and the PRVbrainstem (brainstem +3mm) should be limited to 16Gy.  
However, if disease is in extremel y close proximity to the brainstem, this may need to be 
exceeded.  In this case, Ideally the max dose per fraction to the brainstem should be <1Gy 
Protocol Version 10.[ADDRESS_1038813].  
Optic Nerves and Chiasm: The cumulative dose to the optic structures should not  exceed  
55 Gy. In the event  the that old plan is not available for review,  the dose  to the optic  structures 
should not exceed a max dose of 10Gy to any volume greater than 0/03cc. In the rare  event 
that a single optic nerve is involved with tumor, these constraints can be violated to achieve 
coverage  of thetuor.  However  this would  not apply  to the optic  chiasm  or bilateral  optic  nerves.  
Orbits: Should be limited to a cumulative max dose of 50Gy including previous  radiation.  
Lips:  Reduce the dose  as much as possible.  The mean dose should  be < 20 Gy when  
possible.  
Oral Cavity:  Reduce the dose as much  as possible.  The mean dose should be < 30 Gy when  
possible.  
Parotid Glands (not targeted): In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than  the 
other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid gland to receive a  mean 
dose of <26  Gy. 
Submandibular gland (not targeted): If level Ib is not a target, aim to reduce mean 
contralateral submandibular gland to < 39  Gy. 
OARpharynx/constrictors:  Reduce  the dose  as much  as possible.  Some  recommended  (but 
not mandatory) treatment goals include: 1) No more than 33% of the OARpharynx  exceeds  
50Gy; 2) Mean dose < 45 Gy; 3) No more than 15% of the OARpharynx exceeds 60  Gy. 
Cervical  Esophagus:  Reduce the dose as much  as possible.  Some  recommended (but 
treatment goals include: Mean dose < 30 Gy. 
Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL): Reduce the dose as much as possible. The  glottic  
larynx mean dose is recommended to be <25 Gy. 
Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible. Hot spots within the mandible should be 
avoided.  It is recommended that maximum dose  within  the mandible be < 66 Gy, except  in 
areas overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_127105].  
Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets: No more than 1cc of unspecified tissue outside  
the targets can receive 66 Gy or  more  
Brachial Plexus: The dose to the plexus should be limited as much as possible. The plexus  
can never exceed 66Gy unless it is clinically involved with tumor. If it is uninvolved, it  should  
be limited to <30Gy whenever  possible.  
 
4.2.9.  Radiation Therapy Treatment  Interruptions  
Treatment  interruptions  are strongly  discouraged.  Treatment  breaks  must  be clearly  indicated 
in the treatment  record  when they occur.  Patients  who have treatment  interruptions  in radiation  
for >3 weeks  will be taken  off study.  The interruption of radiation therapy  for grade  4 mucositis  
/ dermatitis  / dysphagia  is at the discretion  of the treating  radiation  oncologist.  Treatment 
breaks,  if necessary,  ideally  should not exceed five treatment  days  at a time and ten treatment 
days  total. Treatment  breaks  should be allowed  only for resolution of severe  acute  toxicity 
and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical  reasons.  
 
 
4.3. NIVOLUMAB ADMINISTRATION:  
 
4.3.1.  Administration of  Nivolumab  
 
4.3.1.  Administration of  Nivolumab  
Nivolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of [ADDRESS_1038814] fraction  of 
radiation (+/- 5 days),  and continued every  2 weeks  (+/- 3 days).  Nivolumab  will thus be given  
in at -2 weeks, then week 0, 2, 4 and 6. Adjuvant nivolumab will then be given for a total  of 10 
additional doses after the completion of radiotherapy every 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days).  
 
There are no premedications for nivolumab  recommended.  
Protocol Version 10.[ADDRESS_1038815] dose  are allowable  (any dose  
delays  greater  than these will require approval  from the local principal  investigator).  
 
Tumor  assessments  for all subjects  should continue as per protocol  even  if dosing is delayed. 
Nivolumab should be delayed for the  following:  
• Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug- related adverse event,  except  for fatigue and laboratory 
abnormalities  
• Any Grade ≥ 3 skin drug -related AE 
• Any Grade ≥ 3 drug- related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions  for 
lymphopenia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  or 
total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or  lipase:  
o Grade [ADDRESS_1038816], ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1  toxicity 
range, delay dosing for drug- related Grade ≥ 3  toxicity  
o Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related amylase  or lipase  abnormality  that is not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require  dose 
delay. The local principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_482493] ≥  3 
amylase or lipase abnormalities.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter -current illness which, in the judgment of  the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study  medication.  
• NOTE:  Grade  3 dysphagia,  dehydration,  mucositis  and pain are routinely  encountered  
during reirradiation and will not require a delay in Nivolumab administration.  
 
4.3.3.  Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation Due to Drug -Related  AE(s)  
Treatment  with nivolumab should be permanently  discontinued for any of the following:  
 
• Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis  or eye pain or blurred vision  that does  not respond to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_758649] 1 severity  within  the re-treatment  period  
OR requires systemic  treatment  
• Any Grade 3 drug- related bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion 
reaction, regardless of duration  
• Any Grade 3 non -skin, drug- related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following 
exceptions for uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic 
toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires 
discontinuation.  
• Any Grade 3 neurologic toxicity including encephalitis required discontinuation of Nivolumab.  
• Any Grade 3 drug-related  endocrinopathies  adequately  controlled with only physiologic  
hormone replacement do not require  discontinuation.  
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  25 of 55  
  
 
 
• Any Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment  
discontinuation except:  
o Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia > [ADDRESS_1038817] (LFT) abnormality that meets the  following  
criteria require discontinuation 
 AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1038818] for > 2 weeks  
 AST or ALT > 10x  ULN 
 Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1038819] 
 Concurrent AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1038820] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1038821] 
• Any Grade 4 drug- related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for  the 
following events, which do not require discontinuation:  
o Grade 4 neutropenia ≤  7 days  
o Grade 4 lymphopenia or  leukopenia 
o Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated  with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade 4 
within 1 week of onset. The local principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_758650] 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities  
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not  associated  
with clinical sequelae and are corrected with  supplementation/appropriate 
management within 72 hours of their  onset  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgment  of the Investigator,  presents  a substantial  clinical risk to the subject  with 
continued nivolumab dosing.  
 
4.3.4.  Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing  
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab when the drug -related AE(s) resolve(s)  to 
Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions:  
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.  
• Subjects  who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
• Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_1038822]/ALT and total bilirubin values  meeting 
discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently  discontinued.  
• Drug -related  pulmonary  toxicity,  diarrhea,  or colitis  must  have  resolved to baseline  
before  treatment  is resumed.  Subjects  with persistent  Grade  [ADDRESS_1038823] tapered down to  an 
equivalent dose of prednisone ≤  10 mg/day.  
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic  hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.  
• Dose delay of nivolumab which results in treatment interruption of > [ADDRESS_1038824]  with fever,  chills,  rigors,  headache,  rash,  pruritus,  arthralgias, 
hypo-  or hypertension,  bronchospasm,  or other  symptoms.  All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported within  24 hours  as an SAE if criteria  are met. Infusion  reactions  should be 
graded according to National  Institute  of cancer  (NCI)  common  terminology  criteria  for adverse  
event (CTCAE, Version 4.03)  guidelines.  
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  26 of 55  
  
 
 
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on  local 
treatment standards and guidelines, as  appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)  
• Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions:  diphenhydramine 
50 mg (or equivalent)  and/or  acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1038825]  30 minutes  before  
additional nivolumab administrations.  
 
For Grade  2 symptoms:  (moderate reaction requires  therapy  or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non- steroidal  anti- 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids];  prophylactic  
medications indicated for ≤  24 hours)  
• Stop the nivolumab infusion,  begin an IV infusion  of normal  saline,  and treat the subject 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent)  and/or  acetaminophen  325 to 1000  mg; 
remain at bedside and monitor  subject  until resolution of symptoms.  Corticosteroid 
and/or  bronchodilator  therapy  may also be administered as appropriate.  If the infusion  
is interrupted,  then restart  the infusion  at 50% of the original  infusion  rate when 
symptoms resolve;  if no further  complications  ensue after 30 minutes,  the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If  symptoms 
recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.  Administer 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1038826] be recorded on the 
electronic case report form  (eCRF).  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are  recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 -1000 mg  should 
be administered >30 minutes before nivolumab infusion. If necessary,  corticosteroids  
(up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_758651]/or  brief interruption of infusion];  recurrence  of symptoms 
following  initial improvement;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_758652] [eg, renal 
impairment,  pulmonary  infiltrates].  Grade 4: Life threatening;  pressor  or ventilatory  support 
indicated).  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal  saline 
and treat the subject  as follows:  Recommend  bronchodilators,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  0.2 to 1 mg 
of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000  
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV  with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be 
monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not  recur.  
Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow  their 
institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and 
monitor subject until recovery of the symptoms.  
 
In case of late- occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, 
oral antihistamine or  corticosteroids).  
 
4.3.6.  Duration of  Nivolumab  
Nivolumab  will be given for a total of 15 doses  (1 before  RT, 4 during radiation therapy  and 10 
following completion of radiation), or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal  of consent,  or the study  ends,  whichever  occurs first. For all subjects,  global  
Protocol Version 10.0

deterioration of health  status  requiring discontinuation of treatment  without  objective evidence  
of disease progression at that time is allowed, if  necessary.  
4.3.7.  Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
The FACT- HN and FACT- G (Appendix 2) Quality of Life (QOL) assessments will  be 
performed at baseline, end of IMRT, and weeks 18, 30, 52, and 104. Patients who do  not 
have QOL collected or refuse QOL completion will not be considered a protocol  deviation.  
Paper  or electronic  questionnaires  may be completed by [CONTACT_102].  A copy  of the 
responses needs to be kept in the study subject’s research  binder.  
 
4.3.8.  Nivolumab Dose Levels 
There will be no dose reductions allowed for nivolumab; delays will be allowed as detailed in 
the section describing nivolumab administration.  
 
4.3.9.  Nivolumab Packaging, Labelling, and Storage  
Please refer to the Investigators Brochure for detailed information. Medication numbers  will 
be unique to each bottle and will be used for tracking purposes  only.  
 
Supply 
Nivolumab is supplied in a 100 mg/ [ADDRESS_1038827] be stored in accordance with the instructions on the label (Refer  to 
investigator  brochure.  Supplies  must  be kept refrigerated  (2 – 8 deg C). Do not freeze  and 
protect from  light).  
 
Drug  Accountability  
Investigational  supply  of Nivolumab  is obtained  from Bristol  Myers  Squibb.  Drug  supplies,  will 
be kept in a secure, limited access storage area under the storage conditions.  Where  
necessary, a temperature log must be maintained to make certain that the drug supplies  are 
stored at the correct  temperature.  
 
The responsible person must maintain records of the product’s delivery to the study site,  the 
inventory at the site and the use by [CONTACT_6904]. The Principal Investigator (and  participating  
site investigators) are responsible for all destructions/disposals of partially used and unused  
supplies.  Supplies  are not to be shipped back  to BMS.  BMS  only needs  to be notified of 
dtestructions/disposals of partially used samples. A copy of the drug destruction certificate 
must be maintained for provision to BMS at the end of the  study.  
 
These records  will include dates,  quantities,  batch/serial  numbers,  expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061]  (“use  by”) dates,  and 
the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product(s) and study patients.  The 
responsible person will maintain records  that document  adequately  that the patients  were 
provided the doses specified by [CONTACT_758680](s)  received 
from BMS. The responsible person must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies  
have been returned by [CONTACT_758681].

4.4. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH  NIVOLUMAB 
 
4.4.1.  Management of immunological toxicities following treatment with  nivolumab  
A proactive and early  approach  to management  of immunological  toxicities  is crucial.  The 
toxicities  can be managed by a variety  of treatment  options  to relieve  symptoms  and to reduce 
the risk of worsening symptoms.  
 
4.4.2.  Management of non -immunological toxicities following treatment  with 
nivolumab  
A proactive and early  approach  to management  of immunological  toxicities  is crucial.  The 
toxicities  can be managed by a variety  of treatment  options  to relieve  symptoms  and to reduce 
the risk of worsening symptoms.  
 
4.4.4.   Treatment  Compliance  
Records of study medication used, dosages administered and intervals between visits will  be 
recorded by [CONTACT_24355].  
 
 
4.5.      ENDPOINTS OF  SAFETY  
Safety  of nivolumab  will be evaluated  as indicated  by [CONTACT_758682], graded according to US NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. Safety endpoints  include:  
 
• Events leading to dose  holding  
• Events leading to permanent treatment  discontinuation 
• The overall  incidence and CTC criteria  grade of adverse events,  as well as relatedness  of 
adverse events to  treatment  
• Causes of  death  
 
 
5. ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS AND  REPORTING  
 
5.1. ADVERSE EVENT  DEFINITION  
An Adverse  Event  (AE) is defined  as any new untoward  medical  occurrence  or worsening  of 
a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study  drug 
and that does  not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory  finding),  
symptom,  or disease temporally  associated with the use of investigational  product,  whether  or 
not considered related to the investigational  product.  
 
Adverse events  can be spontaneously  reported  or elicited  during open -ended questioning,  
examination,  or evaluation of a subject.  (In order  to prevent  reporting bias,  subjects  should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
 
 
5.2. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  DEFINITION  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:  
• results in  death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at  the 
time of the event;  it does  not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have caused 
death if it were more  severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE  below)  
Protocol Version 10.0 
Page  29 of 55  
  
 
 
• results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important  medical  event  (defined as a medical  event(s)  that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical  
and scientific  judgment,  may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention  [eg, 
medical,  surgical]  to prevent  one of the other  serious  outcomes  listed  in the definition  
above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or  convulsions  
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the 
study drug is an  SAE.  
 
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are  not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as  SAEs.  
 
Any component  of a study  endpoint  that is considered related to study  therapy  should be 
reported as an SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to  anaphylaxis,  
anaphylaxis must be  reported).  
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_758653]:  
• a visit to the emergency  room  or other  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737401]  < 24 hours,  that does  not result  
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status  (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these  cases.  
• Admission  encountered  for another  life circumstance  that carries  no bearing on health  
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing,  economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission  for administration of anticancer  therapy  in the absence  of any other  SAEs 
(applies to oncology  protocols)  
 
 
5.3. INTENSITY OF ADVERSE EVENT  
The intensity of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the  Common  
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 in the CRF.  
 
 
5.4. CA[LOCATION_003]L RELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EVENT  
The causal  relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to 
assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:  
 
Related:  There is a reasonable causal  relationship  between study  drug administration and the 
AE. 
 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration  
and the  AE. 
 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship"  means  there  is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship.  
Protocol Version 10.0

5.5. ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
• All Serious  Adverse Events  (SAEs)  that occur  following  the subject’s  written  consent  to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_1038828]  be collected  that relate  to any later protocol -specified procedure  (eg, a follow- up skin 
biopsy).  
• Following  the subject’s  written  consent  to participate in the study,  all SAEs,  whether  related 
or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated  with 
protocol -specified procedures.  The investigator  should report  any SAE occurring after 
these aforementioned  time periods,  which  is believed to be related  to study  drug or 
protocol -specified procedure.  
• An SAE report  should be completed for any event  where doubt  exists  regarding its 
seriousness;  
• If the investigator  believes  that an SAE is not related to study  drug,  but is potentially  related 
to the conditions  of the study  (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy  or a complication of 
a study  procedure),  the relationship should be specified  in the narrative section  of the SAE 
Report  Form.  
• If the BMS  safety  address  is not included  in the protocol  document  (eg, multicenter  studies  
where events are reported centrally), the procedure for safety reporting must  be 
reviewed/approved  by [CONTACT_755891].  Procedures  for such  reporting must  be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_758683].  
• An appropriate SAE form (e.g. ex-US = CIOMS  form or [LOCATION_003] = Medwatch form)  should be 
used to report  SAEs  to BMS . The BMS  protocol  ID number  must  be included on whatever  
form is submitted by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  
o The CIOMS form is available at:  http://www.cioms.ch/index.php/cioms -form-i 
o The MedWatch form is available at: 
https:// www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UC  
M048334.pdf  
• 
• 
• In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all reported  SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie,  not 
previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a  Suspected,  
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investigator notification of  these 
events will be in the form of a S[LOCATION_003]R Report and provided in the FastTrack  portal  
system.  
o Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_122931] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant  expected 
SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modify  the 
conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to  study 
subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal)  study, 
important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee,  or 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_758654] a clinical study for  safety 
reasons.  
o Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the 
ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a  central  
IRB/IEC for the study, the investigator will submit the ESR to the appropriate 
IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the  IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety  information.  
o In addition to the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their 
local HA, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or  unexpected)  
shall be reported by [CONTACT_758684] 10.0 
Page  31 of 55  
  
 
 
concerned countries according to local regulations (either as expedited and/or  in 
aggregate  reports).  
SAEs,  whether  related  or not related  to study  drug,  and pregnancies  must  be reported to BMS 
within [ADDRESS_1038829] be recorded on either CIOMS or MedWatch form &  pregnancies  
must  be reported on a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  or can be submitted on the 
aforementioned SAE form to BMS.  
 
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_176]  
 
SAE Facsimile Number:  +1  [PHONE_188]  
 
If only limited  information is initially  available,  follow- up reports  are required.  (Note:  Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new  information  
becomes  available,  a follow- up SAE report  should be sent within  24 hours  to BMS  (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE  report.  
 
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or  stabilization.  
 
The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) transmitted  to 
BMS Global Pharamacovigilance (WoldwideWorldwide.Safety@bms). Frequency  of 
reconciliation should be every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final  data 
summary. BMS GPV&E will email, upon request from the Investigator, the  GPV&E 
reconciliation report. Requests for reconciliation should be sent  to 
[EMAIL_177].  The data elements listed on the GPV&E  reconciliation 
report will be used for case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was 
not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to  BMS.  
 
5.6. OTHER  REPORTING  
Non-serious Adverse Event  
• Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim  or 
final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg,  IND 
US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
• Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead- in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for  the 
subjects.  
 
A non- serious adverse event is an AE not classified as  serious.  
 
Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and  Reporting  
The collection of non- serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug.  All non -
serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1038830] results  that constitute SAEs  should be documented and reported  
to BMS as  such.  
 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
• any laboratory  abnormality  that required the participant  to have  study  drug discontinued or 
interrupted  
• any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject  to receive  specific  corrective  therapy.  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be  used  
by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI)  
 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities  should 
occur  prior to the reporting  of a potential  DILI event.  All occurrences  of potential  DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as  SAEs.  
 
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
 
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal  (ULN)  
AND 
2) Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1038831],  without  initial findings  of cholestasis  (elevated serum  alkaline 
phosphatase)  
AND 
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and  hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease,  or 
the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
 
Pregnancy 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study  
participant  is pregnant  or may have  been pregnant  at the time of investigational  product  
exposure,  including during at least  [ADDRESS_1038832]  will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner  (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for  participant).  
 
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555]  of this event via either 
the CIOMS, MedWatch or appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with  SAE 
reporting procedures.  
 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 
the participant.  
 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy,  including perinatal  and neonatal  
outcome  and, where  applicable,  offspring information must  be reported on the CIOMS,  
MedWatch or appropriate Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.  A BMS  Pregnancy  Surveillance  
Form may be provided upon request.  
Protocol Version 10.[ADDRESS_1038833]  
be reported as an  SAE.  
 
Other Safety  Considerations  
 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical  examinations,  
electrocardiograms,  X-rays,  and any other  potential  safety  assessments,  whether  or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non -serious or  serious 
AE, as appropriate, and reported  accordingly.  
 
 
6. BIOMARKER(S) AND CORRELATIVE  STUDIES 
Baseline PDL1  status  will be required for analysis;  collection  of the diagnostic  biopsy  specimen 
upon recurrence or disease persistence will be required for enrollment; a new biopsy will  not 
be mandated upon study entry; collection of diagnostic tissue biopsy at presentation will  be 
required for additional correlative studies; P16 status will be required and performed at  local 
institutions;  
 
6.1. CORRELATIVE TISSUE  RESEARCH 
Tissue/Specimen Submission  
Tumor  tissue  samples  will be collected  at pre-treatment  and at the time of disease progression 
if clinically feasible. Tumor tissue collected at the time of pre- treatment may represent frozen 
samples if collected using a previously established repository or, most likely,  formalin -fixed  
paraffin- embedded  (FFPE)  blocks.  If the former,  a section of the tissue  will be submitted  to 
the respective lab(s). For the latter, an FFPE tumor block will be submitted to the respective 
lab(s)  (see below  for more  details).  A biopsy  at the time of progression is strongly  encouraged 
but if not obtained,  does  not constitute  a protocol  violation.  If a biopsy  is obtained,  extra  cores 
may be obtained to allow for biomolecular evaluation. For cases treated at Emory  University,  
tumor tissue samples will be submitted to Rafi Ahmed’s laboratory and will be banked in the 
department  of pathology  at Emory  University.  For cases  treated  at the Cleveland Clinic,  tumor 
tissue samples will be submitted to Mohamed Abazeed’s laboratory and will be banked in his 
laboratory.  The respective labs may exchange  samples  at will. Genomic  profiling  of tissue 
samples  will be mainly  conducted  at the Cleveland Clinic.  Note  that all tissue  obtained for 
correlative reseach is supernumerary  to the needs  of establishing a clinical diagnosis  of 
recurrence.  
 
FFPE tumor samples  (Mandatory)  
A FFPE tumor block should be submitted with the submission form. A Pathology Report  and 
one H&E stained slide documenting that the submitted block or slides contain tumor  should 
also be submitted with the tissue.  The report  and H&E stained slide must  include the protocol  
Protocol Version 10.0

number and patient’s case number. The patient’s name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or other identifying information  
should be removed  from the report.  The surgical  pathology  numbers  and information  must 
NOT be removed from the report.  
 
The pre- and post-progression tumor  biopsies  can be obtained  from the primary  tumor  or 
lymph  node  metastasis  as a punch biopsy  or a core needle biopsy:  a punch  or core in formalin 
and secondary 1- 2 punches or cores in liquid nitrogen (or dry ice/ethanol slurry). The biopsy  
samples should be prepared as: 1) formalin- fixed paraffin- embedded tumor blocks  and 
shipped to the designated laboratories in ambient temperature, and 2) flash frozen samples in  
liquid  nitrogen (or dry ice/ethanol  slurry)  and shipped on dry ice. The frozen  specimens  can be 
stored at -80 degree C ( -70 degree C to - 90 degree C) until ready to ship. If a -80 degree C 
freezer is not available, samples can be stored short term in a - 20 degree C freezer  (non- 
frost-free refrigerator preferred) for up to 7 calendar days (please ship out  Monday - 
Wednesday  only).  
 
6.2. CORRELATIVES WITH  BLOOD  
Blood samples  must  be submitted  with the submission form documenting  the date of collection  
of the sample.  Blood  samples  will be obtained  at baseline and prior to each  nivolumab infusion  
during radiation therapy; subsequently blood will be obtained at weeks 18, 30 52, and 104 as 
outlined in study calendar above. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and  plasma 
will be isolated from collected CPTs and cryopreserved as outlined in the blood processing 
Appendix  3.

[ADDRESS_1038836]  and the 
identification of predictive  biomarkers  are thus essential  to optimize current  treatments  and to 
develop novel treatment approaches in order to improve response rates. Two recent  studies 
analyzing the CD8 T cell response  in the peripheral  blood  of non-small  lung cancer  and 
melanoma patients  undergoing PD-1 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758655] -1+ CD8 T cells in a subset of patients which in combination with tumor 
burden correlated  with clinical outcome (37, 38). We will therefore monitor  T cell activation 
and proliferation  in the peripheral  blood  by [CONTACT_7163]- parameter  flow cytometry  of isolated  PBMCs 
including but not limited to the following markers: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CCR7,  CD27,  
CD28, CD38, HLA -DR, Ki- 67, PD -1. Activated CD38+ HLA -DR+ CD8 T cells at the peak  of 
activation/proliferation will be isolated by [CONTACT_758685].  RNA  will be used to transcriptionally  profile  CD8 T cells responding to therapy  using  
RNAseq. Furthermore, we will use DNA isolated from activated CD8 T cells in the  peripheral 
blood and from frozen tumor tissue to analyze and compare the T cell receptor repertoire of 
activated/proliferating CD8 T cells in the blood  and tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes  in the 
obtained biopsy.  It has recently  been shown  that a particular  subset  of PD-1+ CD8 T cells 
expressing the transcription factor TCF-[ADDRESS_1038837] in a mouse 
model of persistent viral infection ( 39). Two recent studies also demonstrated  that 
costimulatory signaling through CD28 is required for CD8 T cell proliferation following PD-[ADDRESS_1038838] blockade ( 40, 41). We hypothesize that increased numbers of CD28+ and/or  TCF- 
1+ among PD-1+ CD8 T cells will be predictive of response to PD-[ADDRESS_1038839] composition of genetic lesions compared to matched treatment naïve tumors.  The 
extent  of genetic  alterations  has been previously  associated  with response  to checkpoint  
blockade.  Therefore,  we posit  that the extent  of non-synonymous  mutational  load will be 
predictive of the presence of neo -antigens and therefore predictive of response to nivolumab 
in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer. We will assess mutational and neoantigen  
load using whole  exome sequencing.  We will assess transcriptomic  states  using RNAseq.  We 
will correlate clinical outcomes  with the extent  and composition of mutations  and identify  
transcriptomic states (or gene signatures) that could predict improved clinical outcomes  (see 
Appendix 4 for instructions on processing frozen tumor samples for DNA/RNA  extraction).

detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment should be discontinued.  
• Patient develops progressive disease; then the patient will discontinue protocol  therapy.  
• Patient develops unacceptable toxicity; then the patient will discontinue protocol  therapy.  
• Patients may withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time for any  reason.

8. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Power Caclulation: From the MIRI study, the 1-year PFS rate for class I and II combined was 
43.8%  (95%  CI: 38.6 - 49.7%)  Assuming  a one sided alpha of 0.05 and an 85% power  to 
detect an improvement in 1- yr PFS from 40% to 55% we estimate 46 patients will need to be  
accrued in 2.5 years  and followed  for an additional  2 years  (estimated maximum total of 51 
patients) . Accounting for a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_1038843] (42). Definition  of clinical outcomes:  PFS is defined as months  from 
treatment  started  to evidenced progression or death and censored at last follow up without  
progression,  and OS is defined as months from treatement started to death or censored at last 
follow up if  alive.  
Analysis  plan:  For primary  objective,  the 1-yr PFS and its 95% confidence interval  will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier method for all patients, as well as in each stratum defined by  p16 
and RPA status,  but this study  is not powered at the level of subgroups.  For the secondary 
objectives, Kaplan- Meier method will be used to assess [ADDRESS_1038844]  deviation.  For exploratory 
objectives,  the predictability  of related  biomarkers  (baseline PDL1  status, T-cell activation  
biomarkers,  CD28  and TCF1 positivity  on T lymphocytes  and other  biomarkers)  to clinical

outcomes (OS and PFS) will be explored using both univariate and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards model controlling for potential  confounders.  
 
9. ADMINISTRATION, HANDLING OF DATA AND SAFETY  MONITORING  
 
9.1. PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS  
Any changes  to the protocol  will be made in the form of an amendment  and must  be approved 
by [CONTACT_758686].  Any modifications  made  to the protocol  or 
informed  consent  document  according to local requirements  or any other  reason may also 
require approval from sponsoring agencies.  
 
9.2. INFORMED CONSENT  
An investigator will explain to each subject the nature of the study, its purpose,  procedures  
involved, expected duration, potential risks and benefits. Each subject will be informed  that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that she may withdraw from the study at any  time,  
and that withdrawal  of consent  will not affect  her subsequent  medical  treatment.  This informed  
consent will be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement and will be submitted for  IRB 
approval  prior to use. No patient  will enter  the study  before  her informed  consent  has been  
obtained. In accordance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability  Act 
(HIPAA),  the written  informed  consent  document  (or a separate  document  to be given  in 
conjunction with the consent  document)  will include a subject  authorization  to release medical  
information to the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_758657]/or  allow these bodies,  a 
regulatory  authority,  or Institutional  Review Board access to subjects’  medical  information that 
includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44227], including subjects’ medical  history.

objectives.  
 
9.5.3.  Monitoring and Auditing  
The Emory Winship Cancer Institute (Winship) clinical trials office will serve as  the 
coordinating  center  for the Emory  patients.  The coordinating center  will review  responses  and 
toxicity  and report  these  to the regularly  scheduled meetings  of the DSMC  of the Emory 
Winship Cancer Institute. Each participating site is expected to have its own data monitoring  
and safety  plan (DMSP)  with regard to forwarding information to their IRBs.  If the data reveals 
a change in the risk/benefit ratio, the investigator will notify the IRB and the PI. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators will review the data and forward any changes or  protocol  
amendments to the IRBs. All serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the  IRB. 
All study  participant  information  will be kept in a confidential  manner  by [CONTACT_569240] a 
random number to each study participant. All data will be kept confidential as per  institutional  
guidelines  and policies.  Any breach  of confidentiality  is a serious  matter  and conflicts  with 
institutional  policies  and will be reported to the IRB. A cumulative summary  of all adverse  
events  occurring on this study  and a report  of the data safety  and monitoring plan will be 
submitted to the IRBs with the annual renewal  reports.

The Data  and Safety  Monitoring Committee  (DSMC) of the Winship  Cancer  Institute  will 
provide oversight  for the conduct  of this study.  The DSMC functions  independently  within 
Winship  Cancer  Institute  to conduct  internal  monitoring functions  to ensure that research being  
conducted by [CONTACT_163845] -quality scientific data in  a 
manner consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate regulations that govern 
clinical research. Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC review may  occur  
every [ADDRESS_1038845] 5 subjects  being reviewed.  
Subsequent monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the Winship Data and  Safety 
Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  
 
The DSMC will review  pertinent  aspects  of the study  to assess  subject  safety,  compliance with 
the protocol, data collection, and risk -benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer  Institute 
Internal Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed consent, eligibility, data  entry,  
accuracy and availability of source documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential  regulatory  
documents.  Following  the monitoring review,  monitors  will provide a preliminary  report  of 
monitoring  findings  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_758658].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_758659]. Prior to the completion of the final summary report, monitors will discuss  the preliminary 
report responses with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163791] (when appropriate). A  final monitoring  
summary  report  will then be prepared by [CONTACT_2037].  Final  DSMC review  will include the 
final monitoring summary  report  with corresponding PI [INVESTIGATOR_163792],  submitted CAPA (when 
applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_228415], and available aggregate toxicity and safety  data.  
 
The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_276265]. Continuing  Review submissions  will include the DSMC  recommendation  letter.  
Should any revisions  be made  to the protocol -specific  monitoring  plan after initial DSMC  
approval, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163795]. The  Committee 
reserves the right to conduct additional audits if  necessary.  
 
The trial be monitored  at each other  site by [CONTACT_758690] 745 AM (EST);  the sites will be providing 
information and updates  on their enrolled patients  to the Emory  HNCA  working  group;  this will 
be a weekly  meeting;  
 
The following applies for monitoring of  Sub-sites:  
 
At the time of study initiation at a non -Emory site, the Emory Principal Investigator,  Winship 
regulatory specialist, and Winship research coordinators will perform a site  initiation 
teleconference. During this teleconference, the Emory team will review the study,  enrollment,  
reporting,  and regulatory  compliance.  The participating site will have internal  monitoring 
meetings.  These meetings  which  will include the participating site investigator,  the clinical 
research  coordinator  and the regulatory  affairs  coordinator,  will meet  at least  on a monthly 
basis to review and discuss study data to ensure subject safety. The research coordinators  
will maintain a spread  sheet  which  will be de-identified and will summarize  all the patient  data 
for subjects actively being treated on the trial as well as a roadmap detailing pending  
tests/treatments for each individual subject. The spread sheet will be shared with the  Emory 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] e-mail monthly.  Teleconferences  will be conducted weekly  between  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_758660](s). The purpose of the meetings is to discuss  the 
enrollment,  regulatory  updates,  monitor  toxicities,  and evaluate the progress  of the trial. A 
record  of the teleconferences  will be kept in the regulatory  binder.  Scheduled teleconferences  
may stop after all patients  have completed assigned protocol  therapy  and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_758661] 10.0 
Page  41 of 55  
  
 
 
communicate with participating sites via email  as needed.  This communication will also 
be maintained in the regulatory  binder.  Chart  reviews  will be performed on selected cases  by 
[CONTACT_758691].  
 
Winship’s MSC will perform an on -site or remote monitoring visit within the first three  months 
of enrollment of the first subject. Quarterly monitoring visits will occur (annually once onsite  
and three times  remotely)  until subject  follow- up is terminated.  Monthly  reviews  of data in 
OnCore will be conducted to ensure compliance or identify  discrepancies.

3. Spin CPT tubes at 2820rpm (1600g), 25minutes, 22°C (acceleration: 9, brake:3).  Be 
careful on the position of the tubes (tubes are tall and need to be centered).  
4. Carefully remove top layer (plasma) without disturbing the PBMC layer. Save [ADDRESS_1038850] PBMCs without touching the separation gel and transfer cells to collection tube 
(15mL falcon tube if 1 or 2 CPTs, 50 mL falcon tube if more CPTs are processed).  
6. Rinse each CPT tube with 3 mL PBS+2% FBS (P2) once. Carefully pi[INVESTIGATOR_758672]- suspend cells sitting directly on the separation gel. Transfer to collection tube.

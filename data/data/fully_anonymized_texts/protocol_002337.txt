   3 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1 SYNOPSIS   Title: Suicide Prevention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth   Grant Number: 1R61MH120236-01A1   Study Description: In the case series, participants will be screened for eligibility and then complete the initial baseline assessment. During the baseline appointment, participants will receive the first module of the Patient Navigator+Safety Planning Intervention (PN+SPI), consisting of the intake, introduction to navigation, and the SPI. Participants will then receive PN services for a period of three months. At three-months, participants will complete a final follow-up assessment. There are no formal hypotheses associated with the case series.   In the open trial, participants will be screened for eligibility and then complete the initial baseline assessment. During the baseline appointment, participants will receive the first module of the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886], consisting of the intake, introduction to navigation, and the SPI. Participants will then receive PN services for a period of six months. Participants will complete a three-month follow-up assessment and a six-month follow-up assessment. For the open trial, it is hypothesized that PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240490]-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (the hypothesized mechanistic targets of the intervention). We will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240491].     The R61 phase (e.g., case series and open trial) precedes a potential R33 phase, in which the theoretical targets of the intervention will be further tested in a RCT (PN+ SPI [INVESTIGATOR_123934]. SPI [INVESTIGATOR_67866]).   A detailed schematic describing all visits and a schedule of assessments is included in Section 1.2, Schema and Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities.  Objectives/Endpoints:  The primary objective of the case series is to obtain feedback on study procedures and the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. The primary objective of the open trial is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886], as well as the preliminary impact on the purported mechanisms of action of the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886] (e.g. decreasing thwarted belongingness, increasing suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]). There are no secondary objectives in either the case series or open trial.

One group that is at a particularly heightened risk of suicide are sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). SGM is an umbrella term to describe individuals who: 1) identify as non-exclusively heterosexual (e.g. gay, 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   10 lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer); and/or 2) report same-gender attraction; and/or 3) identify as a gender different than their birth sex (e.g. transgender, gender non-binary, genderqueer). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_240498] a high risk of suicide attempts and death by [CONTACT_20673], no known suicide prevention programs exist for this vulnerable population. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to develop and test a novel suicide prevention intervention designed to reduce suicide attempts among SGM youth and emerging adults. The proposed intervention will integrate a single-session, empi[INVESTIGATOR_240499] (Safety Planning Intervention; SPI) with patient navigation (PN) services (PN+SPI). PN may be particularly well suited to address the needs to young SGMs at risk of suicide, given its focus on cultural sensitivity and its high level of flexibility to address patients’ specific needs. Patient navigators work with the individual patient, the patient’s significant others, the health care system, and community services to improve adherence to recommended health care and healthy behaviors. The SPI [CONTACT_832] a 30-minute behavioral intervention to reduce suicide attempts by [CONTACT_240568], including: 1) identification of suicidality warning signs; 2) implementing personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]; 3) connecting with mental health professionals; 4) connecting with friends and/or family for support; 5) connecting with mental health professionals; and 6) reducing access to means of completing suicide. Patient navigators will deliver the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240500], problem-solving, reinforcing copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and connecting participants to social support and mental health resources (e.g. SGM-specific support groups from the community). The aims of this R61 phase are to refine the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240501], assess acceptability and feasibility, and test if the intervention impacts propertied targets (i.e. thwarted belongingness and suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]). The first phase of the R61 study is to conduct a case series and the second phase is to conduct an open-phase trial.  The case series will be used to obtain participant feedback on study procedures and the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240502]-phase trial. Thus, it has no hypotheses. Based on the minority stress model and the interpersonal theory of suicide, in the open-phase trial, we hypothesize that the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240503] 2 proposed targets: 1) decreasing thwarted belongingness (e.g. through interactions with the PN and connection with SGM-specific support groups) and 2) increasing suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. The PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240504]. For example, internal copi[INVESTIGATOR_240505], whereas external copi[INVESTIGATOR_240506] (i.e. restricting access to lethal means to act on suicidal urges) in addition to reaching out to others (e.g. friends, family, PN, mental health provider) when in crisis. Therefore, the clinical outcome of interest are effect size estimates of changes in thwarted belongingness and suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   2.[ADDRESS_292133] $93.5 billion in the U.S.9. Additionally, there are specific vulnerable populations that experience disproportionate rates of suicide.  Sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) are a vulnerable population, for which substantial mental health disparities have been demonstrated10-16. Further, SGM youth also are at a substantial risk for suicidality, with 23% of sexual minority youth reporting one or more suicide attempts (in the past 12 months) versus 5.4% of heterosexual youth17. Meta-analytic findings have also echoed these results, with sexual minority adolescents and emerging adults reporting 2.26 increased odds of suicide attempts compared to their heterosexual counterparts18. Gender minorities are also at substantially elevated risk compared to the general population, with 45% of 18-24-year-old transgender individuals reporting history of one or more suicide attempts19. However, to date, no known suicide prevention programs have been developed and tested among SGM, a notable gap in the literature, given the substantial suicide disparities noted among this vulnerable population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to adapt and test a patient navigation (PN) intervention for SGM youth/emerging adults designed to reduce suicide attempts among SGM youth.  One of the leading models of suicide behaviors is the interpersonal theory of suicide20-23. The core tenants of the interpersonal theory of suicide include the constructs of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide. Together, these constructs are meant to explain variance in the ideation-to-action framework – that is, illuminating pathways from suicidal desire to suicidal behavior (i.e., fatal and non-fatal suicide attempts). Thwarted belongingness denotes an unmet need to belong socially, which includes components of loneliness, having few friends, social withdrawal, and/or interpersonal conflict. Perceived burdensomeness is defined as an internal miscalculation that one’s death would be more valuable to others than their life would be. Capability for suicide includes a genetic predisposition and a learned lowering of one’s fear of death and increasing pain tolerance through repeated exposures to painful events. This model suggests that the interaction amongst thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide, synergistically places individuals are increased risk for suicide attempts. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], recent meta-analytic findings have supported this model, noting significant main effects of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide on suicide attempts and risk (i.e. attempts in the context of current ideation)20. Of note, significant 2-way interactions with thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and 3-way interactions with all variables) were significant in predicting suicide attempts and suicide risk, with thwarted belonginess demonstrated an r = .[ADDRESS_292134] with suicide risk.  The leading theoretical model to explain health disparities, including suicide attempts, among SGMs, is the minority stress theory24-27. The minority stress theory posits that in addition to general stressors, distal minority stressors (e.g. discrimination, prejudice, and victimization towards SGMs) and proximal minority stressors (e.g. discrimination, prejudice, and victimization towards SGMs) and proximal minority stressors (e.g. internalization of anti-SGM messages, concealment of one’s identity, and expectations of rejection) lead to poor mental health outcomes and suicide attempts. Critically, variables have also been identified which buffer the effects of these stressors on negative mental health outcomes, namely social support (broadly, and specific to other SGM members) and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]11,28-31. Integrating minority stress theory with the interpersonal theory of suicide provides a strong conceptual model for understanding suicide risk amongst SGM youth. Both models highlight modifiable buffering variables, that if addressed, would theoretically allay suicide attempts. For example, the minority stress theory posits that increasing social support (broadly, and specifically from other SGMs) and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], attenuates the association of minority stressors to negative mental health outcomes (e.g. suicide attempts). 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.[ADDRESS_292135] provided compelling arguments, that reducing thwarted belongingness (such as through fostering interpersonal connectedness related to social support) would also attenuate the associations between perceived burdensomeness and capability for suicide with suicide attempts and risk.   Thus, the proposed brief and scalable PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240507], or general stressors, or address perceived burdensomeness or capability for suicide. Rather, the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240508] – poor copi[INVESTIGATOR_240509]. If the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240510], a subsequent reduction in suicide attempts is expected, both through adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (e.g. suicide means restriction, distraction skills) and also through attenuating the association between stressors and suicide attempts. Similarly, if the intervention decreases thwarted belongingness, a subsequent reduction in suicide attempts is expected, both through an increased sense of belonging (e.g. through general and SGM-specific social support) and also through attenuating the associations between: 1) perceived burdensomeness; 2) capability for suicide; and 3) stressors, on suicide attempts.  PN may be particularly well suited to address the needs to young SGMs at risk of suicide, given its focus on cultural sensitivity and its high level of flexibility to address patients’ specific needs. Patient navigators work with the individual patient, the patient’s significant others, the health care system, and community services to improve adherence to recommended health care and healthy behaviors. There have been few PN interventions developed or tested to assist patients experiencing mental health or developmental conditions. Research indicates that the PN approach has been used to assist patients with serious mental illness32-35, depression36,37, autism spectrum disorder38-40, and traumatic brain injuries. Existing studies of PN applied to mental health conditions have several limitations. For example, no known study has evaluated whether PN can assist patients with suicide risk. In fact, most studies have excluded patients who expressed suicidal ideation, leading to significant gaps in knowledge regarding the best ways to assist suicidal populations.  The SPI41 is a 30-minute behavioral intervention to reduce suicide attempts by [CONTACT_240568], including: 1) identification of suicidality warning signs; 2) implementing personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]; 3) connecting with mental health professionals; 4) connecting with friends and/or family for support; 5) connecting with mental health professionals; and 6) reducing access to means of completing suicide. In a recent trial of the SPI, 1,640 patients with suicide risk received either the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240511]. Results indicated that participants who received the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240512], with 45% fewer suicide attempts noted among the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240513]42.   The PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240514] a multi-level intervention and will target several hypothesized mechanistic targets that theoretically underlie the impact of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240515]. One proposed target of the intervention is decreased thwarted belongingness (e.g. through interactions with the PN and connection with SGM-specific support groups). For example, in a recent meta-analysis of over 100 unique samples, thwarted belongingness was significantly associated with increased suicide risk (r = .33)20. Additionally, among a sample of sexual minority and heterosexuals, the association between thwarted belongingness and suicide ideation was 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.[ADDRESS_292136] SMs and SM participants with a history of suicide attempts reported substantially higher thwarted belongingness compared to SMs with no history of suicide attempts (d = .54)43. SMs also report greater thwarted belongingness compared to their heterosexual peers (d range from .80 to .97)44. Related, thwarted belongingness has also been found to predict suicide attempts among gender minority youth (Odds Ration [OR] = 2.88)20,44,45.   Another set of hypothesized targets are suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. The PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240516]. For example, internal copi[INVESTIGATOR_240505], whereas external copi[INVESTIGATOR_240517] (i.e. restricting access to lethal means to act on suicidal urges) in addition to reaching out to others (e.g. friends, family, PN, mental health provider) when in crisis46. Means restriction has previously been shown to reduce suicide attempts at both the population and individual level47,48. Indeed, recent meta-analytic data underscore the efficacy of means restriction and lower odds of death by [CONTACT_20673]49. Further, greater use of internal and external suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_240518], severity, and lower likelihood of suicide attempts46.   Positive results from this project would elucidate pathways in which brief suicide prevention programs may confer reduction in suicide attempts among vulnerable populations. Negative results would also confer crucial information on theoretically informed pathways which may not be active in prevention programs, which subsequently may encourage researchers to postulate alternative targets as brief suicide prevention programs are created and refined. We anticipate that decreasing thwarted belongingness, and increasing internal and external copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will have significant clinical meaningfulness as all three targets will subsequently reduce suicidal behavior. There are currently no known existing suicide prevention approaches designed for SGM and none that has utilized PN, thus the proposed study is likely to have a significant clinical benefit and impact on the field of suicide prevention research.   2.3 RISK/BENEFIT  2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS   Case Series and Open Trial Potential Risks:  It is unlikely that participants will be at any risk for physical harm as a result of study participation. Participants may reflect on unpleasant memories or talk about certain things that they may find distressing and may experience anxiety as a result. As with any study of participants with suicidal ideation, there is always the risk of symptoms worsening and the possibility of suicide attempts. Other potential risks include the possibility that confidentiality could be breached, as well as possible discomfort about treatment sessions and assessments being audio-recorded for supervision and treatment adherence checks.   2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS   Case Series and Open Trial Potential Benefits:  All participants will have the opportunity to participate in a suicide prevention program. Each participant will receive the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240519] ‘gold-standard’ intervention for suicide prevention. 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.[ADDRESS_292137] to resources in the community, problem-solve barriers to treatment, and reinforce copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. Lastly, all participants, regardless of eligibility status, will be provided with referrals to local mental health providers, and local/national suicide crisis hotlines, including The Trevor Project, which specializes in suicide prevention for sexual and gender minority youth/emerging adults.   2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS   Case Series and Open Trial Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits:  As stated above, participants may reflect on unpleasant memories or talk about certain things that they may find distressing and may experience anxiety as a result. However, it is necessary that we ask these potentially emotionally upsetting items in order to adequately evaluate the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. Participants will be advised during the informed consent process and throughout the study that they may decline to answer any study questions, that participation is voluntary, and that they may withdraw from the study at any time.  To partially address participants’ risk of distress and potential breaches of confidentiality, we have obtained a waiver of parental consent from the IRB and an approval of minor’s (age 15 to 17) ability to self-consent, which is consistent with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections guidelines:  An IRB may waive the requirements for obtaining parental or guardian permission if it makes and documents the findings under either 45 CFR 46.116(c) or (d). In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in 45 CFR 46.116(c) or (d), if the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed to study conditions in children or a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the parental permission requirements provided that an appropriate mechanism is in place to protect the children, and provided that the waiver is not inconsistent with federal, state, or local law (45 CFR 46.408(c)).  Per Fisher, Arbeit, Dumont, Macapagal, and Mustanski50, failure of IRBs to approve these requests represents a significant barrier to sexual and gender minority youth engagement in research protocols due to fear of being stigmatized and/or victimized if guardian permission leads to disclosure of their sexual orientation or gender identity51-53. The results of IRBs’ failure to approve these requests can subsequently result in more limited and unrepresentative samples54, which may bias results which undermine the generalizability of findings to sexual and gender minority youth who live in a non-accepting familial environment. Indeed, results from a sample of 60, 14-[ADDRESS_292138] majority reported that requiring parental consent for research studies would prevent them from participating. Additionally, participants demonstrated strong knowledge of the informed consent process, including risks/benefits, random assignment, and confidence in dissenting to research practices with which they did not feel comfortable50.  Given that we have obtained a waiver of parental consent for the reasons described above, we do not plan to alert parents/caregivers if a minor enrolled in the study reports immediate suicidal intent. Rather, we will require all participants at baseline to identify at least one trusted adult whom the study staff would contact [CONTACT_240569] a psychiatric emergency or difficulty in contact[CONTACT_240570] 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   15 participant. If study staff were to alert parents/caregivers, it could potentially be detrimental to the participant’s well-being, particularly in the context of a suicidal crisis, if the family member(s) were not aware of, and/or supportive of, the participant’s sexual or gender identity.    The patient navigation procedures will facilitate receipt of high-quality mental health care. The intervention will be implemented by a social work navigator who will be under the supervision of [CONTACT_240616], a licensed clinical psychologist, and [CONTACT_240617], a trained clinical psychologist. The assessment of intervention fidelity will also help to ensure that clinical protocols are being implemented as designed. Study navigators will also have ready access to the Principal Investigators, as well as their direct supervisor at the Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD). In all cases, participant health and safety have priority over study protocol. Study procedures do not preclude participant referral for additional care and treatment.   Other potential risks include the possibility that confidentiality could be breached, as well as possible discomfort about treatment sessions and assessments being audio-recorded for supervision and treatment adherence checks. Participants will be advised that they can refuse to be audio-recorded. All data will be kept confidential, under lock-and-key, or electronically and password protected, accessible only to trained study staff. Participants’ data will be identified by [CONTACT_170332], and a link between names and ID numbers will be kept separately under lock-and-key or electronically and password protected, again accessible only to trained study staff. All digital audio recordings of sessions will be uploaded to the study computer immediately post-session and the file deleted from the digital recorder. Computer files will be secured by [CONTACT_240571]. These procedures will be implemented to provide study participants with the assurance of confidentiality around very sensitive and personal information.   The purpose of the study is to develop and test a PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240520]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_240521], there are currently no known suicide prevention programs for them. Results from the study will provide important information which could reduce the mortality of these populations.   3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  There are no hypotheses associated with the case series given that the purpose of the case series is to obtain feedback on study procedures and the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. For the open trial, we hypothesize that PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240490]-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (the hypothesized mechanistic targets of the intervention). We will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240491].   As stated, the case series (up to 10 participants) will be conducted to refine study procedures and the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. In terms of trial type, the open phase trial is a within-subjects trial. All participants in the case series and open trial will be assigned to the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. Therefore, no randomization or control group will be used.  The case series (N = 10) is a one group, one arm study. Participants in the case series will receive up to three months of the patient navigation plus safety planning intervention, at which 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   16 point they will complete a three-month follow-up assessment. The open phase trial (N = 30) is also a one group, one arm study and will follow the same approach; however, there will be both a three-month and six-month follow-up assessment, and intervention services will be provided for six months. The R61 phase (e.g., case series and open trial) precedes a potential R33 phase, in which the theoretical targets of the intervention will be further testes in a RCT.   The study intervention includes patient navigation (PN) for SGM youth/emerging adults designed to target mechanisms (i.e. decreasing thwarted belongingness and increasing suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]) that theoretically underlie suicide. The study intervention integrates a single-session, empi[INVESTIGATOR_4260], suicide prevention intervention (Safety Planning Intervention41; SPI) with PN services (PN+SPI).   During the first PN+SPI [CONTACT_193548], the patient navigator will deliver the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240522]. After the initial session, the patient navigator will continue frequent contact [CONTACT_240572], problem-solving, reinforcing copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and connecting participants to social support and mental health resources (e.g. SGM-specific support groups within the community). The planned PN content is described in Table 1 (see below) and includes 7 modules that can be delivered using a flexible approach. In other words, patient navigators will deliver the modules based on the particular concerns and needs of each participant, and modules can be repeated.  Table 1:    Module Construct Content 1.

Wells along with the SPI; 2) creating a logic model of the health problem (e.g. suicide); 3) creating a logic model of the integrated PN+SPI; 4) assessing intervention fit and planning adaptations; and 5) making adaptations. The Intervention Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_240525], including delivery fit, design features, and cultural (i.e. SGM) relevance. The research team will develop and initial draft of patient-focused materials, along with a manual for the patient navigators with the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240526]. In subsequent meetings, drafted materials and protocols will be revised based on PPG feedback. The PPG will review the final draft of the intervention prior to its production for use in the open trial.  It is anticipated that only two rounds will be needed to refine the SPI+PN intervention and study procedures in preparation for the open trial.   3.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION PN interventions are flexible by [CONTACT_240573]’s unique barriers to care; the content and pace of the intervention is delivered according to the needs and concerns of the participant. All participants will receive the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240527]. At this time, the patient navigator will also assess barriers to accessing mental health care services and SGM social support services. After the initial session, the patient navigator will contact [CONTACT_240574] (e.g. over the phone) one time per week (at minimum) for the next seven weeks 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   19 and then monthly (at minimum) for the remainder of the intervention period. It is possible that some participants will require additional assistance from the patient navigator. As a result, the length, number, and frequency of intervention contacts will vary based on the participants’ needs.   The minimum-acceptable participation in the intervention is the completion of the first session of PN+SPI, which is the intake, introduction to navigation, and the SPI. Please see Section 2.[ADDRESS_292139] 1 intervention session, and the 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments.    4 STUDY POPULATION 4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  Case Series and Open Trial Eligibility Criteria:  In order to be eligible to participant in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form  2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study 3. Age 15 to 29 years 4. Identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, genderqueer, asexual, pansexual, non-binary, or another non-exclusively heterosexual or cisgender identity, and/or reports same-gender romantic attraction, and/or reports same-gender sexual behavior in the past [ADDRESS_292140] two weeks during phone screen, as indicated by [CONTACT_15370]-administered Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Baseline version 8. Reports a lifetime history of one or more suicide attempts (i.e., actual and interrupted suicide attempts, not aborted attempts)   4.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  Case Series and Open Trial Exclusion Criteria:  An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   20 1. Reports immediate (i.e., within 10 days) intention and plan to attempt suicide based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_42600] (as guided by [CONTACT_240575] C-SSRS). This may include past-two-week intent and plan.   4.[ADDRESS_292141]-two-week suicidal ideation criterion assessed during phone screen, participants’ past-month suicidal ideation will be evaluated during the baseline assessment, creating overlap between reference periods and reducing the number of screen failures. Some individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria or do meet the exclusion criterion for participation in this trial (screen failure) may be rescreened if their response to the criterion or criteria that excluded them from the study changes over time. Examples include a participant who did not have suicidal ideation during the initial telephone screening, but at a subsequent screening reports suicidal ideation. Rescreened participants will be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.   4.[ADDRESS_292142] an anticipated number to be screened in order to reach the target enrollment size for the case series. We will use data collected as part of the case series to help us determine the anticipated number to be screened in order to reach the target enrollment size in the open trial.   The anticipated accrual rate over the course of the case series is five participants per month over two months (total N = 10). The anticipated accrual rate over the course of the open trial is five participants per month over six months (total N = 30).   A broad recruitment strategy will be used to recruit diverse participants within the greater San Diego area via a variety of methods, including FHCSD outreach programs, support groups, flyering local LGBT community centers, gay-identified/friendly coffee shops, gyms, and bars. We will also utilize online recruitment methods, including targeted ads through Facebook/Instagram, and use of geolocation social networking mobile applications tailored to SGM (e.g. Grindr, Scruff, Jacked). Finally, we will also recruit from the BISH Lab registry, a database of diverse SGM community members who are willing to be contact[CONTACT_240576]. This multi-method approach has been in our current and previous studies sampling SGM, is a frequently used method among researchers studying SGM56 and is cost-effective57. We already have developed several recruitment flyers and ads for other studies that can be modified to recruit participants that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of San Diego County. We have also budgeted funding for the expenses related to study recruitment to help ensure our success.  An electronic tracking system will be developed for use by [CONTACT_240577]-up assessments. This system will provide the outcome assessors with a calendar of participants to contact [CONTACT_20687]-up visits within one month of each’s participant’s next scheduled follow-up appointment (if they are unable to schedule the follow-up appointment at the time of the previous appointment). The outcome assessors will be responsible for documenting both baseline and each follow-up data collection encounter in the system. At the baseline assessment participants will complete a locator form which asks permission for study staff to contact [CONTACT_38439], text, email,

   21 social media (Facebook) and mail. We also ask participants for their preferred contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183], although we will use multiple methods of contact[CONTACT_220379], as necessary. Additionally, we ask participants for the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_240578]/family member whom the study could contact [CONTACT_240579]. We also provide evening and weekend appointments to accommodate participants’ schedules. Further, we provide phone/text reminders regarding study appointments and confirm appointments with participants several times in advance. Participants will be provided with incentives (compensation via gift cards) to participate in each data collection session. These incentives will be provided in recognition of the time and effort the participant is providing to the study team, as well as costs for travel. The study team will meet weekly to discuss study enrollment and retention rates, as well as challenges faced in both recruitment and retention. These challenges, as well as the steps taken to overcome them, will be part of the feasibility data collected by [CONTACT_3476]. However, it is expected that these strategies will prove successful based on our previous history using them. For example, in [CONTACT_240616]’s and Wells’ ongoing R34 HIV prevention trial sampling young sexual minority men in the San Diego area, the project team has retained 100% of our sample [ADDRESS_292143] been optimized in other studies (described above).   Furthermore, the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240528], consisting of mental health providers at FHCSD, potential program implementers, young SGMs, and community members who interact with or deliver services to people who may benefit from the intervention. This will help ensure that the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240529], as well as utilizes intervention materials that are acceptable from the population. Lastly, study staff are well-trained to be strong at being able to communicate and work with the communities that we serve.  The age range for this study is restricted to ages 15-29. The lower bound age of 15 was selected as epi[INVESTIGATOR_240530] 15+ as a critical period for suicide risk. Additionally, there are developmental, ethical, and legal aspects to consider in suicide prevention work with children. Further, our upper age limit of [ADDRESS_292144] the screening process. Those who meet screening criteria will be scheduled for the enrollment (baseline) study visit. At the time of the enrollment appointment, a trained member of the study team will provide more information about the study and engage in an informed consent process for the purpose of study participation. Individuals who provide written informed consent will be asked to complete baseline surveys, which, together with the clinical interview, will be reviewed to confirm whether the participants meet criteria to participate. To verify if participants meet the past-two-week suicidal ideation criterion assessed during phone screen, participants’ past-month suicidal ideation will be evaluated during the baseline assessment, creating overlap between reference periods and reducing the number of screen failures. Reasons for non-participation of potential participants will be documented.  
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   22 As mentioned above, participants will be compensated for study participation. Specifically, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_292145] after completing the initial baseline assessment and a $[ADDRESS_292146] after completing each follow-up assessment. Case series participants can earn a total of $125 in gift cards if they complete both data collection sessions (baseline and three-month follow-up). Open trial participants can earn a total of $175 in gift cards if they complete all three data collection sessions (baseline, three-month, and six-month follow-up). As mentioned, these incentives will be provided in recognition of the time and effort the participant is providing to the study, as well as costs for travel. The amount that participants will be compensated ($75 for baseline, $50 for follow-ups) has been deemed appropriate in Southern [LOCATION_004] for the amount of time, effect, and travel required to complete study assessments. All incentives will be given directly to the participants, including those who are minors.   5 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) 5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION 5.1.1 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING  All PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240531], Family Health Centers of San Diego, based on their familiarity with the intended audience, young SGMs. The first intervention session will be held immediately following study enrollment (i.e. during the baseline assessment). While the COVID-19 outbreak is on-going, this session will be conducted online via Zoom (a secured video calling platform with audio and video capabilities) instead of in-person to ensure proper care and safety of participants and study staff. All participants will receive the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240532]. Additionally, the patient navigator will assess barriers to accessing mental health care services and SGM social support services at this time.  Given that PN interventions are flexible by [CONTACT_240580]’ unique barriers to care, the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240533]. At minimum, the patient navigator will contact [CONTACT_240574] (e.g., over the phone) one time per week for the next seven weeks and then monthly for the remainder of the intervention period. However, some participants may require additional assistance from the patient navigator. Therefore, the patient navigator will deliver the intervention modules based on the particular concerns and needs of each participant, repeating modules as needed. As a result, there is no predetermined number of intervention sessions constituting a complete or “full-dose” intervention. We will monitor the dose of patient navigation (as measured by [CONTACT_240581], amount of time spent with participants, and actions taken) by [CONTACT_14662] a PN encounter form. Lastly, participants will not interact with other participants or with a shared interventionist throughout the duration of the study.   5.[ADDRESS_292147] TRAINING AND TRACKING  The patient navigators, who will be social workers, will be extensively trained (e.g., through didactics and role playing) by [CONTACT_240582] 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   23 with the PPG and via the Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP)58 training approach. Patient navigators will be trained on all SOPs that are relevant to their work (i.e., child and elder and dependent adult abuse and neglect) and will have significant training in safety monitoring. This training will include didactic approaches as well as active learning, such as role playing with the investigative team and community members. General PN training will focus on the history of PN, establishing rapport, professionalism in PN, and documenting the PN services provided. In addition, more specific training will be provided in how to administer the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240534], as well as the [ADDRESS_292148] 2-3 weeks to allow the patient navigators adequate time to practice delivering intervention modules, documenting care provided, and following study data collection protocols. However, training may be extended depending on each navigator’s needs. All staff who will be interacting with participants will be trained in the techniques of the UWRAP as it pertains to their role in the project.  Intervention fidelity will be assessed via audio-recordings and observation conducted by [CONTACT_240583]. Audio-recordings, considered the gold standard in treatment fidelity59, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_240584] a checklist to track whether the interventionists delivered PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240535]. Using an approach developed by [CONTACT_240585], patient navigators will record process data related to the PN services provided, including: 1) number of encounters, 2) length of time of each encounter; 3) barriers experienced by [CONTACT_1962]; and 4) actions taken to reduce barriers. Patient navigators will keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_240536]’ safety plans and the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240537]. The patient navigators will also be asked to keep detailed qualitative notes regarding telephone, text, and in-person encounters with participants, including participants’ progress in obtaining mental health services, successes in implementing the PN intervention, and challenges in implementing the PN intervention. A Research Program Manager at FHCSD will provide day-to-day supervision of the patient navigators and will meet with the navigators weekly and document successes and challenges to PN intervention implementation through a weekly written report. [CONTACT_240616], a licensed psychologist, and [CONTACT_240617] will also provide the patient navigators with weekly, and as needed clinical supervision.   5.3 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION ADHERENCE  We will track participants’ attendance at intervention sessions and exposure to intervention materials by [CONTACT_14662] a PN encounter form. Here, patient navigators will record process data related to the PN services provided, including: 1) number of encounters, 2) length of time of each encounter; 3) barriers experienced by [CONTACT_1962]; and 4) actions taken to reduce barriers. This information will be recorded using the PN encounter form. Patient navigators will keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_240536]’ safety plans and the SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240537]. The patient navigators will also keep detailed qualitative notes regarding telephone, text, and in-person encounters with participants, including participants’ progress in obtaining mental health services, successes in implementing the PN intervention, and challenges in implementing the PN intervention.   We will examine intervention adherence during the case series and open trial by [CONTACT_240586], number of intervention modules delivered, and how often each module is delivered. We will also review the progress notes to determine if participants carried out plans described in the progress notes (i.e., contact a mental health provider, enroll in a support group).

   24 6 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  If a subject chooses to discontinue from PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240538], remaining study procedures (assessments) will be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].   The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following: • The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for determining the need to discontinue • If the participant is due to complete assessments within 2 weeks of being discontinued from the study intervention, those assessments will be administered at the time of discontinuation; if the next scheduled assessments are more than 2 weeks from the discontinuation date, the discontinued participant will wait for the next scheduled assessment. Thereafter, the participant will be included in all future scheduled assessments, even though not participating in the intervention.   6.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  In both the case series and open trial, participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons: • The participant can no longer participate in the remainder of the study (e.g. long-term prison sentence, long-term hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]); or • The participant loses their legal right to provide consent to participate for the remainder of the study.  The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in an electronic system of tracking developed by [CONTACT_5051]. Subjects who sign the informed consent form and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study will not be replaced.   6.[ADDRESS_292149] scheduled follow-up.

   25 The following actions will be taken to minimize loss to follow-up and missing data: • At the baseline assessment, participants will complete a locator form, which asks permission for study staff to contact [CONTACT_38439], text, email, and mail. We also ask participants for their preferred contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183], and for the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_240578]/family member whom the study could contact [CONTACT_240579]. Study staff will utilize these multiple contact [CONTACT_240587], or re-schedule, follow-up assessments as necessary. • Study staff will contact [CONTACT_240588]. • Participants will be given multiple appointment reminders and study staff will confirm the scheduled appointment with the participant multiple times. • Study staff will contact [CONTACT_240589]-up appointments within a month of each participant’s next scheduled follow-up appointment (if they are unable to schedule the follow-up appointment at the time of the previous appointment). • Upon rescheduling follow-up assessments, study staff will counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to continue in the study. • The study team will meet weekly to discuss challenges faced in contact[CONTACT_240590]-up assessments and how to potentially overcome them.    6.4 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON-SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  Case Series:  Participants will complete the initial baseline assessment to confirm eligibility. Prior to beginning the baseline assessment procedures, a trained member of the study team will obtain informed consent. If the participant consents to participate in the study, the baseline assessment will be performed. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires (see below), clinician-based interviews (see below), and the first SPI+PN session (intake, introduction to navigation, and the SPI).  Post-baseline, participants will receive PN services for a period of three-months. Patient navigators will record PN intervention encounter data (see below). Participants will then complete a three-month follow-up assessment, consisting of clinician-based interviews (see below) and providing study and intervention feedback through open-ended survey questions (see below).   • Administration of self-report questionnaires:  o Participants will complete self-report questionnaires in Qualtrics (either done remotely from their homes, or on a computer within the lab). o Self-report questionnaires include: § Demographics survey • Assesses demographic items (e.g. age, race, ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, country of origin, U.S. citizen status, primary language, current grade in school or education level, health insurance status, employment status, income (if applicable)) § Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire-15 (INQ-15)63,64  • Assesses thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness

The Principal Investigators will train all personnel to use the C-SSRS and will be providing ongoing supervision. The C-SSRS is a clinician-based interview that assesses five types of suicidal ideation of increasing severity and four types of suicidal behavior, as well as the intensity of suicidal ideation. During the phone screen, items from the C-SSRS will be administered to determine participant eligibility, as well as assess participant safety. The C-SSRS will be administered during the baseline assessment to confirm participant eligibility, as well as assess participant safety. The C-SSRS will additionally be administered during each major assessment sessions and at the beginning of each intervention session.   Preliminary verification of eligibility will be completed (over the phone) in advance of the full baseline assessment visit. To manage suicide risk during the telephone screening or assessments (completed in person or remotely), the University of Washington Risk Assessment Protocol (UWRAP)[ADDRESS_292151] enrolled in the study will receive additional support from their navigators following all assessments.  A summary of how the UWRAP will be administered is as follows: Phone Screen:  1. Administer the introductory language and then administer and obtain verbal consent for telephone screening. 2. Administer the location/emergency contact [CONTACT_177599]. 3. Administer the demographic inclusion criteria questions. 4. Administer items from the University of Washington Risk Assessment Protocol (UWRAP) regarding impairment as a result of substance use and the pre-assessment risk protocol (1: stress level; 2: urge to harm oneself; 3: intent to kill oneself; 4: urge to use substances) on a 1-[ADDRESS_292152] item 1 (obtain feedback on the telephone screening) plus items regarding re-assessment of risk (1: stress level; 2: urge to harm oneself; 3: intent to kill oneself; 4: urge to use substances) on a 1-[ADDRESS_292153] items 5 and 6 (i.e., copi[INVESTIGATOR_240541]). 9. If potential participant has no suicidal intent and plan, engage in chit-chat and/or suggest

   32 that they engage in the other activities in the UWRAP mood induction protocol item 4 before returning to their daily activities (for example, listen to music) 10. If a potential participant has suicidal intent and/or plan, administer the UWRAP debrief checklist items 8 and 9 (strategies to reduce suicide risk) and then UWRAP mood induction protocol item 4. The person conducting the phone screening should stay on the telephone with the potential participant while they do their activity or chat). After the potential participant has completed their mood induction activity, the phone screener should administer item 5 on UWRAP mood induction protocol (i.e., rating the effect of the activity on their mood). 11. Consult with the clinician “on call” for those with suicidal intent and plan who are unable to guarantee that they will use behavior strategies (for example, to keep themselves safe for 24 hours) who may then contact [CONTACT_9150].  12. The Principal Investigators should be contact[CONTACT_240595]/or plan, based on their responses to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Baseline Assessment: 1. Administer the introductory language and then engage in the informed consent procedures for the study.  2. Administer the location/emergency contact [CONTACT_177599]. 3. Administer three items from the University of Washington Risk Assessment Protocol (UWRAP) regarding impairment as a result of substance use and the pre-assessment risk protocol (1: stress level; 2: urge to harm oneself; 3: intent to kill oneself; 4: urge to use substances) on a 1-[ADDRESS_292154] item 1 (obtain feedback on the telephone screening) plus items regarding re-assessment of risk (1: stress level; 2: urge to harm oneself; 3: intent to kill oneself; 4: urge to use substances) on a 1-[ADDRESS_292155] items 5 and 6 (i.e., copi[INVESTIGATOR_240541]). 8. If participant has no suicidal intent and plan, engage in chit-chat and/or suggest that they engage in the other activities in the UWRAP mood induction protocol item 4 before returning to their daily activities (for example, listen to music) 9. If the participant remains distressed, administer the UWRAP mood induction protocol item 4. Stay on the videoconference/or with the potential participant while they do their activity or chat. After the participant has completed their mood induction activity, administer item 5 on UWRAP mood induction protocol (i.e., rating the effect of the activity on their mood). 10. Consult with the clinician “on call” for those with suicidal intent and plan who are unable to guarantee that they will use behavior strategies (for example, to keep themselves safe for 24 hours) who may then contact [CONTACT_9150].  11.

This study will also capture non-medical events that may be behavioral (i.e., self-harm) or social (e.g., child protective services involvement with the family).   6.6.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  According to the SDSU Human Research Protection Program and OHRP guidance, (from SDSUHRPP Standards and Practices v. 02.13.19; also definition in OHRP guidance, which NIH follows), an adverse event is considered serious if it: 1) Results in death; 2) is life 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   34 threatening; 3) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 4) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 5) results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 6) risks the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  For the purpose of this study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240542] 24 hours (inclusive of ER visits of 24 hours or longer).   6.6.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  The Principal Investigators, in consultation with physician Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240618] and other Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240619], if necessary, will assess the severity of adverse events as either: 1) Grade 1: Mild; 2) Grade 2: Moderate; 3) Grade 3: Severe; 4) Grade 4: Life threatening; or 5) Grade 5: Death.  The following definitions will be used to assign a severity rating:  1. Grade 1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; no intervention indicated. 2. Grade 2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living. 3. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. 4. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated. 5. Grade 5 Death related to adverse event. Because the study focuses on suicide prevention, adverse events related to suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors, and other types of self-harm will be graded for severity using the following guidelines:  Grade 1:  1. Worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline or last assessment Grade 2:  1. Development of new suicide intention or plan 2. Engaging in self-harm behaviors which do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 3. Engaging in self-harm behaviors which require an ER visit but not inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15164] 3:  1. Suicide attempt or other type of self-harm which requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240543]. 2. Suicide attempt or other type of self-harm which is disabling 3. Suicide attempt or other type of self-harm which limits self-care activities of daily living Grade 4: 1. Suicide attempt or other type of self-harm which is life threatening and requires urgent intervention

   35 Grade 5:  1. Death by [CONTACT_20673] 2. Death from another type of self-harm 3. Death from any cause  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  Adverse events may be caused by [CONTACT_10980]: 1. the procedures involved in the research; 2. an underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; or 3. other circumstances unrelated to either the research or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject.  In general, adverse events that are determined to be at least partially caused by (1) would be considered related to participation in the research, whereas adverse events determined to be solely caused by (2) or (3) would be considered unrelated to participation in the research.   All adverse events will be rated by [CONTACT_5844] (in consultation with physician study Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240618] and other Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240619], if necessary) on the degree to which they are related to the study intervention using the following attribution scale and definitions:  1. Not related: The adverse event is clearly not related to the study intervention. 2. Unlikely related: The adverse event is doubtfully related to the study intervention. 3. Possibly related: The adverse event may be related to the study intervention. 4. Probably related: The adverse event is likely related to the study intervention. 5. Definitely related: The adverse event is clearly related to the study intervention.  In considering the degree to which the adverse event is related to the intervention, the Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators will consider:   1. Whether the adverse event is a known reaction of the intervention? 2. Whether the adverse event is similar to other adverse events listed in the study protocol and consent documents?  3. Whether the adverse events occurred before in this study?  4. Whether the adverse event is reasonably temporally related to the intervention?  5. Whether the adverse event was present at the baseline assessment of the participant?  6. Whether the adverse event can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical disease status? 7. Whether there are any other potential causes for the adverse event?  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The Principal Investigators (in consultation with physician study Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240618] and other Co-Investigator [CONTACT_240619], if necessary) will be responsible for determining whether an 
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   36 adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. The following definition will be used to determine the expectedness of the AE:  OHRP defines unexpected adverse event as any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: 1. the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or 2. the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event. According to OHRP’s unanticipated problems involving risks and adverse events guidance (2007)88, the vast majority of adverse events occurring in the context of research are expected in light of (1) the known toxicities and side effects of the research procedures; (2) the expected natural progression of subjects’ underlying diseases, disorders, and conditions; and (3) subjects’ predisposing risk factor profiles for the adverse events.  By [CONTACT_63236], the following adverse events are expected for the study: non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, suicidal plan, suicide attempts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240544]-harm, and death from suicide or self-harm. Additionally, given that SGM youth (particularly those with a history of suicide attempts and ideation) experience elevated health disparities compared to the general population on many mental health/substance use markers, we also expect significant comorbidities, including psychiatric and substance use disorders, to be reported over the course of the study.   All adverse events will be rated on whether or not they were expected (Yes, No) according to OHRP criteria and in consideration of the adverse events expected for this study.    6.6.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP  Adverse events will be ascertained by [CONTACT_51856]: 1) spontaneously reported symptoms; 2) observed symptoms and signs; 3) other people’s reports (e.g., parent, guardian, health care provider, child protective services, trusted adult); and through 4) regular assessments using validated questionnaires. The University of Washington Risk Assessment Protocol (UWRAP) will be administered during each major assessment session (Case Series: baseline, 3-month follow-up; Open Trial: baseline, 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up). The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will also be administered during each major assessment session and at the beginning of each virtual, phone, or in person intervention session, to assess suicidal ideation, intent, plans, and behaviors. The UWRAP and C-SSRS are being utilized to identify suicide-related AEs and SAEs. All staff interacting with study participants will be trained to observe participants for signs of injury or illness during virtual and in person assessments. If any injury or illness appears to be related to child abuse and neglect, study staff will also follow the standard of practice for child abuse and neglect, in addition to

   37 documenting an adverse event.  Study staff will also be trained to document spontaneously reported symptoms or other information about adverse events when reported by a participant or another person. If the adverse event is reported to the study team by [CONTACT_19015], a member of the study team will attempt to verify the adverse event by [CONTACT_240596]. Suicidality-related clinical worsening is not solely defined by [CONTACT_122793] C-SSRS scores. Clinical worsening is determined on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_5844], if needed in consultation with Drs. Ramers and Weersing.  6.6.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   The Principal Investigators are responsible for reporting adverse events to the SDSU IRB according to the timelines established in the IRBs reporting policies and will be assisted in submitting reports by [CONTACT_23164].  For all adverse events that are deemed expected and/or unrelated to the study, a summary should be submitted to the NIMH PO with the annual progress report. Adverse events that are not SAEs will be included in the DSMB full data report that is submitted once a year.  6.6.[ADDRESS_292159] be reported to SDSU IRB within 24 hours. A summary of serious adverse events that are deemed expected and/or unrelated to the study will be submitted to the NIMH PO with the annual progress report. Unexpected Serious Adverse Events related to study participation will be reported to the NIMH PO within [ADDRESS_292160] for all deaths and unexpected and related SAEs.  For deaths, the report will be submitted within 5 business days, and for unexpected and related SAEs, the report will be submitted within 10 business days.     6.7 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 6.7.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_19819] (OHRP):  OHRP considers unanticipated problems, in general, to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and

   38 3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Unanticipated problems can include experiences such as protocol deviations, data breaches, having study-related data or documentation unsecured and stolen.   6.7.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_240597] 24 hours. Unanticipated problems which can cause serious risks to others are reported to the NIMH PO and the DSMB within 10 business days of the investigator learning of the event. Any other unanticipated problem will be reported by [CONTACT_240598], the NIMH PO, and the NIMH DSMB within 10 business days.  The unanticipated problem report will include the following information: • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem  6.7.[ADDRESS_292161] their current and future health and privacy via their preferred method of communication (e.g. phone, text, mail).   7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  7.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  • Primary Endpoint(s):   The purpose of the case series is to obtain feedback on study procedures and the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886]. Therefore, there are no formal hypotheses associated with the case series. Only descriptive statistics will be calculated.  For the open trial, it is hypothesized that PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240490]-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (the hypothesized mechanistic targets of the intervention). We will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240491].      7.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   39 For the open pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], N = [ADDRESS_292162] intervention session occurs during the initial baseline appointment, this means that all participants should be included in the analyses.   7.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 7.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  In the case series and open trial, descriptive statistics will be presented as frequencies and percentages (for binary and categorical variables), means with standard deviations, and range (for continuous variables).   In the open trial, qualitative data will be saved in a text file to import into NVivo90 for analysis. Drs. Wells and Blashill will review the qualitative data using a content analysis technique, which identifies emergent themes occurring during discussion. Code mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]91 will be used to develop a preliminary set of codes (themes) corresponding to each potential strength of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240545]. Then, Drs. Wells and Blashill will independently code the remaining data and meet to discuss coding. Once coded, the data will be summarized by [CONTACT_122106].   Inferential tests and checks of assumptions underlying statistical procedures will not be performed in either the case series or open trial. No corrective procedures will be applied.  7.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  As the purpose of the case series is to obtain feedback on study procedures and the PN+SPI [CONTACT_52886], no statistical analyses will be conducted.   In the open trial, the feasibility and acceptability of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240546]. However, we will examine the preliminary impact of the PN+SPI [INVESTIGATOR_240547] (e.g. decreasing thwarted belongingness, increasing suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]). This will be done by [CONTACT_240599]-person changes in thwarted belongingness and suicide-related copi[INVESTIGATOR_240548]’s d.  If missing data are minimal (e.g. 5% or less) available item analysis will be conducted. If greater than 5% of data are missing, multiple imputation will be conducted. Outliers will be defined as ± 3.[ADDRESS_292163] on the sample.

   40 7.4.3 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  In both the case series and open trial, baseline descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample in terms of sociodemographics and psychiatric diagnoses. There is only one treatment group (PN+SPI) so intervention groups cannot be compared. Inferential statistics will not be used.   8 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 8.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS 8.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS [IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  For both the case series and open trial, participants will initially be screened for eligibility via a phone screen conducted by a trained member of the study team. Prior to beginning the phone screen, a trained member of the study team will obtain verbal consent for pre-enrollment screening. The IRB-approved verbal informed consent form will be read verbatim to all study participants over the phone. It describes in detail the phone screening procedure and associated risks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all study procedures, including consenting, will be conducted virtually.   Those who meet the screening criteria will be scheduled for an initial baseline appointment. At the time of the baseline appointment, a trained member will engage in a discussion with all participants and using a written/digital informed consent form that describes in detail the study intervention, study procedures, information about potential risks and benefits of participation, and information regarding whom they can contact [CONTACT_240600]. It will also state that participation is voluntary, that participants can refuse to answer any question, they can withdraw from the study at any time, and that study participation is in no way related to participating in other studies at San Diego State University. Written/digital documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the intervention. The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol:  1. Telephone Screening Consent (see attachment 6) 2. Informed Consent Case Series (see attachment 7) 3. Informed Consent Open Trial (see attachment 8)  [IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  The verbal informed consent for the phone screen will be administered by a trained member of the study team. Prior to beginning the phone screen, the study team member will read the verbal informed consent verbatim to the participant and answer any questions that they may have. The study team member will then ask if they would like to take part in the screening process today. If the participant provides their verbal consent to participate, the study team member administering the informed consent will document that the participant provided their consent to answer the screening questions. This will be done by [CONTACT_240601].  
Suicide Prevention for Gender and Sexual Minority Youth                          Version 1.5 Protocol HS-2020-0076                                                                                30 November 2021  
   41 The informed consent for the case series, as well as open trial, will be administered by a trained member of the study team. This will be done at the beginning of the baseline assessment prior to beginning study procedures. At this time, the study team member will verbally go through the informed consent with the participant and answer the participant’s questions. The study team member will then give the participant time to review the consent form at their own pace and answer any further questions that they may have. The study team member will then ask the participant if they would like to take part in the study. If the participant does wish to participate, the study team member will have the participant sign the informed consent form. The study team member will then sign the informed consent form themselves and provide the participant with a copy of the informed consent form.   Given that we have obtained a waiver of parental consent form from the IRB and an approval of minor’s ability to self-consent, the procedure for administering informed consent for minors in the case series, as well as open trial, will be the same as for adults. These consent procedures use eight-grade verbiage to facilitate comprehension by [CONTACT_240602]. We will not re-consent children who become adults or are emancipated during the study.  We will not obtain consent from speakers of language other than English, as the ability to speak English is one of the inclusion criteria required for study enrollment. We will assess competency and comprehension/understanding through discussing the informed consent with the participant. Similarly, we will not obtain surrogate consent for those unable to consent on their own behalf, as the ability to provide informed consent is one of the inclusion criteria required for study enrollment.   8.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_21224], investigator, sponsor/funding agency (NIMH), and regulatory authorities (OHRP, DSMB). If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the SDSU Institutional Review Board (IRB), the DSMB, funding agency (NIMH), and OHRP and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  If suspended, the study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the sponsor/funding agency (NIMH), IRB, or other relevant regulatory or oversight bodies (OHRP, DSMB).  8.1.[ADDRESS_292164] protected, accessible only to trained study staff.

The investigative team will work with the Institutional Review Board that regulates the study, as well as Family Health Centers of San Diego, to coordinate the data sharing process. Any information that could potentially identify a participant will be removed prior to distributing the data. All investigators funded under this funding opportunity announcement are expected to share data collected as part of an award. Thus, in accordance with National Institute of Mental Health policy, we will prepare and submit de-identified data to the National Data Archive (NDA).

   45 ○ Subject screening and enrollment log template ○ Confidential subject identification code template ○ Protocol violations and deviations log ○ Adverse event/serious adverse event log ○ Sample source documents  The study staff will be responsible for ensuring that all essential documents in the regulatory binder are complete and current.  The research team will receive ongoing training and feedback via quality control checks. The following quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented in both the case series and open trial:   Good Clinical Practice (GCP) - Study staff who directly interact with participants will complete GCP training requirements in accordance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (R2). Each staff member’s completion of GCP training requirements will be documented in a GCP training log created by [CONTACT_3476], as well as maintained in the regulatory binder. All other study staff is required to complete the CITI Human Subjects Research (HSR) – Social-Behavioral course required by [CONTACT_240608].  All study staff members are responsible for ensuring that their GCP and/or HSR training is up-to-date. The Principal Investigators understand and accept responsibility for overseeing the conduct of the study in accordance with GCP.  Safety Monitoring — Study staff will monitor whether documentation related to safety protocols indicates that safety protocols have been appropriately followed.  This will include SOPs for the telephone screening and all assessments as well as the patient navigation intervention Module 10. Documentation will include forms completed for the screening, assessments, and intervention, along with the progress notes for the patient navigation intervention.  Informed Consent — Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as a percentage of the completed consent documents. This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, accuracy, and completeness. Feedback will be provided to the study team to ensure proper consenting procedures are followed. Study staff will be responsible for updating the informed consent in the regulatory binder every time the IRB approves a new version.  Source Document Verification (SDV) — Study staff will confirm that accurate, complete, and current source documentation is maintained. SDV will be ongoing.   Data Integrity — Data collection will occur in the form of self-report questionnaires, clinician-administered verbal assessments, logs of patient navigation encounters, observations of study team members, and key informant interviews. All study data will ultimately be entered into study databases. To ensure accuracy, trained study team members will regularly perform data verification and data cleaning procedures.    Intervention Fidelity — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the intervention phase of the study.    Protocol Deviations — The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a

The investigators will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.    Source data will be recorded in either electronic or paper form. Source data includes self-report surveys, clinical interviews, key informant interviews, patient navigation encounter forms, and audio recordings of patient navigator sessions and interviews conducted as part of the study. All processing of source data will be ongoing.   All paper source data (e.g. clinical interviews) will be entered into an electronic study database directly from the source documents to ensure that it is consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.  Additionally, double data entry will be performed by [CONTACT_49936].  Most surveys will be completed by [CONTACT_240609], reducing the need for data entry.  All audio files will be transcribed verbatim by a research assistant and verified by a second research assistant.

   47 data or audio recordings. Aggregated, de-identified data will be retained indefinitely for data sharing purposes, as required by [CONTACT_52042].  8.1.9 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS    According to the SDSU Human Research Protection Program, a protocol deviation is defined as when there is inconsistency between the procedures carried out in a study and the procedures stated in the research protocol, or when regulations regarding the manner in which research is being conducted are not being followed (from SDSUHRPP Standards and Practices v. 02.13.19). The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  It will be the responsibility of the investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations to the SDSU IRB within 5 days. All deviations will be addressed in study source documents, and reported to NIMH PO with the annual progress report.  All protocol deviations will also be reported to the DSMB annually in the full data report.  These reports should indicate that the monitoring entities (PI, IRB, DSMB) and appropriate regulatory entities have been notified in accordance with the approved monitoring plan and federal regulations.      8.1.10 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY   San Diego State University is committed to the principle of rapid data, model, and software release to the scientific community.  We will adhere to the Data Sharing Policy developed by [CONTACT_240610].   The goals for dissemination of our research are to directly share the study findings and materials: 1) with the research community via scholarly publications in peer-reviewed public health, behavioral science, and medical journals and presentations at professional conferences; 2) with the community and public via a variety of channels, including presentations in the community and at FHCSD and; 3) with researchers and the public on websites, including the websites of the Multiple Principal Investigators, the SDSU HealthLINK Center, and the Center for Research on Sexuality and Sexual Health (SASH). Decisions regarding dissemination will be made by [CONTACT_240611].   The study team will adhere to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication.  Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices. Research data which documents, supports, and validates research findings will be made available after the main findings from the final research data set have been accepted for publication. Such research data will be de-identified to prevent the disclosure of personal identifiers.

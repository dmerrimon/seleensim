Version:  Amendment #7, September 02, 2016Page [ADDRESS_253474] and dramatic.  Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIP N) is a major and often dose-limiting side 
effect of antineoplastic agents. The inciden ce of chemotherapy-induced  neurotoxicity ranges 
from 0 to 70% (commonly 30-40%) of patients receiving chemotherapy, related to the timing 
and cumulative dose.  Pain is the most co mmon symptom, usually described as a burning, 
stinging dysesthesia. There is no standa rd effective therapy for CIPN pain. 
 We propose a straightforward randomized controlle d trial of actual Scra mbler Therapy versus 
sham therapy (electrodes placed on the back, which does not cause pain relief but was perceived as active treatment in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250]).   The primary endpoint is patient re ported change in pain from day 0 to day 28, on a numeric scale 
of 0-10 (question #3 of the Modified Brief Pa in Inventory, Appendix B). Secondary endpoints 
will include changes in the complete Brief Pa in Inventory, the CIPN EORTC Q-20 scale, and 
changes in pain drug use. With 30 patients and a one-sided type I error rate of 10%, we have 
87% power to detect a 50% reduction in pain obs erved in single arm trials and a 10% reduction 
in pain with sham treatment, in pa tients with a starting pain score of ≥4. 
 Subjects enter the study and get scrambler ther apy or placebo for 10 sessions, usually as 
weekdays, for 2 weeks. Then, they are followed without any protocol  treatment until Day 28 
when the primary endpoint is assessed. After th e primary assessment is done the groups are “un-
blinded” and informed of their study treatment, real or sham. Those in the sham group with 
scores ≥[ADDRESS_253475] 10 scrambler sessions. All patients are followed for a total 
of 3 months.

3. Objectives 
3.1 Primary 
3.1.1 To determine the change in pain from day 0 to day 28 with scrambler therapy in patients 
with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropat hy and pain (CIPN).  This endpoint also 
serves to get preliminary information for planning future, larger, phase III studies. 
 
The primary measurement tool for pain will be the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (modified 
specifically for CIPN by [CONTACT_211571], [CONTACT_211591], and used with permission) 
which gives information on Pain Now, Worst,  Least and Average Pa in, and Interference 
with Normal Activity. 
3.2 Secondary 
3.2.1 The secondary endpoints will include changes in  the complete Brief Pain Inventory, the 
CIPN EORTC Q-20 scale, and changes in pain drug use. 
3.2.2 The primary measurement tools used to determine if MC-5A Calmare therapy will improve endpoints include the following: neuropathy (European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualit y of Life Cancer Chemotherapy Induced 
Peripheral Neuropathy-20 Instrument (CIPN-20)); opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834] (morphine  oral equivalent 
daily dose, MOED) and other drug (anti-depres sant, anti-convulsant) use. We will also 
study the duration of the effect. 
 
4. Hypotheses 
4.1 Primary 
 Scrambler Therapy will improve pain re lated to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy 
significantly more than sham therapy at day 28.  
4.2 Secondary 
 Scrambler Therapy will result in significant improvements in the total CIPN modified 
Brief Pain Inventory score and the motor and sensory subscales of the CIPN 20 compared 
to sham therapy. 
 Pain medication and morphine oral equivale nt dose (MOED) daily amounts will decrease 
by [CONTACT_2669] 20% more from the start of treatme nt Day 1 (pre) to Day 30 days (post), in the 
group receiving scrambler therapy versus those who received sham therapy.

5. Background and Rationale 
5.1 Neuropathy due to chemotherapy agents (CIPN) 
CIPN is a major and often dose-limiting side effect of antineoplastic agents1 including the 
taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinums ( carboplatin, cis-platinum, and oxaliplatin), vinca 
alkaloids (vincristine, vinblas tine, and vinorelbine), proteo some inhibitors (bortezimib2), 
immunomodulating drugs such as lenalomid3, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_211548]4. The 
incidence of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity  ranges from 0 to 70% (commonly 30-40%) of 
patients receiving chemotherapy, relate d to the timing and cumulative dose.[ADDRESS_253476] effective therapy for CIPN  pain. Tricyclic antidep ressants (TCAs) do not 
work for CIPN and have significan t adverse effects. Amitriptyline7 and Nortryptiline8 were no 
better than placebo in randomized trials. Lamotr igine had no effect on CIPN in a randomized 
placebo controlled trial.[ADDRESS_253477] the cancer; use is not suggested until larger randomized trials are completed. Acetyl-L-carnitine has be en reported to reduce established CIPN in one 
small series
[ADDRESS_253478] its use until safety and efficacy can be 
confirmed in larger randomized trials.13 Venlafaxine14 reduced the incidence or prevented 
oxaliplatin-CIPN from 76% to 35%  but has only been tested in oxaliplatin, a drug not used in 
breast cancer treatment, and has not been te sted as a treatment drug. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_211549]-
amitriptyline-ketamine (BAK) gel reduced CI PN-sensory symptoms compared to placebo15, but 
incompletely and not in the feet – where th e symptom is most common. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 
is the only drug shown in a randomized  trial to reduce CIPN pain scores16, but only from [ADDRESS_253479] cancer. 
 Acupuncture reduced CIPN pain scores in small, non-randomized series
 of 517 and 1818 cancer 
patients. In one larger trial, acupuncture relie ved CIPN from paclitax el and oxaliplatin more 
effectively than drug treatment with Vitamin B12 injections, 67% vs. 40%19. In one small trial, 
nerve conduction studies showed improvement after acupuncture: 5 of 6 patients improved clinically, correlated with improvements in mean nerve conduction velocity (NCV) (m/s) and mean amplitude (μ V) (p=0.03)

CIPN. Peripheral nerve stimulation27 28 is growing in use but there are no controlled trials to 
date. Not all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_211552], however, as the published data show that trans-cutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS) is  not useful in cancer pain29, and TENS has not been evaluated in 
CIPN.[ADDRESS_253483].  
The goal of the device is to provi de “non-pain” information to the cutaneous nerves to block the 
effect of pain information  The device is a cutaneous electrical stimulator th at uses C fiber stimulation to transmit patterns 
of waveforms simulating [ADDRESS_253484] C fibre excitation; electrical C fibre excitation without information should also produce pain, whereas Calmare therapy produces pain relief. Second, Calmare therapy is not just producing widespread paraesth esia. The patient feels 
the effect of stimulation only in the painful ar ea under the electrode contact-area. Immediately 
after the treatment, no parasthesia or anesthes ia is noted. Furthermore, the intensity of 
stimulation current is very low, and peaks ne ver exceed 5.5 mA, which is likely too low to 
produce analgesia. Fourth, the sensation perceive d by [CONTACT_102] (electrical current, pressure, 
flow, or other “bee sting” sensations under the electrodes) suggests that  non-pain stimuli are 
being felt, not just analgesia numbing sensation. Another aspect of the hy pothesized pain relief is

second trial, 226 patients with neuropathic pain including failed back surgery, brachial plexus neuropathy, and others 
were treated.
32 80% of patients responded with > 50% pain 
relief, 10% responded with pain relief from 25% to 49%, and only 10% had no response (P<0.0001).  Based on these results the FDA approved Scrambler therapy for cancer pain treatment February 25, 2009. In clinical practice, over [ADDRESS_253487] US trial, Smith et al
33 studied 16 typi[INVESTIGATOR_211553] (median age 56, usual chemotherapy drugs) with refractory CIPN and pain scores over 6. Each patient was treated for 10 sessions of 60 minutes each, 
Monday through Friday. The electrodes were applied in 
the areas of the pain, as s hown in Figure 2. The results 
are shown in Figure 3. The average pain reduction was 
59%, similar to direct spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185].  The effect 
on some patients was dramatic, with [ADDRESS_253488] now replicated these results in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], with a 47% reduction in CIPN pain.

Ricci et al treated 47 cancer pain patients (ma ny types of pain, not just CIPN) with Scrambler  
therapy. Pain intensity decreased by 74% from 4.7 (SD 2.9) at baseline to 2.5 (SD 2.3) at the end 
of the second week of treatment and 2.6 (SD 2.6) at one month. (Figure 5) Nearly all patients found it satisfactory or very satisf actory and would continue using it.
35  
 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087]
36, 52 patients with chronic 
neuropathic pain (spi[INVESTIGATOR_211555], failed back syndrome, post-herpetic neuropathy) were randomized to Scrambler therapy or treatment by [CONTACT_211572]
37. 
The patients had post-surgical failed back, post herpetic, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_211556]. These results are shown 
in Figure 6. The mean pain intensity score at outset was 8.1. At one month, the Scrambler therapy group had a 91% decrease in pain to 0.[ADDRESS_253489] therapy group had a 28% reduced pain score, which was maintained for 3 months. Pain drug consumption decreased by 72% in the Scrambler therapy group, including opi [INVESTIGATOR_858], anti-depressants, and 
anti-convulsants. Allodynia, or pain on normal touching of the skin, was reduced in the Scrambler therapy patients from 77% to 15% at 3 months. All differences were both clinically and statistically significant.   Other small series show a >50 % reduction in refractory post –herpetic pain
38 and cancer pain39. 
 In a large series of co mplicated pain patients, 
including spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172], neural gia, chronic regional pain 
syndrome, and multisite pain, D’Amato and colleagues reported a significant reducti on in pain scores across 
all diagnostic groups
40. (Figure 7) 
 In a recent trial, Pachman et al treated 13 patients with refractory low back pain at the Mayo Clinic. Me an average daily pain scores decreased by 54% 
from baseline to day 10 of treatment.  Median weekly pain scores decreased by 70% after [ADDRESS_253490] of a placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

significant reduction in pain pers isting to 90 days (Figure 9) and dramatic improvement in how 
the pain interfered with normal life (Figure 10). 41 
 
 
 
In this trial of 39 patients, Smith et al also  saw significant improvements in both the motor and 
sensory subscales of the CIPN-20. (All p values < 0.001) Again, this was a single arm trial with 
no sham or placebo group. 
 
  
 
While these results in CIPN are promising, th ere are NO sham or placebo controlled trials. The 
results to date could potentially be due to pla cebo effect, as seen in one small trial of high 
frequency spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185]42, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_211557] 10% pain 
relief over 3 months 8-15. In the recent successful trial of duloxetine for CIPN16, the CIPN 
placebo group had reduced pain scores of only 0.1- 0.2 points (on a 10-point scale) over [ADDRESS_253492].  While several hundred thousand CIPN patients stand to benefit, the bigger group of beneficiaries 
is the 116 million Americans with chronic pain
43. Evaluating if Scrambler Therapy works in one 
well-defined pain group will stimulate the needed research with other pain patients.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Days 
 
Day 1/Treatment Initiation: 
1. Treatment should be initiated by [CONTACT_211573]. The 
intensity of the stimulus is increased until the patient can first feel some sensation 
associated with one or both of the electrodes.  
2. Then, over a few seconds, the intensity is in creased to what is maximally tolerated.  
3. Once the intensity is at its maximum setting, th e research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_211560].  If the pain level is not decreased, the machine will be reset to zero, the 
electrodes will be repositioned and the machine will be restarted in the manner described above.  If the pain is not completely resolved  with one set of electrodes, a second set will 
be applied in a similar fashion. Once sa tisfactory electrode placement and stimulus 
intensity is determined, therapy is maintained for a total of [ADDRESS_253501] been finalized, photographs may be taken of the 
sites of the electrodes including lower arms, hands, lower legs, feet, and lower back to 
document the placement of the electrode s on each day. These photographs will be 
documented in the patients’ electronic medical record and will not include any identifying features.    
 
Days 2-10: 
1. Treatment will be administered using th e same principles (each day evaluated 
independently and not necessarily repr oducing the electrode arrangements and

stimulation parameters of the previous da y) for 30 minutes on consecutive days 
(Monday-Friday for 2 weeks).  
2. Up to two or three days may be skipped to allow for weekends and/or holidays, if needed. 
If the participant presents without any pain, th en the treatment will be “held” for that day 
and this information will be recorded.   
3. Treatment does not proceed if th e patient does not have pain. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose and Application 
 
1. Electrodes are applied on the skin in the pain-affected area. 
2. The electrodes are never applied directly on the pain area, unless there is no pain free 
area. In that case, the electrode will be appl ied to the most pain free area, as per the 
manufacturer’s and inventors instructions. 
7.5.2 Sham Treatments 
The sham treatment has been extensively tested at the Mayo Clinic with half of the 10 patients 
able to discern that their treatment was a sham. (Loprinzi, Barton, Pachman, Smith, unpublished 
data) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Days 
 
1. The Sham procedure will be implemented in  exactly the same way as the Scrambler 
Therapy procedure, except that the placement of the electrodes will occur on the back, 
not near the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158407]  (away from the main region of pain, which in CIPN is 
nearly always maxima l in the feet).  
2. The distal electrode (black) will be placed on the back midway from the posterior axillary 
line and the midline on the left side in the T8 dermatome.  
3. The proximal electrode (non-black) will be pl aced on the back midway from the posterior 
axillary line and the midline on the left side in the T4 dermatome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose and Application 
The electrodes will be applied and sessions will continue similarly as in the Scrambler Therapy group, with the exception of the different placement areas noted. 
 We will attempt to control for bias by [CONTACT_211574]-placer use the same script and follow exactly the same procedures, asking the exact same  questions (“Do you feel any sensation?” “Let 
me know when you feel the sensation.” “Let me know when you feel the sensation is at your limit of tolerance.”) when placing “real” or sham leads.

7.6 Patient-Reported Outcomes 
7.6.1 General 
In addition to the patient-reported outcomes  described below and as outlined on the Study 
Calendar, the following information will be  collected for all participants:   
 
1. Before and after each Scrambler Therapy/Sham treatment session daily, the “pain now” 
question from the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_211561], as in prior studies:  “Please rate 
your pain/discomfort on a scale of [ADDRESS_253503] tells how much 
pain/discomfort from the chemotherapy rela ted neuropathy you have RIGHT NOW.”   
2. Patients will be asked to state whether they believe they are receiving the active or sham therapy at the end of the [ADDRESS_253504] treatment:  “Did the treatment help you 
with the pain and or numbness?” Yes/ No. “W ould you want to continue the treatment if 
it was available?” Yes/No 
7.6.2 BPI [CONTACT_41574] – Modified for CIPN 
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form44 is a pain assessment tool used with cancer patients 
to measure both severity of pain (first 5 items ) and interference caused by [CONTACT_77368] (item 6 with 7 
components) on 0-10 scales (0=does not interfere; 10= completely interferes.) It is widely used in 
cancer pain evaluation45 and has been modified specifically for neuropathy46.  
 The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_211562], end of treatment and at 1 month (28 days), 2 months (8 weeks), and 3 months (12 weeks) after the Scrambler/Sham therapy. Those participating in sham therapy group and choosing Scrambler therapy after 28 days, will complete 
the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_211563], and at  1 and 2 months after the Scrambler therapy. 
Before and after Scrambler/Sham therapy daily, the “pain now” question from the BPI (question 
#4) will be asked and documented, as in prior studies.

The reasons for discontinuation or  protocol treatment include: 
 
 Non-compliance with the study protocol; including, but not limited to not attending the 
majority of scheduled visits.  
 Unacceptable major toxicity.  
 Intercurrent illness or condition that would, in  the judgment of the treating investigator, 
affect assessment of clinical status to a significant degree or re quire discontinuation of 
study intervention. 
 At subject’s own request. Note: The reason fo r discontinuation from the study must be 
documented. The patients will be included in the overall evaluation of response (intent-
to-treat analysis) if any protocol interven tion was administered prior to withdrawal. 
 Study is closed or cancelled for any reason. 
7.8.2 Withdrawal from Study

 Subject withdraws consent for follow-up. 
 Subject is lost to follow-up. 
 Study is terminated for any reason.

“scrambler” vs. “sham” treatment due to the communication between the staff performing the 
training.    The patients to be approached to take part in training will have a diagnosis also of peripheral 
neuropathy, as this will be the population in the randomized study.  We will use the same, IRB-
approved informed consent and the study team will explain to these patients that their participation will not be randomized, that they will receive scrambler therapy; however, that all other aspects of the study (inclu ding questionnaires, pain and medication diary collection) will 
continue as per the primary tr ial.  This discussion will be  documented in the medical and 
research records.    We expect to need 2-3 participants for training activities; however, in case of study staff changes 
during the study or any need for additional trai ning, we will increase our recruitment goal by a 
total of 5 participants.    In case of any non-evaluable pati ents, we will increase our re cruitment goal by a total of 5 
participants. The total recruitm ent goal with all potential addi tional participants will be 40.

1. A palliative care consult will be required of all potential patients.  This is needed to confirm medical history, 
current symptoms, and eligibility/appropriateness for the clinical trial.  A member of the Palliative Care team at 
Johns Hopkins, who is also a study team member, will conduct this visit.   
2. Prior to each Scrambler Therapy/Sham Treatment session a physical assessment will be done by a member of the 
study team to document any new/changes in physical symptoms related to CIPN; a full physical exam is not planned. This is to ensure good performance status, absence of sores, etc. 
3. All pain medications will be recorded daily during intervention and for a 7 day period around follow-up 
questionnaires; opi[INVESTIGATOR_211565]. 
4. Eligible subjects are randomized to  receive Scrambler Therapy or Sham Treatment.  Up to 5 additional 
participants will be included in a non-randomized fashion fo r training sessions with study staff; these participants 
will not count towards the overall accrual goal.  NOTE:  To distinguish traini ng participants from those involved 
in the randomized clinical trial, these subjects will be assigned unique/different study numbers.   
5. A phone call will be made 3-[ADDRESS_253509] treatme nt session (Scrambler Therapy or Sham Treatment) to 
ask about any untoward symptoms that may have happened upon withdrawal of MCA-5. 
6. Participants randomized to the sham group will be offere d the option to receive the Scrambler Therapy, if, at Day 
28 their pain is still ≥4, and not relieved to their satisfaction. These patients will be “un-blinded” and offered [ADDRESS_253510] session of Scrambler Therapy/Sh am Treatment, participants will be asked whether they 
think they received the Scrambler Therapy or the Sham Tr eatment.  After the final session, participants will also 
be asked the following questions: “Did the treatment help you with the pain and or numbness?” (Yes/No), and 
“Would you want to continue the treatment if available?” (Yes/No) 
8. Follow-up may occur by [CONTACT_648]/mail, if required.  
9. Patients who receive Scrambler Therapy after Sham Treat ment will have follow-up assessments at the same 
timepoints as if originally assigned to receive Scrambler Therapy; these par ticipants will be on study for about 4 
months to complete all assessments. 
 
Note: The schedule should be followed as closely as is realistically possible; however, the schedule may be modified due to problems such as scheduling delays or conflicts (e.g., clinic closure, poor weather conditions, vacations, etc.) 
with the guidance of the Principal Investigator/designee, as  appropriate, and will not be reportable as a deviation 
unless the endpoints of the study are affected.

was one incident where the Scrambler Therapy machine malfunctioned resulting in the patient 
feeling a short, temporary jolt, which resulted in no permanent damage to the patient. There is a small risk that patients may receive a small el ectrical charge from the machine, which will be a 
surprise to the patient but is not hurtful or harmful. 
9.1 General 
In the case that adverse events related to th e study intervention are reported, these will be 
recorded per the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE) Version 4.0 for adverse event 
reporting that can be found at http://ctep.cancer. gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 Information about all interven tion-related adverse events, in cluding those volunteered by [CONTACT_1560], discovered by [CONTACT_131558]/study personnel questioning, or detected through physical 
examination, or other means, will be collect ed, followed, and reported appropriately.   
 The adverse events related to any ongoing treatment for the patie nt’s underlying cancer or other 
medical conditions will not be collected. 
9.2 Reporting Procedures 
All intervention-related adverse events will be captured on the a ppropriate study-specific report 
forms (CRFs) or in a designated database.  
 The same applies to any adverse event classified  as a “serious adverse event;” these will also 
only be reported if intervention-/study-related.    Any unexpected intervention-related adverse events  and serious adverse events will be reported 
to the IRB per current institutional standards. If  an adverse event requires modification of the 
informed consent, these modifications will be prov ided to the IRB with the report of the adverse 
event. If an adverse event requir es modification to the study protoc ol, these modifications will be 
provided to the IRB as soon as is possible.

13. Statistical Considerations 
13.1 Overall 
The primary endpoint is change in  patient-reported pain from day 0 to day 28 as measured by [CONTACT_211581], question #3 (Appendi x B).  This endpoint also serves to get 
preliminary information for planning future, larger, phase III studies. 
 Secondary endpoints will include the total Brief Pain Inventory score, the sensory and motor 
subscales of the CIPN 20, and the Morphine Oral Equivalents Dose at day 28 compared to sham 
therapy. We will also report the daily (days 1-10 ) changes in “pain now” before and after each 
treatment, to be comparable to  all the other reported studies. 
13.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
We are anticipating that the starting pain scor e will be 4-6 based on VCU, Italian, and Mayo 
Clinic data. We are anticipating that the reductio n in CIPN pain score will be over 50% based on 
the VCU, Italian, and Mayo Clinic data. We antic ipate a possible 10% reduction in pain scores 
over [ADDRESS_253516] a larger reduction in  pain scores than those randomized to the placebo, or sham, 
treatment. Power calculations were performed using a simulation approach.  Pain scores were simulated using a bivariate normal distribution with a mean (SD) of 4 (2) at baseline for both groups, with means ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 (30% to 10% decrease) for the control group post-
treatment and mean of 2 (50% de crease) for the Scrambler group post-treatment.  Post-treatment 
scores for both treatment arms were assumed to have a SD = 1.5.  Based on previous data, a 
value of 0.[ADDRESS_253517]-treatment scores.  Any patient with 1) a simulated pain score at ba seline less than 4, or 2) a simulated pain score 
less than [ADDRESS_253518]-treatment, or 3) a simulated pain  score greater than [ADDRESS_253519] < 0.10.  1000 simulations for each scenario were performed.  The table below shows sample sizes and resulting power fo r the differences between treatment arms. 
 
Total N Power Percent Decrease 
in Treatment Arm Percent Decrease in 
Control Arm 
30 60 90 87.3% 86.6% 77.6% 50% 50% 50% 10% 20% 30% 
 To detect the proposed effect si ze, 30 patients total, 15 on Scrambler therapy and 15 on the sham 
arm, will yield 87.3% power with a 1- sided type I error rate of 10%.

Version:  Amendment #7, September 02, 2016Page [ADDRESS_253520] to 
receive actual Scrambler treatment at the end of their 28-day treat ment period. However, this is 
not a “crossover” design trial wherein each patient serves as his/her own control.  Data collection 
for the primary endpoint will occur before patients in the sham arm are given the option to receive Scrambler treatment.  This data will not be formally analyzed but instead used to help 
plan future studies. 
13.[ADDRESS_253521].  We will conclude a significant 
difference between treatment arms if the p valu e < 0.10.  This difference will be reported with a 
90% confidence interval.  Because this is a small study that is looking for an unbiased signal of activity, and the first randomized sham-controlled study for Scrambler ther apy, we did not want to set the bar too high 
for concluding a positive effect of the treatment.  This is not the definitive phase [ADDRESS_253522] w ith a significance level < 0.05 due to the smaller 
sample size.  We chose a type I error threshold of 10% to account for this, so  that a p-value of 
0.[ADDRESS_253523] that larger studie s are worthy of pursuit. 
13.3.2 Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include change in all of the pain scores (worst, least, average, right now, 
relief) recorded by [CONTACT_55817], changes in the CIPN -20 sensory and motor subscales, and change in 
medication use and doses; all were measured at entry, 1, 2, and 3 months. All of these measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_211582] t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate.  Changes in scores over time will be analysed using appropriate regression models es timated with GEE or random effects to control for correlation 
between measurements from the same patient.  All p values will be calculated for descriptive purposes only and we do not plan to control for multiple comparisons.   We will also compare baseline characteristics between treatment arms.  Because treatment 
assignment is randomized, we do not expect to see differences.  However, if we detect imbalance 
in variables such as concomitant  medicinal use and supportive treatment, then we will control for 
this in the main analyses.

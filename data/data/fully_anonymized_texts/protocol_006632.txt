Study Number: TAK -020-1001 Phase: 1
Study Design:
This is a phase 1, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single and multiple -dose study in healthy volunteers. 
The study  is comprised of [ADDRESS_47968] a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening and Day -1.
Study Design Schematic
SRD=single -rising dose, MRD=multiple -rising dose.
Part 1: SRD
This part will comprise a maxim um of 9 cohorts. Each cohort will comprise 8 randomized subjects, with 6 receiving 
TAK -020 and 2 receiving placebo in the fasted state. Sentinel dosing will be used for Cohort 1 with only 2 subjects 
dosed on the morning of Day 1 (1 receiving TAK -020 and 1 receiving placebo). The remaining subjects will be dosed 
following agreement with the investigator and [COMPANY_005] after reviewing 24 -hour postdose safety (adverse events [AEs], 
vital signs, 12 -lead electrocardiograms [ECGs]) and tolerability data. Sentinel dos ing will not be necessary for other 
cohorts, provided that exposure is observed in ≥4 subjects receiving active treatment and in agreement with the 
investigator and [COMPANY_005], otherwise sentinel dosing in the subsequent cohort will be required.
TAK -020 will b e orally administered as a solution with a starting dose of 0.1 mg for Cohort 1. Dosing for the 
subsequent cohorts will only occur after review of the safety, tolerability, and minimum 24 -hour pharmacokinetic 
(PK) data from the previous cohort. For each do se escalation, exposures may be increased by a maximum of 5 -fold for 
Cohorts 2 -4 and a maximum of 2 -fold for Cohorts 5 to 9. Doses may also be decreased as appropriate.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
TAK -020 is an orally available small mo lecule irreversible inhibitor of Bruton’s ty rosine kinase 
(BTK) for the tr eatment of autoimmune diseases. BTK is expressed in mult iple cell t ypes 
(including B cells, neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, mast cells and osteoclasts) and the funct ion 
of BTK in these cell t ypes may be clinically relevant in a variet y of autoimmune dis eases [1-4]. 
BTK plays a crit ical ro le in B-cell receptor activat ion, which results in pro liferat ion and 
phenoty pic different iation of immature B cells into antibody- secret ing cells [2,3]. It al so pl ays an 
essent ial role in Fcγ an d Fcε receptor si gnaling by [CONTACT_45306]- based act ivation motifs (ITAM) in mult iple cell t ypes [1,2,5] . Inhibit ing B cell act ivation 
and ITAM signaling are 2 of the main mechanisms through which TAK -020 is proposed to 
contribute to clinical efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune disease. 
The init iation of rheumatoi d arthritis (RA) invo lves the presentation of self -antigens, leading to the 
activat ion of T andB lymphocytes. Activation of the adaptive immune response results in cytokine 
secretion and autoantibody  producti on, which promotes inflammat ion [6]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_45265] B cells have been developed in an atte mpt to attenuate disease progression. 
Whereas current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_45266] a single factor contribut ing to RA pathogenesis, 
BTK is an appealing therapeut ic target because of its function in mult iple signaling pathways 
downstream of the B cell  receptor ( BCR) and F cεRs. 
TAK -020 engages the target rapi[INVESTIGATOR_45267], even after plasma 
concentrations are undetectable, with proven efficacy  in a rat collagen -induced arthrit is (CIA) 
model with median effect ive dose (ED 50) of 0.31 mg/kg/day . The high select ivity of TAK -020
reduces potential off -target effects and it is anticipated to improve the benefit risk profile of this 
compound com pared wi th com petitors (eg, ibrutinib). 
TAK -[ADDRESS_47982] imated as 98% from oral 
dosing so lution. In nonclinical studies, TAK -[ADDRESS_47983] asma concentrations generally  occurring wi thin 2 hours postdose. 
Terminal disposit ion phase h alf-life (t 1/2z)of TAK -020 after oral administrati on was 4.4- 7.3 hours 
in rats and 3.8 -6.7 hours in dogs. The oral bioavailabilit y (BA) of TAK -020 in anima ls was l ow 
(12.6% -21.8% in rats and 8.17% to16.5% in dogs). Absorption could be modulated by 
P-glycoprotein (P -gp), since TAK -020 is likely to be a P -gp substrate based on results obtained 
from a study  using LLC -PK1-MDR1 cells. 
TAK -020 is mainly metabo lized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and is also metabolized to 
a minor extent by  [CONTACT_097]2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 ( TAK -020- [ZIP_CODE], TAK -020- [ZIP_CODE]). 
TAK -020 has inhibitory effects on CYP2C19 activit y with 50% inhibitory  concentrati on (IC50)of 
10 μm ol/L wi thout prei ncubat ion and 6.3 μmo l/L with pre-incubat ion (TAK -020- [ZIP_CODE]). 
TAK -020 has little or no time -dependent inhibitory effects on the other cy tochrom e P-450 ( CYP )
activit ies (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 , CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5) up to 30 μmol/L

TAK -020 was found to be an inducer for CYP2B6.
A co mprehensive series of nonclinical safet y studies (Good Laboratory  Practi ce [GLP ]) was
conducted with TAK -020 to support early  human studi es. No safet y concerns were i dentified in 
safet y pharmaco logy assessments (human ether -à-go- go–related gene [hERG], 
electrocardi ography , cardi ovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , central  nervous system  [CNS]), geneti c

been conducted in rats and dogs. The oral dose levels were 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg in the rat s tudy and 
5, 20, and 75 mg/kg in the dog study. The no -observed –adverse -effect l evel (NOAEL) in the rat 
study  was 5 mg/kg (AUC=63 ng*h/mL, sexes co mbined). The NOAEL in the dog study  was 
20mg/kg (AUC=518 ng*h/mL, sexes co mbined). At the low -observed -advers e-effect -level 
(LOAEL) the combined sex AUC in rat and dog were 431 ng*h/ mL and 6418 ng* h/mL,

4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
The nonclinical pharm acology, toxi cology, and pharm acokinet ic (PK) studies support the 
proposed escalat ing single and mult iple dose study of TAK -020 in healt hy subjects.
The study  will characterize the safet y, tolerabili ty, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of TAK -020
in healthy subjects.

will be used for Cohort 1 with only 2 subjects dosed on the morning of Day 1 (1 receiving 
TAK -020 and 1 receiving placebo). The remaining subjects will be dosed fo llowing agreem ent 
with the invest igator and [COMPANY_005] after reviewing 24 -hour postdose safet y (adverse events [AEs], 
vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs) and tolerabilit y data. Sent inel dosing will not be necessary for other 
cohorts provided t hat exposure is observed in ≥[ADDRESS_47986] igator and [COMPANY_005], otherwise sent inel dosing in the subsequent cohort 
will be required.
TAK -020 will be orally administered as a solut ion with a starting dos e of 0.1mg for Cohort 1. 
Dosing for the subsequent cohorts will only occur after review of the safet y, tolerabilit y, and 
minimum 24 -hour PK data from the previous cohort. For each dose escalat ion, exposures may be 
increased by a maximum of 5 -fold for Coho rts 2-4 and a maximum of 2- fold for Cohorts 5 to 9.

6.1.1 Dose Escalation
The dose escalat ion scheme i s shown in Figure 6.b. All decisio ns concerning dose escalat ion will

most sensit ive nonclinical species, which is the rat (63 ng·hr/mL, sexes combined). For doses with 
exposure above the NOAEL doses may be increased to give a maximum of 2 -fold increase in 
exposure. Doses may also be decreased as appropriate. In cohorts in t he next part of the study  
(Part 2), the doses may be increased as long as the maximum exposure mult iplier i s below [ADDRESS_47989].
All AEs reported during the Treatment Period, both within and across cohorts, up to the time of

and/or study  terminat ion in accordance wit h the prespecified criteria for 
discontinuat ion/terminat ion (Section 6.3.1 ).
Following assessment of the AEdata and pre -defined criteria for study  terminat ion, dose 
escalat ion may be interrupted/stopped and the blind broken for further analysis. Based on review 
of unblinded data, [COMPANY_005] in consultation with the PI[INVESTIGATOR_1318] d ecide if a nd how it is appropriate for the

Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory  matches d ocum ented inventory .
Verifying that the log is completed for the drug lot used to prepare each dose.
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that required fields are co mpleted accurately and legibly.
A site repres entative or unblinded pharmacy monit or, otherwise uninvo lved wit h study  
conduct, will review the randomization schedule and subject dosing log prior to Day [ADDRESS_48037] the current inventory of all sponsor -supplied drugs 
(TAK -020) on a sponsor -approved drug accountabilit y log. The f ollowing inform ation will be 
recorded at a minimum: protocol number and tit le, name [CONTACT_45358], site ident ifier and 
number, descript ion of sponsor -supplied drugs, expi[INVESTIGATOR_45278]/or retest date, date and amount 
dispensed, including signature [CONTACT_39844], including the signature [CONTACT_45359] -supplied drug. The log should include all required informat ion as a 
separate entry  for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied drug is dispensed.
Prior to si te closure or at app ropri ate intervals, a representative from the sponsor or its designee 
will perform sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y and reconciliat ion before sponsor -supplied 
drugs are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction. The invest igator or design ee will 
retain a copy  of the docum entati on regarding sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y, return, and/or 
destruction, and originals will be sent to the sponsor or designee.
The invest igator will be notified of any expi[INVESTIGATOR_4057] n of sponsor -supplied 
drug during the study conduct. On expi[INVESTIGATOR_45279], the site

(10) lymph nodes; and (11) other. 
TAK -[ADDRESS_48040] be assessed as not 
clinicall y significant (NCS) or clinically significant (CS) by  [CONTACT_45321].
Any clinically  significant change, as determined by  [CONTACT_17062], from  the baseline physical 
examinat ion will be recorded as an AE or pretreatment event in source documentation and on the 
Pretreatment Event/AE eCRF.
9.1.[ADDRESS_48041] for collecting height is cent imeters without decimal places and for weight it is kilograms 
(kg) wi th [ADDRESS_48042]. BMI should be derived as:
Metri c: BMI = wei ght (kg)/height (m)2
Note that although height is re ported in centimeters, the formula uses meters for height; meters can 
be determined from cent imeters by [CONTACT_45322] 100. Thus, for example, if height=176 cm 
(1.76 meters) and weight=79.2 kg, then BMI=79.2/1.762=25.[ZIP_CODE] kg/m2 
The values should be reported to [ADDRESS_48043] by [CONTACT_45323]. Thus, in the above example BMI 
woul d be reported as 25.6 kg/m2.

not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_48078] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168]. 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and sympt oms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be r ecorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is requi red or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A

or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in r enal failure), the di agnosis only  should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be re corded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the wors ening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_45285], serious o r 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsenin g of the condi tion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of P TEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum sev erity recorded.
TAK -[ADDRESS_48079] anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an eme rgency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:

10.1.5 Severity of PTEs and AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The e vent is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.6 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for whi ch possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reas onable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causal ity) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship sho uld be assessed 
as Not Related.

10.1.11 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdra wn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable – astudy  medicati on was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion was already 
stopped before the onset of the AE.
10.1.12 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved –Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the di agnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range o r to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ s ymptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause o f death.

permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), a nd 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s

3. Centrifuge the vacutainers for 10 minutes at approximately 1100 to 1300 (RCF) at 4°C. Note: 
if using a collection dev ice other than Becton-Dickinson, refer to manufacturer’s instruction 
for proper centrifugation force and time.
4. Immediately following centrifugation, gently rem ove plasma from the packed cells. To ensure 
a more homogeneous sample, all plasma should first be transferred into 1 aliquot. From there, 
split the plasma evenly between the 2 aliquots. A minimum of 1.2 mL needs to be obtained for 
each sample. Labeling should include protocol number (TAK-020-1001), sample matrix (ie, 
plasma) randomization sequence number, Part (ie.  1 or 2), profile day and nominal time, and 
either “SET 1” (for original sample) or “SET 2” (for duplicate sample).
5. Cap the labeled storage tubes and freeze the plasma samples immediately at 
approximately -20°C or lower until shipment to , Whitesboro, 
NY, [LOCATION_003]. No more than [ADDRESS_48122] urine into polypropylene containers. During the collection interval, the urine will be 
stored at approximately 4°C. The urine collection will require the use of 2% Tween [ADDRESS_48123] 
the volume. For the urine sample in the graduated cylinder, measure “X” amount of 2% Tween 
80 solution (2% Tween 80 by [CONTACT_45353]) into  a separate graduated cylinder (where “X” 
equals 1 part in 10 of the urine volume in the cylinder).
3. Pour 3/4 of the “X” amount of Tween [ADDRESS_48124]’s urine collection. Mix and transfer to the collection jug for the time period.
4. With the remaining Tween [ADDRESS_48125] the total volume of 
urine sample collected.
6. Mix well and measure the urine volume within 2 hours of the end of the collection period.
7. Transfer approximately10 mL aliquots of urine in duplicate into appropriate polypropylene 
containers. Containers should be filled to between 60% and 90% of nominal volume. Labeling 
should include protocol number (TAK-020-1001), Part (ie, 1 or 2), sample matrix (ie, urine), [COMPANY_003]

Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45293]’s standard operating 
procedures for labeling, packaging, or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_33198].
1. Biological samples (ie, plasma or urine) should be shipped on dry ice to prevent thawing 
during transit. Samples should be shipped only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and at 
least [ADDRESS_48126]’s 
samples as follows:
3. Separate the duplicate SET [ADDRESS_48127] into self-sealing bag (eg, Ziploc) containing additional 
absorbent material.
5. Using a permanent marker, write the 4-digit randomization sequence number, sample matrix 
(ie, plasma or urine), number of samples, and “SET 1” on each self-sealing bag.
6. Place the bags of individual subject’s samples into a larger plastic bag so that samples are 
double bagged. Dup licate SET 2 samples should be returned to the freezer for storage. Repeat 
steps 3 through 6 above when preparing duplicate samples for shipment, except self-sealing 
bags should be marked “SET 2.”
7. An inventory of individual samples should accompany each shipment and should include the 
Sponsor’s name ([COMPANY_005]), study medication (TAK-020), protocol number (TAK-020-1001), 
investigator’s name, sample type (ie, plasma or urine), subject randomization sequence 
number, Part (ie. 1 or 2), nominal collection day and time, and intended sample storage 
conditions. When duplicate SET 2 samples are bei ng shipped, make a copy of the original 
SET 1 sample inventory and mark as “SET 2.” Place the inventory paperwork into a large 
self-sealing bag. SET [ADDRESS_48128] been receive d by [CONTACT_45354].
8. For sample packing, utilize dry ice generously (eg, 20-25 pounds per day of transit) to 
safeguard against longer than expected shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45294]. Use newspaper or other 
material to insulate the double-bagged samples from  direct contact [CONTACT_45355]. Place the 
sample bundles into a Styrofoam container (or other suitable container) and fill the excess 
space with dry ice slabs or ice pellets (preferably the latter). Make a note of the estimated 
weight of the dry ice used per shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].[COMPANY_003]

Styrofoam container. Place the lid on the Styrofoam container and seal completely with 
strappi[INVESTIGATOR_45295]. Place the Styrofoam container in a cardboard shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45296].
10. Mark the outside of shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45297](s) with a tally number (eg, 1 of 5, 2 of 5).
11. Affix an address label to each shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45297]. Complete the address label with the following 
information:

  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background of Study Disease  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the 
[LOCATION_002] with the majority of patients presenting with advanced disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_482552], the median 
survival for patients with advanced NSCLC remains a disappointing 12 months. ( 1) In patients 
who are able to tolerate treatment beyond first line, responses are even lower and median 
survival is only minimally improved with chemotherapy. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_482553], the five-year survival rate for patients with advanced NSCLC remains less 
than 5%. ( 2) Strategies using monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune-checkpoint pathways 
have recently shown activity in several solid tumors including NSCLC. ( 3-6) Pembrolizumab is a 
fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the Programmed death-1 receptor interfering 
with the binding with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Recent clinical trials with pembrolizumab 
demonstrated clinical activity in NSCLC. (4) 
1.1.1 Name [CONTACT_482600] a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD- 1 
receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1. 
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is being advanced for clinical 
development as an intravenous immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. See investigator 
brochure for further details. ( 7) 
1.1.[ADDRESS_619819] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in 
many solid tumors.( 3, 8, 9) 
The PD-[ADDRESS_619820] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2). ( 10, 11) The structure of murine PD- 1 
has been resolved. PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing 
an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which 
is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 
tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immunoreceptor tyr osine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD- 1 
recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic

Protocol Amendment 7

  tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 
which are involved in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascade.( 12, 13) The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]- [ADDRESS_619821] from that of CTLA-4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natural 
Killer cells. Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double 
negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. ( 14, 15) The ligands for 
PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell 
types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.( 16, 17). Both ligands are 
type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular 
region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either 
PD-[ADDRESS_619822] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD- L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell function in peripheral tissues. (8 ) Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor. High 
expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and 
survival in various malignancies. ( 18-21 ) PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-
cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL). ( 18) This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-
L1 and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for 
the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
 
Recently approval of nivolumab (MDX-1106, BMS-936558), an IgG4 antibody against PD-1, 
based on data in NSCLC has validated the role of PD-1 as an attractive target for clinical 
therapeutic intervention in NSCLC subjects. ( 22) The approval was based on phase III open-
label CheckMate-017 study involved 272 previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic 
squamous cell NSCLC. Participants were randomized to the fully human IgG4 monoclonal 
antibody nivolumab at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (n = 135) or docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 
(n = 137) intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with nivolumab improved OS by 41% versus 
docetaxel (9.2 vs 6.0 months; HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.79; P = .[ZIP_CODE]). This approval was 
further supported by [CONTACT_482574] -063 study presented at the 2014 Chicago 
Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology. The study included 117 heavily pretreated 
patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC. All patients had failed two or more systemic 
treatments and 65% of participants (n = 76) had previously failed three or more treatments. 
Seventy-six percent of patients were within [ADDRESS_619823] recent therapy. 
Nivolumab was administered at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression 
or treatment discontinuation. At 11 months follow-up ORR, as assessed by [CONTACT_472190], 
was 14.5% (95% CI, 8.7-22.2), with a median duration of response that was not yet reached. The 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  15             
  estimated 1-year survival rate was 41% (95% CI, 31.6-49.7) and the median OS was 8.2 months 
(95% CI, 6.05-0.91). An additional 26% of patients had stable disease for a median duration of 6 
months (95% CI, 4.73-10.91), producing a disease control rate (ORR plus stable disease) of 
41%.  Responses were observed independent of PD-L1 status for patients with quantifiable PD-
L1 expression. Adverse events (AEs) of all types and grades occurred in 74% of patients; 
however, 85% of patients were able to receive at least 90% of their planned dose intensity. Grade 
3/4 drug- related AEs were reported in 17% of patients. The most common (≥2%) grade 3/4 AEs 
were fatigue (4.3%), pneumonitis (3.4%), and diarrhea (2.6%). Discontinuations due to drug-
related AEs of any grade occurred in 12% of patients. Two drug-related deaths (pneumonia, 
ischemic stroke) occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities and progressive disease. ( 23) 
 
Recently phase [ADDRESS_619824] one dose of pembrolizumab 
(at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per 
kilogram every 2 weeks). The objective response rate was 19.4%, and the median duration of 
response was 12.[ADDRESS_619825] 50% of tumor cells response rate was 45.2%, median progression-free 
survival of 6.3 months and overall survival was not reached. PD-L1 expression was assessed in 
tumor samples using immunohistochemical analysis, with results reported as the percentage of 
neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Common side effects 
attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no clear 
difference according to dose or schedule. ( 24) Pembrolizumab is approved for use in patients 
with advanced chemotherapy refractory NSCLC expressing PD-L1. However, the role of PD-L1 
expression in determining treatment with PD-1 inhibitors is unclear at this time. Nivolumab,  
another agent in the same class,  is currently FDA approved for all patients with advanced 
chemotherapy refractory NSCLC irrespective of the PD-L1 status. No significant differences 
were seen between docetaxel and Nivolumab in patients who were PD-L1 negative. ( 25) 
 
1.1.3 Preclinical Data 
Due to the lack of cross-reactivity of pembrolizumab with PD-1 from rodents (or other 
nonprimate species), a commercially available, hamster anti-mouse PD-1 analog antibody (clone 
J43) was used for in vivo efficacy studies in mice. Anti-mouse PD-1 (J43) was tested as a 
monotherapy in several syngeneic murine tumor models. The tumor growth curves in Figure 1 
show that anti-mouse PD -1, administered at 10 mg/kg, potently inhibited the subcutaneous 
growth of MC38 colon adenocarcinoma tumors in most animals. In addition to inhibiting tumor 
growth, anti-mouse PD-1 administered at 10 mg/kg induced complete tumor regression in 50% 
of the animals resulting in long-term tumor free survival (Figure 1).

  Figure 1  - The experiment described in Figure 1 was analyzed for the effects of anti-mouse PD-1 on the long-term 
survival of treated mice in each of the groups. Mice receiving 10 mg/kg of anti-mouse PD-1 demonstrated an 
increased chance of overall survival, with 50% of the mice surviving beyond 60 days with no evidence of tumor 
relapse 
1.1.4 Clinical Trial Data 
An open-label phase 1 trial (Keynote 001) was recently publishes in New England Journal of 
Medicine, in this large phase I trial side effects, safety, and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab 
was evaluated in patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of [ADDRESS_619826] common treatment related adverse events were 
fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite. Only 9.5% of patient experienced adverse events of 
grade 3 or higher. Pneumonitis of grade 3 or greater was observed in 9 patients and caused death 
in one patient.  
At the time of the data cutoff, the median duration of follow-up was 10.9 months (range, 5.2 to 
27.5), and 115 patients (23.2%) continued to receive treatment. Efficacy data from this study 
showed an overall response rate of 19.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.0 to 23.2). The 
response rate was 18.0% (95% CI, 14.4 to 22.2) in the previously treated patients (n-394) and 
24.8% (95% CI, 16.7 to 34.3) in the previously untreated patients (n-101). The median duration 
of response was 12.5 (range, 1.0 to 23.3) months in all patients, 23.2 months (range, 1.0 to 23.3) 
in previously untreated patients and 10.4 months (range, 1.0 to 10.4) in previously treated 
patients. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 4.1) for all the 
patients, 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.0) for previously treated patients, and 6.0 months (95% 
CI, 4.1 to 8.6) for previously untreated patients. Median overall survival was 12.0 months (95%

  CI, 9.3 to 14.7) for all patients, 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 12.4) for previously treated patients, 
and 16.2 months (95% CI, 16.2 to not reached) for previously untreated patients 
Subjects were required to submit a newly obtained tumor biopsy prior to initiating therapy with 
pembrolizumab to evaluate the tumors for expression of PD -L1, the presumptive predictive 
biomarker of pembrolizumab, using a preliminary immunohistochemistry assay. PD-L1 
positivity was defined as membranous staining in at least 1% of cells (neoplastic and intercalated 
mononuclear inflammatory cells) within tumor nests or a distinctive staining pattern caused by 
[CONTACT_482575] a banding pattern 
adjacent to tumor nests. A modified H-score scoring system of PD-L1 expression was 
established for NSCLC by [CONTACT_165886]. Results 
were reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells showing membranous staining of PD-L1 
(proportion score). 
For the training group, 136 patients were finally included and their associated clinical outcome 
data were used to assess an optimal cut point for PD-L1 positivity. An optimal PD-L1 cut point 
was identified by [CONTACT_482576]. Cut points were identified based upon a 
proportions score (PS) method of IHC analysis with the tumors expressing at or greater than the 
highest cut point (PS >50%) referred to as PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, and tumors 
expressing >1% but less than 50% referred to as the PD -L1 weak tumors. Outcomes based on 
irRC were used as the primary outcome for the analysis. 220 patients were included in validation 
group and the response rate was 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5 to 57.3) in the [ADDRESS_619827] 50%. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50%, 
median progression-free survival was 6.3 months; median overall survival was not reached. 
Clinical d ata regarding combination of radiation with immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor 
is limited to assess abscopal effect. Several case reports have described the role of abscopal 
effects,  and several ongoing trials are further assessing it in various malignancies. (26-30 ) 
Several other ongoing clinical trials are assessing the activity of pembrolizumab in NSCLC with 
a combination of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Currently ongoing trials of pembrolizumab 
in NSCLC includes; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]- Study of MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) Versus Platinum-
based Chemotherapy for Participants With PD- L1-positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-small 
Cell Lung Cancer; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]- In Part B participants with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) will receive pembrolizumab in combination with either cisplatin/pemetrexed or

combination therapy; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]- study will evaluate the safety of adding an investigational 
drug, pembrolizumab to standard treatment with gemcitabine; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], assessing effect of

  1.2 Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT) 
1.2.1 Rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population 
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the [LOCATION_002], with the majority of 
patients presenting with advanced disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_482554] 
a disappointing 12 months. ( 1) However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_482555], the majority of patients 
will experience systemic recurrence and eventually die from their lung cancer. Tumors with high 
mutational burden present a wider array of tumor-specific antigens and prompt T-cell recognition 
and invasion. ( 31) Tumor evasion of immune surveillance is required for cancer progression. 
(32) The tumor milieu contains several suppressive mechanisms including the infiltration by 
[CONTACT_482577] (e.g. Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells),  production of 
soluble factors/cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and TGF- β), and activation of co-inhibitory pathways 
(e.g. PD-1/PDL-1, B7-H4, IDO-1, CTLA-4 etc). Recent evidence highlights the pi[INVESTIGATOR_482556]. ( 33) Strategies using monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune-
checkpoint pathways have recently shown activity in several solid tumors including NSCLC. ( 3-
6) Pembrolizumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the Programmed death-
1 receptor interfering with the binding with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Recent clinical trials 
with pembrolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in NSCLC. (4)  
There is substantial evidence that radiotherapy ( RT) is capable of converting the irradiated tumor 
into an immunogenic hub. The processes of antigen presentation and development of cellular 
immunity are complex, and subject to modulation due to the tumor microenvironment. Antigen 
presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment acquire the antigens from the tumor cells. The 
APCs mature with expression of MHC class I and II on cell surface for interaction with antigen 
specific T-cells. The antitumor effect of radiation is through DNA damage and insufficient repair 
resulting in apoptosis mediated by [CONTACT_482578]2, p53-dependent, and TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) dependent mechanisms. In addition to tumor cell 
apoptosis in the irradiated tumor, several mechanisms resulting in increased tumor specific 
immune responses have been described. Radiation depletes the suppressor T- cells in the tumor 
microenvironment ( 34) and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhance the infiltration of 
effector (CD8+) T-cells. ( 35-37 ) Preclinical models demonstrate that radiation promotes the 
immunological recognition of the tumor and higher expression of different cancer testis family 
antigens and a higher expression of MHC-I in a dose-dependent scale. ( 38) In addition, 
preclinical data using B16 melanoma cells expressing the prototypic tumor stem cell marker 
CD133 revealed that hypofractional RT with anti-PD1 induced robust tumor T-cell infiltration 
and prolonged survival compared to RT or anti-PD1 alone.( 39) The idea of enhanced systemic 
anti-tumor immune response following radiation is further supported by [CONTACT_482579]-radiated tumor lesions, known as the abscopal effect. ( 27-
30) The abscopal effect has also been observed in patient receiving anti-CTLA4 antibody, in 
both NSCLC and melanoma. ( 26, 30) In an ongoing single arm trial with radiation and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482557] (ORR) of non-ablative RT 
followed by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_482558] 18% in the intent to treat population and 33% in patients receiving 
4 cycles of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. ( 40) In addition to these responses a shift in T-cell receptor clonality 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7

  differentiated responders from non-responders to therapy in this trial. Beyond the above few case 
reports and small single arm combination trial with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], this interaction has not been 
well studied in a prospective study and the details of the mechanism are unclear. 
In this proposal,  we plan to investigate this phenomen on of ‘in -vivo immunization’ with focal 
RT to one of the target tumor lesions and the potential for augmenting the anti-tumor immune 
response with pembrolizumab. The dose of radiation will be non-ablative and focal to one or 
more of the tumor lesions,  and hence would expect minimal anticipated toxicity from the 
radiation. The preliminary clinical data from the pembrolizumab clinical trials are promising,  and 
strategies such as this to augment tumor specific antigen presentation may augment the responses 
and clinical benefit from pembrolizumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS]        Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
a) Dose of Pembrolizumab:   
 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects 
with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-limiting 
toxicities were observed. This first in-human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target 
engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No MTD has been identified to date. The highest dose tested in PN001 
(10.0 mg/kg Q2W) will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this 
protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the 
pembrolizumab program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab and a less frequent 
schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity. 
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB). Pharmacodynamic 
data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days). This 
early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W 
dosing schedule.  
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from [ADDRESS_619828] a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication. The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 
2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established 
exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab in the melanoma indication. The exposure 
margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. 
the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The 
population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  20             
  exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings. 
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on (1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, (2) the flat exposure-response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, (3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]),  and (4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that (1) are optimally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, (2) will maintain individual patient exposures in 
the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response,  and 
(3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that 
are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and 
to reduce potential for dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage. 
b) Dose of Radiation and Choice of Modality:  
Most patients with metastatic NSCLC requiring palliative radiation receive 8 Gy SFRT or 20 Gy 
in 5 fractions. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that a single fraction of 
radiotherapy (8 Gy) is equivalent in palliation,  and local control in comparison to a longer course 
of radiotherapy in patients with bone metastases. ( 41, 42) Similarly even in patients with lung or 
other visceral metastases no significant difference in symptom palliation and overall survival 
were noted with single fraction versus multiple fractions of radiation. ( 43) Moreover, SFRT is 
cost effective and prevents delays to initiation of systemic therapy. Animal studies suggest that 
low dose (2 –4 Gy) SFRT can promote tumor immunity via major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) up-regulation, antigen presentation, and vascular normalization. ( 44) At higher doses, 
SFRT likely retains these immunogenic effects, but also recruits T cells into the tumor and leads 
to greater direct tumor cell death due to apoptosis or necrosis. ( 45) Using a B16 mouse 
melanoma model, Lee et al. showed that SFRT (20 Gy) is more effective than fractionated 
radiation therapy (FRT; 45 Gy in 3 fractions) in controlling tumors though the total dose of 
radiation was far less. ( 45) In their model, the efficacy of SFRT was dependent on CD8 T-cells. 
Thus,  we suspect that [ADDRESS_619829]. 
Patients with more than a single symptomatic lesion will be treated to some or all of their lesions, 
depending on disease burden, necessity for palliation of particular lesions, proximity to other 
major organs or neurovascular regions, and other patient considerations. There are no anatomi c 
locations that will be deemed inappropriate for RT other than the brain.  
  
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7

  Radiation will be delivered using electrons for subcutaneous lesions or rib lesions, and photons 
using 3D conformal planning and IMRT (intensity modulated radiation treatment) for deeper 
tumors in the neck, mediastinum, and retroperitoneal regions. None of the patients will be treated 
with stereotactic radiotherapy techniques. Standard doses of prophylactic antiemetic pre-
medications including ondansetron and dexamethasone will be administered if thought to be 
clinically indicated before treatment of abdominal and retroperitoneal masses 
[IP_ADDRESS]        Rationale for Biomarker Research 
The relationship between PD-L1 and responses to PD1 inhibitors is not entirely clear at this time. 
(46, 47) In patients with NSCLC even though there appears to be an association between PD-L1 
expression and response in some trials there has been no association in some trials. ( 23, 25, 46-
50) The discrepancy in the predictive value of the PD-L1 assay are likely related to differences in 
the definition of positivity, variability of assays across clinical trials and the temporal and spatial 
heterogeneity of PD-L1. ( 51, 52) The expression of PD-L1 has also been correlated with the 
extent of tumor lymphocytic infiltrate. ( 51, 52) The latter has been observed to be increased after 
radiation therapy, suggesting one possible mechanism for an improved systemic response after 
SFRT. ( 39) We propose here to treat NSCLC patients without regard to PD-L1 expression on 
biopsies done just prior to initiation of pembrolizumab. When feasible, tissue specimens will be 
obtained before SFRT and pembrolizumab treatment, and again after SFRT, and local and 
systemic response will be correlated to expression. The majority of PD-L1 positive tumors were 
associated with CD4 and CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), while the minority of the 
PD-L1 negative tumors had associated TILs. Moreover, the staining pattern of PD-L1 on 
melanocytes differed based on proximity to TILs. Interferon- γ, a primary inducer of B7 -H1 
expression, can be detected at the interface of PDL1 positive melanocytes and TILs, possibly 
reflecting activation of PD-[ADDRESS_619830] that might be 
associated with anti-tumor response, and will be studied on pre-treatment specimens from 
patients enrolled in this trial. Expression of other members of the B7 super-family of ligands, 
including PD- L2 and B7-H4 on tumor cells, might be associated with activation of PD-1 on 
tumor cells.( 53, 54) Galectin-9 (the liga nd to TIM3), has been proposed as a mediator of PD- 1 
related T-cell exhaustion. ( 55) A more sophisticated and accurate predictive biomarker model 
might be built by [CONTACT_482580] T cells, in addition to quantification of T cell tumor 
infiltrate. Specifically, co-expression of TIM-3 and PD-1 might be associated with sensitivity to 
PD-1 blockade.( 55) LAG-3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) synergizes with PD-1 to inhibit T 
cell activation.( 56, 57) Co-expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells is thought to be co-
inhibitory, and co-inhibition of these molecules is the basis of ongoing clinical trials. While the 
T-cell stimulatory role of PD-1H (PD -1 Homologue) on T cells was recently described, its 
association with anti-tumor response in the setting of PD-1 blockade has yet to be determined. 
We propose to evaluate several biomarkers studies in collaboration with the Yale Translational 
Immunology Lab, to characterize the nature of the tumor immune cell populations and several 
immune evasive pathways including PD-L1 and PD-1. We will use novel quantitative 
immunofluorescence based assays developed by [CONTACT_482581]. ( 51, 58-62)  
 
Peripheral circulating immune cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_482559]. In addition, MHC 
Dextramer® reagents will be used for detection of antigen-specific T cells pre and post 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  22             
  treatment. We will monitor changes of the circulating immune cell population’s pre and post 
treatment and at the time of progression. Novel immune SEQ platforms will be used to 
interrogate T and B-cell receptor repertoire over time pre-post treatment and at progression. This 
will identify and define highly expanded clones and diversity of lymphocyte populations.  
Correlations between genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of subjects tumors, and 
efficacy outcomes will be assessed to identify gene mutations, gene amplifications, RNA-
expression levels, and protein-expression levels. Genomic sequencing of tumor cells from tissue 
relative to non-tumor cells from whole blood will be profiled to identify the genomic variances 
that may contribute to response or disease progression and provide an understanding of 
molecular abnormalities. RNA sequencing will be conducted to provide expression data and give 
relevance to DNA mutations; Quantitative proteomics analysis will be conducted to determine 
the exact amounts of specific proteins and to confirm expression of genes that are correlative of 
response and disease progression. 
 
A recent study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) with a mass spectroscopy based serum proteomic assay BDX008 
took pre-nivolumab treated melanoma samples from 119 patients. The same assay was 
independently validated with pre-treatment serum of 30 patients from a non-protocol study using 
PD-1 blockade regimens. The evaluation showed that patients in the non-protocol study 
classified as having a high likelihood of good outcome had a 74 percent lower risk of death 
compared to those with a profile associated with low likelihood of good outcome (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0.26, p=0.002). Of the 119 patients in the nivolumab trial, those with a profile predicting 
high likelihood of good outcome had a 50 percent lower risk of disease progression (HR 0.50, 
p=0.001) and a 62 percent lower risk of death (HR 0.38, p=0.001) compared to those with a 
profile predicting low likelihood of good outcome. ( 63) We will evaluate the predictive value of 
this assay in our trial on all the pre-treatment samples. These studies will be done in 
collaboration with Biodesix Inc.  
An additional potential biomarker of tumor response is cell-free tumor-derived circulating DNA 
(ctDNA). We will collaborate with BioCept Inc. to develop an ultrasensitive assay for measuring 
small amounts of cell-free mutant DNA released into the blood from dying tumor cells. The 
assay covers a broad panel of mutations and uses novel error suppression techniques applied to 
next-generation sequencing data to enable identification of rare mutant DNA down to a 
fractional abundance of ~0.02%. Because such ctDNA is highly tumor-specific and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_482560], this assay exhibits excellent promise as a quantitative cancer 
biomarker. Rapid decreases in ctDNA levels have been observed following treatment with 
surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy (sometimes with an initial spi[INVESTIGATOR_482561]).  Thus, we hypothesize that quantitative changes in ctDNA may provide information that is 
complementary to radiologic studies for tracking the efficacy of treatment with the PD- [ADDRESS_619831] 
response based on pre-treatment imaging, and also help monitoring patients treated with 
immunotherapy and potentially help identify early responders and pseudo-progression.

  [IP_ADDRESS]        Statistics and Sample Size 
The primary goal of the trial is to assess the RECIST-defined tumor response rate outside the 
radiation field in previously treated NSCLC patients given radiation to an index lesion followed 
by [CONTACT_79911]. Secondary goals include assessment of toxicity, other efficacy measures such 
as progression-free survival, response duration, overall survival, and local control of disease 
within the radiation field, immune response, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression.  
 
In previous studies (KEYNOTE 001 and 010) the ORR to pembrolizumab monotherapy has been 
approximately 20% in this population. Based on this,  an underlying ORR of >35%  would be 
considered positive in the current trial whereas a <20% ORR would be considered negative. A 
two-stage accrual design that allows for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482562]. The maximum accrual goal is 48 eligible and evaluable patients. Initially 
29 eligible and evaluable patients will be entered into the trial. If <6 patients respond (observed 
ORR <21% ) the trial will be stopped for (relative) lack of efficacy. If more than 6 patients 
respond an additional 19 eligible and evaluable patients will be entered. Pembrolizumab plus 
radiation will be considered effective if overall 12 or more patients respond (ORR >25% ). With 
this design the likelihood of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482563] >64%  if the underlying 
ORR is <20% and <7% if it is  >35% . The overall type I and II errors are 20% and  10%, 
respectively . 
 
Safety is an important secondary endpoint. Toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 4.0  
criteria, categorized by [CONTACT_34565], and summarized as frequency counts and percentages. 
Assuming the trial accrues all 48 patients, the risk of a particular type and/or grade of toxicity 
will be estimable using an exact 90% confidence interval that has a maximum half-width of 
13% . The likelihood of observing at least one such event is 86% even if the associated risk is 
only 5%. 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints such as progression-free survival, response duration, and overall 
survival will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Local control will be summarized 
as a frequency count and percentage. Other endpoints, such as PD-L1 expression, will be 
summarized as medians and ranges (e.g. proportion of cells expressing PD-L1) or frequency 
counts and percentages (e.g. number and percent of patient with PD-L1 expression in >50% of 
cells) as appropriate. 
 
Methods such as Fisher’s exact test, chi -square tests, logistic regression (categorical data), the 
logrank test and proportional hazards models (time to event data) will be used to compare patient 
groups. These analyses are primarily exploratory and it is acknowledged that they will have 
relatively low statistical power. 
 
All genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic molecular analyses will be exploratory. These 
studies would be analyzed using a prospective-retrospective statistical analysis plan (SAP).

3.1 Study Design 
 
This is a phase II trial of pembrolizumab sequentially following focal radiation to one or more of 
the target lesions, in patients with stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary 
goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of focal radiation (RT) to index lesion(s) as a way of 
enhancing the anti-tumor immune response to pembrolizumab. The primary efficacy endpoint is 
overall RECIST-defined response outside the radiation field. To accomplish this goal [ADDRESS_619833] scans every 9 weeks +/ - [ADDRESS_619834] experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new antineoplastic therapy. 
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for reasons other than disease progression should also 
receive tumor imaging every 9 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_619835] 1.1 criteria.  Local reading 
(investigator assessment with site radiology reading) will be used to determine eligibility and for 
subject management. De-identified imaging will also be obtained from all participating sites for

3.1.2 Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Correlatives in Biopsy Tissue  
All the tissue based immunological correlatives PD-L1 expression and other exploratory 
correlatives will be performed by [CONTACT_482584]-
oncology Laboratory lab at the Yale University. Both these laboratories are specialized in 
measurement of im
mune biomarkers and have access to CLIA-compliant facilities. 
 
i. Measurement of Tumor infiltrating immune cells on pre-treatment and post treatment 
biopsies : The automated quantitative spectral multiplexing platform for evaluation of 
immune biomarkers is highly novel. We have previously developed and validated ways 
to reproducibly measure and quantify TILs and immune biomarkers by [CONTACT_423467]. ( 51, 59, 61) 
To understand the tumor immune landscape, we will characterize the immune infiltrates 
in the samples using a previously described and validated assay to objectively interrogate 
different lymphocyte subsets. ( 59) This assay comprises the simultaneous staining and 
measurement of tumor cells (cytokeratin), T cells (CD3), cytotoxic T cells (CD8) and B 
lymphocytes (CD20).  The signal intensity and amount of cells will be measured using 
informatic tools as described for PD-L1. These will be done in collaboration with Tumor 
immunology lab at Yale to develop and validate several immune biomarker panels for 
potential use in the clinical setting. This collaboration will expand on our previous work. 
 
ii. Measurement of several immune biomarkers in the tumor and stromal compartments on 
pre-treatment and post treatment biopsies : PD-L1 expression will be determined for all 
patients on pre-treatment samples per standard of care using the DAKO PD-L1 assay in 
the Yale CLIA lab. Positivity will be determined by [CONTACT_423468] (non-nuclear) 
PD-L1 signal present in intact tumor and/or stromal cells within the tumor region of the 
tissue examined, as evaluated by a pathologist in preparations stained with chromogenic 
immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and counterstained with hematoxylin. Operationally, a 
positivity threshold of signal present in >1% of cells will be used. An additional 3-tiered 
semi-quantitative categorical result will be rendered by [CONTACT_423469] 1+ (<30%), 2+ (30-<60%) and 3+ 
(60-100%). PD -L1 negative cases will be those with absence of any detectable signal in 
the sample tested and with appropriate tissue and staining controls.  
 
In addition to chromogenic PD-L1 IHC using a novel platform,  we can increase specific 
staining of multiple tissue biomarkers (PD-L2, B7H4, TIM-3, VISTA, LAG-3, IDO- 1 
etc.), and are able to reach 6-plex and beyond in a single image retaining the morphologic 
context of the tumor. The incorporation of such novel approaches could positively impact 
the value of tissue biomarker determination for anti-cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Finally, 
additional correlative studies using novel approaches with higher sensitivity and 
throughput,  such as the Luminex assay69 and CyTOF massspect based cytometry70, will 
be pursued once these platforms are appropriately standardized. 
 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  28             
  iii. Omics Testing : We will evaluate the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profile of 
subjects’ tumors to identify gene mutations, gene amplifications, RNA -expression, and 
protein-expression using the Nantomics “Omics platform”. The e xploratory genomics, 
transcriptomic, and proteomics molecular profiling will be performed on formalin-fixed, 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and whole blood samples (subject matched 
normal comparator against the tumor tissue) by [CONTACT_11398]-generation sequencing and mass 
spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. Collection of tumor tissue and whole blood 
is mandatory for this study, unless an exception is approved by [CONTACT_16170]. 
See lab manual for tissue collection requirements.  
 
iv. Next Generation Sequencing for T -cell receptor clo nality : TCR sequencing and clonality 
quantification on pre -and post -treatment samples will be performed using ImmunoSeq 
assay in a multiplexed PCR method using forward primers specific to TCR Vβ gene 
segments and reverse primers specific to TCR Jβ gene seg ments. In addition, using 
Immune Repertoire Capture™ (IRC™) technology we will evaluate immune response , 
enabling the identification and generation of functional human antibodies and TCRs. This 
delivers an unparalleled quantitation of the adaptive immune r esponse. This will be done 
in collaboration with Atreca Inc.  
 
v. Pharmacodynamic analyses : The intended molecular pharmacodynamic effect of oral 
THU -decitabine is depletion of DNMT1 in tumor tissue. This will be measured by [CONTACT_423467]. 
DNMT1 -depletion is expected to  induce p53 -independent cell cycle exits, with 
downregulation of MYC and upregulation of p27/CDKN1B. This will be measured by 
[CONTACT_482585]. Finally, the intracellular accumulation of decitabine to deplete DNMT1 
depends on relative expression in the cancer cell s of pyrimidine metabolism enzymes 
DCK, CDA and UCK2, and also the growth fraction of the malignancy, measured by 
[CONTACT_482586]67. These parameters will also be measured by [CONTACT_423467].  
[IP_ADDRESS]      Correlatives in Blood 
i. Phenotypic character of PBMC : To be performed by [CONTACT_423472]. Multiplex T cell 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_423421].  We will design a broad T-cell flow cytometry panel 
composed of multiple exhaustion markers, checkpoint receptors and activation markers. 
Non-biased automated algorithms will be used to determine T -cell signatures predictive 
of response and resistance to immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The putative markers in the panel may 
include CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD45RA, CCR7, CD95, CD27, CD25, CD57, CD107, 
CD69 CD11A, TIM3, HLA-DR, PD-1, LAG3, OX40, ICOS, CCR4, CXCR3, CCR6, BIM, 
EOMES, CTLA-4. In addition to T-cells, we will evaluate other immune cell subsets 
including dendritic cells (DCs), monocyte populations, and NK cells. A whole blood 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_482564] 
(CD56+CD3-), NKT cells (CD56+CD3+), B cells (CD19+), and monocytes (CD16+). In 
addition, both myeloid (CD45+HLADR+ CD11c+CD123-) and plasmacytoid 
(CD45+HLA-DR+CD11c-CD123+) DC frequencies will be measured in this precision-
validated multiparameter flow cytometric assay. In addition, PBMCs will be 
cryopreserved for future potential studies using platforms such as Mass cytometry 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7

  (CyTOF), IRC™ and CIBERSORT, and will be correlated to the immunologic response, 
clinical response, and survival data.  
 
ii. Serum proteomic and ctDNA correlatives:  Exploratory proteomic analysis using MALDI 
ToF mass-spectrometry and ProTS will be performed in collaboration with Biodesix and 
the Pandey lab at Johns Hopkins on baseline and on treatment plasma samples at time 
points defined in the protocol from patients in the study.  
 
PBMCs, Serum and plasma will be banked for other potential correlatives

confirmed CR should be performed within [ADDRESS_619836] be reviewed by [CONTACT_131887].  
3.2 Number of Subjects 
The maximum accrual goal is 48 eligible and evaluable patients. Initially 29 eligible and 
evaluable patients will be entered into the trial. If <6 patients respond (observed ORR <21%) the 
trial will be stopped for (relative) lack of efficacy. If more than [ADDRESS_619837] Participation 
Subjects will complete 8 cycles (28 weeks) of on study treatment. Before they begin study 
treatment they will receive SFRT to one or more target lesions. If participants experience 
complete response while on study treatment they will stop treatment with pembrolizumab. If they 
experience recurrence after this time they have the option of re-starting treatment on trial as long 
as all eligibility requirements are still met.

Patients will undergo CT simulation and treatment planning per standard practice. Patient 
immobilization should be sufficient to ensure minimal intra- and inter-fraction set-up error, and 
is otherwise left to the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. The treating physician will 
define a planning target volume (PTV) to which the dose will be described, and which will be 
used to define local control or local failure. 3D conformal beam arrangement is encouraged, 
though advanced techniques are allowed at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. At 
least 90% of the PTV should receive 90% or more the prescription dose. All organs at risk within

worsening AEs as specified in the Study Schema, and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow-up 
period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4 .0 (see Section 7 ). Toxicities will be characterized in 
terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial 
treatment.  
For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated 
with pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of 
clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune-related adverse 
events, or irAEs).  Refer to the ECI guidance document regarding the identification, evaluation 
and management of potential irAEs.

  [IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing Interruptions  
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption 
should be documented in the patient's study record. 
6.5.2 SFRT Dose Modification and Supportive Care 
SFRT with 8Gy is considered a palliative dose and we do not anticipate any significant 
unexpected adverse events from treatment. However, if any grade 3 or greater adverse event 
occurs during radiation treatment that are probably or definitely attributable to radiation, this will 
be counted as a DLT. These patients will be allowed to continue with trial therapy 
pembrolizumab if the toxicity resolves to grade 0 or 1 with supportive measures within 12 
weeks. If greater than 20% (2/10) SFRT related DLTs are seen in the first 10 patients; the study 
will be put on hold for safety review by [CONTACT_4318].  
6.6 Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines 
6.6.1 Concomitant Medications 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowe d 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with 
the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acceptable Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the investig ator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983]. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, 
and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_619878] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and 
ECIs as defined in Section 7. 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  44             
  [IP_ADDRESS]  Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial: 
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
 Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_619879] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid vaccine.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids, or short courses of corticosteroid treatment unrelated to study 
treatment, may be approved after consultation with the Sponso r. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial. Subjects may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. 
The Exclusion Criteria (Section 4.3 ) describes other medications which are prohibited in this 
trial. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
6.6.2 Supportive Care Guidelines 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events 
with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines 
include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note 
that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the 
steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes 
such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional 
supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator 
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 6. 5.1.2  for dose 
modification.  
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  45             
  It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
 Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no 
less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3-4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer 
additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed. 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration . 
 Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2  or higher 
diarrhea , consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis,  treat with intravenous steroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78018].  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA) 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3-4  Hyperglycemia 
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus 
and for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or

o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4  hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy. 
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3-4  hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly). 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and

6.7.1 Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such 
as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
6.7.2 Sexual Activity 
[IP_ADDRESS]    Contraception 
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  
For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have 
azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).  
Female subj
ects will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either:  
1. Postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR  
2. Have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR  
3. Has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_619881] 
dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:  
Practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity  
OR  
Use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.  
Accept
able methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  49             
   Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
 Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
 Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide) 
 Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)  
 Contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
 Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
 Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]-only 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive 
injection 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if 
it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered 
acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it does 
not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this 
country/region. 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the stud y. In order to participate in the 
study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described 
above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study 
medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_619882] should not be entered into the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]    Use in Pregnancy 
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the subject 
will immediately be removed from the study. The site will contact [CONTACT_240337] ’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 
24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious advers e 
experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening 
complication to the mother or newborn).

[IP_ADDRESS]    Use in Nursing Women 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, 
subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.

Interruptions from the protocol specified treatment plan for > [ADDRESS_619884] label  
6.9 Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. When a subject 
discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities scheduled for the final 
trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any adverse events which are 
present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the 
safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 - Assessing and Recording Adverse Events. Subjects 
who a) attain a CR or b) complete 24 weeks of treatment with pembrolizumab may discontinue 
treatment with the option of restarting treatment if they meet the criteria specified in Section 
6.9.1. After discontinuing treatment following assessment of CR, these subjects should return to 
the site for a Safety Follow-up Visit (described in Section 6.3.1 ) and then proceed to the Follow-
Up Period of the study (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
 The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
Note: A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved.

prevents further administration of treatment 
 Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
 Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements 
 The subject is lost to follow-up 
 Administrative reasons 
The End of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedures are listed in Section 6.2.2  (Treatment 
Regimen Overview). After the end of study treatment, each subject will be followed for [ADDRESS_619885]-treatment follow-up  visits for disease status every 9 weeks +/- 
[ADDRESS_619886] of care will be followed for disease status every 9 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_619887].  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version [ADDRESS_619888] each change of grade 
recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness. 
7.[ADDRESS_619889] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  52             
  and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the 
[COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of 
this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_482566] a physiologically appropriate time. 
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent 
or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_80085]. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials, or as 
prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and 
from withdrawal. Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event.  
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment must be 
reported by [CONTACT_26364], or are the 
result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
From the time of treatment through [ADDRESS_619890] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the 
Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events 
meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.5.1. The investigator will make every 
attempt to follow all subjects with non-serious adverse events for outcome. 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any  protocol-
specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., 
the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured 
according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
7.3 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and [COMPANY_006] 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembr olizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg 
or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the  
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  53             
  If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product 
Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840])

Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment must 
be reported by [CONTACT_26364], or are the 
result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment through 120 days following 
cessation of Sponsor’s product, or [ADDRESS_619892] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. All 
reported pregnancies should be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Every 
effort should be made to report pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, 
benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and 
stillbirth as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the 
outcome (health of infant) should also be reported. 
Such e
vents must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to

 Is another important medical event  
Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as 
SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by 
[CONTACT_131892]. 
 Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study) 
 
 Is associated with an overdose. 
Refer to Table 7  for additional details regarding each of the above criteria. 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment, any serious 
adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other 
than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 7.2 for additional details) that 
occurs to any subject must be reported within [ADDRESS_619893] that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any 
time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow-up period (Section 6.3 ) 
must be reported immediately to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety.  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.

7.6 Protocol-Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to [COMPANY_006] as described in 
Section 7.5 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006], unless there is 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any such event will be 
submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety within 2 working days 
either by [CONTACT_131008]. 
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study. 
 
CASE 1516 
Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /2019  56             
  The Sponsor will monitor aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the 
safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression 
of the cancer under study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety as a SAE within 2 working 
days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77989] (e.g. transportation issues etc.) will not be considered a 
SAE. 
7.7 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations. Please refer to the Manual of

Table 6 Evaluating Adverse Events  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
 
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130978]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade  [ADDRESS_619897] that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immed iate risk of death from the event as it occurred 
(Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruptio n of one’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of 
length of stay, even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary mea sure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482568] a pre -existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre -existing condition is a clinical 
condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a [COMPANY_006] product and is documented in the patient’s medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (altho ugh not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 
hours and to [COMPANY_006] within 2 working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse 
event for collection purposes. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical 
interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_619898] and  may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_619899] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
[COMPANY_006] Product  Did [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that [COMPANY_006] product  caused the adverse event will 
be provided by [CONTACT_1629] i nvestigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or 
worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was do ne.

correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006] product  caused 
the adverse event (AE):  
Relationship  
to [COMPANY_006] Product  
(continued)  Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable 
compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected ph armacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies  to trials with investigational 
medicinal product)?  
Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or 
other host or environmental factors  
The following components are to be used  to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
Dechallenge  Was [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negat ive dechallenge.  
 
Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE 
resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_55530]’s product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); 
or (4) Sponsor’s p roduct(s) is/are only used one time.  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to [COMPANY_006] product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
 
Note: This criterion is not ap plicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the 
trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are used only one time  
 
Note: if a rechallenge is planned for an adverse event which was serious and wh ich may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_482593], or if re -exposure to [COMPANY_006] product  poses additional potential significant risk to the subject, 
then the rechallenge must be approved in advance by [CONTACT_482594].  
 Consistency with 
Trial Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding [COMPANY_006] 
product or drug class pharmacology or toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician according to his/her best 
clinical judgment, including consideration of the above elements.

Protocol Amendment 7  
06/06 /[ADDRESS_619901]-defined tumor response  rate outside the 
radiation field in previously treated NSC lung cancer patients given radiation to an index lesion 
followed by [CONTACT_79911]. Secondary goals include assessment of toxicity, other efficacy 
measures such as progression-free survival, response duration, overall survival, and local control 
of disease within the radiation field, immune response, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 
expression.  
In previous studies (KEYNOTE 001 and 010) the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab 
monotherapy has been approximately 20% in this population. Based on this an underlying ORR 
in the current trial >35% would be considered positive whereas a <20% ORR would be 
considered negative. A two-stage accrual design that allows for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482569]. The maximum accrual goal is 48 eligible and 
evaluable patients. Initially 29 eligible and evaluable patients will be entered into the trial. If <6 
patients respond (observed ORR <21%) the trial will be stopped for (relative) lack of efficacy. If 
more than 6 patients respond an additional 19 eligible and evaluable patients will be entered. 
Pembrolizumab plus radiation will be considered effective if overall 12 or more patients respond 
(ORR >25%). With this design the likelihood of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482563] 
>64% if the underlying ORR is <20% and <7% if it is >35%. The overall type I and II errors are 
20% and 10%, respectively. 
Safety is an important secondary endpoint. Toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 4 .0 
criteria, categorized by [CONTACT_34565], and summarized as frequency counts and percentages. 
Assuming the trial accrues all 48 patients the risk of a particular type and/or grade of toxicity 
will be estimable using an exact 90% confidence interval that has a maximum half-width of 13%. 
The likelihood of observing at least one such event is 86% even if the associated risk is only 5%. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints such as progression-free survival, response duration, and overall 
survival will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Local control will be summarized 
as a frequency count and percentage. Other endpoints, such as PD-L1 expression, will be 
summarized as medians and ranges (e.g. proportion of cells expressing PD-L1) or frequency 
counts and percentages (e.g. number and percent of patient with PD-L1 expression in >50% of 
cells) as appropriate. 
Methods such as Fisher’s exact test, chi -square tests, logistic regression (categorical data), the 
logrank test and proportional hazards models (time to event data) will be used to compare patient 
groups. These analyses are primarily exploratory and it is acknowledged that they will have 
relatively low statistical power. 
All genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic molecular analyses will be exploratory. These 
studies would be analyzed using a prospective-retrospective statistical analysis plan (SAP).

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 2 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate 
Efficacy and Safety of BMS-986165 in Subjects with Systemic Lup us Erythematosus
Study Phase: 2
Rationale:
BMS-[ADDRESS_35351], potent, oral tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a novel, highly 
selective mechanism of action th at has the potential to safely and effectively treat a broad spectrum 
of immune-mediated diseases. Tyrosine kinase 2 activates intrace llular signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT)-dependent transcription and f unctional responses downstream 
of receptors for critical immune mediators, such as interleukin  (IL)-12, IL-23, and Type I and III
interferons (IFNs) .1,2,3These immune and inflammatory signaling pathways are critical i n the 
pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases including p soriasis, lupus, 
spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dermatomyo sitis, and Type I
interferonopathies .4,5BMS-986165 potently inhibits IL-23-, IL-12-, and Type I/III IFN -driven 
responses and has demonstrated proof of mechanism in mouse mode ls of autoimmunity (psoriasis, 
colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and in healthy  humans .5,[ADDRESS_35352] e reasons, as follows: 1) the 
major pathways in the TYK2 signaling cascade (Type I IFN and IL -12/23 and the downstream 
mediators IFNγ and IL -17) have been implicated in SLE disease pathogenesis ;72) biologic agents 
targeting the IL- 12/[ADDRESS_35353], or the IFNα (or the Type I IFN) receptor have be en shown to be 
efficacious in Phase 2 studies of SLE8; and 3) the ability to measure circulating target-specific 
(such as suppression of IFN-stimulated gene expression) and dis ease-specific pharmacodynamic 
(PD) measures in SLE both before and after treatment allows for  establishing exposure-response 
relationships for PD endpoints in this condition.
The present study is the first study of this TYK2 inhibitor conducted in subjects with SLE and is 
intended to determine whether t he pharmacological effects of TY K2 inhibition are associated with 
objective clinical improvement in SLE disease activity and rela ted biomarkers. The study is also 
designed to assess the safety and tolerability of short- and lon g-term BMS-986165 treatment in 
subjects with SLE and to determine the dose level that provides  the optimal balance of efficacy 
and safety.
Study Population:
The study will enroll male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years o ld (inclusive), with SLE defined 
as follows:

Overall Design:
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multice nter study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of BMS-986165 in subjects with SLE. The study includ es a screening period (SP) of 
up to 4 weeks (28 days); a 48-week (336-day) blinded treatment pe riod (TP); and a 28-day 
follow-up period (FP), for subjects who do not continue into the long-term extension (LTE) study 
(IM011074). The total duration will be approximately 56 weeks (3 92 days). Other details of 
study design are as follows:
xRandomization will be performed a fter completion of the SP, on Day 1 of the TP.
xRandomization in a 1:1:1:1 ratio will be performed using intera ctive response technology

BMS Confidential 292 INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic progressive immune-mediated disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_35837]/tissue involvement and clini cal manifestations that are varied 
and widespread. The most commonl y affected body systems are muc ocutaneous, musculoskeletal, 
and renal. Progression of the dis ease is marked by [CONTACT_35838], and 
uncontrolled SLE leads to end organ damage and death. SLE preva lence in the [LOCATION_002] is 
estimated at 20 to 150 cases per 100,000, and incidence is esti mated at 1 to 25 per 100,000. Women 
are more frequently affected than men (9:1), as are people of A frican American and African 
Caribbean descent, and peak incidence occurs around the third o r fourth decade of life. 
Autoantibodies that define the autoimmune nature of SLE have be en identified. However, these 
autoantibodies are not specific to SLE. This and the variable c linical manifestations of SLE 
contribute to the complexity of diagnosis and treatment.
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35781], and include immunosuppres sive drugs and corticosteroids 
(CS), which can temporarily control SLE flares and disease prog ression. However, the utility of 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35782], and their use is associated wi th substantial undesirable effects 
that may outweigh any short-term improvements. One goal in the management of SLE is to achieve 
disease and symptom control while minimizing CS exposure. Treat ments include antimalarials, 
immunosuppressants, biologics including belimumab, and other ag ents (prescribed off-label). 
There remains an unmet need for novel, well-tolerated, orally a dministered therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35783].
2.1 Study Rationale
BMS-986165 is a potent, highly selective small molecule inhibit or of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), 
which functions as a critical mediator in signaling pathways that regulate diverse, yet specific, 
immunomodulatory cellular responses, such as immunity, inflamma tion, and anti-inflammatory 
responses. BMS-[ADDRESS_35359] spectrum of 
immune-mediated diseases. Tyrosin e kinase 2 activates signal tr ansducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT)-dependent  transcription and functional responses downstream of critical 
immune mediators, such as interl eukin (IL)-12, IL-23, and Type I and III interferons (IFNs). 
BMS-986165 inhibits TYK2 through a novel allosteric mechanism, binding to the unique Janus 
kinase (JAK) homology 2 (JH2) domain, rather than binding direc tly to the active site .
1,2,3TYK2 
mediates immune and inflammatory signaling pathways critical in the pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases including psoriasis, lupus, spondyloar thritis, inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), dermatomyositis, and Type I interferonopathies .
4,5BMS-986165 potently inhibits 
IL-23-, IL-12-, and Type I/III IFN-driven responses and has dem onstrated proof of mechanism in 
mouse models of psoriasis, colitis, and lupus; and in healthy h uman volunteers .5,6
The proposed Phase 2 study in subjects with SLE will provide ev idence of biologic activity of 
BMS-986165 in a relevant diseas e population and will facilitate  dose ranging for future studies in 
SLE and other immune-mediated conditions. SLE is an ideal condi tion to evaluate the efficacy of 
the TYK2 inhibitor BMS-986165 for multiple reasons, as follows:  1) The major pathways in the

BMS Confidential 30TYK2 signaling cascade (Type I IFN and IL- 12/23 and the downstream mediators IFNγ and IL -17) 
have been implicated in SLE disease pathogenesis,72) Biologic agents targeting the IL-12/[ADDRESS_35360], or the IFNα (or the Type I IFN) receptor are under investigation and have been shown to 
be efficacious in the treatment of SLE based on some Phase [ADDRESS_35361] been released. Thus, 
it is feasible that SLE patients treated with BMS-986165 may de rive therapeutic benefit, 3) It is 
also conceivable that TYK2 inhibition may show improved benefits  over existing anti-IFN 
monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35784]-12/23 and 
Type I IFN pathways,84) The ability to measure circulating target-specific (such as suppression 
of IFN-stimulated gene expression) and disease-specific pharmac odynamic (PD) measures in SLE 
both before and after treatment allows for establishing exposur e-response relationships for PD 
endpoints.
The present study is the first study of this TYK2 inhibitor conducted in subjects with SLE and is 
intended to determine whether t he pharmacological effects of TY K2 inhibition are associated with 
objective clinical improvement in SLE disease activity and rela ted biomarkers. The study is also 
designed to assess the safety and tolerability of short- and lon g-term BMS-986165 treatment in 
subjects with SLE, and to determine the dose level that provide s the optimal balance of efficacy 
and safety.
Research statement: The proportion of subjects with SLE who meet the response crite ria for the 
SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) at Week [ADDRESS_35362] 1 of the BMS-986165
regimens than with placebo.
2.2 Background
Tyrosine kinase 2 (a member of the JAK family) catalyzes the pho sphorylation of STAT proteins 
downstream of the receptors for the p40-containing cytokines IL-[ADDRESS_35363]-in-class or ally administered small molecule 
inhibitor of TYK2 that has been shown to be superior to blockad e of the Type I IFN receptor in an 
IFN-dependent mouse model of SLE.

Early Clinical Experience
The clinical data available to date supporting the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PD of 
BMS-986165 are from 5 Phase 1 studies of BMS-986165 in healthy volunteers (IM011002, 
IM011015, IM011016, IM011031, and IM011039) and a Phase 2 study in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (IM011011).
Study IM011002 (Single and Multiple  Ascending Dose Study to Eva luate the Safety, Tolerability,

approximately half of subjects overall had at least [ADDRESS_35364] infection. Dose-limiting AEs in the form of skin rashes and 
acneiform lesions were observed. These observations were largely reported for subjects in the 
24 mg/day (12 mg BID) group and were reported for most subjects dosed at this level. These events 
had not been observed earlier in the monkey studies. These AEs were mild or moderate in nature 
and resolved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969] (corticosteroid applicatio ns, benzoyl peroxide cream,

the study experienced an AE of acn e, and all these AEs were mil d or moderate in severity. Subjects 
with no or mild acne at baseline developed either mild or moder ate acne, whereas subjects with 
moderate acne at baseline generally experienced less worsening of their acne as the study 
progressed. In 2 subjects, an AE of moderate acne led to discon tinuation of study medication. All 
events of acne that required treatment responded to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]. 
In Study IM011039 (The Effect of BMS-986165 on the Pharmacokine tics of a Combined Oral 
Contraceptive), healthy subjects received 24 mg/day (12 mg BID) . Acneiform lesions (eg, skin 
rashes or pustules) were seen in all subjects at this dose and the number of events was similar to

group study to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and PD of  BMS-986165 after 12 weeks of 
treatment with 4 weeks’ follow -up in 267 subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The stud y 
met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of clinically relevant improvement in Psoriasis 
Activity and Severity Index and static Physician Global Assessme nt scores for 4 of the 5 doses 
investigated (only the 3 mg every other day dose did not meet t he primary endpoint). The most 
common AEs reported overall were nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], diarrhea,

In assessments of PK in Study IM011002, BMS-986165 achieved maximum plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing an d had a median terminal half-life 
ranging from 8 to 15 hours across the dose range tested. With si ngle dosing, BMS-986165
exposures appeared to increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses less than 3 mg,
and in an approximately dose-depe ndent manner from 3 to 40 mg. After multiple-day dosing, 
BMS-986165 accumulation in the 1.4× to 1.9× range was observed at steady state. BMS-986165
is metabolized by [CONTACT_35840], but it does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
enzymes at expected plasma concentrations. When taken with a high-fat meal, BMS-986165exhibited a lower Cmax and a dela yed time to maximum plasma con centration (Tmax) relative to 
dosing in the fasted state. Although the area under the concent ration-time curve extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC[0-INF]) was decreased by 15% in the fed state rel ative to the fasted state, this 
difference was not thought to be clinically meaningful.

The effects of TYK2 inhibition by [CONTACT_20444]-[ADDRESS_35372] been documented in pharmacology studies, 
and the potential for benefit in SLE has been suggested by [CONTACT_35841] a mouse model 
of SLE; further support is found in mouse models of other immun e-mediated diseases. Findings in 
toxicology studies were consistent with expectations based on t he pharmacology of BMS-986165.
Thus, the FIH study was conducted with standard safeguards within a range of dose regimens. Even at the highest exposures in healthy subjects, AEs were mild to moderate, reversible, and 
consistent with expectations  based on nonclinical experience.
The risk for PK drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with BMS-986165 was assessed based on regulatory guidelines. At the maximum concentrations expected in this stud y (in portal vein or systemic 
circulation, as appropriate), the potential for DDIs involving most transporters is low.

transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as substrate, concomitant use  of strong inhibitors of P-gp is 
prohibited throughout the study. Treatment with BMS-986165 is n ot expected to diminish the 
effectiveness of contraceptives.
Nonclinical data and clinical experience in healthy subjects in  combination with the design and 
doses selected for the current Phase 2 study indicate an overall favorable risk/benefit assessment 
for investigating BMS-986165 as an oral treatment of patients w ith SLE. Detailed information

Section 9.1.
4.3 End of Study Definition
The duration of study participation for individual subjects is expected to be approximately 
56 weeks (392 days). 
The start of the study is defined as first visit for first subj ect screened. The end of the study is 
defined as the last visit or sch eduled procedure shown in the S chedules of Activities ( Section 1.3)
for the last subject. Study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary 
endpoint was expected to be collected, if this is not the same.  The end of the study for analysis of 
biomarker samples is mentioned in Section 8.9 .
4.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The primary purpose of the study is to determine the optimal do se of BMS-986165 for treatment 
of subjects with SLE. A placebo control is included to allow th e effects of treatment, both desired 
and adverse, to be appropriately attributed to treatments recei ved. All subjects will be permitted to 
continue their existing therap ies for SLE, and rescue treatment s are permitted as needed (with a 
few protocol-specified limitations) to allow subjects to mainta in standard disease control

allow subjects to use the lowest dose that meets their needs th roughout much of the study, but 
doses are held stable for 12 weeks before the Week 32 assessments  (primary efficacy) and for 
8 weeks before the Week 48 assessments to isolate effects of ass igned study treatments. A DMC 
will monitor safety and efficacy findings throughout the study to allow timely management of any 
concerns that arise. Study visits allow for close monitoring of  subjects. The eligibility and 
randomization criteria are designed to ensure that subjects hav e the expected level of SLE disease 
activity and to minimize the risk for serious infections that m ay be associated with 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_35842]-2K score, and region in order to balance subjects equally across treatment groups based 
on these characteristics, which may indicate the background severity of disease and/or background 
level of disease control and will also balance for potential re gional differences in SLE background 
medication.

over-the-counter anti-acne medications and alcohol-based skin care products, and avoidance of 
perfumed soaps and detergents, and similar measures.
Study treatment may be taken without regard to meals. However, s ubjects are required to fast for 
a minimum of 10 hours before visits on which fasting lipid and fasting glucose samples will be 
drawn (at 2 of these visits [Days  1 and 85], fasting PK samples  will also be drawn).
5.5 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to particip ate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized in the study for any reason. A minimal set of screen failure information 
is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements, and to r espond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demo graphy, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs.
5.5.1 Retesting During Screening Period; Rescreening
For laboratory parameters and/or assessments that initially do not meet eligibility requirements, a 
single retest within the 28-day SP is permitted in an effort to  find all possible well-qualified 
subjects. Consultation with the  medical monitor may be need ed to identify whether repeat 
testing of any particular parameter is clinically relevant.
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial 4-week SP) of a subject who 
discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, the subje ct fails screening or randomization

circumstances which must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_35852] l monitor, a subject can only 
be rescreened 1 time. Depending on the timing of rescreening, r epetition of some assessments may 
not be required. Duration of existing treatments and required d iscontinuation periods shall be 
considered relative to the given screening visit and/or randomi zation.
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the subject’s most current clinical state.
6 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study subject a ccording to the study randomization 
or treatment allocation
Study treatment includes both investigational [medicinal] produ ct (IP/IMP) and noninvestigational 
[medicinal] product (non-IP/non-IMP) and can consist of BMS-986165 and placebo. Information 
about the pharmacology and previous  experience with BMS-986165 is provided in Section 2.2 .
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharm aceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a c linical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (f ormulated or packaged) differently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indicatio n, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form.
Other medications used as support or escape medication for prev entative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as noninvestigational products. Table 5 shows the study treatments for

BMS Confidential 54treatment (as shown in Table 6 ). Investigative site staff, Sponsor and designee personnel, the  
(Section 4.1.1 ), and subjects and their families will remain blinded to treatment assignments. 
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject in which knowledge of the IP 
is critical to the subject’s management, the blind for that sub ject may be broken by [CONTACT_093]. 
The subje ct’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment 
assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment,  the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is neces sary, ie, that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the IP, the 
problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_35854]. It is 
highly desirable that the decisi on to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the  
medical monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate autho rity for the decision to unblind. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_35795].For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT manual.
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted acce ss to randomization information via 
IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify th e  medical monitor and/or study 
director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is de scribed in the IRT manual. 
Subject information and the reason for the blind being broken must be recorded on the appropriate 
study status page of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Af ter unblinding via IRT, the 
investigator shall notify the  medical monitor.In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_35855] e the blind. Any request to 
unblind a subject for nonemergency purposes must be discussed w ith the  medical monitor 
prior to unblinding.
Designated staff of Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development  (or designee) may be 
unblinded (obtain the randomizati on codes) prior to database lo ck to facilitate the bioanalytical 
analysis of pharmacokinetic samples. A bioanalytical scientist in the Bioanalytical Sciences 
department of Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development (or a  designee in the external 
central bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to (may obt ain) the randomized treatment 
assignments in order to minimize bioanalytical analysis of samp les.
6.4 Dosage Modification
There is no provision for dose modification of study treatment.  Titration of CS and its use as rescue 
therapy are discussed in Section 6.7.3 . Modification of other background SLE therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35796]. Subjects should continue to take their 
assigned treatment even if they experience flares and/or are un able to taper their CS dose, unless

6.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local reg ulations. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study s ubjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by [CONTACT_35856] g to local regulations.
The study treatment is stored in accordance with the environmen tal conditions (temperature, light, 
and humidity) required by [CONTACT_20444]. If concerns regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study 
treatment arise, the study treatment should not be dispensed and BMS should be contact[CONTACT_35857].
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration, and, as applicab le, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).

joint counts, CLASI, or Physician’s Global Assessme nt of Disease Activity are assessed (ie, all 
scheduled visits). Study treatment must not be taken on visit d ays until after efficacy assessments.
The following procedures or tools will be used to assess subjec ts’ SLE disease activity during the 
study (see schedule in  Section 1.3 ):
xBILAG-200410,11,12,13(APPENDIX 10 ): The BILAG-2004 rating is based on organ systems 
(constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskelet al, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, r enal, and hematological). Each is scored by a number of 
assessments, from which an overall grade is derived for each organ system. The overall grades 
are represented as 5 different levels from A to E (A = very active, B = moderate disease activity, C = mild stable disease, D = no disease activity but suggests the system had previously 
been affected, and E = no current or previous disease activity) .
xSLEDAI-2K
14,15(APPENDIX 11 ): The SLEDAI-2K is a global index based on weighted 
scores for each of [ADDRESS_35415] 30 days. The SLEDAI-2K assigns relative weights to each pa rameter.
xCLASI  16,17(APPENDIX 12 ): The CLASI assesses cutaneous disease activity by [CONTACT_35866]; points are given for presence of erythema, scale, hypertro phy, mucous membrane lesions, 
recent hair loss, and physician-observed alopecia. For the dama ge assessments, points are 
given for dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring, and scarring alopecia.
x40-joint count: A 40-joint count is used. This includes bilater al wrists, elbows, ankles, knees, 
interphalangeal joints of the thumb, individual proximal interp halangeal joints of the hand, 
second through fifth metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand, an d individual 
metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet (which make up the 36-joi nt count) .18,19,20To allow the 
28-joint count evaluation, bilateral first metacarpophalangeal joints and shoulders are also 
included, bringing the total joint count to 40. Each joint is e valuated based upon the presence 
or absence of tenderness, the presence or absence of swelling, and the presence or absence of 
both tenderness and swelling.
xPhysician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity assessed using a 3 -point visual analog scale 
(VAS).

assessments (eg, BILAG and SLEDAI-2K), such as complete blood c ount and renal function tests, 
are also used for safety assessments and are described in Section 8.5.3 . Samples for confirmation 
of hemolysis (using haptoglobin and reticulocyte count) for the  BILAG will be drawn at 
assessment visits and stored at the central laboratory; the samples will only be analyzed if there is

Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are listed in the  Schedules of Activities
(Section 1.3). All urgent safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponso r immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should cont inue or discontinue treatment.
Safety evaluations that will be performed in addition to AE mon itoring are physical examinations

examination may not be as comprehensive as the initial full exa mination, key aspects should 
evaluate important body systems as clinically indicated. These body systems can include lymph 
nodes, liver, spleen, and breast at the discretion of the examin er. A targeted examination may note 
any changes in the subject’s condition (body systems) since the  last assessment and does not 
preclude examination of any of the other body systems as clinically indicated. Every effort should 
be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the examinat ion for each subject at all visits 
throughout the study. Documentation of who performed the examin ation is to be recorded in source

The PD effects of BMS-986165 will be assessed based on markers in blood and urine, which will 
be collected at the timepoints shown in Section 1.3 and in Table 7 . Serum and plasma samples will 
be collected and analyzed for markers of tissue damage and regeneration, such as markers of 
inflammatory damage to collagen. Samples will be collected predose except for the FP visit. 
Samples can also be collected a t any time for the Day 2 or 3 sa mple, which will be collected for a 
subset of subjects for blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) and inflamm atory markers (this will be 
performed in a home visit or other means to avoid requiring sub jects to return to the site).  
 
Lupus is an inflammatory/autoimmune disorder that results in da mage to many different tissues. 
It is characterized by [CONTACT_35874] I IFN pa thway. To assess the effect of 
BMS-[ADDRESS_35435] decreases in complement prot eins, C3 and C4, and circulating 
lymphocytes. These will be assessed for evidence of PD activity . Anti-dsDNA will also be 
assessed for PD changes in serum and plasma.
BMS-986165 is expected to inhibit the actions of IL-12 and IL-2 3. This should result in alterations 
to T-helper cell phenotypes. In addition, B-cell populations ar e dysregulated in lupus, with 
increases in activated phenotypes.  Blood will be collected for lymphocyte profiling including 
assessments of T-helper subpopulations, activated and memory T- cell subpopulations, B-cell 
populations, and dendritic cell populations. These populations will be enumerated in samples from 
a subset of subjects in the [LOCATION_003]. In addition, the effects of BMS-986165 on IL-12- and 
IL-23-regulated genes and proteins will also be assessed.
Corticosteroid treatment is common in lupus; however, the effectiveness of this treatment varies 
in different patients. Thus, a broad range of doses are used ac ross patient populations and even 
over time within individual patients. This treatment can confou nd the interpretation of 
investigational clinical trials. To address this issue, the bio logical effect of CS use will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_35755] a gene signature [CONTACT_35898].
Lupus patients have characteristic alterations in blood cell pop ulations and activation status. Blood 
samples will be collected to assess the numbers and activation status of lymphocyte and leucocyte 
cell subsets.

Statistical Methodology
Efficacy analyses will be pe rformed using the population of randomized subjects.
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects who meet the r esponse 
criteria for SRI(4) at Week 32, will be analyzed using logistic regression 
with covariate for the randomization stratum to compare the res ponse rates 
between each treatment group and placebo. The odds ratio (odds for active 
treatment /odds for placebo) and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will be provided from the logistic regression mod el. 
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted using a Cochran-
Mante l-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by [CONTACT_35876];
or alternatively a chi -square test if a CMH test cannot be performed. 
Differences in response rates and corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be 
provided along with the point estimates and corresponding 95% C I for each 
group using a binomial model.
The above analyses will be conducted for the mITT population. T he primary 
efficacy analysis will be perfor med after all subjects have com pleted 
Week 48 efficacy assessments (or discontinued).

BMS Confidential 88CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are der ived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for adverse events (AEs) and/or laboratory abnormalities that ar e reported or identified during  the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture  (EDC) tool, electronic CRFs will 
be prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and pregnancy, which will be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy 
Surveillance form, respectively. If an electronic SAE form is n ot available, a paper SAE form 
can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstance s permitted by [CONTACT_3449]-specific 
CRF completion guidelines provided by [CONTACT_35886].
The confidentiality of records t hat could identify participants  must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentia lity rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature [CONTACT_35899]/or corrections on CRFs.The completed CRF and SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly revi ewed, signed, and dated 
by [CONTACT_20510] a sub-investi gator and who is delegated this task 
on the Delegation of Authority Form. Sub-investigators in Japan  may not be delegated the CRF 
approval task. For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature [CONTACT_35900]. The investigator must retain a copy of  the CRFs including records 
of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must mee t Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the BMS EDC tool using the uni que user account provided 
by [CONTACT_35886]. User account s are not to be shared or r eassigned to other individuals
MONITORING
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on-si te visits for targeted review of s tudy records.
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess 
the data quality and study integrity. On site they will review s tudy records and directly compare 
them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study wi th the investigator, and verify 
that the facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the 
source documents.
In addition, the study may be evaluated by [CONTACT_35887] d access to CRFs, source documents , other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP, AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with this treat ment .
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc ans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consi dered clinically s ignificant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Not e that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
xExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition  including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdo se of either study 
interventio n or a concomitant medication. Overdose as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_1275]), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is  an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses shou ld be reported regar dless of 
sequelae and should specify "intentional overdose" as the verba tim term.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
xMedical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which a n untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.

Serious Adverse Event Definition: Any untoward medical occurren ce that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20345] (see note 
below)
Note: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35815]: 
xa visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
xelective surgery, planned  prior to signing consent
xadmissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
xroutine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)
xmedical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
xadmission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)
xadmission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or signi ficant disability or permanent da mage
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event[s] th at may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require i ntervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event (see  Section 8.3.8 for the definition of potential DILI). 
Pregnancy and potential DILI must follow the same transmission timing and processes to BMS as 
used for SAEs (see Section 8.3.6 for reporting pregnancies).

BMS Confidential 97EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Intensity
The intensity of AEs is deter mined by a physician and will use the following levels:
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort, and not 
interfering with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interf eres with normal everyday 
activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An A E that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a cat egory utilized for rating the intensity 
of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
Assessment of Causality
xThe investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reaso nable possibility of a relationship” conveys that 
there are facts, evidences, a nd/or arguments to suggest a causa l relationship rather than a 
relationship cannot be ruled out.
xThe investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
xAlter native causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant thera py, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to s tudy intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated.
xThe investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
xThere may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. Howeve r, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the i nitial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
xThe investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_35816]- up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report w ith the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteri a used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent  sterilization methods include hys terectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categor ies are not considered WOCBP:
xPremenarchal
xPremenopausal female with 1 of the following:
oDocumented hysterectomy
oDocumented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_35817]: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview.
xPostmenopausal female 
oA postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_35449] a serum follicle-stimulating horm o n e  ( F S H )  l e v e l  
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Women treated with hormone r eplacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order  to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout periods below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels.
x1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, ge ls)
x4 week minimum for transdermal products
x8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the w oman can be considered 
postmenopausal.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE SUBJECTS OF CHILDBEARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods or less than highly effectiv e methods of contraception listed 
below is required during study duration and until the end of re levant systemic exposure, defined 
as 3 days after the end of study treatment, plus 30 days.
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/o r additional contraception methods 
(eg, one highly effective method plus another method).

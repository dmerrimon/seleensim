Study Duration  [ADDRESS_743975] stimulation (iTBS) is a patterned form of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS), an effective, neuromodulatory treatment for refractory 
depression. Accelerated rTMS paradigms have become of increasing clinical interes t to 
address the potential limiting factors of dose response variability and the burden that 
standard rTMS treatment poses due to the requirement of weeks of treatment at great 
financial expense. Even with reduced treatment time in iTBS compared with stand ard 
rTMS, there remains a barrier in requiring weeks or months of daily treatment sessions 
for desired response. A recent study carried out by [CONTACT_566424], tolerability and efficacy of an accelerated iTBS pro tocol and

  01 May 2023  2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Bipolar disorder is a chronic and burdensome illness that affects up to 5% of adults 
(Merikangas et al., 2011)  and is associated with direct and indirect costs of care 
exceeding $200 billion annually in the US (Cloutier et al., 2018) . Individuals with bipolar 
disorder spend considerably more time ill with depression than with mania or hypomania 
symptoms (Miller et al., 2014) , such that depression accounts for the majority of the time 
spent unwell.  Bipolar disorder is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and 
is an important contributor to long -term dysfunction due to psychosocial impairment, loss 
of work prod uctivity and high rates of substance abuse  (McIntyre & Calabrese, 2019) . 
Compared to the general population, individuals with bipolar disorder are at greater risk 
to attempt and complete suicide, especially among individuals experiencing longer 
periods of depression than mania (Baldessarini et al., 2006) . First line treatments for 
depression are limited in bipolar disorder, and treatment resistance can be up to two times 
higher when compared to unipolar depression (Tondo et al., 2014) .  
2.2 Study Rationale  
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, neuromodulatory clinical 
intervention used to treat depression. When stimuli are applied to the left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC), rTMS has been shown to be safe and effective in tre ating 
individuals with both unipolar and bipolar depression (Kazemi et al., 2018; Rachid et al., 
2017) . Accelerated rTMS  paradigms have recently been explored to determine the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of delivering multiple sessions over fewer days, to achieve similar 
outcomes compared with a standard series of rTMS  (Sonmez et al., 2019) . Reducing 
treatment time is important not only to reduce individuals’ suffering and resource strain, 
but also to address accelerating antidepressant response in more severely depressed 
individuals who are at greater risk for suicide. Intermittent theta bu rst stimulation (iTBS) 
is a form of patterned rTMS, recently deemed “non -inferior” to standard rTMS in the 
treatment of unipolar major depressive disorder (Blumberger et al., 2018; Chung et al., 
2015) . Even with a significant benefit in reduced treatment time in iTBS compared with 
the standard rTMS treatment time of 4 -6 weeks, time constraints, transportation, and the 
financial resources to attend daily sessions over weeks of time remain cumbersome 
limitations (Bakker et al., 2015) . Moreover, as individuals with bipolar disorder tend to 
have more treatment resistance and spend more time in a depressed state with higher 
risk for suicide  the value of non -invase treatment options is emphasized.  
 
A recent study carried out by [CONTACT_566425] (SAINT). SAINT utilized prior evidence to further enhance the 
 9 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  propensity of antidepressant response to iTBS by [CONTACT_566426], 
dosage and treatment target location  (Cazzoli et al., 2009, 2012; Fox et al., 2012; 
Gamboa et al., 2010; Noh et al., 2012) . Applied in a sample of individuals with unipolar 
(n=20) and bipolar (n=5) treatment resistant depression (TRD), the use of an accelerated 
iTBS paradigm yielded approximately 90% response and remission rates in depressive 
symptoms, in both unipolar and bi polar TRD participants (Cole et al., 2020) . Of the [ADDRESS_743977] participants, all met depression remission criteria within 5 days of treatment, 
with no hypomania/mania conversion observed during treatment or at follow -up. More 
recently, SAINT demonstrated evidence of efficacy over sham stimulatio n in RCT for 
treatment -resistance depression (Cole et al., 2022) . The current study aims to further 
evaluate the use of an adapted accelerated iTBS protocol for bipolar TRD and 
neuroimaging biomarkers of treatment response.  It will leverage the resources of the 
National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC), a consorti um of academic centers of 
excellence caring for participants with depression and bipolar disorder, to conduct the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
  
 [ADDRESS_743978] an open 
label pi[INVESTIGATOR_566413] (LDLPFC) (up to five days, up to 10x/day) using the MagVenture MagPro  X100 
rTMS System. Participants will have individualized treatment targets that will be 
produced from structural and functional MRI scans using the software services of 
Magnus Medical. We will enroll a total of 10 outpatient participants at two participati ng 
NNDC centers, the Johns Hopkins University and University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin. The 
participants will be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, currently depressed, as 
determined by a SCID -5 assessment at screening [Day -5/-14].  Participants will be 
asked to  remain on their psychotropic medications for stabilization throughout the 
screening, baseline, active study and follow -up phases of the study. During active study, 
changes in medication dosages may be made based on clinical judgment as outlined 
below. Par ticipants will be required to have an established psychiatrist in order to 
facilitate ongoing care after the trial.  
 
The expected overall study duration is one year. Each patient will have up to 9 total 
visits over the course of one month. One visit for consent and screening. One visit for 
baseline clinical and self -report assessments, MRI scan, and neurocognitive tests.  Five 
consecutive day visits (or less per symptom remission as outlined above via MADRS 
</=10) of 10 hours each for treatment. Two visits for follow -up. One immediately ( up to 5 
days ) after last day of treatment for clinical and self -report assessments, MR I scan, and 
neurocognitive tests. And another visit [ADDRESS_743979] of the study will be covered by [CONTACT_566427].  Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_743980] 
follow up appointment. This study will offer participants a choice to receive 
payment/reimbursement through the JHU Greenphire ClinCard Program. The standard 
Greenphire information sheet will be used to explain the use of Greenphire to 
participants.

inclusion/exclusion criteria and discuss the study with them . Then, the clinician or patient 
may contact [CONTACT_566432] a meeting to undergo the consent and formal 
screening process.  Once a study team member has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they may send 
potential participants a pre -consent screener via REDCap survey. This screener focuses 
on basic questions to establish whether the individual may be eligible to participate in the 
study.  A copy of  the screener is included with this application.  The screener will explain 
why we are asking these questions and will in form the individual that their responses are 
completely voluntary.  The screener will also inform the individual that any information we 
collect on them will be permanently removed if they decide not to participate in the study 
or are not eligible to parti cipate.

  01 May 2023  5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
 
Device Rationale:  
In our study, iTBS  will be delivered using the  Magnus Transcranial Magnetic 
Neuromodulation System (MNS) . MNS consists of the  MagVenture MagPro X100 rTMS 
Stimulator System (Magventure A/S, Denmark) equipped with a MagVenture Cool -B65 
coil. A Localite neuronavigation system (Localite GmbH, Sankt Augustin, [LOCATION_013]) will 
be used to position the TMS coil over the individualized stim ulation target at each 
session. MagVenture has a 40+ history in the development of safe and reliable TMS 
stimulators which have widespread clinical a nd research use. We will follow the dosing 
that was used successfully in the prior SAINT study carried out by [CONTACT_566434]. This is the same equipment that has been used for all 
published SAINT clinical trials to date.  
 
Traditional 10Hz TMS treatment is on label for the MagVenture MagPro X100 device we 
are using. Theta burst with an X100 is FDA cleared for treatment of MDD (K173620). 
No TMS is FDA cleared yet for treating bipolar depression. So, we are using a TMS 
machine  that is FDA -cleared for treating MDD, but for a non -FDA-cleared indication, 
bipolar depression.  
 
Theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is minimal risk because the risk of seizure is very low 
(only reported once in literature) and there is no other risk other than minimal scalp 
irritation. We are using iTBS with “off label” stimulation parameters which ha ve a lower 
risk profile than the on label approved parameters. Specifically, these parameters 
include: 1) 1800 pulses of iTBS ([ADDRESS_743983]), 2) 10 session per day instead of 1, 3) 90,000 overall  pulses 
instead of 18,000 total, 4) 5 days instead of 36, 5) 90% depth adjusted intensity instead 
of 120% non -depth adjusted, and neuronavigated targeting. The increased dose and 
dose density increases the risk, the lower stimulation intensity, fewer days, a nd 
navigated targeting all reduce risk.  
 
Treatment Details:  
Motor threshold: Using single pulse TMS, the scalp position of lowest motor threshold 
for the left first dorsal interosseous or abductor pollicis brevis muscles will be 
determined. Resting motor threshold (MT) will be defined by [CONTACT_566435] a visible muscle contraction in ≥5 of 10 trials.  
 
 15 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  rTMS system and treatment: For this study, we will be using the the MagVenture 
MagPro X100 rTMS Stimulator System (Magventure A/S, Denmark) equipped with a 
double -sided MagVenture Cool -B65 coil. A Localite neuronavigation system (Localite 
GmbH, Sankt Augus tin, [LOCATION_013]) will be used to position the TMS coil over the 
individualized stimulation target at each session. All participants will receive stimulation 
using iTBS over the LDLPFC (1800 pulses per session). The individualized treatment 
targets will be pro duced from structural and functional MRI scans using the software 
services of Magnus Medical. The targeting approach will be the same as that used in 
prior publications (Cole et al., 2020, 2022; Williams et al., 2018) .  
 
Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 90% of left RMT, adjusted to skull to cortex 
distance. No further adjustments are needed based on other patient characteristics or 
conditions. For safety, stimulation will never be delivered above 120% rMT. Sessions 
will be delivered using the MagVenture MagPro X100 stimulator, with triple -pulse 50 -Hz 
bursts given every 200ms (at 5 Hz).  
 
The iTBS protocol will consist of a 2s train of bursts given every 10 s for a total of 570s 
(1800 pulses) over the LDLPFC.  
 
If treatment emergent mania occurs (defined as an increase of [ADDRESS_743984] 2 YMRS items  or clinician judgment ), we will discontinue treatment and adjust anti -
manic medication and, if necessary, add on other pharmacologic measures 
(neuroleptics, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) as clinical ly indicated with the intent to treat until 
remission is achieved.  
 
Neuroimaging Biomarkers:  
We will perform structural and resting state functional connectivity MRI with a 3T system 
prior to active study phase and immediately after active study phase ( up to 5  days 
following final iTBS stimulation). The MRI scans will require about 1 hour in the MRI 
scanner. During the scan, participants will lie on the table in the magnet while the 
images are acquired. Instructions may be given through an auditory system. Subj ects 
will wear earplugs and may be fitted for a bite bar to help them to keep their head still 
during the scans; for studies that enroll older adults, a bite bar will not be used so as to 
accommodate participants with dentures. These procedures have been used previously 
in younger and older adults alike, and do not cause undue distress in subj ects.  
 
At Baseline and 1 week, our MRI scans will include:  
-Anatomical (T1) - 5min  
-Resting state fMRI  - 24 min  
-Resting state ASL - 7 min  
 16 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  -Diffusion -weighted imaging (DWI) - DWI acquisition will take approximately 4 min along 
90 non -collinear directions with a b -value=2400s/mm2.  
TOTAL scan time: ~40min  
 
Biomarker measures: We will use a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) 
convolved event -related model with temporal and dispersion derivatives to model the 
blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) in the context of a generalized linear model. 
Separate r egressors (convolved with the HRF) will be created for stimulus events in 
each paradigm. Temporal and dispersion derivatives will be treated as regressors of no 
interest. A region of interest (ROI) analysis will be performed using our established 
methods, to identify BOLD -dependent signal change in the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex, subgenual cingulate, and default mode network nodes (right, left). Beta values 
for each ROI will be extracted for each subject for regression analyses.

  01 May 2023  6.2 Descriptions of Evaluations   
 
Screening [Day -5/-50]: 
We will recruit participants from our clinics with a treatment history verifying they meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below in Section 5).  We will obtain informed consent 
from the participant and a trained rater will administer a SCID (Structured C linical 
Interview for DSM -5) to confirm the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Participants will be 
staged using a modified Maudsley staging method tailored for bipolar depression to 
determine the severity of treatment resistance. The consenting and clinical  screening 
assessment will be preformed in -person, or virtually by [CONTACT_566433]/video platform as 
works best for the individual and current COVID environment. We will also gather the 
participants’ medical records and review all information to screen for in clusion and 
exclusion criteria, MRI safety, TMS safety, medical and psychiatric history, a pregnancy 
test, and current medications.  
 
At the clinical screening assessment, a trained rater will also collect the following 
assessments:   
1. MADRS  (Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale)  
2. YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale)   
3. CGI-BP (Clinical Global Impression – Bipolar Disorder)  
4. ATHF current and lifetime (Antidepressant Treatment History Form)  – ATHF 
reviews patient antidepressant trials to assess whether patients have had “failed, 
adequate trials” of various classes of antidepressants.  
5. TASS (Transcranial Magnetic Simulation Adult Safety Screen)  – a screening 
form that evaluates prior adverse reaction to TMS and various seizure risk 
factors and relative contraindications  
 
Participants will also complete the following:  
1. AS-18 (Affective Self Rating Scale ) 
2. PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule)  
3. digiBP  (Digital Self -Report Survey of Mood for Bipolar Disorder)  
4. MADRS -S (Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale – Self Rated)  
5. C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)  
 
Baseline [Day 0]:  
Baseline visits will be separate from screening visits to confirm stability of symptoms. 
Participants will have an MRI scan in the morning (see Neuroimaging Biomarker section 
below for more details).

Active Study [Day 1 -5]: 
TMS sessions will be scheduled in a [ADDRESS_743986] treatment session. We will 
monitor any medication changes throughout the course of the entire study. Participants 
will receive up to 10 daily stimulations with active iTBS over the left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) (1800 pulses). In the event of depression treatment 
remission (i.e. MADRS </=10), treatment emergent mania occurring (defined as an 
increase of [ADDRESS_743987] 2 YMRS items), or clinician judgment, LDLPFC 
treatment will be discontinued and emergent symptoms will be treated by [CONTACT_566437]’s anti -manic agent and other pharmacologic measures if 
necessary as assessed  by [CONTACT_566438].  
 
If participants do not experience a significant increase in manic/hypomanic symptoms 
(>/=2 item increase of 2 or more points on the YMRS scale), LDLPFC treatment will 
continue until MADRS </=10 or the end of the 5 -day treatment series is reached.  
 
Each session will be separated by a 50 -minute break. This separation between 
stimulation sessions decreases the risk of associated TMS side effects (e.g. irritation 
from the device, headache).   The modified PANAS (items 3, 9, 11, 17, 18, 19) will be 
administered between every stimulation session to assess for any potential shift 
towards (hypo)mania. If a significant increase (>/=2 item increase of 2 or more points) is 
observed, the YMRS will be administered.  
 
Active study clinical measures collected at beginning and end of  each treatment day 
(unless where noted) will include:  
1. YMRS (AM and PM)  
2. MADRS  (AM, PM, and as clinically indicated)  
3. Daily Check -In Form  (AM only)  
 
Active study self -report measures collected at end of each treatment day will include:  
1. AS-18 
2. digiBP  
3. MADRS -S   
 
The goal will be to treat participants to remission over the course of 5 days or earlier 
(when patient achieves remission of symptoms per MADRS </=10).  
 
Follow -up [Day 8-40]: 
Due to COVID -19 or related considerations, we will perform follow -up assessments via 
a secure audio/video platform in cases where we cannot conduct in -person 
assessments or per participant preference.  
 [ADDRESS_743988]-treatment mark. In addition, we will also administer the CGI -BP at these 2 time 
points.  
 
Participants will complete the following self -report assessments at these two follow -up 
time points as long as they meet responder/remission criteria:  
1. AS-18 
2. PANAS  
3. digiBP   
4. MADRS -S   
5. C-SSRS

baseline) to treatment by [CONTACT_566439], [ADDRESS_743989].  
 
6.3 Description of Study Measures   
a. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Scale -Clinician Rated (MADRS) : The MADRS  is a 
ten-item clinician rated questionnaire. Total scores can range from 0 to 60, with 
higher scores indicating greater severity of depression  (0-6 normal range, 7 -19 mild 
depression, 20-34 moderate depression, >34 severe depression) . We will utilize this 
assessment to determine participant’s level of depression and consequent eligibility 
for the trial.  We will then subsequent utilize the MADRS daily and at follow up as our 
primary outcome measure.  
 
b. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS):  The YMRS is an 11 -item clinician -administered 
scale used to measure symptoms of mania. Each item is scored from 0 -4 with scores 
of 4 indicating the presence of more severe mania. This scale will be used to monitor 
symptoms of mania through each day of  iTBS treatment.  
 
c. Clinical Global Impression Scale - Bipolar Disorder  (CGI -BP): The CGI -BP is  a 3-item 
clinician rated scale to provide a global rating of severity of manic and depressive 
 [ADDRESS_743990] phase of illness. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 (0 = not assessed and 7 = 
very much worse or severely ill ). The CGI -BP will be administered at screening, 
baseline and visit follow ups for a more global assessment of patient’s illness and 
symptoms.  
 
d. Affective Self Rating Scale  (AS-18): The AS -18 is a 18 item self -rating scale that 
assess depressive, manic, and mixed affective states. Each symptom is rated from 0 
“none” to 4 “very severe”. The AS -18 will be filled out at every study encounter: 
screening, baseline, active study, and follow up.  
 
e. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS):  The PANAS is a 20 -item self report 
scale that consists of different words that describe  different positive and negative  
feelings and emotions.  Every item is rated from 1 “very slightly or not at all” to 5 
“extremely” . The PANAS will be filled out screening, baseline, and follow up  
encounters . A modified PANAS (items 3, 9, 11, 17, 18, 19) will be administered 
between every stimulation session to assess for any potential shift towards 
(hypo)mania  
 
f. Digital Self -Report Survey of Mood for Bipolar Disorder (digiBP):  The digiBP  is a 6 -
item digital survey for measuring mood in bipolar disorder. It has three depressive 
items (depressed mood, fidgeting, fatigue), two manic items (increased energy, rapid 
speech), and one mixed item (irritability); and recovers two scores (m and d) t o 
measure manic and depressive severity. The digiBP will be filled out at every study 
encounter: screening, baseline, active study, and follow up.  
 
g. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Scale -Self Report (MADRS -S): The MADRS -S is the 
self-report version of the original ten -item clinician rated questionnaire  (MADRS) . The 
MADRS -S comprises 9 items rated on a 0 -3 point scale which are summed to 
calculate a total score. This score is then doubled for comparison with the clinician 
version of the MADRS. The MADRS -S will be filled out at every study encounter: 
screening, baseline, active study, and follow up.  
 
h. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) : The C -SSRS is  questionnaire 
used for suicide assessment . The C‐SSRS measures four constructs: the severity of 
ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior and lethality. It includes “stem questions,” 
which if endorsed, prompt additional follow ‐up questions to obtain more information.  
We will utilize this along with clinical assessment to monitor for participant’s suicide 
risk. The C -SSRS will be filled out at screening, baseline  and follow up .

  01 May 2023  7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Risk Assessment:  
TMS:  Extensive published data show that this accelerated theta -burst rTMS  protocol in 
prefrontal cortex is safe and very well tolerated (Sonmez et al., 2019) . The most 
common side effects were mild headache, fatigue, and some discomfort at the 
stimulation site.  
 
No seizures were observed in any of the above studies. However, very rarely, TMS can 
induce seizures (17 reported cases to date among tens of thousands of participants 
treated with rTMS, but few to none if proper safety and enrollment procedures are 
follow ed), with a seizure risk at approximately 1:30,000 sessions for traditional high 
frequency rTMS (Rossi et al., 2009) . To minimize the chances of this adverse event, 
participants with seizure history will be excluded. The FDA has considered studies of 
standard TMS to be nonsignificant risk (not requiring an IDE).  
 
Another potential immediate risk is that of induction of mania. Although there have been 
no such cases of mania induced by [CONTACT_566440], there have been at least 13 cases of rTMS -
induced mania reported from fixed -frequency rTMS in participants with depression (Xia 
et al., 2008) . The rTMS -induced mania rate reported by [CONTACT_566441] 0.84% as 
compared to 0.73% for sham, which were not significantly different from each other.  
 
Another potential risk is mild pain at the site of stimulation, which occurs during 
stimulation only, and which wanes with each session. There is also a risk of 
psychological distress related to this pain, should it occur, though discomfort associated 
with rTMS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105], and not distressing when participants are reassured it is not 
dangerous. For participants that continue to experience discomfort with TMS, pre - 
treatment with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and/or lidocaine will be allowed as warranted.  
Participants and treaters will wear earplugs during all treatment sessions. In between 
sessions, participants will be placed in a relaxing environment to maximize 
psychological well -being.  
 
MRI:  Common MRI risks include claustrophobia, localized twitching (not painful) 
sensation during MRI, and tinnitus after MRI. There are some contraindications that 
may prevent a participant from having a scan; however, all participants will be screened 
prior t o scanning to evaluate these risk factors. Due to the strength of the magnetic field, 
contraindications include participants with heart pacemakers, metallic foreign bodies in 
their eye, and brain aneurysm clips, as the magnetic field may dislodge the m etal 
leading to injury.  
 24 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023   
Confidentiality:  A risk of all clinical studies is that they collect personal information that 
may be seen by [CONTACT_566442]. This could lead to 
psychological, social, and cultural risks.  However, we will use best practice procedures 
to minimiz e the potential for breaches of confidentiality.  To protect participants’ 
confidentiality, a numerical system will be used as unique identifiers, and identifying 
information will not be stored with the data. Electronic data will be collected via 
REDCap, a HIPAA compliant electronic data capture system, maintained in a protected 
environment in the SAFE Desktop Environment at Johns Hopkins. Secured information 
linking participant’s ID with protected health information will be separated from the 
unidentified d ata. All treatment interactions will occur in a closed -door room with 
specified study personnel. We will have private rooms available for all participant 
interviews and follow -up interactions. All video meetings will be conducted using the 
PHI-safe Zoom vi deo meeting interface or comparable platform.  
 
Long -range Risks:  No long -range risks associated with TBS or routine MRI have been 
reported, and none are anticipated for this study.  
 
Potential Benefits:  
Participants may have reduction and/or remission of depressive symptoms allowing for 
improved quality of life, engagement, and functioning. This translates to other 
downstream benefits such as increased societal/economic productivity. Further, this 
study m ay give a way for participants to receive rTMS treatment who otherwise would 
be ineligible given that rTMS treatment is not covered by [CONTACT_566443]. 
Demonstration of SAINT efficacy may lead to larger real -world clinical trials for both 
bipolar I  disorder but also perhaps other psychiatric conditions.   
7.1 Method s for Assessing Adverse Events  
Seizure:  A physician will be available at all times during treatment to evaluate any 
participant experiencing a suspected seizure.  
 
Mania:  The rTMS parameters used in this study  are the least risky because the intervals 
of stimulation have been shown to be appropriate for theta burst stimulation in the motor 
system with no adverse outcomes. Moreover, participants' symptoms will be monitored 
carefully by [CONTACT_566444]. The YMRS will be 
administered daily to check for mania symptoms. If the participant displays an increased 
YMRS score (>/=2 points) on 2 questions, stimulation will be stopped and pati ent will be 
treated for emergent symptoms via increase of their anti -manic agent and other 
pharmacologic measures as indicated per clinician assessment.  
 
 25 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  If any of the research team or clinical staff believe that the participant may be showing 
signs of hypomania/mania, the YMRS will be administered by [CONTACT_566445], the researchers will not wait until the daily assessments are conducted. 
Further, independently, the modified PANAS (items 3, 9, 11, 17, 18, 19) may be 
administered between every stimulation session to assess for any potential shift 
towards (hypo)mania. If a significant increase (>/=2 item increase of 2 or more points) is 
observed , the YMRS will be administered.  
 
Suicide:  Monitoring participants depressive symptoms will allow the identification of 
individuals at risk of suicide and therefore the risk of this occurring can be minimized. At 
screening, baseline, and follow up the C -SSRS will be administered to directly assess 
suicidal risk.  During active study days suicide risk will be screened via the MADRS 
which has a question to assess suicidal thoughts. Evaluation of the suicidal risk 
assessments will be made by [CONTACT_566446] -up is needed as described in section 7.2.   
7.2 Management of Adverse Events   
Seizure:  In the unlikely occurrence of a suspected seizure, participation will be 
discontinued and the participants will be provided with a referral to outpatient care. Any 
seizure that theoretically could occur would likely be self -limited and lead to no residual  
neurological impairment. Seizures induced by [CONTACT_566447], brief and don’t result in 
sequelae, with no events of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_566417] (Rossi et al., 2009) .  
 
Mania:  In the event of emergent mania symptoms (defined as an increase of [ADDRESS_743991] 2 YMRS items), or clinician judgment, treatment will be discontinued and 
emergent symptoms will be treated by [CONTACT_566448]’s anti -manic 
agent and other pharmacologic measures if necessary as assessed by [CONTACT_566449].   
 
Suicide:  If any study personnel believe a participant is at suicide risk, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_566418] , clinical staff,  and the 
participant will be had. If the study team considers it necessary, the patient will be referred 
for emergency psychiatric treatment.  
7.3 Reporting Procedures  
All adverse events  occurring in this study will be reported to both local and Central IRBs 
according to each institutions’ IRB policies. Central IRB shall promptly notify the Principal 
Investigators (PI) of the study as designated on the IRB protocol submission of all IRB 
decisions and shall make available to the PIs all applicable study related documents 
 26 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  including but not limited to approved protocols, consent forms, surveys, and decision 
letters.   
All adverse events will also be reported to Magnus Medical, who manufacture the TMS 
device intended for use in this study, via their safety email address 
([EMAIL_10800] ).  
7.4 Follow  up for Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be followed through until the event(s) have resolved , no further 
action is required , or participant has been transferred to an appropriate level of clinical 
care. The study team will communicate with the participants’ pre -study care team to 
coordinate care.  
  
 27 of 36 Version 1. 8 
  01 May 2023  8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Study 
doctors are to discontinue participants from the study if participants:  
• Request early discontinuation or withdraw consent.  
• Experience a serious or intolerable adverse event that prevents the participant 
from continuing.  
• In the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is experiencing a clinically significant deterioration.  
• Conduct a protocol violation, including lack of compliance.  
• Are “lost to follow -up” as defined as no response from participant after daily 
attempts to contact [CONTACT_566450].  
• Encounter other conditions (such as administrative issues or pregnancy).  
 
If a participant discontinues from the study at any time at their own request or at the 
study clinician’s discretion, the reason(s) for discontinuation are to be recorded by [CONTACT_10748].  
 
Participants are to continue care with their pre -study care team. If participants do not 
remit but respond (>/=50% decrease on the MADRS from baseline) to treatment by [CONTACT_566451], 5 -day treatment series, they may be referred to a TMS clinic. If 
participants are withdrawn from the study for reasons related to the treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_566419] [ADDRESS_743992] treatment), they will be followed until the event(s) 
have resolved or no further action is required. The study team will communica te with the 
participants’ pre -study care team to coordinate care.

  01 May 2023  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Considerations  
This is an open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The study will not include blinding given that this is a 
single group assignment to treatment. Study will not include a placebo or non -treatment 
group as this is a feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_566420] a sufficient evaluation of 
the feasibility of carrying out the protocol across multiple NNDC centers given the 
available resources and provide preliminary data to motivate further study of this 
treatment approach.  
9.2 Early  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566421]:  
 
Three or more participants reach hypomania as defined by a score of greater than 10 
on the YMRS scale without resolution (YMRS <10) within 24 hours with pharmacologic 
measures as outlined above.  
9.3 Outcomes  
9.3.1 Primary Outcome   
The primary outcome measures for this study will be change in MADRS scores. The 
MADRS is a clinical assessment tool used to rate a patient's level of depression and is 
the standard scale used for depression research studies. The YMRS will be used as a 
seco nd primary outcome measure to assess any changes in symptoms of mania over 
the course of treatment. The YMRS is a clinical assessment tool used to assess the 
presence and severity of manic symptoms. The primary outcome measures will be 
assessed as the chan ge between baseline and immediate ( up to [ADDRESS_743993] day of 
treatment) post -treatment assessment.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_743994] if there are significant changes in scores over follow -up.  Based on previous 
work, we will use a compound symmetry or autoregressive covariance structure (based 
on distribution of residuals) and robust estimation of coefficients to handle violations of 
model assumptions. Random effects will be included to account for repeated measures 
on the same participants, and fixed effects of time will be evaluated controlling for fixed 
effects of age, sex and number of days to reach treatment remission.  All post hoc 
pairwise comparisons will be Bonferroni corrected. Exploratory endpoints related to 
biometrics will be analyzed in similar fashion.  
 
For assessment of the secondary outcome measures of change in functional 
connectivity, we will employ a resting -state seed -based functional connectivity approach 
to assess connectivity between the subcallosal cingulate connectivity to the DLPFC and 
within the default mode network. For each participant, the correlation coefficients 
between average blood oxygen level -dependent (BOLD) time series of the seed -region 
and the BOLD time series of each grey matter voxel within the DLPFC or default mode 
network will  be calculated.  The correlation coefficient will be converted to normally 
distributed z scores by [CONTACT_566452]’s r to z transformation. The resulting 
connectivity maps will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA to compare pre -
iTBS vs post -iTBS connectivity measures as a within -subject variable, and sex and site 
as a between -subject covariate.  
  
 [ADDRESS_743995] review 
to ensure they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and are appropriate for this study.  Study 
team will have monthly meetings to review and ensure protocol compliance as 
participant’s are enrolled and undergo active study treatment.     
 [ADDRESS_743996] (IRB) Review   
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications 
will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_36052].  The 
consent form should be separate from the protocol document.   
11.[ADDRESS_743997] will be documented in the participant’s record.  
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised written ICF and any written information provided 
to the subject must be approved by [CONTACT_566453]. The ICF will adhere to 
Central IRB requirements, applicable laws and regulations.  
11.[ADDRESS_743998] the 
site will be identified only by a participant identification number ( Participant ID, PID ) to 
maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept on secure servers. All computer entry 
and networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. Information will not be released 
without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744] .  
  
 [ADDRESS_743999] be simultaneously reported to both site PI [INVESTIGATOR_566422]. Apart from this , monthly meetings will be held to discuss protocol events and 
deviations to ensure appropriate reporting to the JHM IRB. All data will be stored on 
JHU REDCap and SAFE Desktop. PI [INVESTIGATOR_566423].  
13.2 Single IRB   
Johns Hopkins Medicine is serving as the single IRB for this study. It is the preference 
of Johns Hopkins Medicine IRB to use the SMART IRB reliance agreement as the basis 
of reliance. The SMART IRB master reliance agreement was created in 2016 to 
harmonize and streamline the IRB review process for multisite studies. It enables 
reliance on a study -by-study basis, clearly defines roles and responsibilities of relying 
institutions and reviewing IRBs, and eliminates the need to sign reliance agreements for 
each study [e.g., a non -SMART IRB agreement]. 900+ institutions have already signed 
onto this agreement and are actively using it as the basis of reliance for multisite 
projects. Sites that will rely on JHM IRB are still responsible for conducting a local 
context review prior to the start of research at their site and for following any local and 
institutionally required policies as it applies to research at their site [e.g., reporting of 
unanticipated problems].

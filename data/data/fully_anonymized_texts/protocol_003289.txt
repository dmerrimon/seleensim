<50x 109/L(ie,subjects m eeting 
such lab criteria would be 
relatively too healthy to pre sent

Study Design
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study 
using avatrombopag to treat adults with thrombocytopeniaassociated with liver disease.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 2cohorts according to mean baseline platelet count and, within 
each baseline platelet count cohort will be further stratified by[CONTACT_403673] (low, moderate,or high)and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status (Yes 
or No). Neither baseline platelet count cohort will comprise greaterthan 55% of the total 
number of subjects enro lled into th e study.
Within the lowerbaseline platelet count cohort (<40× 109/L) and each stratum, subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive avatrombopag or placebo as follows: 
60mg avatrombopag on Days 1 to 5 (Group A: avatrombopag, lower baseline platelet 
count)
Matching placebo on Day s 1 to 5 (Group B: placebo, lower baseline platelet count)
Within the higherbaseline platelet count cohort (from 40 to <50× 109/L) and each stratum, 
subjects will be rando mized in a 2:1 ratio to receive avatrom bopagor placebo as follows: 
40mg avatrombopag on Days 1 to 5 (Group C: avatrombopag, higher baseline platelet 
count)
Matching placebo on Day s 1 to 5 (Group D: placebo, higher baseline platelet count)
Platelet counts must be measured on 2separate occasions, during the Screening Period and at 
Baseline, and must be performed at least 1day apartwit
h neitherplatelet count >60×109/L.  
The mean of these 2platelet counts (mean baseline platelet count<50 × 109/L) will be used for 
entry criteria.  
This study will consist of 3phases: Prerandomization, Randomization, and a Follow-up Phase.  
The Prerandomization Phase includes 1Screening Visit that will take place from Day-14 
through Day-1; the Randomization Phase includes the Baseline Period, TreatmentPeriod, and 
Procedure Day Period ([ADDRESS_509063] dose of study drug [Study Day 10 to 13]).  The 
Follow-up Phase comprises 2visits: [ADDRESS_509064] dose of study  drug.
The elective procedure for those subjects whose preprocedural platelet count is >200 × 109/L on 
Visit 4 (Procedure Day) may be delayed at the discretion of the investigator until platelet counts 
are below 200 × 109/L.  All subjects whose platelet count exceeds 200 × 109/L will be required to 
have a Doppler assessment at Visit 5.  For any subjects where the presence ofaportal vein 
thrombosis (PVT)is suspected , confirmat ion of diagnosisvia computerized tomography (CT) 
scan or m agnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed and treatm ent for PVT ini tiated 
per local guidelines.
Permitted procedures and the risk of bleeding associated with eachprocedure are listed in the 
following table.It is planned that no fewer than 10% of subjects will be enrolled into the high 
risk group and no more than 60% of subjects in the low risk group.

Health Economic Assessments
The health economic assessment consists of translating the primary efficacy variable, reduced 
need or reduction in the proportion of platelet transfusio ns in the avatrombopag study arm 
compared to the placebo arm. Specifically, the following health care resource utilization is 
assessed: (including any rescue treatment, procedure, and laboratory  test for bleeding including 
the number of transfused platelet units, the supply from which the transfused platelet units were 
procured including whole blood platelets from a random donor pool (if known) with or without 
leukocyte depletion, as an apheresis product (as platelets alone) from a single donor and/or 
autologous blood donation, number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], number of intensive carebed-days, number 
of outpatient visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s outpatient department, the clinic, the physician’s office, 
home health care or other place of service, and health care resource utilization related to other 
transfusio n-related complications during all scheduled and unscheduled visits will be collected
during all scheduled and unscheduled visit s.
Bioanalytical Methods
Plasma samples will be assayed for avatrombopag concentrations using a validated liquid

Subjects who have any major protocol violations (major inclusion/exclusio n violations or 
other major protocol  violations that impact the evaluat ion of efficacy)
Subjects who use a prohibited concomitant medication that affects the assessment of

Efficacy Analyses
The FAS will be used as the primary population for all efficacy analyses, while the PPwill be 
used as the supportive population.  All analyses of platelet counts will be based on local 
laboratory  results.
Primary Efficacy Variable Analysis
The null hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusio n or any 
rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective 
procedure is the same between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups.  The 
corresponding alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects not requiring aplatelet 
transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following 
an elective procedure is not the same between avatrombopag and placebo. This hypothesis will 
be tested separately wit hin each baseline platelet cohort.
The proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusio nor any rescue procedure for 
bleeding will be tested between the individual avatrombopag treatment group (40 or 60 mg) and 
matching placebo within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40 × 109/L or from 40 to 
<50 ×
109/L), each at a significance level of α=0.05,using the generalized Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low,

For subjects with platelet count <40 x 109/L at baseline, the treatm ent comparison will  be 
carried out between the 60mg avatrombopag treatment group versus matching placebo.
For subjects with platelet count from 40 to <50 × 109/L at baseline, the treatment 
comparison will be carried out between the 40mg avatrombopag treatment group versus 
matching placebo.
This study will be considered as positive if statistical significance is achieved for the primary 
efficacy endpoint for both baseli ne platelet count cohorts.
The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet 
transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding will be calculated for each treatment group 
within each baseline platelet count cohort.  Inaddition, the 95% CI for the difference between 
avatrombopag and matching placebo will be provided within each baseline platelet count cohort.
Since the HCC status i s included in the randomizati on stratificat ion for safety purposes only , not 
for efficacy consideration, HCC will not be included in the CMH model for the primary  efficacy 
analysis.
Subjects with missing information about the primary efficacy outcome due to early withdrawal 
or other reasons will be considered as having received a transfusio n for the primary analysis.
Subgroup analyses and addit ional sensit ivity analyses will be performed, as appropriate.  
Secondary Efficacy Variable Analyses
The analysis of the secondary  efficacy variables as defined above will proceed following a

The proportion of subjects who achieve platelet counts of ≥50 × 109/L on the Procedure Day  will 
be analyzed first.  The proportion of subjects with platelet counts of ≥50 × 109/L on the 
Procedure Day will be tested between the individual avatrombopag treatment group (40 or 
60mg) and matching placebo separately within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40 × 109/L 
or from 40 to <50 × 109/L), each at a significance level of α=0.05,using the generalized CMH 
test adjusting for risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate,or high
based on Amendment 02 categorizat ion).  
The second secondary  efficacy variable, change from baseline in platelet count on the Procedure 
Day, will be analyzed only if the test for the first secondary  efficacy variable is statistically 
significant for both baseline platelet count cohorts.  The change from baseline in platelet count 
will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test separately  within each baseline platelet count 
cohort (<40×109/L or from 40 to <50 ×109/L),each at a significance level of α=0.05. (revised

CONFIDENTIALSample Size Rationale
The proposed sample size is based on comparisons of the primary efficacy variable, with the 
response rate defined as the proportion of subjects who do not require a platelet transfusio n or 
any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective 
procedure.  Based on clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_403650] a similar compound in adults 
with thrombocy topenia associated with liver disease (ELtrombopag EValuated for its Ability to 
overcome Thrombocytopenia and Enable procedures [ELEVATE] study), the response rate in 
the placebo group i s assumed to be 18%.  With each baseline platelet count cohort, a sam ple size 
of 100randomized subjects, 67subjects for avatrombopag and 33subjects for placebo, will have 
greater than90% power to detect an absolute difference of 35% between the avatrombopag 
response rate and the placebo response rate assuming 18% response rate for placebo using 
Fisher’s Exact tests wit
h a 2-sided α=0.05.  (revised per Amendment 04)The hypothesized 
treatment group difference is based on pl atelet count changes found in the Phase 2 study (E5501-
G000-202)and dose-response modeling using data from that study and others in the project 
development. Based on the baseline data in the Phase 2 study and assuming these are projected
to be similar for this study, it is anticipated that thisstudy will enroll roughly half of the total 
number of subjects in each of the 2 baseline platelet count cohortsto make the total sample size 
of 200 randomized subjects, 133subjects for avatrombopag and 67subjects for placebo.

associated with significant morbidity and mortality.Patients with chronic liver disease can 
develop thrombocytopenia from decreased production of thrombopoi etin (TPO), as well as from 
increased destruction of platelets from auto-antibodies or platelet sequestration with 
splenomegaly .In addition, depending upon the etiology of the liver disease, additional factors 
can contribute to thrombocytopenia, such as viral-induced myeloid suppressio n.  
Thrombocy topenia is a common problem in patients with liver disease, with the extent of 
thrombocytopenia often worsening with the degree of cirrhosis .
Patient treatment decisions are guided by [CONTACT_403683], as well as by [CONTACT_403684].  Patients with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (<50 x 
109/L) associated with liver disease are commonly administered platelet transfusions 
immediately pri or to elective diagnostic or therapeuti c procedures in order to mi tigate the risk of 
bleeding. The extent of the bleeding risk r elates to the degree of thrombocy topenia, the extent of 
other coexisting coagulopathy(ies), and the type of elective procedure.  While temporarily 
effective, platelet transfusio n therapy can have significant health and economic consequences, 
including the development of refractoriness to subsequent platelet transfusio ns, potential 
transmissio n of infectious agents, transfusio n reactions, and, in rare cases, fatality.  
Unfortunately, in patients requiring repeated platelet transfusions, both the magnitude ofthe 
platelet increase and the duration of that increase declines with increasing numbers of 
transfusio ns.1This refractoriness to treatment can pose a major challenge for patients 
undergoing procedures in preparation for liver transplant or other procedures pertinent to their 
care. For patients who have acquired refractoriness to platelet transfusion, an unintended 
consequence is often the need to delay or even cancel important procedures.  Additionally, like 
all blood products, platelets are a precious commodity with a limited shelf life. Approximately 
9million units of platelets are transfused each year in the US;240% in surgical settings.3Liver 
disease patients are believed to represent a significant proportion of the patient population 
regularly receiving platelet transfusio ns.4A recent assessment at the University of Colorado 
Denver Medical School revealed that up to 20% of all platelet transfusio ns were given to liver 
disease patients.
E5501/avatrombopag (formerly known as AKR-501 monomaleate and YM477) is an orally 
administered, small mo lecule c-Mpl receptor agonist that mimics the biological effects of TPO in 
vitro and in vivo. Thrombopoiet in, the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, 
exerts its effect on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis via binding and activation of 
the c-Mpl receptor, which is expressed on hematopoiet ic stem cells, on cells of the 
megakaryocyt ic lineage, and on platelets. Like TPO, avatrombopag also binds to the human 
c-Mpl receptor and affects signal transduction through the induction of downstream  signaling, 
thereby [CONTACT_403685]. 
Aproof of concept (POC) study(E5501-G000-202)has demonstrated the efficacy, safety,and 
tolerability of avatrombopag in elevating platelet counts inthis group ofpatients with

maintenance of interferon-based therapy,neither product is approved for the treatment of

Avatrombopag is being developed to provide an alternative to the standard of care (platelet 
transfusio n) by [CONTACT_1541] a 5-day course of once daily therapyand eliminating the need for

human megakaryocytes in a concentration -dependent manner with a maximum effect similar to 
that of recombinant human TPO.  In vitro, avatrombopag has been shown to stimulate human 
megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation without affecting platelet function, either 
activation or aggregation.  The pharmaco logic effect of avatrombopag is highly species-specific, 
with signaling occurring only in chimpanzees and humans but not in any other species tested.  
Avatrombopag was stable in mouse, dog, or human liver microsomal enzyme incubations in 
vitro, indicating slow metabo lism.

CONFIDENTIALIn addition, avatrombopag (up to 10 μmol/L) did not inhibit the major human liver cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4).  
Avatrombopag (0.1 to 5 μmol/L) did not induce CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP3A.  
However, it weakly induced CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.  Therefore, the potential for drug-drug 
interactions is low.
Absolute bioavailabilit y was evaluated in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey.  Overall, 
avatrombopag was well absorbed, but highly variable, and the fraction absorbed ranged from 
approximately  50% to 90%.
Nonclinical toxicology studies have indicated that avatrombopag was well tolerated.  The 
primary toxicity of avatrombopag was identified as dose-related changes in the stomachs of rats, 
mice, and monkeys, with an elevation of serum gastrin levels in repeated-dose studies.  The 
gastric changes showed a clear trend towards recovery after a recovery period.  Exposures (area 
under the concentration -time curve and maximum plasma concentrati on) at the no-observed-
adverse-effect-levels in animals, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], are sufficient ly above the clinical exposures 
at the current m aximum therapeutic dose.  Avatrombopag wa s negative in the standard battery  of 
genotoxicity tests.  Avatrombopag has no effect on reproductive toxicity, except for the higher 
sensitivity to toxicity in neonates/j uvenile rats in the pre -and postnatal  development study .  In the 
2-year carcinogenici ty studies, neuroendocrine cell (enterochrom affin-like [ECL] cell) 
hyperplasia (rats only), and ECL cell tumors (carcinoids, both mice and rats) occurred in the 
stomach.  The mechanism of action for gastric changes by [CONTACT_403686] a gastrin hypothesis, similar to the cases of antisecretory agents such as proton 
pump inhibitors and H2blockers based on mechanist ic studies, leading to the conclusion that the 
results are not relevant to humans.  Avatrombopag had no ocular ordermal irritation, no dermal 
sensitization, and no phototoxicit y potential in nonclinical studies.
Overall, nonclinical data suggest that avatrombopag is a promising candidate for use in the 
treatment of thrombocy topenia of diverse eti ologies, including t hrombocy topeniaassociated with 
liver disease.
7.1.2.3Effects in Humans
Avatrombopag has been studied in humans in single-and multiple-dose Phase 1, dose-rising 
safety and tolerability studies.  In healthy human subjects, single and multiple doses of 
avatrombopa g oral suspensio n showed a dose-dependent increase in peripheral  plateletsand no
safety issues were reported.  A
 comparative bioavailabilit y study of avatrombopag suspensio n 
and tablets showed that avatrombopag tablets produced significantly lower exposure 
(approximately 67%) than the oral suspension.  A food-effect arm demonstrated a high-fat meal 
mildly increased avatrombopag exposure. 
A total of [ADDRESS_509093] population in the clinical pharmaco logy studies 
included 390 healthy volunteers, age 18 to 64, of which two-thirds were men (men: 263/390,

Study E5501-G000-202 evaluated the efficacy, safety, and population PKof once-daily oral 
avatrombopag dosing, in subjects with chronic liver diseases and thrombocytopenia prior to 
elective surgical or diagnostic procedures.  The primary efficacy endpoint w as the proportion of 
responders with platelet count increases from baseline of ≥20 × 109/L and a platelet count 
of≥
50× 109/L once from Day 4 through Day 8.  The proportion of responders for all 
avatrombopag-treated subjects was 48.4% compared with 8.1% in the combined placebo group 
(P<0.0001).  All doses of avatrom bopag achieved a significantly higher proporti on of responders 
compared with their respective cohort placebo arms and the highest platelet count responses 
were observed between Days [ADDRESS_509095] dose.  In addition, avatrombopag appeared well 
tolerated in this patient population.  There was no clear trend regarding the incidences of AEs
between placebo and avatrombopag treatment groups, and the commonly reported 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)and serious TEAEs were consistent wi th the disease 
state of the patient population.  The findings from Study E5501-G000-[ADDRESS_509096] that

7.1.2.4Common Serious Adverse Events Expected to Occur in the Study  Population Even in 
the Absence of Study  Drug Exposure
Thromboti c/thromboembo lic complicationsmay occur in patients with chronic liver disease.  
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is of particular concern in chronic liver disease patients who are 
prone this t ype of thro mbosis and is o ften associated with poor portal  vein flow.  The presence of 
thrombocytopenia can increase the potential for bleeding, which results in an elevated morbidity 
and mortality risk in patients with liver disease.  In cirrhotic patients undergoing abdominal 
surgery, bleeding accounts for up to 60% of all causes of death.  Thrombocytopenic patients 
often require multiple platelet transfusio ns, which can be associated with complications such as 
systemic infect ions, iron overload, and pl atelet refractoriness.4
7.2 STUDY RATIONALE
The current study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated 
with liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet transfusio ns or 
any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and postprocedural bleeding complications
Dose selection has been carefully focused on seeking to maintain an appropriate risk: benefit 
ratio in this patient population, removing the requirement for platelet transfusion, or any rescue 
procedure for bleeding, while minimizing the risk of thromboembo lic events. The selected 
doses, based on modeling and simulation of the E5501-G000-202 study data, are aimed at

CONFIDENTIALachieving sufficient efficacy(eliminatingthe need for platelet transfusio n) while specifically 
limiting the proportion of subjectsachieving platelet counts >200× 109/L to less than 2%. The 
current study design employs a dosing regimen, according to baseline platelet count, that is 
anticipated to lead to a similar rise in platelet counts irrespective of baseline platelet count.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 2cohorts according to mean baseline platelet count (<40 × 109/L 
or from 40to <50× 109/L) and dosed with 60 mgavatrombopag versus placebo for subjects with 
platelet count <40 × 109/L and 40mgavatrombopag versus placebo for subjects wit
h platelet 
count from 40 to <50× 109/L. 
This is 1of 2duplicate global pi[INVESTIGATOR_403652].
7.2.[ADDRESS_509097] a significant risk of thromboembo lic and bleeding events.As 
platelet counts decline,cirrhotic patientstend tobecome more susceptible to bleeding following 
an inciting event such as trauma, rather than spontaneous bleeding as seen in other 
thrombocytopenic conditions such as ITP. This apparent discrepancy is mainly due to 
coagulation abnormalit ies seen inpatients withcirrhosis.5,6Despi[INVESTIGATOR_403653] ‘balance’ 
between pro-and anti-coagulation factors in plasma, the coagulation system in the cirrhotic 
patient is associated with an increased tendency towards thrombosis, regardless ofobserved 
prolonged conventional coagulation test times, such as prothrombin time, activated partial 
thromboplastin time, and INR. As a result, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia 
associated with liver disease, excessive elevations in platelet counts may potentially trigger 
thrombotic/thromboembo lic events in the background of known coagulation abnormalities.
Perhaps,the most significant thromboti c event seen in patients wi th thrombocytopenia associated 
with liver disease is PVT.
Portal vein thrombosis in the general population is a rare event. However, it is a relatively 
common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis (4% -15%)7, with frequencies increasing 
with the degree of cirrhosis and a prevalence as high as approximately 30% in candidates for 
liver transplantation. Although even complete occlusion of the portal vein may not result in 
overt clinical manifestations, due to rapid development of collateral veins by[CONTACT_403687], patients can experience acute and chronic onset of a variety of clinical 
symptoms. These include increased variceal bleeding, refractory  ascites and abdominal pain, 
presumably from small bowel ischemia or infarction due to the involvement of the superior 
mesenteric vein.[ADDRESS_509098] been associated with the occurrence 
of PVT in patientswith chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia.10  
In theELtrombopag

Development of PVT is recognized as a multifactorial complication, which involves both 
inherited and acquired thrombotic risk factors.  One of the strongest risk factorspredisposing 
patients to the development of a PVT may be a reduced flow in the portal vein. Literature and 
meeting reports indicate that a portal vein flow rate of10to 15cm/second is a good predictor of 
future risk for PVT.13Doppler sonography, which is routinely used in pat ients with liver disease, 
can be used to assess portal vein flow rates and guidelines have been developed that can reduce

The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol 
eligibility.  Subjects m ust have a di agnosis of thrombocytopenia associ ated with liver disease and 
be scheduled to undergo an elective procedure.   Only subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], are expected to require platelet transfusio n to address a risk of bleeding associated 
with the procedure will be recruited into this study . 
Informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to each subject and 
before the conduct of any  screening procedures or assessments.  Procedures to be foll owed when 
obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section5.3.
After providing 
informed consent, all subjects will undergo screening assessments to ensure that 
they meet all of the inclusi on and none of the exclusi on criteria, as described in Section 9.3.1and 
Section 9.3.2.  Screening assessments and timing are shown in Section [IP_ADDRESS](Table5).
During this phase, the ty pe and schedule of the elective procedure will be confirmed.  
The Screening Disposition case report form (CRF) page must be completedto indicate whether 
the subject is eligible to participate in the study and to provide reasons for screen failure, if 
applicable.
Rescreen of subjects will only  be allowed under the following circumstances:
Scheduled procedure is cancelled or delayed
Plateletcount inclusion criteria is not met 
as platelet count tendsto fluctuate
Unable to complete the Screening Period due to administrative, logist ical issues
Previously  screen failed due to criteria no longer in the protocol (added per Amendment

Repeat of screening laboratory evaluations are allowed in cases where abnormal result(s) are 
noted during the Screening Period that are believed to be related to a potential laboratory  error 
or a transient and/or reversible condition  (eg, clumpedplateletsor hemolyzedsample for

randomization.  If additional blood samples are sent to the central laboratory  during the 
Screening Period, eligibility must be assessed based on 
the most recent laboratoryvalues.  The 
2most recent values will be used to determine the mean platelet count valuefor entry criteria 
and for assignment to the low or high baseline platelet count cohort.

9.1.3 Follow -up Phase (Visits 5 and 6)
Upon completion of the Procedure Day period, all subjects will enter theFollow-up Phase 
comprised of 2visits: 7 days postprocedure Day  and Day 35.
Assessments and timing are shown in Section [IP_ADDRESS](Table5).
9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUPS
The current study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated 
with liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet transfusio ns or 
any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural  and postproce dural bleeding complications.  
The study design employs a dosing regimen, according to baseline platelet count, that is 
anticipated to lead to a similar rise in platelet counts irrespective of baseline platelet count.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to mean baseline platelet count (<40 × 109/L 
or from 40 to <50× 109/L) and dosed with 60 mg avatrombopag versus placebo for subjects with 
platelet count <40 × 109/L and 40mg avatrombopag versus placebo for subjects wit
h platelet 
count from 40 to <50× 109/L.  Within each cohort, subjects will be further stratified by [CONTACT_403690] (low, moderate,or high) and HCC status.  From 
previous studi es, it is anticipated that the 2 baseline platelet count cohorts (<40 × 109/L and from 
40 to <50× 109/L) will be equally represented. However, neither baseline platelet count cohort 
will be permitted to comprise greater than 55% of the total number of subjects enrolled into the 
study.  
Theclinical primary endpoint is based on reducing the need for platelet transfusio ns or any 
rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and postprocedural bleeding complications.  A 
similar primary endpo int has already been used for el trombopag, another TPO agonist.  Based on 
the clinical grounds and the available literature, the primary endpoint of “proportion of subjects 
who do not require a platelet transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding after 
randomizationand up to 7 days following an elective procedure,” is considered to be clinically 
relevant.
The secondary and exploratoryendpointssurrounding World Health Organization (WHO)
bleeding scores and BARC bleeding scale in the current studyare also clinically relevant, as 
bleeding is considered a complication of thrombocytopenia that can lead to increased morbidity, 
mortality,and use of medical resources. Information obtained from these secondary  and 
exploratory  endpointscan provide important information regarding bleeding scores and 
associated medical interventions in patients withthrombocytopenia associated with liver disease 
and thrombocy topenia.  
An independent DSMB will be established to monitor the ongoing safety data.If there are 
excessive serious adverse events ( SAE)in a dose arm, further subject enrollment to that dose arm 
may be suspended at the discretion of the DSMB. The study will continue to its end with the 
remaining dose until follow-up is completed for all enrolled subjects.

Dose selection has been carefully  focused on seeking to m aintain an appropri ate risk:benefit rati o 
balance in this patient population, removing the requirement for platelet transfusio n, or any 
rescue procedure for bleeding, while minimizing the risk of thromboembolic events.  The 
selected doses, based on modeling and simulation of the E5501-G000-202 study data, are aimed 
at achieving sufficient efficacy (eliminating the need for platelet transfusio n) while specifically 
limiting the proportion
of subjects achieving platelet counts >200 × 109/L to less than 2%.

classification must be 0, A, or B for inclusion in the study. Therefore, HCC subjects with a 
staging classificat ion of C or D will be excluded from the study as these subjects have a higher 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a PVT complication.  The BCLCstaging classificat ion guides treatment, 
particularly in early tumors. The BCLC staging system links tumoral stage with a treatment 
strategy, and is aimed at incorporating prognosis estimation and potential treatment 
advancements in 1unified proposal,with Stage [ADDRESS_509127] subjects with HCC, although individual cases might warrant 
special considerat ion.16
DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY WITH FLOW RATE
Subjects will be screened for evidence of PVT, including portal vein flow rate, using Doppler 
sonography  before study entry.  All subjects whose platelet count exceeds 200 x 109/L will be 
required to have a Doppler assessment at Visit 5.  Three main portalvein blood flow velocity 
measurements, lasting no less than [ADDRESS_509128] a main portal vein blood flow 
velocity rate of ≥10 cm/second at Screening to be eligible for the study.  The Doppler 
sonography  and flow rate assessment can be completed at any time during the Screening Period 
with results available pri or to randomizat ion.
Guidelines have been developed toreduce inter-observer variability inmeasuring flow rates14to 
ensure uniformit y of flow rate measurements.  Every effort should be made to have the same 
sonography  operator at the study site perform all ultrasound evaluations throughout the study.

9.5.1.5Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0grades (for both increasing and 
decreasing severity), and SAEsincluding platelet transfusio n
-related complications;regular 
monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital 
signs and electrocardi ograms (ECG); theperformance of physical examinations; and Doppler 
sonography  as detailed in Table5.
An independent DSMB will be established in order to ensure the s afety of the subjects.   
ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is avatrombopag
The criteria for identifying AEs are:
●Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal  laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product

Clinical Study Protocol
(Protocol Amendment 0 4)E5501-G000-311
FINAL (v7.0):  02 Dec 2016 Page 53of 92
CONFIDENTIAL●Any new disease or exac erbation of an existing disease
●Any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurem ents of a laboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuat ion of study  drug
●Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present at 
pretreatm ent (Baseline)
●An abnormal laboratory  test resul t should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any  type of intervention, whether prescribed in the protocol or not.
A laboratory  result should be considered by  [CONTACT_403696]:
●Results in the wit hdrawal o f study drug
●Results in wit hholding of study drug pending so me investigational outcome
●Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (eg, potassium supplement for 
hypokalemia)
●Results in any out of range laboratory  value that in the invest igator’s judgment fulfills the 
definitions of an AE with regard to the subject’s medical profile
●Increases in severity compared with baseline by ≥2 CTCAEgrades (see Appendix 1for 
CTCAE v 4.0), with the exception of lymphocytes, albumin, cholesterol, glucose, and 
phosphate. For these tests, any change of ≥[ADDRESS_509129] 
dose.
Abnormal laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part 
of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  Any  laboratory  abnormality considered 
to constitute an AE should b e reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
It is the responsibilit y of the investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and 
determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether an isolate d laboratory  abnormalit y should be classified as an AE.  
Abnormal ECG (QTc, corrected for heart rate) results, if not otherwise considered part of a 
clinical symptom that is being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval 
is >450ms and there is an increase of >60ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormality that the 
investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.

Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_3190].
ASSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v 4.018as follows:
Grade 1 = Mild: asymptom atic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Grade 2 = Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living
Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403661]; disabling; limiting self-care activities 
of daily living
Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 = Death related to AE
Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing sev erity).  
All AEs reported using CTCAE classification and graded as 4 or 5 are to be considered serious.
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Serious 
Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest for th e definition of an SAE).
ASSESSING RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY TREATMENT
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatment are:
●Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatment
●The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
●Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments
●The presence of risk factors inthe study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
●The presence of nonstudy, treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event

FINAL (v7.0):  [ADDRESS_509131] further qualify the degree of certainty as 
“possible” or “probable.”
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST
A SAE is any  untoward m edical occurrence that at any  dose:
●Results in death
●Is life-threatening ( ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not includean event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]
●Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity
●Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug)
Other important medical events that m ay not be immediately  life-threatening or resul t in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or 
may require intervention to prevent 1of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above 
should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of interest include pregnancy  or exposure to study drug 
through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication 
error; any treatment-emergent significant laboratory abnormality;recurrence of 
thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of <10 × 109/L and 10 × 109/L less than baseline 
count within 30 days of discontinuation); thromboembo lic events; bleeding events (WHO 
Grade2 to4);andplatelet transfusio n-related complicat ions.These events of interest are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet 1of the 
above criteria.  All AEs associ ated with events of interest are to be reported on the CRF whether 
or notthey meet the cri teria for SAEs.  All liver transplantations are to be captured as SAEs.

CONFIDENTIALprocedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (Section9.5.4.1) even if the AEs do 
not meet serious criteria.  Abuse is always to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associ ated with an 
overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be 
reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on 
the SAE form  and the Adverse Event CRF.
REPORTING OF SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY ABNORMALITY
Any significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality observed during the clinical study 
should be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the procedures detailed in 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (Section9.5.4.1), even if the laboratory  abnormalit y does 
not meet serious criteria.  If the significant laboratory abnormality does not m eet serious criteria, 
it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as

A laboratory result should be considered a treatment -emergent significant abnormalit y if the 
result:
●Is within normal limits at baseline and has increased in severity to meet the sponsor’s 
grading criteria for laboratory  values of Grade 3 or above
●Is outside normal limits at baseline and increases in severity to the sponsor’s grading 
criteria for laboratory  values of Grade 4 or above.  These abnorm alities are autom atically
considered to be serious, with the exception of expected and reproducible hematologic 
abnormalities.
●Is otherwise considered by [CONTACT_403703]9.5.1.5(Serious Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest)
Significant laboratory abnormalities should not be listed as separate AEs or SAEs if they are 
considered to be part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE or SAE. 
REPORTING OF STUDY -SPECIFIC EVENTS
Study-specific events (ie, recurrence of thrombocytopenia [defined as a platelet count of 
<10× 109/L and 10 × 109/Lless than baseline count within 30 days of discontinuation]); 
thromboembolic events; bleeding events (WHO Grade 2 to4); and platelet transfusion -related 
complications should be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the procedures 
detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (Section9.5.4.1), even if the study-specific 
event does not meet serious criteria.  If the event does not meet serious criteria, it must still be

PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYS IS
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of subjects who do not require a platelet 
transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7days following 
an elective procedure.
The null hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusio n or any 
rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective 
procedure is the same between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups.  The 
corresponding alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet 
transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following 
an elective procedure is not the same between avatrombopag and placebo.This hypothesis will 
betested separately wit hin each baseline platelet cohort.
The proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusio n or any rescue procedure for 
bleeding will be tested between the individual avatrombopag treatment group (40 or 60mg) and 
matching placebo within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40× 109/L or from 40 to 
<50 × 109/L), each at a significance level of α=0.05,using the generalized Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, 
moderate, or highbased on Amendment 02 categorization).  
For subjects with platelet count <40 x 109/L at baseline, the treatm ent comparison will  be 
carried out between the 60 mg avatrombopag treatment group versus matching placebo.
For subjects with platelet count from 40 to <50× 109/L at baseline, the treatment 
comparison will be carried out between the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment group versus 
matching placebo.
This study will be considered as positive if statistical significance is achieved fortheprimary 
efficacy endpointfor both baseline platelet count cohorts.

transfusio n or any rescue procedure for bleeding will be calculated for each treatment group 
within each baseline platelet count cohort.  In addition, the 95% CI for the difference between 
avatrombopag and matching placebo will be provided within each baseline platelet count cohort.
Since the HCC status i s included in the randomizati on stratificat ion for safety purposes only , not 
for efficacy consi deration, HCC will not be included in the CMH model for the primary  efficacy 
analysis.
Subjects with missing information about the primary efficacy outcome due to early withdrawal 
or other reas ons will be considered as having received a transfusio n for the primary analysis.
The following analyses will be considered as sensitivit y analyses:
PP analysis: The same primary efficacy analyses described above will be repeated based 
on the PP analysis s et. 
Observed case: The same primary efficacy analyses described above will be repeated 
based on observed data.  Subjects with missing information about the primary efficacy 
outcome will be excluded from this analysis.
Fisher’s exact Test: The same primaryefficacy analyses described above will be carried 
out using Fisher’s exact test.
Modified primary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects who do not require a platelet 
transfusio n after randomizat ion and up to 7 days following an elective procedure.  This 
efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the same approach as primary efficacy analysis 
using FAS. 
Additional sensitivity analyses m ay also be explored, if deemed appropriate.

CONFIDENTIALThe proporti on of subjects who achi eve platel et counts of ≥50 × 109/L on the Procedure Day  will 
be analyzed first.  The proportion of subjects with platelet counts of ≥50 × 109/L on the 
Procedure Day will be tested between the individual avatrombopag treatment group (40 or 
60mg) andmatching placebo separately within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40 × 109/L 
or from 40 to <50 ×109/L), each at a significance level of α=0.05,using the generalized CMH 
test adjusting for risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or high
based on Amendment 02 categorizat ion). 
The second secondary  efficacy variable, change from baseline in platelet count on the Procedure 
Day, will be analyzed only if thetest for thefirst secondary  efficacy variable is statistically 
significant for both baseline platelet count cohorts.  The change from baseline in platelet count 
will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum testseparately  within each baseline platelet count 
cohort (<40 × 109/L or from 40 to <50 × 109/L), each at a significance level of α=0.05.

to the end of the Follow-up Phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_21753].  Analysis of changes from baseline will be based on the number of subjects with both 
nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline results.
Laboratory  test results will be assigned a low/normal/high (LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference 
range.  Shifts from baseline (LNH) to Procedure Day  and to the end of  the Follow-up Phase will 
be presented for each laboratory  parameter.  Similar shift tables from baseline (LNH) to the 
highest/lowest postbaseline LNH classificat ion will also be provided.
Appendix 1(Sponsor’s Grading for Laboratory  Values) presents the criteria that will be used to 
identify subjects with treatment-emergent markedly abnormal laboratory  values (TEMAV). 
Except for phosphate, a TEMAV is defined as a postbaseline value with an increase from 
baseline to a grade of 2 or hi gher.  For phosphate, a TEMAV was defined as a postbaseline value 
with an increase from baseline to a grade of 3 or higher.   The number and percentage of sub jects 
with TEMAVs will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]; each subject may be counted once in the 
laboratory  parameter high and in the laboratory  parameter low categories, as applicable.  
Markedly abnormal laboratory  values will be flagged in the subject dat a listings.
VITAL SIGNS
Descriptive statistics for vital sign parameters (i.e. diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], body temperature, and weight) and changes from baseline will be presented by

HEALTH ECONOMIC ANALYSES
The health outcome economics, as measured by [CONTACT_403711], will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_403712]. The categorical variables will be tested using 
CMH, Chi -squared or Fisher's exact test, while cont inuous variables may be analyzed by t-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate .
Details of these analyses will be provided in a separate analysis plan .
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size
The proposed sample size is based on comparisons of the primary efficacy variable, with the 
response rate defined as the proportion of subjects who do not require a platelet transfusio n or 
any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective 
procedure.  Based on clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_403650] a similar compound in adults 
with thrombocy topenia associated with liver disease (ELEVATE study),10the response rate in 
the placebo group i s assumed to be 18%.  With each baseline platelet count cohort, a sam ple size 
of 100randomized subjects, 67subjects for avatrombopag and 33subjects for placebo, will have 
greater than90% power to detect an absolute difference of 35% between the avatrombopag 
response rate and the placebo response rate assuming 18% response rate for placebo using 
Fisher’s Exact tests with a
 2-sided α=0.05.  (revised per Amendment 04)  The hypothesized 
treatment group difference is based on pl atelet count changes found in the Phase 2 study  (E5501-
G000-202) and dose-response modeling using data from that study and others in the project 
development.  Based on the baseline data in the Phase 2 study and assuming these are projected 
to be similar for this study, it is anticipated that thisstudy will enroll roughly half of the total 
number of subjects in each of the 2 baseline platelet count cohortsto make the total sample size 
of 200randomized subjects, 133subjects for avatrombopag and 67subjects for placebo.

Clinical Study Protocol
(Protocol Amendment 0 4)E5501-G000-311
FINAL (v7.0):  [ADDRESS_509179] variabilit y:
The subject should be fast ing for at least [ADDRESS_509180] er sonography
oRationale: Portal vein flow  rate increases after food intake
The subject should be in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 15 minutes prior to the Doppler 
sonography
oRationale: Posture has an impact on portal vein flow  rate. Standardizing posture 
across study sites can minimize variability
The subject should be instructed to take a full inspi[INVESTIGATOR_403668]/her breath for a 
few seconds during portal vein flo w measurement
oRationale: Measuring portal vein flow  rate at the same point in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_403669] y:
In order to minimize operator variabilit y, the follo wing instructions are provided:
When possible, the same trained sonography operator will perform all of the Doppler 
sonography  testing on all subjects at the study  site throughout the study . 
The portal  veinshould be scanned lo ngitudinally 
Sample volume should be positioned in the center of the vessel, in the tract underneat h 
the hepatic artery, covering 50% of the vessel diameter
The Doppler angle should be 55º or just below
Pulse repetition frequency  should be 4kHz; the high pass filter should be adjusted to 
100Hz
The Doppler and B -mode tracings should be recorded simultaneously
The average portal  blood maximum velocity should be obtained by [CONTACT_403720]
The Doppler waveform calculation should be obtained by [CONTACT_403721] 2cardiac cycles 
between 3arterial wall art ifacts

CONFIDENTIALPortal vein diameter should be measured from the inner anterior to the inner posterior 
wall
Three main portal vein blood flow velocity measurements, lasting no less than 4 seconds, will be 
recorded, and the mean of the 3 values recorded as the final reading.  
Minimize equipment variabilit y:
Different equipment may furnish different results due to interequipment variability.  Therefore, 
the sponsor recommends that the same Doppler equipment should be used at the study site 
throughout the study .

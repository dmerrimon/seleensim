6 I. Introduction  
1.1 Background and rationale  
Poor maternal nutrition is a major public health concern and has adverse  consequences on fetal and 
early childhood growth, infant morbidity and mortality, and health and productivity in adulthood (Black 
et al. 2013).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_653127] , many  women do not receive proven maternal nutrition services  during 
pregnancy.  In Ethiopia, 62 percent of women receive antenatal care (ANC) from a  skilled provider  and 
just two -thirds of women who attend ANC receive nutrition counseling ; nearly 60 percent of women do  
not consume any IFA tablets during pregnancy (CSA & ICF, 2016).  
 
There is wide recognition of the importance of integrating maternal nutrition interventions  in ANC  to 
improve maternal and child health (Bhutta et al. 2013).  In 2016, World Health Organization (WHO) ANC 
guidelines were updated to place a high priority on nutrition interventions during pregnancy to improve 
perinatal outcomes and women’s experience of care. In Ethiopia, the  government has adopted a 
package of maternal nutrition interventions into national guidelines (see Ethiopia’s Federal Ministry of 
Health (FMOH) National Guideline on Adolescent, Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_653128], the coverage and quality of maternal nutrition interventions remains low.  Alive & Thrive 
(A&T) is interested in improvin g nutrition coverage among users of government ANC services.  
 
A&T is an initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, prevent illnesses, 
and contribute to healthy growth and development through improved maternal nutritio n, breastfeeding 
and complementary feeding practices in several countries. In October 2017, A&T was awarded by [CONTACT_653139] & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Ethiopia Office a new five -year agreement to Accelerate 
Improvements in Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nu trition in Ethiopia. The A&T Ethiopia 3.0 
investment (2018 –2022) will support  the government of Ethiopia to achieve targets set out in the 
national nutrition program (NNP II)  and the National Nutrition Sensitive Agriculture Strategy ( NNSAS). 
A&T will focus  its role on strengthening systems at the national and regional levels for achieving large 
scale and sustainability, and strengthening the evidence base for programs and policies.  
In Ethiopia, A&T will develop and test the integration of a n intensive  packa ge of maternal nutrition 
intervention s into existing ANC services delivered through government health facilities that will align 
with the latest global evidence (WHO, 2016) and the NNP II . These include interpersonal counseling on 
diet quality during pregnancy , counseling on  iron-folic acid ( IFA) supplement ation , adequate weight -gain 
monitoring, counseling on early breastfeeding practices , and systems strengthening through training 
and suppo rtive supervision . The impacts of the se intensive interventions  in users of government ANC 
services  will be compared with standard ANC services.  
1.[ADDRESS_876590]  of 
integrating locally relevant maternal nutrition interventions into existing ANC services on diet quality  
and utilization of nutrition interventions  during  pregnancy .  
Research questions for the evaluation include:  
7 1) Is it feasible  to integrate locally relevant maternal nutrition interventions based on the WHO 
ANC Guidelines into existing ANC services delivered through government health facilities?  
2) Can the coverage and utilization of key nutrition interventions  (nutrition counseling , weight 
gain monitoring , IFA supplement consumption , and breastfeeding counseling ) be improved by 
[CONTACT_653140] -focused behavior change interventions and  health systems strengthening 
approaches into existing ANC services?  
3) Can the quality of diets (dietary diversity  and meal frequency ) among pregnant women be 
improved by [CONTACT_653140] -focused behavior change interventions and  health systems 
strengthening approaches into existing ANC services ?

II. Methods: Participants, Interventions and Outcomes  
2.[ADDRESS_876592] in two regions: Southern Nations 
Nationalities and People’s Re gion (SNNPR) , a primarily agrarian region,  and Somali , a region with a high 
population of pastoralists  (see Figure 1). The Somali region is among the poorest of Ethiopia’s nine 
administrative regions , predominantly rural , and relatively ethnically homogene ous. According to the 
most recent Ethiopi[INVESTIGATOR_653129] 2007 , 38 percent of the population in Somali is pastoral compared with 
less than one percent in SNNPR  (CSA 2007) . SNNPR is one of the most populous regions in Ethiopia as 
well as the most diverse; more than 80 ethnic groups reside in the region.  
Study  regions were selected by [CONTACT_653141],  so that maternal nutrition intervention 
packages be tested in both agrarian and pastoral settings. Pastoralists —agriculturalists who rely 
primarily on th eir livestock for their food and income —and the regions they live have had few 
opportunities to be studied in the past , as t heir migratory nature makes it particularly difficult to track 
them through surveys. Policymakers are requesting programmatic experi ence across regions so that 
results and interventions can be used for the scale -up of nationally accepted guidelines and targets.  
Current guidelines for ANC services are standardized nationwide , providing further incentive to include 
diverse areas for stud y implementation.  
 
[ADDRESS_876593] nationwide and in study  regions (see Figure 2). Current ANC service 
utilization is low in the study  regions and nationwide: only 11.8 percent of women in Somali and 38.2 
percent of women in SNNPR achieved the WHO -recommende d four or more ANC visits during 
pregnancy (compared to 31.8 percent nationally)  (CSA & ICF, 2016) . Among women who had at least 
one ANC visit, 48 percent in Somali and 62.3 percent in SNNPR received nutrition counseling. More than 
half (56 percent) of wom en in Somali and nearly a third (30.4 percent) of women in SNNPR did not 
attend ANC during their pregnancy.  
IFA consumption during pregnancy is also low in Ethiopia. Current WHO guidelines recommend daily IFA 
supplementation for women throughout pregnancy , beginning as early as possible. Ideally, women 
should receive IFA tablets no later than the first trimester, corresponding to 6 months (180 days) of 
supplementation. Very few women (4.2 percent in SNNPR and 2.3 percent in Somali) achieve at least 90 
days  of IFA supplementation before delivery  (CSA & ICF, 2016) . Seventy -two percent of women in Somali 
and [ADDRESS_876594] the ir health through 
pregnancy and delivery , evidence on the dietary intake of pregnant women in Ethiopia is scarce.  One 
study conducted in rural SNNPR found that while nearly all pregnant women reported the need for 
dietary improvements during pregnancy, only a quarter of women reported increased food intake and 
no significant differences were found between the dietary intake s of pregnant and non -pregnant 
women (Asayehu et al. 2017). Moreover , even among those pregnant women who claimed improved 
food intake, energy and most micro nutrient intakes were inadequate.  
Misconceptions about weight gain during pregnancy and food taboos also persist in some areas of 
Ethiopia . Many r ural women in the Oromia region  were found to oppose gaining weight during 
pregnancy, out of fear of delivery complications associated with the birth of a large baby (Zerfu et al. 
2016). Limited weight gain , before and  during  pregnancy , can result in  inadequate birthweight and fetal 
growth (Frederick et al. 2008; Siega -Riz et al. 2009).  
SNNPR  Somali  
[ADDRESS_876595] ever breastfed their children, 
with nearly 80 perce nt of women in SNNPR and Somali reporting early initiation of  breastfeeding (within 
one hour of birth) (CSA & ICF, 2016). Exclusive breastfeeding among children during the first 6 months is 
less prevalent ; only 40 percent of infants in Somali and roughly 6 0 percent of infants in SNNPR are 
exclusively breastfed . 
Figure 2. ANC and breastfeeding indicators among Ethiopi[INVESTIGATOR_653130]: 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey  
 
Across SNNPR and Somali regions, A&T selected seven  woredas  (districts) as potential intervention areas 
on the basis of having adequate health facility access and infrastructure. Four woredas  were selected in 
SNNPR and three  woredas  in Somali region. Fewer  woredas  were selected in Somali as the communities 
are more homogenous,  and those with less security issues  were identified . The list of study woredas  and 
their corresponding numbers of health centers and posts are presented in Table 1.

12 2.5 Participant timeline  
Enrollment of pregnant and recently delivered women will begin in October  2019 , at the time of 
baseline survey . Interventions were planned to be implemented for up to one year, following the 
baseline survey. Then, pregnant and recently delivered women would be assessed at endline , exactly 
one year after baseline.  
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID -19 a pandemic. Disruptions to work and 
field conditions in Ethiopia resulted in program implementation being halted in April 2020  when the 
Government of Ethiopia declared a state of emergency . A&T began providing supportive supe rvision in 
July 2020 and refresher trainings for nurse -midwives and HEWs were held in November 2020. 
Interventions will be implemented through July 2021. Pregnant and recently delivered women will be 
assessed at endline in July -September 2021.  
2.6 Sample Si ze 
The two main survey samples for the primary outcomes will be : 1) pregnant women who attend ed at 
least [ADDRESS_876598] , as this sample allows the 
assessment of diet quality during pregnancy; and 2) recently de livered women who attended at least [ADDRESS_876599] children <[ADDRESS_876600] opportunity to assess the primary outcome related to intervention 
exposure throughout pregnancy (i.e., IFA consumption).  Sample sizes were estimated based on current 
known prevalence of the primary outcomes  among women who attended ANC , the expected change 
after intervention, power to detect those differences (80%), and level of significanc e (α=0.05) As the  
intervention was randomized at the cluster level ( 30 clusters) rather than the individual level, cluster 
effects were considered for sample size calculations .  
For the sample size for pregnant women, we used the number of food groups from the  A&T Phase 1 
endline survey for SNNPR (mean: 3.0 4, SD: 1. 39, categ orized as 9 food groups; Arimond  et al ., 2010), 
assuming an intra -cluster correlation (ICC) of 0. 21. We calculated that a sample of [ADDRESS_876601] a minimum of 0. 75 food group consumption increase . Using baseline 
data, we observed a mean food group consumption of 3.50 (SD: 1.49)  out of [ADDRESS_876602] a minimum difference of 0.6 1 food 
groups.  
For the sample size for recently delivered women, we used the number of IFA tablets consumed from 
the DHS 2016 data for SNNPR (mean: 33.19, SD: 30.36), assuming an ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_876603] a difference of 13 tablets 
consumed. For the proportion of women who consumed 90+ IFA tablets , we calculated that a sample of 
[ADDRESS_876604] a minimum of 1 5% increase in women  consuming 
90+ IFA tablets. At baseline , an error in the final Computer -Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) form for 
recently delivered women  led to missing data values for the outcome variable on total IFA tablets  
consumed . We instead used t he percentage of recently delivered women at baseline who ever 
consumed IFA tablets (84.3 %) and assumed an ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_876605] a 12.3% increase in women who ever consumed IFA tablets.  If husbands of recently delivered 
women are present at the time of the endline survey, they will also be interviewed briefly about their 
exposure to interventions, health and nutrition kn owledge and any support provided during pregnancy.  
13 Nurse -midwi ves and HEWs providing ANC in the study areas will also be included in both baseline and 
endline surveys. Three kebeles/h ealth posts (where HEWs fall under the supervision of corresponding 
healt h centers ) will be sampled per health center catchment area. Government guidelines advise that 
pregnant women should receive their first and last ANC visits at the health center, and other ANC visits 
may be provided at health posts.  Direct observations of ANC visits (two per health center and one per 
health post) to assess service quality, followed by [CONTACT_653145], will be 
conducted at endline among a subgroup of pregnant women attending ANC at the time of the survey.  
At bas eline, a light data collection at all facility levels (health centers and health posts) and subsamples 
of pregnant and recently delivered women will be conducted to assess comparability between study 
arms. At endline, the full samples of pregnant and recen tly delivered women will be surveyed.  
Thus, the overall study samples sizes are presented in Table 3 .

Total ( excluding  facility assessment)  [ADDRESS_876608] 3 kebeles per cluster 
(health center catchment area) to recruit 2 pregnant women per kebele at baseline (6 at endline) and 4 
recently delivered women  from each kebele at baseline  (21 at endline)  (to balance achieving a 
geographical spread across the cluster with logistical feasibility) . Program monitoring data indicate that 
achieving the sufficie nt endline sample sizes of  pregnant and  recently delivered women from 3 kebeles  
per cluster  may be difficult. If the required sample size s cannot be reached from the 3 kebeles alone , 10 
recently delivered women will be sampled from each kebele and 3 3 will be sampled from each health 
center catchment area  and any additional pregnant women needed to reach the sample size can be 
taken from the health center catchment area . Pregnant women will be asked whether they currently 
attend ANC at the selected governmen t health center and/or health post . Recently delivered women 
will be asked whether they attended any ANC at the selected government health center and/or health 
post during pregnancy . From the two separate lists (for pregnant women and for recently delivere d 
women), women will be randomly selected by [CONTACT_653146] .  
14 III. Methods: Assignment of Interventions  
3.1 Allocation  
A cluster is defined as the health center catchment area. F our woredas  in SNNPR (with 18 health centers  
and 2 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] ) and two  woredas  in Somali region  (with 10 health centers ) were selected as  
intervention areas  (see Figure 3). The samples across the two regions will be pooled to estimate effects 
at program level . We will use strat ified randomization to try to balance potential co -interventions and 
confounders. Where there are odd numbers of health centers with in woredas , the remaining health 
centers will be  randomized  within the same region. Then , 15 clusters will be  allocated to the 
intervention arm and 1 5 clusters w ill be  allocated to the control arm by [CONTACT_653147] -random numbers .  
3.2 Blinding (masking)   
This evaluation study will be unblinded. Women in the intervention areas will not be infor med about the 
results of the randomization. However, there will be no blinding of the interventions at the level of 
service delivery.

4.2 COVID -19 precautionary measures  
Since early 2020, close -range contacts between enumerators and study participants during data 
collection activities present a particular risk for spreading COVID -19 in communities with vulnerable 
populations. The collaborating survey firm, Addis Continenta l Institute of Public Health (ACIPH), has 
developed formal fieldwork guidelines based on directives for the prevention and control of the COVID -
19 pandemic by [CONTACT_373790] (MOH) and Ethiopi[INVESTIGATOR_653132], and UNICEF 
recommendations fo r surveilling and monitoring nutrition in the context of COVID -19. As part of the 
guidelines, all enumerators and study participants will wear masks (provided to them) and wash or 
sanitize their hands before and after each interview. Interviews will be con ducted outside or in a well -
ventilated space and enumerators will maintain two meters of distance from the interviewee and other 
household members. Measuring boards and scales will be sanitized after every anthropometric 
measurement. Any study staff with C OVID -19-related symptoms (fever, dry cough, extreme fatigue, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780],  or any unusual illness) will be immediately excluded from fieldwork and remain 
isolated as per MOH guidelines. Any study participants with COVID -19-related symptoms will be 
excluded from the study and advised to remain isolated and seek appropriate services according to 
MOH and any local guidelines.  
Before enumerator training begins, all study staff will be tested for COVID -19. Any individual who tests 
positive will be advis ed to isolate and seek appropriate health services as described above. Study staff 
will also be assessed for COVID -19-related symptoms before each day of enumerator training begins . 
While in the field, f ield supervisors will assess enumerators each day bef ore starting data collection  
using a COVID -[ADDRESS_876623] with ACIPH and in -country partners during data collection to assess the changing 
risks and governme nt measures.  
4.3 Data management  
A secure data file structure will be established in an IFPRI -server -based Dropbox Professional folder for 
use by [CONTACT_653148] . Original, sensitive (non -anonymized) data 
files and documents will be stored in a folder with access restricted to senior IFPRI  researchers. A do file 
[ADDRESS_876624] team members . 
All changes to the raw data output files from the CAPI [INVESTIGATOR_653133] . Formatting, reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and labeling of data will be documented  using detailed and w ell-annotated do files.  
4.4 Statistical methods  
Data  analysis will us e econometric analysis to control for (any) differences at baseline and between 
intervention and comparison groups  for all relevant variables of interest. Statistical testing for 
differen ces between the two groups will be done using a random effects regression, account ing for the 
clustering of errors within and across health center  catchment areas.  
The randomized study design allows for the identification of causal effects of the maternal nutrition 
intervention through comparisons of mean outcomes between the treatment and control groups.  Key 
indicators will include dietary diversity (among pregnant women), IFA consumption, weight gain 
monitoring, and breastfeeding practice s (early initiati on and exclusive breastfeeding). Impact s will be 
assessed using “difference -in-difference” (DID) estimation  and/or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
controlling for covariates . Data management, data cleaning and statistical analyses will be conducted  
using S tata version 1 6 (Statacorp, [LOCATION_003]). The statistical significance for tests will be set at 5% for main 
effects or 10% in case of interactions. All statistical tests will be one-sided.  
V. Methods: Monitoring  
5.1 Data monitoring  
Data collection (including observational, women, and health worker data collection) will be undertaken 
using electronic tablets. Checks will be built into the CAPI  [INVESTIGATOR_653134] . 
These will include  logic checks, valid values, skip patterns , and range checks  among others to ensure 
efficiency and high data quality. In addition, enumerator monitoring will be incorporated into the CAPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_653135] . 
Field supervisors , project manager, and principal and co -principal investigators of the survey firm and 
IFPRI will closely monitor enumerators and the quality of data collected to ensure the integrity of the 
data during data collection.  
5.[ADDRESS_876625] s (IRB) of FHI 360 and the International Food Policy Research 
Institute in Washington, DC.  In Ethiopia, ethical clearance will be sought  from the ACIPH IRB . 
A COVID -19 country risk assessment system was developed by [CONTACT_653149]’s IRB 
assess COVID -19 risk in countries where fieldwork is planned. In function of the level of COVID -19 risk 
identified in country, data collection methods will be adapted to minimize the transmission risk of 
COVID -19. Justification for resuming fieldwork with in-person contacts will be provided and accepted by 
[CONTACT_1201].  
6.2 Protocol amendments  
All amendments to the protocol will be reported (by [CONTACT_653150] -Principal Investigators  and ACIPH Co -
Investigator ) to and agreed upon with Alive & Thrive. Substantive changes to the protocol  that may 
impact the safety of participants or the scientific validity, scope, or ethical rigor of the study will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_653151].   
Version control using protocol versi on identifiers and dates will be used to track the history of 
amendments and identify the most recent protocol version.  
6.3 Consent or assent  
After explaining the study’s objectives and procedures, enumerators will seek and obtain written 
informed consent from eligible study participants. Participation in the study is completely voluntary. 
Participants are free to withdraw at any time by [CONTACT_653152].  
All COVID -19 transmission risks to study participants (including close contact [CONTACT_554415] d for taking 
anthropometric measurements) and the precautionary measures that will be followed during data 
collection to limit the risk of transmission will be included in the informed consent.  
6.[ADDRESS_876626] access to depersonalized data —located in a separate 
IFPRI -server -based Dropbox Professional folder —where direct identifiers have been replaced  by 
[CONTACT_653153] s. 
Data that is made pub licly available will be carefully screened to remove any indirect and geographic 
identifiers  which may breach the confidentiality of respondents.  
6.[ADDRESS_876627] (based in the US and in Ethiopia) will have full access to 
the cleaned data. Other project team members will have access to data that has had all personally 
identifiable information removed.  
In compliance wit h donor (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) open access policy requirements,  fully 
anonymized datasets will be made publicly available one year after the end of the project. Metadata and 
other documentation of data collection procedures (such as the codebook, data collection instruments 
and interviewer guides/protocols) will also be made publicly available.  
6.[ADDRESS_876628]. The A&T 
Ethiopia team will be working in close partnership with  government entities on strengthening maternal 
health systems at the national and regional levels throughout the duration of the project. Findings will 
be disseminated through in -country events, presentations, and conferences.  
Within the research communit y, we aim to have the research peer -reviewed and published in high 
quality journals. Preliminary research findings may be presented at international conferences and 
internal IFPRI seminars.

baseline pathogen.  An atypi[INVESTIGATOR_904068] a 
baseline pathogen if the baseline sample is collected in the [ADDRESS_1268613] dose of study drug.  
 For vital signs, baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to Day 1.  
 For ECGs, baseline is defined as the mean of the triplicates from the last 
assessment prior to th e first dose of study drug.  
 If no study drug is received, baseline is defined as the measurement taken at the 
Screening Visit  
The visit window for ECR is defined in  Section 6.1 . Clinical efficacy and safety analyses at 
Day 7 (safety only), EOT, TOC and LF U will utilize the data obtained on the scheduled visit 
(ie, nominal visit will be utilized). Safety labs (chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) are 
collected for all subjects at Screening, Day 4, EOT and TOC.  Subjects receiving [ADDRESS_1268614] had an abnormal result at TOC.   For Day 4 safety lab assessments, the 
window is Day  4 ± 1 day. For Day 7 safety lab assessments, the window is Day 7 +[ADDRESS_1268615] infusion on that day.  
See Appendix A for a complete description on the timing of the safety assessments.  
If no scheduled visit was done, but an unscheduled safety assessment was done in the 
window of the scheduled assessment (for the specific safety parameter), the unscheduled  
assessment should be used.  If more than 1 measurement is taken during the visit window 
(a scheduled visit and an unscheduled visit) , the value taken on the scheduled visit will be 
utilized  or if no scheduled visit was done the measurement closest to but a fter the scheduled 
visit will be used .  If more than one unscheduled assessment is completed in the visit 
window of the scheduled assessment (and no scheduled assessment), the earliest 
assessment should be used .  For overall worst post -baseline analyses, all assessments 
including those obtained on unscheduled and scheduled visits will be included.

“susceptible.” If an isolate yields an MIC result other than susceptible it should be retested being sure that the test 
is performed correctly. If the results are other than susceptible on re -test, the isolate will be subject to additional 
testing including investigation  of the molecular resistance mechanism (including check for presence of cfr, 
vga(A), vga(B) and vga(C) and sequencing of 23S rDNA, rplC and rplD ).

 Subjects who are non -responders and receive less than [ADDRESS_1268618] 48 hours total duration of study drug will 
remain classified as a non -responder.   An unadjusted 95% CI will be computed 
using a continuity corrected Z -test for the diffe rence in the ECR responder rates 
between lefamulin and moxifloxacin.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Outcome Measures  
A summary of subjects who met the criteria for ECR responder (ie, alive, improvement in at 
least [ADDRESS_1268619] presented with at baseline, no 
worsening of any of the 4 cardinal symptoms of CABP and did not receive a concomitant 
antibiotic (other than adjunctive linezolid) for the treatment of CABP through the assessment 
of the cardinal symptoms of CABP) will  be provided by [CONTACT_15449]. Analyses of signs and 
symptoms will only be assessed in subjects with non -missing assessments of all baseline signs 
and symptoms at the specified visit  For each study visit, ECR will be determined for (ie, 
the denominator will consist of) those subjects who have died up through the relevant 
assessment, those subjects who have received an antibiotic for the treatment of CABP up 
through the relevant visit and those subjects with non -missing assessments of all baseline 
cardinal CAB P symptoms at the relevant visit. If the EOT Visit and the last day of study 
drug are on the same day and only 1 assessment is performed, the assessment will be 
summarized both at the study day and the EOT Visit.

30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 66 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) provides the framework for the summarization and analysis 
of the clinical data from the study, “A Phase 3, Randomized,  Double -Blind , Double -Dummy  
Study to Compare  the Efficacy and Safety of Lefamulin (BC -3781)  Versus  Moxifloxacin  
(With  or Without Adjunctive Linezolid ) in Adults With  Community -Acquired Bacterial 
Pneumonia .”  Changes made to th is SAP after it has been signed but prior to database lock will 
be documented in an amendment.  Any important changes made to th e analysis after database 
lock will be described in the clinical study report .  Pharmacokinetic  analyses (except for the 
description of plasma concentrations)  and health utilization and patient -reported outcome  
analyses will not be included in this SAP , but will be addressed in separate analysis plans . 
Study  NAB -BC-3781 -3101  has been designed to address both the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) regulatory requirements .  
While the EMA supports the asse ssment of clinical response by  [CONTACT_314661] a Test of Cure 
(TOC) Visit  (which is scheduled to occur 5-[ADDRESS_1268632] dose of study drug ) as the 
primary endpoint, the FDA is using an earlier primary endpoint  (3-[ADDRESS_1268633] dose of 
study drug ) based on improvement in pneumonia symptoms .  
This SAP addresses the primary efficacy outcome and analyses for the FDA. A SAP Addendum 
will be developed to address the different primary efficacy outcome and analyses for the EMA.  
2.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase  3, multicenter, multinational , randomized, double -blind,  double -dummy  
comparative efficacy and safety study of lefamulin (150 mg intravenous  (IV) over 60 minutes 
every 12 hours ( q12h) with an optional switch to oral 600 mg q12h) and moxifloxacin  (400 mg 
IV over 60 minutes every 24 hours ( q24h) with an optional switch to oral 400 mg q24h) in the 
treatment of adult subjects  with community -acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).  If the 
Investigator determines at baseline based on pre -speci fied criteria that methicillin -resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA ) could be the etiological agent of the current CABP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], then 
adjunctive linezolid therapy must be added to the moxifloxacin treatment arm with placebo 
linezolid added to the lefamuli n treatment arm . Subjects  will be permitted to switch from IV to 
oral study drug ( ie, lefamulin or moxifloxacin ± linezolid) after at least 6 doses of IV therapy and 
if clinically appropriate ( ie, there has been improvement in at least 2 of the 3 or 4 cardinal 
symptoms of pneumonia [dyspnea , cough, sputum production, chest pain ] and subjects  are 
hemodynamically  stable,  have a normalizing temperature curve  with a maximum temperature in 
the previous 24 hours of <38.0C (<100.4 F), and are able to swallow  and absorb  oral 
medications [ie, have a normally functioning gastrointestinal tract ]).   
A total of 550  subjects  with CABP will be randomi zed 1:1 to study treatment ( 275 to each 
treatment arm) using interactive response technology (IRT) .  However, if based upon regulatory 
requirements additional subjects exposed to lefamulin are needed, up to 626 subjects may be 
enrolled and randomized.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617]  (US vs . ex-US), 
prior single dose treatment with a  short acting antibiotic vs. none, and by [CONTACT_904110]  (PORT) risk class (PORT III vs. IV/V ).  Enrollment of subjects  receiving prior

30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 66 antibiotic therapy will be c apped at 25%  and enrollment of subjects with a PORT risk class of III 
will be capped at 75% .  An independent Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will perform a blinded 
sample size reassessment when  approximately  60% of subjects  randomized have been  followed 
through the FDA time point ( 96 ± 24 hours)  for the assessment of the primary efficacy outcome.  
After informed consent is obtained, a ll potential study participant s undergo screening 
evaluations, which include s a medical history, clinical assessments, and laboratory assessments .  
It is estimated that the duration of study drug administration for the majority of subjects 
(approximately  90%) will be 7 days  of active treatment . Subjects with CABP due to MRSA will 
receive 10 days of active treatment.  Other treatment scenari os are detailed in the original and 
Amendment 1 protocol s.  An assessment of Early Clinical Response  (ECR)  will occur 96 ± 
[ADDRESS_1268634] dose of study drug.  An Investigator’s Assessment of Clinical Response

separately for each subject .  Baseline pathogens and post -baseline pathogens will be identified.  
Additional details regarding the pathogen review process and determination are included in the 
Evaluability Review P lan. 
Baseline is defined as the [ADDRESS_1268641] dose of study drug . A pathogen identified from a respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]

or oropharyngeal specimen  collected at baseline is considered a baseline pathogen.  An atypi[INVESTIGATOR_904079] a baseline pathogen if the baseline sample is 
collected in the [ADDRESS_1268642] dose of 
study drug.   
If more than 1 specimen is taken during the baseline period, all specimens will be reviewed for 
pathogen identification.  If the same pathogen (based on genus and species)  is identified from 
more than [ADDRESS_1268643] minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) to 
study drug received will be considered the baseline pathogen. If the pathogens have the same 
MIC to study drug received, the one with the high est accession number will be considered the 
baseline pathogen.  
Post-baseline is defined as the period starting [ADDRESS_1268644] -baseline pathogens.

If the genus identification is the same between the local and central microbiology laborator ies 
but the species identification is discrepant, the central laboratory identification will be used.  If 
the local laboratory grows an isolate but the central labo ratory is not able to grow the isolate, if 
isolates were lost during transportation or storage, or there are major discrepancies between the 
local and central laboratory in the identification of species, the central laboratory will request the 
local labora tory to resend the isolate.  If the central laboratory identification is not available for 
an isolate, the local laboratory identification  will be used.  It is possible for subject s to have 
different isolates from both central and local  laboratories as a re sult.  For any remaining major 
discrepancies in genus and/or species identification between the central and local laboratory, the 
central laboratory identification will be used as the default identification.

 LFU – between S tudy Day 27 and 34 (inclusive) . NOTE:  To address an inconsistency in 
the study protocol regarding the timing of the LFU Visit (ie, 30 ± [ADDRESS_1268656] 
dose of study drug vs. Day 30 ± 3 days ), the LFU Visit window comprises  the cumulative  
range of possible study days.  
For the EOT, TOC and LFU  assessments, subjects  will be assigned a n IACR  (success, failure, or 
indeterminate  at EOT and TOC, sustained success , relapse , prior failure or indeterminate at 
LFU ).  Early Clinical Response will be determined programmatically b ased on recorded 
symptom assessments that compare  the assessments at Baseline and at 96 ± [ADDRESS_1268657] 's overall response to therapy . 
Microbiologic responses will be determined programmatically at EOT, T OC and LFU .   
6.1 Primary Efficacy Outcome: Early Clinical Response  
The primary efficacy outcome is the percentage of subjects with an ECR of responder  at 
96 ± [ADDRESS_1268658] dose of study drug in the ITT Analysis Set .  Symptom definitions  for 
the assessment are shown in Table  2. Subjects  will be programmatically defined as a responder  
if the following 4 criteria are met:  
 Alive ; 
 Improve ment in at least [ADDRESS_1268659] 1 level of severity ;  
 No worsening of any of the [ADDRESS_1268660] 1 level of severity for any symptom;   
 Did not receive a concomitant antibiotic  (other than adjunctive linezolid  for subjects

 Did not show an improvement in at least [ADDRESS_1268661] 
1 level of severity ; or 
 Worsening of any of the [ADDRESS_1268662] 1 level of severity for any symptom; or

Subjects will be programmatically defined as a responder  if the following 5 criteria are met:  
 Alive ; 
 Improvement in at least [ADDRESS_1268668] 1 level of severity;  
 No worsening of any of the [ADDRESS_1268669] 1 level of severity for any symptom;  
 Improvement in vital signs ( ie, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862]), if abnormal at baseline.  Improvement is defined as returning to normal.  If vital

Subjects will be programmatically defined as a non-responder  if any of the following are met:  
 Did not show an improvement in at least [ADDRESS_1268670] 1 
level of severity; or  
 Worsening of any of the [ADDRESS_1268671] 1 level of severity for any symptom; or

vital signs is based on the ITT Analysis Set , subjects  with an indeterminate response are 
essentially considered non -respo nders.  For the ITT Analysis Set , the percentage  of ITT subjects

6.2.4  By-Pathogen Microbiological Response  
By-pathogen microbiological responses  are eradication , presumed eradication , persistence, 
presumed persistence and indeterminate , as defined in  Table  5.  Microbiological responses of 
eradication and persistence are based on comparing the baseline pathogen(s) to post -baseline 
pathogens, where post -baseline organisms  are identified from post-baseline cultures  and 
considered pathogens based on the criteria in Section 4.0.  If a pathogen is persistent at  the EOT  
Visit , the persistence is carried forward to the TOC and LFU Visit s.  If a pathogen is presumed 
persistent at the EOT  Visit , the presumed persistence is carried forward to the TOC and LFU 
Visits, unless a repeat culture is obtained between  the EOT and TOC  or EOT  and LFU Visits, 
respectively,  which shows persistence.  Baseline p athogens identified by a modality other than 
culture of a  blood or respi[INVESTIGATOR_152922] (i e, pathogen from serology, urine antigen or PCR ) can 
only have a presumed or indeterminate microbiological response.   
Table  5. By-Pathogen Microbiological Response at EOT , TOC  and LFU  
Outcome  EOT TOC and LFU  
Success  Eradication  The baseline causative pathogen was absent from 
repeat culture(s)  obtained at EOT  (ie, the post -
baseline culture showed no growth or the post -
baseline culture did not grow the same pathogen 
as isolated at baseline , or the same organism (s) 
was present but did not meet the definition of 
pathogen as defined in Section 4.0).  The baseline causative pathogen was absent from 
repeat culture(s)  obtained between EOT and TOC 
or EOT and LFU , respectively  (ie, the post -baseline 
culture showed no growth or the post -baseline 
culture did not grow the same pathogen as isolated 
at baseline , or the same organism (s) was present 
but did not meet the definition of pat hogen as 
defined in Section 4.0). 
Presumed 
eradication  The IACR was success and culture  was not 
repeated  at EOT . The IACR was success  (TOC) or sustained success 
(LFU) and culture  was not repeated  (at TOC and 
LFU, respectively) . 
Failure  Persistence  The baseline causative pathogen  was isolated in 
repeat culture (s) obtained at EOT.  Persistence at EOT  is carried forward  or a culture 
obtained after EOT and up to and including TOC 
grew the same pathogen identified at baseline 
(TOC).  Persistence at TOC  is carried forward  or a 
culture obta ined after TOC and up to an inc luding 
LFU grew the same pathogen identified at baselin e 
(LFU).  
Presumed 
persistence  The IACR was failure and culture was not 
repeated  at EOT . The IACR was failure (TOC) or prior 
failure/relapse (LFU) and culture was not repeated  
(at TOC and LFU, respectively) and no cultures 
demonstrated persistence (between EOT and TOC 
and EOT and LFU, respectively) .  
Indeterminate  The IACR was indeterminate and culture was  not 
repeated  at EOT . The IACR was indeterminate and culture was not 
repeated  (at TOC and LFU, respectively) and no 
cultures demonstrated persistence (between EOT 
and TOC and EOT and LFU, respectively).

success rate is calculated as follows:   
Number of subjects who are  a success for the specific pathogen  
(Number of subjects  who are  a success  for the specific patho gen + Number of subjects  who are  
a failure  for the specific pathogen ) 
Subjects who have the same pathogen isolated at baseline from more than [ADDRESS_1268674] has the same baseline pathogen identified from culture of blood and a

The outcome measure of all -cause mortality (ACM) is defined as deceased on or before Study 
Day 28.  
Subjects with an LFU visit on Study Day [ADDRESS_1268675] died on Study Day 28.  Other s ubjects who are not known to be alive or deceased 
as of Study Day  28 will be defined as deceased and included in the numerator and denominator 
for the calculation of the ACM rate.  The 28 -day ACM rate is defined by [CONTACT_51632]:  
Number of subjects deceased

Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_904130]  (chemistry and 
hematology) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters , and vital signs . Laboratory abnormalities  are 
not considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or require 
medical intervention.  Clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory findings or other 
abnormal asses sments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_904131]'s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
6.7 Additional Exploratory Outcomes  
Exploratory evaluation of a variety of heal th utilization variables  (eg, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
discharge status and discharge destination ) and a patient -reported outcome instrument (SF -12) 
will be performed.  Deta ils of this exploratory analysis will be presented in a separate SAP and 
results will be presented in a separate report .

However, if based upon regulatory requirements additional subjects exposed to lefamulin are 
needed, up to 626 subjects may be enrolled.  The total number of subjects included in this study 
is sufficient to achieve the primary and  secondary study objectives  based on statistical 
considerations.

30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 66 Retrospective analyses of clinical study data for patients with CABP of varying severity indicate 
the point estimates for an ECR responder at Day s 3-5 range from 72% -81% (FDA, 2011 ).  Thus, 
it is reasonable to assume that in a prospective study of subjects with CABP, the percentage  of 
subjects who are responders for ECR at 96 ± [ADDRESS_1268681] dose of study drug will be 
approximately 79%.   
The primary efficacy analysis variables used for NI analyses for the Marketing Authorization 
Application to the EMA will be the percentage  of subject s with an IACR of S uccess at TOC in 
the mITT and CE -TOC Analysis Sets.  In recent clinical studies , IACR success rates at the TOC 
Visit in the CE Analysis Set ranged from 77% -87% depending on the antibiotics under study and 
the severity of the  CABP.  The IACR  success rate for subject s receiving moxifloxacin is 86% as 
reported in the prescribing informati on (AVELOX® [moxifloxacin] PI, 2013 ).  Based on these 
data, an 85% I ACR success rate in the  CE-TOC  Analysis Set was chosen for determination of the 
sample size.  The success rate is expected to be about 5% lower in the mITT A nalysis Set. It is 
expected that <1% of subjects will be excluded from the mITT Analysis Set and thus, the sample 
size determination assumes the same number of subjects in the ITT and mITT Analysis Sets.  
Utilizing an anticipated ECR responder rate of 79% in the ITT Analysis Set, and a 1-sided alpha 
of 0.025, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1268682] s (275 in  each treatment group)  provides >90% power to 
establish  the NI of lefamulin  to moxifloxacin  for ECR  using a  NI margin of 1 2.5%.  Assuming 
an IACR success of 80% and 85% in the mITT and CE -TOC Analysis Sets, respectively, and a 
clinical  evaluability rate of 80%, there is 80% power for demonstration  of NI for IACR at  the 
TOC Visit using a 10% NI margin.   If the sample size is increas ed to 626 subjects, it will provide

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum), blood for culture, urine, nasopharyngeal or 
oropharyngeal specimen collected at baseline is considere d a baseline pathogen.  An 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_904068] a baseline pathogen if the baseline 
sample is collected in the [ADDRESS_1268685] dose of study drug.  
 For vital sig ns, baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to Day 1 . 
 For ECGs, b aseline is defined as the mean of the triplicates from the last assessment prior 
to the first dose of study drug.  
 If no study drug is received, baseline is defined as the measurement  taken at the 
Screening Visit  
Study Day [ADDRESS_1268686] dose of study drug is Study Day -1; the re is no Study Day 0.  
For all clinical assessments and procedures perfo rmed prior to the date of the first study drug 
administration, study day will be calculated as the date of the assessment minus the date of the 
first dose of study drug. For all clinical assessments and procedures performed on or after the 
date of the firs t dose of study drug, study day will be calculated as the date of the assessment 
minus the date of the first dose of study drug, plus 1.  
The visit window for ECR  is defined in Section 6.1. Clinical e fficacy and safety analyses will 
utilize the data obtained on the scheduled visit  (ie, nominal visit will be utilized) . Safety labs 
(chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) are collected for all subjects at Screening, Day 4, EOT 
and TOC.  Subjects receiving [ADDRESS_1268687] ha d an abnormal result at TOC.  For Day 4 
safety lab assessments, the window is Day  4 ± 1 day.  For Day 7 safety lab assessments, the 
window is Day 7 +[ADDRESS_1268688] infusion on that day.  See 
Appendix A  for a complete description on the timing of the safety assessments.  
If no scheduled visit was done, but an unscheduled safety assessment was done in the window of 
the scheduled assessment (for the specific safety parameter), the unscheduled assessment should 
be used. If more than 1 measurement is taken during the visit window  (a scheduled visit and an 
unscheduled visit) , the value taken on the scheduled visit will be utilized .  If more than one 
unscheduled assessment is completed in the visit window of the scheduled assessment (and no 
scheduled assessmen t), the earliest assessment should be used.  For overall worst post -baseline 
analyses, all assessments including those obtained on unscheduled and scheduled visits will be 
included.   
7.3 Randomization  
Subjects  will be assigned to receive lefamulin  or moxifloxacin in a 1:1  ratio with stratification by 
[CONTACT_1617]  (US vs. ex -US), receipt of prior single dose short -acting antibiotic therapy for 
CABP vs. none , and PORT risk class (II I vs. IV/V ) using blocked randomization via the IRT .  
Nabriva Therapeutics AG  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol NAB -BC-3781 -3101  
30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 66 The random ization s chedule will be gene rated by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee).   Subjects  
randomized into the study will be assigned  the treatment corresponding to the next available 
number in the respective stratum of the computer -generated  randomization schedule.  The 
subject  will only be randomized after the inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified.  
The Sponsor designee ( ie, IRT vendor ) will maintain the randomization codes in accordance with 
standard operating procedures to ensure the blind is properly maintained , and that only Sponsor 
personnel who require knowledge of treatment assignments will be unblinded ( eg, staff involved 
in maintaining the clinical supplies  or SAE reporting).   After the database is locked and the SAP 
is final, the study blind codes will be  broken.  
7.4 Interim Analysis  
In order to ensure that the point estimate of the ECR responder rate used in the estimate of the 
sample size is valid for this study, an interim analysis for sample size re -estimation will be 
performed when ECR data at 96 ± [ADDRESS_1268689] dose are available for approximately 60% 
of the randomized subjects .  The FDA Guidance “Non -inferiority Clinical Trials  to Establish 
Effectiveness ” notes that such a sample size re -estimation  if based on the blinded overall 
response rate is n ot only acceptable but is advisable  (FDA, 2016 ).  The interim analysis will 
involve a sample re -estimation to either confirm  that the initial sample size estimate is adequate 
or increase the sample size (number of randomized subjects) to ensure the study has adequate 
power for determining whether lefamulin is NI to moxifloxacin for the primary outcome 
measure.  The sample size re -estimat ion will be based on the blinded overall (not b y treatment 
group) ECR responder rate and will be conducted by [CONTACT_904132], blinded statistician.  An 
Independent Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will be provided the results of the interim 
analysis by [CONTACT_64741], blinded statistician and will make a recommendation regarding any 
increase to the sample size.   A detailed IAC charter will be developed which outlines the 
analyses to be completed, statistical rules, the potential increase  to the sample size , and the 
recommendations that can be made to the Sponsor. The members of the IAC will n ot participate 
in the ongoing assessment of the important aspects of study conduct, including the assessment of 
safety data.  
In addition,  an independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) will be constituted for this study 
to monitor important aspects of stud y conduct, including safet y results on an ongoing basis.  The 
DMC will receive masked  data (treatment “A” vs. treatment “B”) at pre -specified time points for 
their review of safety data throughout the conduct of the trial. DMC meeting frequency and 
conduct  will be outlined in a separate DMC Charter. An independent , unblinded statistician will 
provide the committee with masked  data for review, but will not be a member of the 
committee.   In addition, a clinical representative from the Sponsor will be availabl e during an 
open session of each meeting to help answer questions or relay additional information to the 
DMC as needed, but this individual will not be a voting member of the committee. All members 
of the DMC will treat study data, reports, meeting discuss ions, and conclusions as confidential. 
The members of the DMC will not participate in the interim analysis and re -assessment of the 
sample size for this trial.

 All clinical data will be provided in by -subject  listings.  
 Continuous variables will be summarized using number (N), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum.   
 Frequency counts and percentages will be reported for all categorical data.  
 If a laboratory result (other than  an MIC value) is reported relative to a lower/upper range 
of detection for an assay,  for example, “<10”,  the numeric portion of the result (10) will 
be used for statistical analyses and the full result, including any symbols, will be provided 
in the subject  listings.  
 For AEs with onset on or after the first dose of study drug , onset day  will be calculated as 
the date of onset of the AE minus the date of the first dose of study drug , plus 1. For AEs 
with onset prior to the first dose of study drug, onset day will be calcula ted as the date of 
onset of the AE minus the date of the first dose of study drug . 
 For prior medications, st art day will be calculated as the start date of the medication 
minus the date of the first dose of study drug . For concomitant medications and prior  
medications taken on the same day as the first dose of study drug , start day will be 
calculated as the start date of the medication minus the date of the first dose of study 
drug, plus 1.  
 Version 9. 2 (or higher) of SAS statistical software package will b e used to provide all 
summaries, listings, figures and statistical analyses.  
7.6 Handling of Missing Data  
For ECR, missing data will be handled as follows:  
 If any component of ECR is missing  in the time fram e detailed in Section 6.1 (unless the 
subject  dies or is deemed a failure prior to this time point) , or if the subject  does not have 
at least 2 symptoms of CABP at baseline, ECR will be defined as an indeterminate.  
 If the time of an assessment of CABP symptoms obtained in the window for 
determination of ECR is missing but the date of the ECR assessment is known, the time 
will be imputed to noon on the date of the CABP symptom assessment.  
 Missing start and stop times of antibiotics will be set to 00:00  on the start and stop date of 
the antibiotic.  
 For the analysis of ECR in the ITT Analysis Set , where ECR may be missing 
(indeterminate ), all subjects  in the ITT Analysis Set  will b e included in the denominator. 
Thus, subjects with an indeterminate response are essentially considered as a failure.  
Nabriva Therapeutics AG  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol NAB -BC-3781 -3101  
30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 66 For IACR , missing data will be handled as follows:  
 A missin g IACR  at the EOT Visit  will be considered indeterminate  at the EOT Visit . 
 A missi ng IACR at the TOC Visit  will be considered indeterminate unless the IACR at 
the EOT  Visit  is failure.  An IACR  of failure at the EOT Visit  will be carried forward to 
the TOC Visit .  
 A missing IACR at the LFU Visit  will be considered indetermi nate unless the IACR at 
the TOC Visit  is failure. An IACR of failure at the TOC Visit  will be carried forward to 
the LFU Visit . 
 For the analysis of IACR  at the EOT , TOC  and LFU Visits  in the mITT , microITT , 
microITT -2 and emicroITT  Analysis Sets , where Clinical Response  may be missing 
(indeterminate), all subjects  who meet the analysis set criteria will be included in the 
denominator.  
 For the analysis of IACR at the EOT , TOC  and LFU  Visits  in the CE  and ME  Analysis 
Sets, subjects  with a missing (indeterminate) IACR  will not be included in the analyses, 
since by [CONTACT_108], subjects  in the CE or ME Analysis Sets cannot have a missing IACR . 
For microbiological response , missing data will be handled as follows:  
 A missing microbiological response  at the EOT Visit  will be pres umed from the IACR at 
the EOT  Visit .  
 A by-pathogen microbiological response  of persistence and a by-subject microbiological 
response  of failure at the EOT Visit  will be carried forward to the TOC Visit . A missing 
microbiological response  at the TOC  Visit  will be presumed from the IACR at the TOC  
Visit . If the IACR  at the TOC  Visit  is missing, the  microbiological response  at the TOC  
Visit  will be indeterminate.  
 A by-pathogen microbiological response  of persistence and a by-subject microbiological 
response  of failure at the TOC Visit  will be carried forward to the LFU Visit . A missing 
microbiological response  at the LFU  Visit  will be presumed from the IACR at the LFU 
Visit . If the IACR at the LFU Visit  is missing, the microbiological response  at the LFU  
Visit will be indeterminate.  
 For the analysis of microbiological response  at the EOT , TOC  and LFU  Visits  in the 
microITT and microITT -2 Analysis Set s, where microbiological response  may be 
missing (indeterminate), all subjects  who meet the analysis set c riteria will be included in 
the denominator.  
 For the analysis of microbiological response  at the EOT , TOC  and LFU Visits  in the 
ME Analysis Set s, subjects  with a missing (indeterminate) microbiological response  will 
not be included in the analysis, since by [CONTACT_108] , subjects  in the ME Analysis Sets  
cannot have a missing microbiological response .

30 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 66 For all other outcome measures, missing data are handled as follows:  
 Missing values for individual data points will remain as missing. Missing values will not 
be imputed and only observed values will be used in data analyses and presentations.  
 When individual data points are missing, categorical data will be summarized based on 
reduced denominators ( ie, only subjects  with available data will be included in the 
denominators).

8.4.2  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
The World Health Organization (WHO) dr ug dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications, including antibacterial  medication s, by [CONTACT_18671].   A prior 
medication is defined as any medication taken prior to the date and time of the first dose of study 
drug.  For non -antibacterials (for which only start and stop dates [not times] are collected ), any 
medication taken on or after the date of first d ose of study drug will be considered concomitant; 
medications stop dates occurring prior to the date of first dose of study drug will be considered 
prior medications.  A concomitant medication is d efined as any medication taken on or after the 
date and time  of the first dose of study drug. If the start date of a medication is missing, the 
medication will be assumed to be both prior and concomitant, unless the end date of the 
medication clearly indicates the medication was stopped prior to the first dose of s tudy drug.  If 
the start date is a partial date such that it cannot be determined if the medication is prior or 
concomitant, the medication will be assumed to be both prior and concomitant, unless the end 
date of the medication clearly indicates the medicat ion stopped prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  
For antibacterials, m issing start and stop times will be set to 00:00  on the start and stop date of 
the antibiotic.   
Prior systemic antibacterial medications and concomitant systemic antibacterial medicati ons will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_6977] ( ATC ) level 4 and preferred term 
separately by [CONTACT_904145] , mITT and CE -TOC  Analysis Set s. Subjects  receiving 
the same medication more than once will be  counted only once for a parti cular ATC level  and 
preferred term .  Prior systemic antibacterial medications will be summarized based on receipt 
within 72 hours prior to randomizat ion and receipt more than 72 hours  prior to randomization.  
Additional tables (ITT  and CE -TOC Analysis Set s) will summarize the percent of subjects 
receiving any prior systemic antibacterial medication, the percent of subjects receiving an 
antibacterial medication in the 72 hours prior to randomization, the percent receiving the 
antibacterial for the current ep isode of CABP, the percent receiving a single dose of a short -
acting oral or IV antibacterial for CABP  (per the eCRF), the percent receiving more than 1 dose 
of a short -acting antibacterial for CABP or ≥1 dose of  a long -acting antibacterial for CABP, the 
percentage of subje cts receiving >48 hours of prior  systemic antibacterial therapy for the current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_904099] a treatment failure (ie, the exception to exclusion criterion 1) , the 
percentage of subjects receiving a prior systemic antibacter ial for an infection not related to 
CABP and the percentage of subjects receiving a prior systemic antibacterial for an “other” 
reason.  
Nabriva Therapeutics AG  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol NAB -BC-[ADDRESS_1268694] listing and 
concomitant non -antib acterial  medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_904146] 4, preferred term 
and treatment group for the ITT Analysis Set .  Subjects  receiving the same medication more than 
once will be  counted only once for a particular ATC level  and preferred term .  
The reasons for receipt of concomitant systemic antibacterial medications will be summarized  by 
[CONTACT_904147] , mITT and CE -TOC Analysis Set s.  For concomitant systemic 
antibacterial medication s, the number and percentage of subjects excluded fro m the CE Analysis 
Sets due to receipt of an antibacterial and not excluded from the CE Analysis Sets will be 
summarized.  The reasons for receipt of the antibacterial will be provided for each category 
(excluded and not excluded from the CE Analysis Sets) and include current CABP prior to 
randomization, infection prior to randomization not related to CABP, concomitant infection 
unrelated to CABP, insufficient therapeutic effect of study drug  (only for not excluded from the 
CE Analysis Set s), treatment -limit ing AE resulting in study drug  discontinuation  (only for not 
excluded from the CE Analysis Sets) , and “other .” 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1268695] ’s compliance with study drug treatment will be calculated based on the  number of 
doses the subject  would have been expected to receive based on the baseline pathogen(s) 
identified  and the version of the protocol a subject was enrolled under . Treatment compliance is 
defined as the number of doses actually received divided by [CONTACT_904148] × 100 . Compliance includes active drug plus placebo with or without 
linezolid/linezolid placebo.  Descriptive statistics (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, median, and maximum) of compliance for IV and oral, and for IV and oral separately 
will be presented for the mITT  and CE -TOC  Analysis Sets .  
8.5 Efficacy Analyses  
For all efficacy analyses, subjects  will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.  
By [CONTACT_108], subje cts who receive the wrong study drug are not included in the CE  and 
ME Analysis Sets .  Unless otherwise stated, subjects  who are randomized to the wrong 
geographic region, prior antibiotic , or PORT risk class stratum will be analyzed in the stratum to 
whic h they were randomized.  
8.5.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy outcome is the percentage of subjects with an  ECR of responder at 96 ± 
[ADDRESS_1268696] to follow up are defined as indeterminate 
for the primary analysis and are included in the denominator for the calculation of the response 
rate. Thus, subjects  with an indeterminate outcome are considered non -responders f or the 
primary analysis. The number and percentage of subjects  in each treatment group in each 
response category (and combined non -responder/indeterminate) will be reported.

H0: P1-P2 ≤- ∆ 
H1: P1-P2 >- ∆ 
Where P 1 = the primary efficacy outcome rate in the lefamulin  group  
P2 = the primary efficacy outcome rate in the moxifloxacin group  
∆ = the non -inferiority margin  
The NI hypothesis test is a [ADDRESS_1268697] performed at the 2.5% level of significance. 
This is based on the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed 
difference in the early clinical response rate ( lefamulin  group minus the moxifloxacin group). 
The CI will be calculated using an unadjusted continuity corrected Z -test. If the lower limit of 
the 95% CI for the difference in resp onder rates in the ITT Analysis Set  is greater than -12.5%, 
the null hypothesis will be rejected and the NI of lefamulin  to moxifloxacin will be concluded.  
The reasons for an ECR of non -respond er and indeterminate  will be summarized by [CONTACT_904149] a re a non -responder  or indeterminate at 96 ± [ADDRESS_1268698] 
dose of study drug.   Reasons for non -responder are: did not show improvement in at least [ADDRESS_1268699] 1 symptom of CABP, received a 
concomitant antibacterial and died from any cause. Reasons for indeterminate are: no assessment 
of symptoms and did not have at least 2 cardinal symptoms at baseline.  
8.5.2  Additional Analyse s of the Primary Efficacy Outcome  
Early Clinical Response will be assessed separately across the randomization stratification 
factors (from the IRT) of geographic regions  (US vs . ex-US), prior antibiotic use vs. none, and 
PORT risk class (III vs. IV/V) . For each geographic region, prior antibiotic use,  and PORT risk 
class stratum  a 2-sided 95% CI for the observed difference in  ECR responder  rates will be 
calculated for the ITT Analysis Set .  
Sensitivity analyses of early clinical response include:  
 An analys is adjusted for the stratification factors of geographic region, prior antibiotic 
use and PORT risk class stratum (based on the randomization stratum the subject  was 
actually randomized to).  A 95% CI using the method proposed with stratification by 
[CONTACT_904150] .  Cochran -Mantel -Haen szel weights will be used for 
the stratum weights in the calculation of the CI . 
 An analysis adjusted for the stratificat ion factors of geographic region, prior antibiotic 
use, and PORT risk class stratum based on the randomization stratum the subject  
correctly belongs to.  A 95% CI using the method proposed with stratification by 
[CONTACT_904151].  Cochran -Mantel -Haens zel weights will be used for 
the stratum weights in the  calculation of the CI.

are considered ECR non-responders in the primary anal ysis).  An unadjusted 95% CI will 
be computed using a continuity corrected Z -test for the difference in the ECR respon der 
rates between lefamulin  and moxifloxacin.  
 Subjects who are non -responders and receive less than [ADDRESS_1268701] 48 hours total duration of study drug will remain classified  as a

Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy outcome , including treatment differe nces and 95% 
CIs (computed using a continuity corrected Z -test), will al so be conducted for descriptive 
purposes.  These include but are not limited to PORT Risk Class per the eCRF (III, IV, V), prior

Adverse events will be coded using Version 18.0 or higher  of MedDRA. A treatment -emergent 
AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE that starts or worsens at or during the time of or after the first 
study drug administrat ion. If the AE start date is unkno wn or is a partial date such that it cannot 
be determined if the AE st arted on or after the first study drug administration, it will be 
categorized as a TEAE.  
An overall summary of AEs will include the number and percentage of subjects who experienced 
at least 1 AE of the following categories: any AE, any TEAE, any serious T EAE, any treatment -
related TEAE, any treatment -related serious TEAE, any TEAE leading to premature 
discontinuation of study drug, any TEAE leading to premature discontinuation from the study, 
and any TEAE leading to death.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting a TEAE  and the number and percentage of 
subjects  reporting a treatment -related TEAE (related defined as possibly, probably or definitely 
related to study drug ) in each treatment group will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term, and severity (mild, moderate, and severe ).  A summary of TEAE s and treatment -related 
TEAE s sorted by [CONTACT_904168].  Likewise, the number and percentage of subjects  reporting a serious TEAE  and the 
number and percentage of subjects reporting a TEAE leading  to premature discontinuation of 
study drug in each treatment group will be tabulated separately by [CONTACT_904169] .  For all analyses of TEAE s, if the same AE (based on preferred term) is reported 
for the same subject  more than once, the AE is counted only once for that preferred term and at 
the highest severity and strongest relationship to study drug.  
A listing of TEAE s leading to discontinu ation of study drug will be provided and will include 
subject  ID, subject age, sex and race, onset day  of the AE, duration of AE in days, duration of

Hy’s law is reported based  on local laboratory results, and 3) the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_904100].  
Laboratory values will  be defined as potentially clinically significant  (PCS)  according to the 
table in Appendix B. To be considered PCS, the laboratory value must meet both the lower limit 
and the percent decrease from baseline or both the upper limit and the percent increase from 
baseline.  The proportion  of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set with at least [ADDRESS_1268714] -baseline value  
(minimum and maxim um value, where appropriate  defined in Appendix C ). Percentages for each 
laboratory test will be based on the number of subjects with a baseline and post -baseline 
evaluation at the visit for the specific laboratory test.  By-subject  listings of all laboratory values 
for a subject  with any PCS post-baseline laboratory value will also be provided.  
Shift tables will be presented to show the number and percentage of subjects with a laboratory 
value below the lower limit of normal (LLN), within normal limits , above the upper limit of 
normal (ULN)  and missing  at baseline versus the value at each visit and the worst post -baseline 
value. Percentages for each laboratory test will be based on the number of subjects  in the Safety 
Analysis  Set.   
A listing of subjects  who have  the laboratory criteria for  potentially meeting  Hy’s Law will also 
be provided.  The laboratory criteria for potentially meeting Hy’s Law is defined as ALT or AST

However, all subjects, including Outpatients, must be evaluated in person by [CONTACT_904181]/visits:  Screening/Baseline; Day 1; during each IV administration, 96 ± [ADDRESS_1268742] dose of study drug; E nd of Treatment (EOT); Te st of Cure (TOC); and Late 
Follow -up (LFU).  
a: Perform Screening/Baseline assessments within [ADDRESS_1268743] of care prior to consent ( eg, chest X -ray, blood culture) may be used to satisfy study screening requirements; however, no study specific 
procedures may be performed prior to informed consent.   
b: Day [ADDRESS_1268744] day of study dru g administration; subsequent study days are consecutive calendar days.  
c: Days 4 to 7:  Subjects receiving 7 days of randomized study drug.  
d: [Days 4 to 10:  Subjects receiving 10 days of randomized study drug.]  
e: Perform EOT assessments at the study si te within 2 days (1 day preferred) after the last dose of study drug or at the time of premature discontinuation of study dru g or early withdrawal from 
study.  EOT assessments resulting from premature discontinuation of study drug should be done in place o f the regular study visit on Days  1 to 7 (or Days 1 to 10, as applicable).  
f: Perform TOC assessments at the study site 5 –[ADDRESS_1268745] a TOC Visit irrespective of early clinical failure or rece ipt of an  alternative 
antibiotic.  
g: Perform LFU assessments at the study site on Day  30 ± [ADDRESS_1268746] a LFU Visit irrespective of early clinical failure or receipt of an alternative antibiotic.  
h: Obtain informed consent before initiating any study assessments or procedures.  
i: Randomization may occur at either Screening or on Day [ADDRESS_1268747] dose of study drug.  
j: Record vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature), O [ADDRESS_1268748] is seen in person ( ie, at baseline, 
daily while the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] [record vital signs associated with highest temperature], daily while the subject is on IV therapy, at in -person visits while the subject is taking oral study 
drug as an outpatient), and at EOT and TOC.   Record vital signs, O 2 saturation, and supplemental oxygen usage at LFU if medically indicated.  If Screening and Day 1 occur on the same day, 
vital signs should be obtained as part of the Screening evaluation (prior to administration of any study drug) and repeated as part of the Day 1 assessment (record the vital signs associated 
with the highest temperature post dosing).  If EOT and the last day of study drug are the same day, vital signs do not need t o be repeated, they may be recorded once on that da y (ie, as part of 
the EOT assessment).  
k: Evaluate signs and symptoms of CABP at baseline, daily while receiving study drug and at EOT, TOC, and LFU.  Signs and sympto ms are not obtained at TOC or LFU if the subject was 
previously deemed to have an IACR of  Failure.  Subjects who are receiving medication at home may be contact[CONTACT_904182] i n-person assessment

assessment).  
l: Record AEs from the signing of the ICF through TOC and SAEs from signi ng of the ICF through LFU.  Study personnel will follow unresolved AEs and SAEs present at LFU until resolution 
or stabilization.  
m: At each required time point, ECGs should be recorded in triplicate within a [ADDRESS_1268750] infusion of study drug.  Additional ECG’s may be performed if clinically indicated. 
If at any time the subject demonstrates an average QTcF value >500  ms (me an of 3 ECG’s at any time point), or an average QTcF value >480ms with a concurrent increase in average QTcF 
value of > 60 ms (mean of [ADDRESS_1268751] -dose ECGs compared to mean pre -dose ECG’s taken on that day) study drug will be discontinued.  
n: A complete physi cal examination is performed at baseline and directed physical examinations are performed on Day  4 (Day 3 is acceptable for outpatients who are not able to return on Day 
4) and at EOT and TOC.   
o: For all subjects, collect blood and urine at Screening, Day 4 (Day 3 is acceptable for outpatients who are not able to return  on Day 4), EOT, and TOC.  In addition, for subjects receiving [ADDRESS_1268752] blood and urine on Day 7 (Day 8 is ac ceptable for outpatients who are not able to return on Day 7).  Subjects treated as outpatients must agree to return to the s ite 
for blood draws.  Collect blood and/or urine at LFU only if subject had an abnormal (high/low flag) result at TOC.  Blood sam ples sent to the local laboratory for the purposes of determining 
study eligibility must be repeated and sent to the central laboratory following enrollment.  
p: A pregnancy test will be performed on all females unless surgically sterile or at least [ADDRESS_1268753].  
q: Blood to be collected and sent to central laboratory for serologic tests for M. pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae  and L. pneumophila  at Screening and LFU.

30 Aug  2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 66 s: Collect blood samples (2 sets via peripheral venipuncture) for mi crobiologic culture and susceptibility testing at the local/regional lab at Screening and as clinically indicated during the study.  
Repeat blood cultures after a positive result until sterilization is documented.  If possible, subjects who are discontinue d from study drug due to confirmed MRSA or MSSA bacteremia should 
have blood samples collected for microbiologic culture prior to switching to alternate appropriate therapy. All organisms iso lated from blood cultures which are not considered contaminants 
will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing.  
t: All lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_904105] (including the Screening sample) should be sent to the local/regi onal laboratory for Gram’s sta in, culture and susceptibility 
testing.  If a subject is unable to produce an adequate ( > 25 polymorphonuclear [PMN] cells AND  < 10 squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_904106] ) sputum sample at Screening, a specimen should be 
obtained, if possible, within [ADDRESS_1268754] dose of study drug.  Gram’s stain and culture results from the local/regional laboratory will be recorded in t he eCRF.   Slides (stained and 
unstained) will also be sent to the central laboratory for a confirmatory reading of the Gram’s stain . If possible, subjects who are discontinued from study drug due to clinical failure should 
have repeat cultures collected for microbiologic culture prior to switching to alternate appropriate therapy. All organisms i solated from sputum samples, which are not considered 
contaminants, will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing.  In addition , a portion of all sputum samples must be frozen until sent to the 
central laboratory for PCR. Subjects with a posit ive urinary antigen will also have isolation of L. pneumophila performed at the central laboratory on the frozen sputum .  
u: An oropharyngeal specimen (2 swabs) will be collected and frozen until sent to the central laboratory. The oropharyngeal spec imen w ill be used for culture of  M. pneumoniae and 
identification by [CONTACT_954].   
v: A nasopharyngeal specimen will be collected and frozen until sent to the central laboratory.  The nasopharyngeal specimen wil l be used for culture of  S. pneumoniae and identification by 
[CONTACT_954].   
w: Study drug should be administered approximately the same time each day.  On days when this is not feasible, doses should be g iven within 4 hours of the scheduled dosing time ( ie, a 
minimum of 8 hours between doses).  Subjects who receive only a single dose of study drug on Day 1 will receive their final dose in the morning on either Day 8 (to complete a 7 -day course) 
or on Day 11 (to complete a 10 -day course).  Administration of study drug may occur on the same calendar day as EOT, and if so wi ll be completed before EOT assessments begin.  
x: Collect blood for PK analysis in association with the morning dose of IV study drug on Day  3.  Collect blood for PK samples within 1  h before administration of IV study drug, within 10 
minutes following com pletion of the infusion, at 2 –4 h after infusion, and at 8 –[ADDRESS_1268755] morning dose of oral study drug.  Blood will be collected within 1 h prior to dose, 1 –3 h after dose, and 4 –[ADDRESS_1268756] morning dose of oral study drug at home, rather 
to bring all blister packs (used and unused) to the study site.  Following collection of the pre -dose blood sample, subjects will take their dose of study drug under supervision of study 
personnel, and su bsequent PK blood samples will be collected .   
y: Investigator to determine IACR - Success, Failure or Indeterminate ( ie, subject lost to follow up) at EOT and TOC and Sustained Success, Relapse or Indeterminate at LFU .  The Investigator 
will not determine  Clinical Response at TOC or LFU if the subject was previously deemed to have an IACR of Failure.  
z: Collect pleural fluid samples and/or BAL only if medically indicated.  Gram’s stain samples, culture, and test the isolated p athogens for susceptibility.  Pathogens isolated from pleural fluid 
and/or BAL samples will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing. If poss ible, pleural fluid samples should be incubated in blood culture 
bottles for optimal pathogen  recovery.

Auditory Processing of Complex Sounds – Sensitivity to Chirps  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888763] H. Carney, PhD  
 
I. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
 
1. Purpose of the study .  
The purpose of this research project is to study sensitivity of listeners for “chirps,” which are fast frequency sweeps that are contained in many natural sounds. We will also test 
listeners’ sensitivity to fast fluctuations in the amplitude, or loudness, of sounds. Based 
on these results, we will also test novel schemes for processing sounds for potential use in 
hearing aids. Listeners with normal hearing or with hearing loss will participate.  
 2. Background .  
      Ongoing physiological and psychophysical studies in our laboratory focus on 
identifying the features of sounds that are most important for encoding and neural 
processing of the information in complex sounds. This study will take advantage of that 
information to test novel strategies for processing sound that may ultimately be used in 
hearing aids. In this study, we will 1) test listeners for sensitivity to fluctuations in 
amplitude and frequency within complex sounds, and 2) test novel signal -processing 
strategies  that manipulate the fluctuations in speech sounds.  
      Note: This study is associated with the next 5-year cycle of an ongoing NIH grant, 
entitled “Auditory Processing of Complex Sounds.”  This study has now been 
categorized as a Clinical Trial by [CONTACT_4289] (because listeners with hearing loss will be 
studied, and we will be manipulating sounds (determined to be an “intervention”). Thus,  
we are submitting a new protocol and Informed Consent form.  
 
II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION 
1. Number of subjects.  [ADDRESS_1243925] 4 experiments (see below). For each experiment, our goal is to 
test 15  listeners with normal hearing (having thresholds within 20 dB of normal), 15 
listeners with mild symmetric hearing loss (pure -tone average thre shold, PTA , elevated 
between 20-40 dB), and 15 listeners with moderate symmetric hearing loss (PTA 
between 40-60 dB). An additional 5 subjects will accommodate attrition and/or subjects 
who are consented and screened but who do not fit the inclusion criteria (e.g. symmetric hearing loss). Therefore, we will recruit up to 50 subjects for each of the 4 experiments, 
for a potential upper limit of 200 subjects.  
2. Gender of Subjects. Approximately 50% of the listeners  will be male and 50% will be 
female.  
3. Age of Subjects . Listeners  will be [ADDRESS_1243926] 
 3  
audiogram (hearing test). Additional screening tests will be used to better describe each 
listener’s hearing status, and to ensure that the hearing loss of sensorineural origin.  
6. Exclusion Criteria . Exclusion criteria are severe  (PTA > 60 dB) or asymmetrical 
hearing loss, as evidenced by a standard audiogram . 
7. Vulnerable Subjects. No vulnerable subjects will be included in this study.  
 III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
1. Methods and Procedures.  
Human subjects will listen to sounds delivered by [CONTACT_888769] 
a computer keypad or a mouse. Subjects will be instructed to listen for certain sounds, 
such as a very brief tone (‘beep’), or to speech or music. In some cases, the sound will be 
presented at the same time as a noisy sound, which makes it more difficult to hear. We 
will also study responses made for sounds that are changed in different ways  using new 
signal -processing strategies .  
Listening sessions will typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] 1 -2 hours each, depending on the listener’s 
preference. Sessions  can be conducted one or more times  a week, depending on the 
listener ’s schedule. A total of approximately 3-[ADDRESS_1243927] the hearing of each listener  before the study begins; if listeners  have 
severe hearing loss  (greater than [ADDRESS_1243928]  loss) of which they are not already aware , we 
will advise them to pursue a professional hearing test and they will be excluded from the 
study.   
In addition to the regular test sessions, each listener will have one additional 
session dedicated to making a series of three measurements that will allow us to fine -tune 
our computational model of hearing to each subject. This session will include a standard 
speech -in-noise test, a tympanogram (to assess middle -ear and Eustachian tube function), 
and measurement of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to assess 
function of the inner ear. These tests will be conducted with the assistance of Dr. U -
Cheng Leong, an audiologist in the Dept. Of Otolaryngology at UR with experience 
screening subjects for research studies. The speech-in -noise test will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_888770]. The tympanogram requires placement of a small probe in the ear canal. Measurements of 
sound pressure in the ear canal will be made in response to a low -frequency tone. During 
this measurement, the subject may feel an increased sound pressure in the ear canal. This 
sensation will be described beforehand, so they will know what to expect. The DPOAE 
measurements will be made by [CONTACT_888771]. 
Very small pressures emitted by [CONTACT_888772] -level tones will be measured.  
These standard hearing tests are not painful or annoying, but simply require the subject to 
sit still in a comfortable chair during the measurements.  
 [ADDRESS_1243929] sessions (from Grant application):  
The sequence of experiments begins with abstract sounds and transitions towards more complex 
and natural speech sounds.  
      (Aim 1):  
1. Discrimination of complex sounds designed to contain contrasts in amplitude fluctuations 
and/or frequency chirps. Discrimination thresholds will be assessed for each listener.  
      (Aim 3):  
2. Speech intelligibility tests using synthetic vowels, based on the Klatt (1980) synthesizer. 
We will manipulate fluctuation contrast, based on models of peripheral responses. These 
tasks will be performed in quiet and in the presence of a masking noise with spectrum 
matched to the long- term speech spectrum. The task will identify the lowest contrast at 
which a given subject can perform at criterion (e.g. > 70% correct for the [ADDRESS_1243930] set.) Afterwards, we will also ask listeners to ‘manually’ adjust 
the contrast to identify a preferred contrast setting for which clarity of the vowel stimuli 
is highest.  
3. Intelligibility tasks using synthetic consonant- vowel and vowel -consonant syllables 
constructed using the Klatt synthesizer, with vocal- tract resonances varied to manipulate 
contrast.  
4. The word- in-noise (WIN) task (Wilson et al., 2007). We will initially process these 
stimuli to enhance contrasts using algorithms implemented in software (Matlab). We will then attempt to implement our algorithms on hardware platforms we are testing as part of 
the Open Speech project. Intelligibility tests using the hardware processors will be 
compared directly to those using our software processing. The ultimate goal will be to 
process running speech with the hardware implementations.  
 
Based on our experience, we anticipate a range in the degree and configurations of 
hearing loss, and that there will be variability in both the control and SNHL groups in the results of these tasks. Variability across listeners is a strength for our approach, as it allows us to test 
individualized models in a detailed fashion. Detailed studies of individual listeners can reveal 
important differences in the performance and cues used between listeners, and within listeners 
across frequencies (Mao et al., 2015).  We plan to test [ADDRESS_1243931] statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) will be applied to the 
estimated thresholds for detection of small fluctuations  in amplitude and/or frequency. 
Standard measures of speech intelligibility (e.g. percent correct) or of sound quality (e.g. 
“pleasantness”, or “clarity”) will be used.  
 
Data Safety & Monitoring Plan  
This is a minimal risk study. However, because it was categorized as a Clinical Trial by [CONTACT_4289], we prepared the following Data Safety & Monitoring Plan (from Grant

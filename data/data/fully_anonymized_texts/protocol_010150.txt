 SYNOPSIS 
 
This randomized, controlled, double-masked (subject and observer) clinical trial 
intends to randomize approximately [ADDRESS_477038] been diagnosed with op en-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OHT).  All subjects are require d to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 
1 (Screening) and unmedicated IOP inclusi on criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline).  The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate th e IOP-lowering effect of each of two 
investigational implanted medication treatm ents, as compared to a control topi[INVESTIGATOR_380825].  After completing Visit 2 (Baseline), subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to one of three study treatment arms:  model  
G2TR-  implant (test) arm, model G2TR -  implant (test) arm, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_11227] (control) arm.  Postoperatively, there are 16 follow-up visits over a three-year period.  Specular microscopy photos  will be collected at selected sites.

life.  Reducing intraocular pressure cu rrently is the only proven treatment for 
glaucoma.  
Treatment for open-angle glaucoma ( OAG) traditionally has started with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_380826].  Development of more effective 
medications has increased the popularity of  this approach as  initial treatment 
compared to more invasive inci sional or drainage  device surgery. 
Furthermore, the more benign medicati on treatments preserve the ocular 
tissues in the event that more invasive  surgical approach es are eventually 
required. The various topi[INVESTIGATOR_380827], β-adrenergic receptor antagonists ( β-blockers), car bonic anhydrase 
inhibitors (CAIs), α-adrenergic receptor agonists ( α-agonists), and 
prostaglandin analogues (PGAs).  The P GAs are a class of ocular hypotensive 
agents that have been proven effectiv e in lowering IOP in subjects with OAG 
or OHT.  Other advantages of this cla ss of medications is that the systemic 
side effects associated with α -agonists (e.g., dry mouth, drowsiness) 
and  β - blockers (e.g., depression, fatigue, br adycardia) do not appear to be 
associated with PGAs.  Furthermore,  the ocular side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_11230] a-agonists (e.g., allergic  reactions), and c holinergic agents 
(e.g., reduced vision), do not seem to  manifest with the use of PGAs. 
However, PGAs have been shown to be associated with side  effects such as 
ocular hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, periorbital atrophy, increased eyelash 
growth, general ocular surface discomfort and headache.

3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 
The following are the hypotheses for the study: 
‐ Intraocular implants containing travoprost are at least as effective as 
timolol in achieving lowered intraocu lar pressure (IOP) in subjects with 
OAG or OHT. 
‐ Intraocular implants containing travoprost are well-tolerated.

 9.2 Analysis Populations 
9.2.1 SAFETY POPULATION (SP) 
The safety analysis population will c ontain all subjects who are randomized 
and receive any level of treatment.  Subjects will be grouped according to 
their actual treatment received, not  according to their randomization 
assignment (as randomized). 
9.2.2 INTENT-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  
This subset includes all subjects who are randomized.  All baseline 
characteristics will be summarized based on ITT.  Subjects in the ITT will be 
analyzed according to original trea tment assignment, regardless of actual 
treatment received.  The primary analyses will be based on this ITT 
population. 
9.2.3 PER-PROTOCOL (PP) POPULATION  
The Per Protocol Population is a subset  of ITT.  It includes all the ITT 
subjects who received the treatment and medication drops based on the

10 ADVERSE EVENTS   
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as  any untoward and unintended medical 
occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that occurs in a study subject, regardless of  the suspected cause during the study. 
Adverse events will be clearly documented on the study source document and monitored throughout the course of the study.   
Events occurring after signing the informed  consent but prior to the implant or 
sham procedure should be documented in the medical history.  Events

July 26, [ADDRESS_477058]'s condition afte r receiving any of 
the study treatments, regardless of causal ity, is to be cons idered an adverse 
event, unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre-existing 
condition that is documented in the subj ect's medical history.  If an adverse 
event occurs, an AE form must be completed.   
An AE includes any of the following: 
 An exacerbation or an unexpected incr ease in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition, including inte rmittent or epi[INVESTIGATOR_11238] 
 New conditions or illnesses detected or diagnosed after the implant or 
sham procedure 
 A suspected interaction with any of the study treatments 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected overdose of either 
any of the study treatments or a concomitant medication 
 Any clinically significant laboratory finding that was not present prior to 
receiving any of th e study treatments 
An AE does NOT include any of the following: 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuati ons of any pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease un der study (OAG and OHT). 
 Medical or surgical procedure, (e.g., co lonoscopy or hernia repair).  The 
condition that led to the procedure may be an AE, if not present in medical 
history. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11239] 
(social or convenience ad mission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 Pre-existing conditions or diseases that were pres ent before receiving any 
of the study treatments that do not wors en or that are ch ronic but stable 
 Changes in a chronic condition or diseas e that are consistent with natural 
disease progression.  (These medical  conditions should be adequately 
documented).   
 Lack of efficacy of the study treatment for the condition being 
investigated.

 AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale a nd reported in detail as indicated on 
the CRF: 
Mild: easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal everyday activities 
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities 
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
 
The relationship of each AE to study tr eatment should be determined by [CONTACT_11258]: 
 
Definitely Unrelated: the event is clearl y related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Unlikely Related: the event is most lik ely produced by [CONTACT_11259]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject; and does not follow a known res ponse pattern to the study 
medication  
Possibly Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication; but could have 
been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Probably Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study me dication; and is not likely 
to have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Definitely Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication; and cannot be

CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Date:  Phase:  Protocol No.: 
July 26, [ADDRESS_477059], or precaution.  Any adverse event is 
considered a serious adverse event if  it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
‐ Death 
‐ Life- or sight-threatening 
‐ Required admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380831] (emergency room vis its that do not result in admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380832] d for one of the other serious 
outcomes) 
‐ A persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity 
‐ A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
The terms “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” are measures of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  For example, nausea of several hours 
duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380833] a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcome s listed above.  A life-th reatening event is any 
event that places the subject at substantia l risk of death from the event as it 
occurred; it does not refer to an even t that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  A si ght-threatening event is any event that 
places the subject at risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. 
 
Serious adverse events must be report ed to Glaukos immediately (preferably 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event). 
Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, the investigator should info rm
 Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Gl aukos may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_380834].  If the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a study-treatment related serious adverse event, a copy of the discharge summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible.

10.3 Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Event (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adve rse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any AE for 
which there is evidence to suggest  a causal relationship between the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant and the AE, and which is assessed as both 
unexpected and serious.  An unexpected  adverse reaction, i.e. any untoward 
and unintended response to any of the study treatments, is one for which the 
nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable reference safety 
information (e.g., Invest igator’s Brochure).

 APPENDIX C:  DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
 
Ethical principles for medical re search involving human subjects 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Asse mbly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_477068] WMA General Assembly, Washingt on DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of 
Clarification added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Toky o, Japan, October 2004 (Note of 
Clarification added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
 
Preamble 
1.         The World Medical Associat ion (WMA) has developed the Declaration of 
Helsinki as a statement of ethical prin ciples for medical research involving 
human subjects, including research on  identifiable human material and 
data. 
The Declaration is intended to be  read as a whole and each of its 
constituent paragraphs should be app lied with consideration of all other 
relevant paragraphs. 
 
2.         Consistent with the mandate  of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed 
primarily to physicians.  The WMA enc ourages others who are involved in 
medical research involving human s ubjects to adopt these principles. 
 General Principles 3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the 
words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act 
in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
 4.         It is the duty of the physic ian to promote and safeguard the health, well-
being and rights of patients, including  those who are involved in medical 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Date:  Phase:  Protocol No.: 
July 26, 2022 Phase 3 Stud y GC-012 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 66 of 72 
 research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfilment of this duty. 
 
5.         Medical progress is based on re search that ultimately must include studies 
involving human subjects. 
 
6.         The primary purpose of medical  research involving hu man subjects is to 
understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve 
preventive, diagnostic and therapeuti c interventions (methods, procedures 
and treatments).  Even the best prov en interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality. 
 7.         Medical research is subject to ethical standards th at promote and ensure 
respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
 
8.         While the primary purpose of  medical research is to generate new 
knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and 
interests of individual research subjects. 
 
9.         It is the duty of physicians w ho are involved in medical research to protect 
the life, health, dignity, integrity, ri ght to self-determination, privacy, and 
confidentiality of personal inform ation of research subjects.  The 
responsibility for the protect ion of research subjects must always rest with 
the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
 10.       Physicians must consider th e ethical, legal and regulatory norms and 
standards for research in volving human subjects in their own countries as 
well as applicable international norms  and standards.  No national or 
international ethical, legal or regu latory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
 
11.       Medical research should be co nducted in a manner that minimises possible 
harm to the environment. 
 
12.       Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by 
[CONTACT_380844], training 
and qualifications.  Research on patien ts or healthy volunteers requires the 
supervision of a competent and appropr iately qualified physician or other 
health care professional.

Privacy and Confidentiality 
24.       Every precaution must be taken to  protect the privacy of research subjects 
and the confidentiality of their personal information. 
 Informed Consent 25.       Participation by [CONTACT_380845].  Although it may be 
appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving inform ed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees. 
 
26.       In medical research involving  human subjects capable of giving informed 
consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any po ssible conflicts of interest, 
institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and 
potential risks of the study and th e discomfort it may entail, post-study 
provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study.  The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study 
or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  Special 
attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information. 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Date:  Phase:  Protocol No.: 
July 26, [ADDRESS_477072]’s freely-given in formed consent, preferably in 
writing.  If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects shoul d be given the option of being 
informed about the general outc ome and results of the study. 
 
27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the 
physician must be particularly cautiou s if the potential subject is in a 
dependent relationship with the physician  or may consent under duress.  In 
such situations the informed consen t must be sought by [CONTACT_11274]. 
 
28.       For a potential research subj ect who is incapable of giving informed 
consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative.  These in dividuals must not be included in a 
research study that has no likeli hood of benefit for them unless it is 
intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_62386], the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the re search entails only minimal risk 
and minimal burden. 
 29.       When a potential research su bject who is deemed incapable of giving 
informed consent is able to give asse nt to decisions about participation in 
research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of 
the legally authorised representative.  The potential subject’s dissent should be respected. 
 
30.       Research involving subjects w ho are physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent, for example, unconscious  patients, may be done only if the 
physical or mental condition that prev ents giving informed consent is a 
necessary characteristic of  the research  group.  In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative.  If no such representa tive is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent 
provided that the specific reasons fo r involving subjects with a condition 
that renders them unable to give inform ed consent have been stated in the 
research protocol and the study has b een approved by a research ethics 
committee.  Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as 
possible from the subject or a le gally authorised representative. 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Date:  Phase:  Protocol No.: 
July 26, [ADDRESS_477073] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are 
related to the research.  The refusal of a patient to  participate in a study or 
the patient’s decision to withdraw from the stud y must never adversely 
affect the patient-physician relationship. 
 32.       For medical research using identifiable human material  or data, such as 
research on material or data containe d in biobanks or similar repositories, 
physicians must seek informed consen t for its collection, storage and/or 
reuse.  There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research.  In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a 
research ethics committee. 
 Use of Placebo 33.       The benefits, risks, burdens a nd effectiveness of a new intervention must 
be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the 
following circumstances: 
• Where no proven intervention exis ts, the use of placebo, or no 
intervention, is acceptable; or 
• Where for compelling and scie ntifically sound methodological 
reasons the use of any interventi on less effective than the best 
proven one, the use of placebo, or no  intervention is necessary to 
determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention 
• and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or ir reversible harm as a result of not 
receiving the best pr oven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
 Post-Trial Provisions 34.       In advance of a clinical tr ial, sponsors, researchers and host country 
governments should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an interven tion identified as beneficial in the 
trial.  This information must also be  disclosed to part icipants during the

The SAP will be finalized prior to database unblinding and describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen when the study is being planned. If circ umstances should arise during the study rendering this 
analysis inappropriate, or if improved methods of analysis should ar ise, updates to the analyses may be 
made and this SAP will be amended. Any deviations from the SAP after database  unblinding, reasons 
for such deviations and all alterna tive or additional statistical analyses that may be performed, will be 
described in the clinical study report (CSR). 
 
1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Primary Objective 
 
To demonstrate the manufacturing equivalence, in terms of imm unogenicity, of th ree independent 
consecutive lots of the Sci-B-Vac™ [ADDRESS_184406] vaccination. This obj ective will be met if the 
following condition is satisfied: 
x The upper and lower bound of the two sided 95% CI of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 
anti-HBs ratios [ADDRESS_184407] vaccination, for all three pairwise comparisons (GMC of anti- 
HBs in group A/GMC of anti-HBs in group B, GM C of anti-HBs in group A/GMC of anti-HBs in 
group C, GMC of anti-HBs in group B/GMC of anti-HBs in group C) are within [0.67, 1.5]. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
Immunogenicity 
To demonstrate that the SPR 4 weeks after completion of the three-dose regimen of Sci-B-Vac™ is non- 
inferior to a three-dose regimen of Engerix-B®, i. e. the lower bound of the 95%  two-sided confidence 
interval (CI) of the difference between the SPR Sci- B-Vac™ arm minus the SPR in the Engerix-B® arm, 
achieved [ADDRESS_184408] vaccination will be > -5. 
Safety 
x To assess the safety and reactogenicity of Sci-B-Vac™ compared to Engerix-B® 

 1.3 Exploratory Objectives 
The following are exploratory objectives: 
x To assess the Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) of anti-HBs in serum after [ADDRESS_184409] vaccin ation with Sci-B-Vac™ 
or Engerix-B®, on Study Days 168 and 336, respectively. 
x To assess the seroprotection rate af ter [ADDRESS_184410] vaccination with Sci-B-V ac™ or Engerix-B®, on Study Days 168 and 336, 
respectively. Seroprotection is defined as anti-HBs levels  10mIU/mL in serum. Seroprotection Rate 
(SPR) is the percentage (%) of subjects achieving seroprotection. 
x To assess the Proportion of subj ects achieving anti-HBs levels  100mIU/mL in serum, as a measure 
of an especially robust immune response, on Study Days [ADDRESS_184411] vaccination with Sci-B-Vac™  or Engerix-B®, and on Study Day 336. 
x To assess the rate of non-response on Study Day 196, [ADDRESS_184412] vaccination with Sci-B- 
Vac™ or Engerix-B®. Rate of non-response is de fined as the proportion of subjects not attaining 
anti-+%VOHYHOVP,8P/LQ  serum.
x To assess SPR, GMC and rate of non-response in sub-groups of interest (e.g. BMI > 30), [ADDRESS_184413] vaccination with Sci-B-Vac™ or Engerix-B®. 
x To determine whether the SPR after 2 vaccinations with Sci-B-Vac™, evaluated 20 weeks after the 
second vaccination (just prior to receiving the thir d vaccination), is non-inferior to the SPR [ADDRESS_184414] vaccination with Engerix-B®. 
 
2. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a double-blind 4-arm randomized study. Subj ects age 18-45 years will be randomly assigned to 
one of 3 lots of Sci-B-Vac™ or to Engerix-B® with a ratio 1:1: 1:[ADDRESS_184415] Hepatitis B vi rus (HBV), according to a three-dose immunization 
schedule and followed for [ADDRESS_184416] (assuming a screening period of 28 days  or 4 weeks) is 364 days or 52 weeks. 
 
The scheme of the study design is as Figur e 1. For further details please refer to section 3.1 of the 
Protocol .

without spermicide); 3) in tra-uterine devices; and 4) vasectomy of  male partner; 5) abstinence from 
penile-vaginal intercourse (if the preferre d and usual lifestyle of the subject)). 
5. Able and willing to give informed consent. 
Main Exclusion criteria 
Main exclusion criteria are listed below, for the complete list of exclusion criteria please refer to section  
4.1.2 of the Protocol . Participants meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded. 
1. Previous vaccination with any HBV vaccine (licensed or experimental). 
2. Treatment by [CONTACT_158784] w ithin 30 days of enrollment including but not limited to 
corticosteroids at a dose that is higher than an or al or injected physiological  dose, or > 20 mg /day 
prednisolone equivalent (Inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271]). 
3. History of immunological function impairment,  including but not limited to: a) autoimmune 
diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, type [ADDRESS_184417]'s or Basedow’s disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, autoimmune he patitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, vasc ulitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
Addison’s disease, Bell’s Palsy and Alopecia Areata); 
b) secondary immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. Acqu ired Immunodeficiency Syndrome caused by 
[CONTACT_158785] (HIV/A IDS), solid organ tran splant, splenectomy); 
c) primary immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. comm on variable immune deficiency (CVID), 
Defective phagocytic cell func tion and neutropenia syndromes , complement deficiency). 
4. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 
5. Immunization with attenuated vaccines (e.g. MMR) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 
6. Immunization with inactivated vaccines (e.g. in fluenza) within 2 weeks prior to enrolment. 
 
4. STATISTICAL BASIS FOR SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size for this study is driven by [CONTACT_158786]- to-lot consistency requireme nt. A total of 800 subjects 
in each of the three Sci-B-Vac™ lots will provide at least 90% power to ensure that the 95% confidence 
interval for each pairwise difference (GMC of anti-HBs in group A/GMC of anti-HBs in group B, GMC 
of anti-HBs in group A/ GMC of anti-HBs in group C, GMC of anti-HBs in group B/ GMC of anti-HBs

 in group C) in normalized log10 (G MC) will have a lower bound that is >-0.176 and an upper bound that 
is <0.[ADDRESS_184418] deviation LVWKLVFRUUHVSRQGVWRWKHWUXH*0&UDWLRIDOOLQJEHWZHHQ 
2/3 and 3/2. With an active co mparator arm of Engerix-B® of equal size (n=800), the total sample size 
of the study is 3,200. 
If lot-to-lot consistency is demonstr ated, all three Sci-B-Vac™ lots will be pooled together to test that 
the Seroprotection Rate ( SPR) four weeks after completion of the three-dose regimen of Sci-B-Vac™ is 
non-inferior to a three-do se regimen of Engerix-B®. Assuming 10% of the subjects are non-evaluable 
(i.e., 2880 are evaluable, with 2160 randomized  to Sci-B-Vac™ and 720 to Energix-B®), a two-sided 5% 
significance level and a non-inferiority margin of – 5%, the non-inferiority test  will have > 90% power. 
The following table provides the estimated power unde r different assumptions of the SPR four weeks 
after completion of the three-dose regimens.

In October 2018, enrollment was closed early fo r non-safety-related re asons after 2838 were 
randomized to the study. With appr oximately 700 subjects in each of the three Sci-B-Vac™ lots and 
700 subjects in comparator arm of Engerix-B®, the sample size will provide > 80% power to evaluate 
both the primary objective of lot to  lot consistency of the three Sc i-B-Vac lots, and the secondary 
objective of non-inferiority of  Sci-B-Vac™ vs Engerix-B®. 
 
5. RANDOMIZATION 
A statistician who is not involved in the clinical as pects of the study will generate a permuted blocked 
randomization list for each site. Ra ndomization will be via a web-base d IWRS, stratified by [CONTACT_91294]. 
The site pharmacy and/or unblinded study center staff will receive a no tification of the randomization, 
which should be filed in a locked area/ computer folder not accessed by [CONTACT_91329].

6.1.1 Derived and Computed Variables 
 
Demographics 
Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2) will be calculated using the following formula: 
BMI = Weight (kg) / Height2 (m2) 
Immunogenicity 
Values below the lower limit of quantification (recorded as “< LQ”) will be set to half that limit (LQ/2). 
Values above the upper limit of quan tification (recorded as “>UQ”) w ill be set to that upper limit (UQ). 
Titer greater or equal to a given threshold is defined as binary variable for non-missing values as: 
= 1, if the titer is superior or equal to the given threshold 
= 0, otherwise 
Seroprotection is defined as binary variable for non-missing values as: 
= 1, if anti- +%VOHYHOVP,8P/LQVHUXP  
= 0, otherwise 
Seroprotection rate (SPR) is the percentage (%) of s ubjects achieving seroprotection.

Solicited Adverse Events 
Reactions at the site of injection (redness/eryt hema, pain, tenderness, sw elling/edema, pruritus), 
systemic reactions (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, myalgia) and vital signs 
abnormalities (fever, tachycardia,  bradycardia, hypertensions, hypot ension, changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_862]). 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be characterized according to the date of occurrence related to the vaccination 
phase as follows: 
Ɠ Emergence before vaccination phase : start date before the firs t date of injection of study 
vaccine. 
Ɠ Emergence during vaccination phase : start date on or after the fi rst date of injection of study 
vaccine or, adverse event increase in severity including to “serious” adverse event. 
If an adverse event start date is equal to the fi rst date of vaccination injection, missing or unknown, 
the adverse event will be considered as emergent. 
When start and/or end dates of an adverse even t are only partially known, adverse events will be 
categorized as emergent before, during (or after) vaccination phase using the following rules:

The maximum event severity is the greatest severity associated with a preferred term for a reported 
adverse event according to the following order: Mild < Moderate < Severe < Potentially life 
threatening. Unknown/ Missing severity is c onsidered as potentially life threatening. 
Multiple AEs with the same PT for th e same subject are counted only once. 
Vaccination-related Adverse Events are those for which the cause has been evaluated by [CONTACT_1275], and recorded either as very likely/ certain, possibly related, pr obably related or unknown/ 
missing. 
Pre-study, Concomitant and Post-Study Medications 
A pre-study medication is a medication used only before the first study vaccination (i.e. medication 
end date < first study vaccination date). 
A post-study medication is a medication used only after study te rmination (i.e. medi cation start date 
> study termination date). Th is will not be collected in the clinical  database and will not be reported in 
the CSR. 
All other medications are concomitant . 
When start and/or end dates of a medication intake are missing, th e medication is considered as 
concomitant with the study vaccination schedule. 
If the first study vaccination date is missing then the medication is considered as concomitant with the 
study vaccination schedule, provided that the st udy vaccine was administered to the subject. 
6.2 Analysis Sets 
6.2.1 All Enrolled Set 
 
The All Enrolled Set will be defined as all screened subjects who provide informed consent and provide 
demographic and/or baseline scre ening assessments, regardless of  the subject’s randomization and 
treatment status in the study.

 In case of vaccination error, subjects will be analyzed as initially “treated” (i.e., according to the first 
vaccine a subject receives, rather than the vaccine to which the subject is randomized). 
6.2.3 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
 
All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who were randomized. 
In case of vaccination error, subjects in the ITT will be analyzed “as randomized” (i.e., according to the 
vaccine a subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject actually 
received). Any subject who received the wrong va ccination will not be excluded from the ITT. 
6.2.4 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
 
All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who receive at least one vaccination and provide at least one evaluable 
serum immunogenicity sample both at  baseline and after baseline. 
In case of vaccination error, subjects in the FAS w ill be analyzed “as randomi zed” (i.e., according to the 
vaccine a subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject actually 
received). Any subject who received the wrong va ccination will not be excluded from the FAS. 
If a subject is unblinded during the study, he/she will be included in the FAS.

PPS1 will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. [IP_ADDRESS]  Per Protocol Set 2 (PPS2) 
 
All subjects in PPS1, but excluding those who attende d study visits outside of the following windows: 
x V3/Day 168 (+/- 28 days) 
x V4/Day 196 (-7/+14 days) 
PPS2 will be used for the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints. In case of vaccination error, subjects in PPS1 and/or PPS2 will be analyzed “as randomized” and the 
subject who received the wrong vaccination will be excluded from PPS1 and/or PPS2. If a subject 
receives a vaccine from the wrong kit number, but th e same as the one the subject was randomized to, 
the subject will not be removed from PPS1 and/or PPS2. 
If a subject is unblinded during the study, except fo r suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R), he/she may be excluded from PPS1 and/or PPS2 based on sponsor’s decision with respect to 
any potential bias that may be introduced in th e analysis of the primary and key secondary 
immunogenicity analyses.

6.3.5 Missing Data 
 
For immunogenicity data, it may be reasonable to consider missing immu nogenicity values as missing 
completely at random (MCAR), i.e., not informative. Therefore, each  of immunogenicity analyses will 
comprise a complete case analysis only, without in troducing any bias. Imputati on methods will not be 
used.

Deviations from the protocol will be assessed as ‘minor’ or ‘major’. CSR reportable (“major”) protocol 
deviations (PDs) are defined in acco rdance with ICH E3 as important PDs related to study inclusion or 
exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, subject management or subject assessment resulting in the 
potential to jeopardize the safety or rights of the trial subjects or the scientific value of the trial. 
All major PDs will be classified into the following categories, but not all deviations listed below will 
necessarily be declared a major PD:

Prior to unblinding, a PD report will be provided to the Clinical Study Team (CST) consisting of medical, 
clinical, and operational team me mbers from the Sponsor and CRO for review on an ongoing basis during 
the study. The PDs review is part of  the Data Listing Review process. 
After the review, the CST team is responsible fo r assessing the impact of PDs on the immunogenicity 
and safety data for study subjects from medical and c linical perspectives. The PDs will be identified and 
categorized to determine subjects to be exclude d from analysis populations according to the PDs 
specification. 
Details of PD review procedure will be provided in the Medical Monitoring Plan and Data Listing Review 
Manual.

anti-HBsAg antibody ratios [ADDRESS_184431] injection for all three pairwise comparisons 
(GMC(group A)/GMC(group B), GMC(group A)/GMC(group C), GM C(group B)/GMC(group C)) are 
within [0.67, 1.5] 
The analysis will use a two-sided 5% significance level. PPS1 and PPS2 will be used to test the primary 
hypothesis.

pre-vaccination (baseline) titer. Da ta from all centers w ill be pooled. For each vaccine lot, antibody 
GMCs, associated standard errors, two-sided 95% CIs and median, minimum, and maximum titer values 
will be determined and presente d by [CONTACT_158793]. The median, minimum,  and maximum values will be 
reported on the actual titer values, rather than the log scale. The ratio in GMCs between each vaccine lot

[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Objective Analyses 
 
If lot-to-lot consistency is demonstrated, then the data from the three lots will be combined to address 
the secondary immunogenicity non inferior ity-hypothesis. It is to demons trate that the SPR 4 weeks after 
completion of the three-dose regime n of Sci-B-Vac™ is non-inferior to  the SPR 4 weeks after completion 
of a three-dose regimen of Engerix-B® . Seroprotection is defined as anti- +%VOHYHOVP,8P/  in 
serum. Seroprotection rate (SPR) is the percen tage (%) of subjects achieving seroprotection. 
Seroprotection rate (SPR) [ADDRESS_184433] injection 
 
Non-Inferiority of Sci-B-Vac™ [ADDRESS_184434] vaccination compared to Engerix-B® [ADDRESS_184435] vaccination will be assessed using PPS2. Data from all centers will be pooled 
and data from all 3 lots of Sci-B-Vac™ will be pooled. The differ ence in proportions [SPR(Sci-B-Vac™) 
–SPR(Engerix-B®)] and two-sided 95% CIs, will be calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen 
method. Funnel plot will be produced to  investigate the impact of center.

If the lower bound of the 95% Miettinen-Nurminen CI is  greater than -5%, Sci-B-Vac™ will be declared 
non-inferior to Engerix-B®. 
Sensitivity analyses using the same modeling appro ach outlined above will be conducted using the FAS 
and ITT. For these ITT analyses, patients with missi ng data at Day 196 ([ADDRESS_184436] 
vaccination) will be included and treated as failur es. These analyses will be reported both with and 
without patients who are seropositive at baseline. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Obj ective Analyses 
 
Analysis of all exploratory immunoge nicity endpoints will be based on PPS2, unless otherwise indicated. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized and analyzed without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons. 
Each of the exploratory endpoints defined in the prot ocol will be summarized for each Sci-B-Vac™ lot 
separately, as well as for the difference between each Sci-B-Vac™ lot. Analysis of GMC endpoints will use the same methods as described above for the pr imary endpoint. For binary data, proportions and two- 
sided 95% CIs will be reported. The difference in pr oportions and two-sided 95% CIs, will be calculated 
using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
In addition, each of the exploratory endpoints will be  summarized with data fro m all 3 lots of Sci-B- 
Vac™ pooled together. Summaries will be pres ented for Sci-B-Vac™, E ngerix-B™ and for the 
treatment difference. Adjusted estimates of GMCs and their associated 95% CIs will each be determined 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with a factor for treatment group, and a covariate for 
the log transformed pre-vaccination (baseline)  titer. For each treatment group, anti-HBs GMCs, 
associated standard errors, two-sided 95% CIs and median, minimum, and maximum titer values will be 
determined and presented by [CONTACT_12922]. The median, minimum, and maximum values will be 
reported on the actual titer values, rather than the log scale. The ratio in GMCs between treatment groups 
(GMC of anti-HBs in Sci-B-Vac™ / GMC of anti-HBs in Engerix-B®), and their associated two-sided 
95% CIs will also be presented. For binary data, proportions and two-sided 95% CIs will be reported. 
The difference in proportions and two-sided 95% CIs, will be calculated using the Miettinen and

diary cards and/or remained in clinic for at leas t [ADDRESS_184439] and/or 
[ADDRESS_184440] each vaccination assessment (including implausible values) except “Not 
done/unknown”. 
Three summaries will be produced: 
 
1. The frequencies of subjects who pr ovide diary cards by [CONTACT_29299]. 
 
2. For each type of solicited adverse event (local , systemic, other), the frequencies of subjects 
with valid data by [CONTACT_29299], aggregated ov er time points and interv als: 0-30 min (clinic), 
>30 min – Day 1 (diary), Day 2 – 7 (diary). wh ere the Day 1 is the date of each vaccination. 
The Day value is incremented by 1 for each date following the date of the vaccination. 
3. For each solicited adverse event, the frequencie s of subjects with valid data by [CONTACT_158794]: 0-30 min (clinic), >30 min – Day 1 (diary), Day 2 – 7 (diary) where the Day [ADDRESS_184441] was present or not. All 
analyses will be based on the Safety Set (i.e. ‘as treated’).

All solicited AEs will be summarized according to defined severity grading scales. Frequencies and 
percentages of subjects experiencing each solicited AE  will be presented for each symptom, by [CONTACT_158795] (i .e., after each vaccination). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unsolicited Adverse Events 
 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are define d as those adverse events that either start or 
worsen on or after the date of first vaccination. 
All following TEAEs will be included in the summary tables: 
 
x All AEs occurred on the day of vaccination (va ccination 1, vaccination 2 or vaccination 3) and 
during the next 27 days [date of vaccination + 27 days] 
AND 
 
x SAEs, medically significant events (i.e., AEs me dically attended) or new onset of chronic 
illnesses through the date of end study 
If a subject missed one or two vaccination injec tions, the AEs for the corresponding vaccination 
injections will not be included in the summary. Fo r example, one subject mis sed vaccination 2, the AEs 
for the day of vaccination 2 and during the next 27 days will be missing and not be included in the 
summary tables and figures.

 Solicited adverse events continui ng beyond Day 7 will be coded by [CONTACT_158796]. 
For AEs included in the summary tables defined a bove, numbers of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_86104] (SOC) and Preferred Term, and also by [CONTACT_926]/causality to vaccine. The summaries will 
be presented by [CONTACT_33853] (any vaccination, vaccinati on 1, vaccination 2 and vaccination 3) and interval 
of onset as follow: 
x Day 1 to Day 28 
where the AEs will include AEs occurred on/after Day 1 (date of vaccination) until earliest date 
of (Day 28, date of next vaccination-1, end of study) 
x Day 29 to end of considered interval 
where the AEs will include SAEs, medically significant events (i.e., AEs medically attended) or new onset of chronic illnesses occurred on/after Day [ADDRESS_184444] date of (date of next vaccination-1, end of study) 
x Day 1 to end of considered interval 
where the AEs will include AEs occurred on/after Day 1 (date of vaccination) until earliest date 
of (date of next vaccination-1, end of study) 
The original verbatim terms used by [CONTACT_158797] (MedDRA) dictionary. The AEs 
will then be grouped by [CONTACT_158798]. 
These summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_6654]. When an AE occurs more than once 
for a subject, the maximal severity  and strongest relationship to th e treatment group will be counted. 
Separate summaries w ill be produced for the following categories: 
- AEs 
- SAEs 
- Unexpected AEs 
- AEs that are very likely, probably or possibly related to vaccine 
- AEs leading to vaccine withdrawal 
- AEs leading to study withdrawal 
- AEs medically attended 
- New onset of chronic illnesses 
- Solicited AEs continuing beyond Day 7

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests (Hem atology, Biochemistry and Urinalysis) 
 
Laboratory values (hematology, biochemistry and ur inalysis) will be listed by [CONTACT_158799] (with the excepti on of urinalysis). The baseline for the laboratory 
values will be the latest non-missing result obtained befo re first vaccine injection. 
All laboratory (e.g., hematology, bioc hemistry) data will be summarize d using descriptive statistics. 
Summaries will be provided for the observed values and changes from baseline at each scheduled visit. The changes in biochemistry and hematology from baseline will only be  calculated in the clinical 
laboratory sub-study analysis set ( SSA). In addition, absolute and ch ange from baseline values will be 
categorized according to the toxicity scales (See protocol Appendix 3 for la boratory parameters) and 
summarized by [CONTACT_158800].

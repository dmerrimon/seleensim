Objective:     
To determine if different techniques used in the creation of suture anchor socket creation can 
influence post -op pain following rotator cuff repair  
 
Hypothesis:  
We propose that the use of an arthroscopic drill for creation of anchor  socket  will result in less 
pain post -operatively when comp ared to the use of the punch . 
 
Clinical significance:  
Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has become a mainstay of treatment for rotator cuff 
tears requiring surgical intervention and has been reported to decrease pain and increase 
function to levels similar to open approaches while requiring smaller incisions a nd less soft 
tissue disruption.3-[ADDRESS_889871] commonly uses suture anchors inserted 
into proximal humeral bone to re -attach tendon(s), the authors sought to examine technical 
components of suture anchor insertion.  The sockets for insertion of suture anch ors used in 
rotator cuff repair are made most often with use of a surgical punch that, in theory, corticates 
the socket to optimize anchor thread purchase and pull -out strength.  However, use of a punch 
may cause significant micro -trauma to proximal humera l bone as it fractures trabeculae to 
create the socket, as opposed to use of a drill bit which cuts and removes trabeculae to create 
the socket.  These fractures occurring as the result of stress -induced microtrauma to bone have 
a well -documented role in c ausing pain.11-[ADDRESS_889872] 
been reported to occur after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using punch -socket suture anchor s, 
and can remain present for 6 – 12 months.15-17 Taken together, these findings give credence to 
the theory that punch -induced microfractures may contribute to postoperative pain after 
arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.  
 
Study Design:  
- Randomized prospective cohort study.  
 
1. Inclusion criteria  
a. Patient’s aged [ADDRESS_889873] bone sockets formed  with either a punch  (25) or 
a drill  (25) at the time of surgery . 
- Patients will follow up at their standard of care visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 
6 months   
- PROMIS  SF v2.0 – Physical Function 10a , PROMIS SF v1.0 – Pain Interference 6a,  SANE, 
ASES, VAS  scores will be collected at each visit  for research purposes.  
- Patients will record their pain levels and number of pain pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] t hey took for three days 
post -op for research purposes.  
- MRI of the shoulder of the first [ADDRESS_889874] -op for evaluation of bone marrow edema pattern in the proximal humerus  for 
research purposes.  
 
 
Training in the policies protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects in 
research:  
All staff involved in this study has had IRB -approved training according to The University of 
Missouri Healthcare guidelines  
 
Publication of private information:  
Investigators intend to publish the results of this study without identifying the subjects; and 
every attempt will be made to follow strict confidentiality. The results of this research may 
appear in scientific publications without identifying the patients.  
 
Future contact [CONTACT_659976]:  
Research patients/caregivers may be contact[CONTACT_659977].  
 
Possible risks to research patients :  
Potential for loss of confidentiality.  Each patient will be assigned a random subject number. The 
key linking numbers to subjects will be locked away i n the offices of University of Missouri, 
Missouri Orthopedic Institute .  All published information will be through de -identified subject 
numbers.  The key linking the patient and all identifiable personal information will be destroyed 
[ADDRESS_889875] -study completion  to allow for complete data analysis and use of data for 
publication writing.  
 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 into either the punch or drill. The surgeon does not 
determine the procedure; there is always the potential risk that the other procedure may 
result in more post -op pain.  
 
Possible benefits:  
Research patients enrolled in the study will not benefit directly from this study itself; however, 
information gained from this study could benefit patients being treated in the future.  
Specifically it may help determine a new standard of care for patients with upper extremity 
injuries with resultant hand stiffness.  
 
Costs to subjects:  
No costs will be incurred by [CONTACT_659978].

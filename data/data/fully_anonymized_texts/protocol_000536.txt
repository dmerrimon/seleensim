 2 Background  
More than 80% of U .S. women with breast cancer have hormone receptor -positive (HR+) tumors  (1). They  are 
commonly prescribed adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) after surger y, chemotherapy and/or radiation  (2, 3) . Long -
term use of AET significantly reduce s the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], cancer recurrence, and mortali ty (4, 5) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_168807], evidence suggests that adherence is low (6-12). Multiple studies 
point to AET -related adverse symptoms as a key reason for non -adherence or premature discontinuation  (7, 8, 10, 
13-20). In addition to adverse symptoms, other potentially modifiable factors that impact AET adherence include 
poorer patient -provider communication , fewer perceived treatment benefits , and barriers  such as  high  cost and 
inconv enience  (21).  
 
Patients who do not take the full amount of t heir AET medication as prescribed or who discontinue their AET 
treatment early do not receive the full intended treatment benefits and , consequently , are at increased risk for 
mortality  (22-25). Observational  studies have found significant ly  lower adherence  (7, 26, 27)  to AET among Black 
women  when compared to White women.  Racial differences  in AET adherence may contribute to mortality 
disparities between  Black and White women  with breast cancer  (6). This challenge is magnified in Memphis, 
Tenne ssee, which has one of  the highest mortality  disparities  in breast cancer survival in the country  (28). Survival 
differences by [CONTACT_168825], insurance status, income, and 
comorbidities  (28-30). It is possible that an intervention that sta ndardizes patient -provider communication 
regarding adherence and symptom management may be able to reduce racial disparities in AET adherence  and 
improve patient health outcomes .  
 
For women with breast cancer in the adjuvant phase, clinic visit s become less frequent . Because of  the 
infrequency of clinic visits and limitations of patient recall, adverse symptoms are often not optimally evaluated or 
managed  (13, 21) . Monitoring adverse symptoms, especially between clinic visits, could help healthcare providers 
better manag e AET treatment s of breast cancer patients  without relying on patient recall . A few studies 
investigate d the feasibility of symptom monitoring among oncology patients using web portals and automated 
 3 telephone calls  and found promising results  (31-33). However, these studies focused on alleviating symptoms, not 
improving medication  adherence. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_168808]+ breast cancer  (2), only seven  behavioral interventions to d ate have been specifically 
aimed to ward  increas ing AET adherence  (34-41). Of these  intervent ions, most provided educational materials only  
(37, 38, 41, 42)  and only one  showed a statistically  significant improvement  in adherence  (36).  While there is 
some early evidence t o suggests that co mmunication between doctors and patients is associated with higher AET 
adherence , none of the AET adherence interventions focused on improving communication outside of clinic visits. 
Furthermore, there is a critical need for evidence on the impact of these  types of interventions with  underserved 
patients  (43). 
 
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] , which used a web -based, electronic health record (EHR) -integrated app intervention designed to 
support adherence among women  initiating AET treatment , participants receiving weekly reminders to use the 
study  app self-reported significantly higher AET adherence at eight  weeks compared with controls (91% vs. 68%, 
p=0.02)  (44). The ability of  healthcare providers to monitor symptom reports via an app a nd engage in treatment -
related  communication with patients outside of clinic visits  could provide a wide -reaching and potentially cost-
effective  way to improve symptom management and ultimately health outcomes.  
 
Our study tests a web -enabled app designed to improve patient -provider communication about AET adherence 
and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits . This builds on the success of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_168809]: 1) expanding 
the intervention period from two to six months i n order to capture later -onset adverse symptoms that might be  
slower to develop; 2) following participants for one year, to test longer -term effects of the intervention on 
medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample, stratifie d by [CONTACT_545], powered to test 
the intervention  with and without tailored feedback messages .   
 
Methods  
THRIVE is a five -year study funded by [CONTACT_29630]. During the first year, we completed five focus 
 4 groups to refine the study protocol and app (45). In the second year, we launched the randomized controlled trial  
of a web -based app and tailored messages for women with breast cancer initiati ng AET. The intervention last s [ADDRESS_196876] if the App and App+Feedback conditions improve AET adherence.  
2. Test if the App and App+Feedback conditions improve symptom burden, quality of life, patient -provider 
communication, and self -efficacy for managing symptoms.  
3. Calculate the relative impact of the App and App+Feedback conditions on healthcare utilization and cost.  
Conceptual Framework . The intervention design was guided by [CONTACT_168826] , which 
describes the interrelatedness of three symptom management dimensions: symptom experience, management 
strategies, and health outcomes  (46). The model assumes that the patient’s perception of symptoms is the gold -
standard of measurement, troublesome symptoms must be monitored and managed in a timely manner, and 
symptom management is dynamic (46). An effe ctive approach to improving treatment outcomes is one that is 
sensitive to an individual’s perception of her own symptoms, relies on ongoing communication and shared 
decision -making, and is patient -centered.  Accordingly, w e utilize real -time reporting of symptoms between 
patients and their oncology care teams outside of clinic visits. Built -in, real -time alerts and EHR -integration allow s 
any patient’s report of AET nonadherence or adverse symptoms to be continually evaluated by [CONTACT_102]’s West 
Cancer Center Research Instiute ( WCCRI ) oncology team (i.e., the participant’s physician and their nursing team). 
In turn, providers have the opportunity to promptly address symptoms and other patient concerns, resulting in 
improved patient symptom ex perience and AET adherence. This cyclical process provides the patient and their 
clinical team the opportunity to communicate, evaluate, and manage symptoms.  
The feedback component is based on self -regulation theory and will enhance patient engagement and activation 
and facilitate shared decision -making (47-49). Cornerstones of any behavioral program are objective feedback and 
positive reinforcement (50-52). The feedback serves to reinforce positive behavi or in adherence and self -
monitoring using the app.  Evidence on app -based behavioral interventions supports the importance of tailored 
feedback to maintain self -monitoring behavior and optimize outcomes (50-54).  
 [ADDRESS_196877] cancer diagnosis each  year.  The WCC RI serves a diverse patient population similar to 
the surrounding region: nearly 40% of patients identify as racial/ethnic minorit ies, the majority of whom identify 
as Black.  
 
Participants: Potentially eligible patients from all WCC RI locations are identified by [CONTACT_168827]’s EHR system and by [CONTACT_67377] . Patients referred to the study meet with a research nurse who 
confirm s eligibility, obtain s informed consent,  provide s the electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_168810],  and has participants 
complete a baseline survey.  Between November 2018 and March 2021, 300 participants will be recruited ; 
participants  complete study tasks for a minimum of a year (the primary study end -point), and up to [ADDRESS_196878] (IRB #: 17 -[ZIP_CODE] -XP IAA).   
 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The criteria for entry into the study include: a) adult f emale WCCRI patients (ages 18 
years and older) with a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or Stage I -III hormone receptor -positiv e breast 
cancer ; b) n ew prescription for an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen ; c) have a mobile device with a data plan; 
d) have a valid email address; e) willing to complete brief surveys on a web -enabled device.   Given that side 
effects associated w ith AET are typi[INVESTIGATOR_168811], we exclude  patients who 
had prior AET use. Because of  potential exacerbations of possible side -effect, we also exclude patients with a 
current diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromy algia . We also exclude patie nts with chronic narcotic usage. 
Further, we do not include participants concurrently undergoing surgery  or chemotherapy  so that we could best 
disentangle the source of the side effects caused by [CONTACT_168828].  Our survey and app we re only available in English, 
 6 thus we excluded participants who were unable to communicate in English.  Aside from chemotherapy and 
surgery, participants are permitted to undergo radiation and receive other concomitant treatments.  
 
Procedures . Following inf ormed consent, all participants complete a baseline survey using the REDCap  (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) database assessing basic demographic information and baseline measures of key study 
outcomes (see Table 2).  REDCap is a secure web -based applicat ion that has many useful features for creating and 
managing online research databases and surveys while ensuring data integrity, such as auditing trails, and secure 
data import and export functions (55).  
 
The study statistician (MK) generated the r andomization sequence with  SAS using race -stratified block 
randomization with equal allocation 1:1:[ADDRESS_196879] access to the randomization 
scheme.    
 
The study coordinator (AP) will randomize participants  into one of the three study arms: 1) App, 2) App+Feedback, 
or 3) Usual Care.  Finally, the stud y research nurse  orients participants to their assigned condition and provides 
new enrollees with the study materials for their condition. All participants  are given an electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_168812]  (i.e., 
a WisePi[INVESTIGATOR_113572])  and asked to use it for [ADDRESS_196880] the 
participant via text or e -mail to troubleshoot barriers to device use.  
 
At the 12 -month visit, participants are asked to return their pi[INVESTIGATOR_168813] a 
preaddressed envelope, which is mailed to them. After returning their pi[INVESTIGATOR_168814] 12,  
participants are given a financial incentive ($60 ) to compensate them for the time and effort required to use the 
 [ADDRESS_196881]

App  Condition . Participants in the App group  
receive a weekly text message to prompt 
them to log into the THRIVE  app to answer 
questions about their AET adherence and 
related adverse symptoms. The app can be 
accessed through any web -enabled device or 
Internet browser. The reporting of 
medication use is assessed by a single -item 
adherence measure adapted from th e 
Medi cation Adherence Reasons S cale (56, 
57). Symptoms are assessed using a condensed version of the F ACT-ES (58), with follow -up questions about 
severity of symptoms using a [ADDRESS_196882] screenshots of the THRIVE app’s 
symptom burden and adherence items . If participants select “Pain” as a symptom, they are prompted with a body 
map where  they  can indicate the specific area of the body in which they are experiencing pain (see Figure  3). The 
questions are designed to limit the time burden on patients ; reports should take about one  to two  minute s to 
complete.   
Figure 3. Screenshot of Free Text and Body Map  

 [ADDRESS_196883] 
cancer  to determine the optimal frequency (e.g., weekly, every other week, or monthly)  and timing of messages  
and content (e.g., motivation s, app use, AET adherence, symptom summary, relevant educational materials ) (45). 
These focus group s served to inform our intervention design, primarily through presentation of content to 
participant s and allowing them to rate and provide feedback on both quality of content, utility of certain features, 
design aesthetic , and other methodological conside rations . Examples of some of these findings include 
preferences for once -a-week reminder messages; a loss aversion scheme for incentivization; and the free text, 
body map, and patient dashboard features.  Although participants are prompted to use the app at least o nce per 
week, they are informed that they may use it at any time regardless of when they receive prompts. All patient -
reported data are automatically entered into the EHR  system  and easily available to oncology care team s for 
review.  Furthermore, participa nts can use the free -text feature to convey any information they want to share with 
their provider that is not captured in the questions asked in the app  (see Figure 3).  
 
The app a lerts are based on response thresholds to adherence and symptom questions a nd are generated to 
inform the participant’s  care team (i.e., prescribing physician and nurse) of any concerning responses or trends 
that emerge from the participant -reported outcomes via the app. WCCRI  oncologists guided the alert threshold s, 
which include: three  missed doses within the last week, a [ADDRESS_196884] with the 
patient. The aler t messages include the event that triggered the alert and are sent to the care team via e -mail . 
Care  teams are asked to respond to alerts within 48 hours. They are able to review concerning responses directly 
from the patient’s EHR to help guide ongoing tr eatment and make therapeutic adjustments when necessary. AET  
nonadherence for three  days or more  within one week  prompt s a call, even when the cause is not related to an 
adverse symptom . This facilitate s communication between patients and their team s on ba rriers to AET adherence 
and provide s an opportunity for shared decision -making. A research nurse note s the clinical response and care 
team contact [CONTACT_168829]’s record after each alert (i.e., a phone consult, visit, and any medication changes ).  
 
App +Feedback  Condition . In addition to  the previously outlined  procedures , participants randomized to the  
App+Feedback group will receive  weekly tailored feedback messages based on their baseline survey responses 
and use of the app during the 6 -month interven tion phase. Some tailored feedback include s links to symptom -
specific educational materials and copi[INVESTIGATOR_168815] -severity symptoms. Using  
feedback from focus groups, w e developed a library of messages with multiple options for each condition in order 
to prevent desensitization  to the same message . Message categories  are tailored to participant’s responses to the 
app and baseline survey .  Some feedback  messages are supplemented with images  (see Figure  5). 
Data Collection  
Medication Adherence Monitoring. The WiseP ill monitor consists of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_168816]. The device uses mobile phone and Internet technologies to provide real -time 
adherence data . Wise Pi[INVESTIGATOR_168817] (59, 60 ).  
 
 [ADDRESS_196885] the following survey measures as covariates or secondary outcomes : a) a 
brief three -question, validated instrument to assess health literacy  (61); b) the Health Beliefs and Medication 
Adheren ce in Breast Cancer  (HBMABC) (21) questionnaire , which focuses on patients’ perceived susceptibility to 
breast cancer recurrence  and perceived benefits and barriers of AET; c) Self -Efficacy for Managing Symptoms - 
Short Form  instrument  (62); d) Communication: Patient and Physician Peer Assessment Module 10 -items  
instrument  (63); e) Wheeler et al.’s shared decision -making questions  (64); f) sociodemographic characteristics, 
including education level , relationship status, religious identity, household size,  and household income ; g) Self-
reported medication adherence  questions (66); and  h) cost, measured via self -reported healthcare utilization (i.e., 
number of clinic visits, urgent care or emergency visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], etc). Table 1 describes  the key survey s 
and the relevant time points.

Electronic Health Record Chart Abstraction.  The following baseline demographic data are abstracted from the 
patient’s electronic health record upon enrollment : 
• Date of birth, race/ethnicity, marital status, comorbidities  
• Disease stage, tumor histology and grade, hormone receptor and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] -2 (HER-
2) status, menopausal status  
• AI therapy and modalities of breast cancer treatment received in the primary adjuvant setting  
• Chemotherapy  and/or surgery  received prior to AET  
• Provider Responses to the alerts  
Intervention Fidelity Monitoring and  Data Management . We adhere to the following quality procedures to 
ensure treatment fidelity: 1) development of detailed intervention standard operating procedures ; 2) electronic 
monitoring of receipt of emails/texts, app usage, and feedback reports; 3) documentation of all i ntervention 
contacts; and 4) weekly meetings to review overall adherence to structured protocols, and problem solving for 
any issues related to participant challenges.  The study coordinator performs weekly data quality checks, and the 
study statistician pe rforms range checks for data values on a monthly basis. All identifiable data is stored on 
password protected servers or locked file cabinets that only the study team has access to.  The study PI, the study 
 [ADDRESS_196886], will be documented (time,  reason, 
actions taken, initiator) on the Delivery Assessment tracking form  
 
Any changes to the protocol are communicated to the proximal study team on a weekly basis, and to the wider 
study team on a monthly basis.  
 
Study Retention . The pi[INVESTIGATOR_168818] 88% without the use of financial incentives to 
compensate patients for their time and contribution to the study. This high rate may reflect the proactive 
approach that we have employed, including maintainin g current contact [CONTACT_3031], minimizing barriers by 
[CONTACT_168830] , and regular study meetings with retention as a standing agenda 
item. For this study, we are following participants for a longer period, which could impa ct retention rates; to 
maintain high retention rates, we provide small but meaningful incentives through a loss aversion scheme, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_168831]. This include s a total compensation up to $ [ADDRESS_196887] enroll and how many follow -up surveys  they complete . 
Specifically, fo r months 0 -6, all participants are credited $60 merchant credit at the end of the period if they 
complete all activities, including the 6 -month survey a nd maintenance of the WiseP ill device’s battery charge.  For 
 14 months 7 -12, participants receive an additional $120 merchant credit for the second follow -up survey, WisePi[INVESTIGATOR_168819], and return of the WisePi[INVESTIGATOR_113572]. For months 18 -36, par ticipants  who enroll early  
are asked to  complete follow -up surveys every 6 months and receive $10 per survey, for a maximum of $40.   
Criteria for modifying allocated interventions  
If a participant is discontinued from adjuvant therapy, she is asked to sti ll complete the follow -up surveys, but no 
longer receives reminder or feedback messages nor completes the app surveys if she was allocated to the app or 
app+feedback conditions.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Power/Sample Size . Using adherence results from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_168820] 60% adherence in the ‘Usual Care’ 
arm, 75% adherence in the ‘App’ arm, and 85% adherence in the ‘App+Feedback’ arm, 95% power to detect a 
significance adherence difference among the three arms will be achieved with a total of 240 e valuable participants 
(80 evaluable patients in each arm) with 5% Type -1 error rate. We increase the sample size to 100 for each arm 
for a total accrual of 300 participants to account for potential 1 -year attrition up to 20%. The same sample size 
would als o provide 90% power with 5% Type -[ADDRESS_196888] the Quality of Life difference of 
9.3 units where the ‘App’ and ‘App+Feedback’ arms are combined against the ‘Usual Care’ arm with projected 
standard deviations from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], of 9.3 and 24.3, respectively.  
 
Primary Outcome  
 Adherence.  Using the  electronic  pi[INVESTIGATOR_168821], adherence  will be defined as the proportion of days 
in which each participant  took her medication  (as recorded and transmitted via WisePi[INVESTIGATOR_168822])  according 
to the prescribed frequency during the 12 -month study period.  For example, a patient would be considered to be 
100% adherent if the pi[INVESTIGATOR_168823] [ADDRESS_196889] analysis of varia nce ( ANOVA ) and t -tests for pairwise comparison, or its non -
parametric counterparts such as Kruskal -Walls (or Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney) test when warranted, and chi -
squared or Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare the groups for any differences in char acteristics. We will 
also construct models utilizing the across -strata data to formally test for treatment and race interaction. The 
primary data analysis will adhere to the intent -to-treat principle.   
 
Healthcare utilization and costs . To ensure completen ess, w e will combine self -reported healthcare utilization 
(reported every 6 months) with data abstracted from patient EHRs. Duplicates will be eliminated, and if conflicting 
information arises, we will assume that the EHR is correct. All utilization will b e converted to cost using Medicare 
reimbursement rates. Using Medicare payment rates is a relatively standard approach in economic analysis 
because these rates provide a common metric for costing out services across all sectors of care (public or private)  
(49); this is important because we are actually interested in the underlying resource utilization, not differences in 
prices. Medicare is also a major payer in all health care markets; almost all payers ‘follow Medicare’s lead’ when 
determining payment rates. Finally, many Medicare reimbursement rates were originally determined based on 
cost studies; thus,  the Medicare relative fee structure bear s some resemblance to the underlying relative cost 
structure.   
 
For analysis of healthcare  utilization data, we will employ two -part Hurdle Poisson models that are appropriate for 
 16 ‘‘rate’’ data (e.g., visits per year) . If we find that the data are over -dispersed, we will also explore negative 
binomial models.  These models  will yield two sets of coefficients, one related to the probability of any utilization 
and the other related to the level of utilization conditional on having any utilization.  For cost data, we will employ 
two-part lognormal models to accommodate the high level of skewness. Agai n, this approach will yield two sets of 
coefficients: one related to probability of any cost and the other related to level of cost (conditional on having any 
cost). We have successfully used this  approach in previous studies.  We will also use survey repor ts from providers 
at clinic staff to accurately estimate costs to implement and maintain each intervention . For relative cost -
effectiveness, we will calculate [ADDRESS_196890] -effectiveness ratios , comparing App or 
App+Feedback versus usual  care at [ADDRESS_196891] of abbreviations

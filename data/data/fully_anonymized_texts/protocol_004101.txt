Study Title  
A Multi -Center, Double -Blind, Randomized, Parallel-Group Study Comparing Permethrin Cream, 5% 
(Mayne Pharma, Inc.) with Elimite™ in patients with active scabies . 
Type of Study  
Bioequivalence with Clinical Endpoints . 
Objectives  
Primary:  To demonstrate bioequivalence between Permethrin Cream, 5% (Mayne Pharma, Inc.) and 
Elimite™ in patients with active scabies.  
Secondary: To demonstrate comparative safety of Permethrin Cream, 5% (Mayne Pharma, Inc.) vs 
Elimite™ and tolerability of Permethrin Cream, 5% . 
Methodology  
This is a multi- center, double -blind, randomized, two arm  parallel design study. This study is 
comprised of two phases: screening and treatment. The screening period will be up to 5 days , 
followed by [CONTACT_663176] 28±[ADDRESS_895272] o r reference treatments in a double -blind manner in an outpatient 
setting.  Randomization of subjects will be in a 1:[ADDRESS_895273] and reference drug arms and will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Screening will begin at visit 1, during which eligibility will be determined and prohibited treatments 
will be discontinued.  Randomization will occur following the confirmation of the eligibility criteria at 
visit 2  (baseline , Day 1) i.e. initiation of treatment phase. The treatment phase will be 28±[ADDRESS_895274]  (either test or 
reference ) on Day 1 or  Baseline  (visit 2 ). Safety and tolerability assessments will be performed on 
Day 7  (visit 3) . Efficacy , safety  and tolerability will be assessed on Day 14 (visit 4) followed by [CONTACT_663177] 28 (visit 5).  If positive identification of scabies is  confirmed at Day  14 (visit 4), 
the subject will be retreated with the second  application of the investigational product.  
Planned Number of Subjects  
Number of subjects to be allocated to treatments according to a 1:[ADDRESS_895275]. Currently, enough drug is available for  a total  of N=140 
(enrolled subjects) to achieve N= [ADDRESS_895276]

Investigational Products, Dose and Mode of Administration: 
Test Drug:  Permethrin Cream, 5% , 60g, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], manufactured by [CONTACT_663180]. 
Reference Product:  Elimite™ 60g, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ma rketed  by [CONTACT_663181], Inc. (“Prestium”), the 
branded s ubsidiary of Renaissance Pharma. 
Standard of Care  (SOC) : Generic Permethrin Cream, 5%  60g available in the market  will be used for 
treatment of the household members  with active scabies or at a “high risk” of the disease . 
Dose During the Active Treatment Period:  Subjects will receive  a maximum of  two doses of the 
investigational product during the study. The first dose will be applied on Day 1  in an outpatient 
setting, after the visit to the clinical site (preferably in the evening) . The second dose will be applied 
on Day 14 ±[ADDRESS_895282] of care generic Permethrin Cream, 5% at the Baseline visit, sufficient for two applications: 
at the time of the Baseline visit of the participating study subject, and in two weeks - if the re -
treatment will be necessary  of the standard of care at Baseline visit . 
Route: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407], cove ring the entire area of the skin from the neck  down  to the feet.  
Study Duration: 28 Days  
Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that are identified as 
cured at Study Day 28. Cure is defined as the absence of new lesions  and the healing of all old lesions. 
Residual, dry, non -inflammatory  papules are not counted as active.  
Secondary Endpoint: The secondary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that are identified 
as cured at Study Day 14.  
Safety:  Analysis of safety variables will be based on all adverse event (AE) capture measuring 
severity and duration utilizing MedDRA terminology for consistency. Vital signs will also be 
reviewed and analyzed at the Baseline and at visit 5 (End of Study visit).  
Tolerability: Analysis of tolerability will be based on scores of Stinging/Burning and Itching 
sensations collected during Patient Self -Assessments at visits [ADDRESS_895283] and reference 
treatment groups.  
Statistical Methods:  To establish bioequivalence, the continuity -corrected 90% confidence interval

of the difference in the proportion of subjects with treatment success (defined as the absence of 
new lesions and the healing of all old lesions) between the test and reference products treatment 
groups at Study Day [ADDRESS_895285] be within [ -0.20, +0.20].  
Results in the (Per-Protocol ) PP population will be considered definitive and those in the mITT 
population as supportive.  
To assess treatment differences in the secondary endpoint,  the proportion of subjects that are 
identified as cured  in the test and reference treatment groups  at Study Day 14  will be analyzed 
following the same approach as described for Day 28. 
Populations for Analysis  
Safety Population: The safety population is any randomized individual who was enrolled into the 
study, and (b) received at least one dose of study treatment.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population: A modified intent -to-treat individual is any randomized 
individual who (a) met inclusion/exclusion criteria, (b) was enrolled into the study, (c) received at least one dose of the assigned study treatment, and (c) had at least one post -baseline visit.  
Per Protocol (PP) Population:  A per -protoc ol subject is any randomized individual who (a) met 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, (b) was enrolled into the study, (c) received the assigned study treatment , (d) had not taken any concomitant medications prohibited by [CONTACT_663182], and (e) completed the primary endpoint evaluation within the designated visit window ( ±4 days).  
Subjects whose condition worsens and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment 
of scabies during the study will be discontinued, included in both the mITT and PP population analyses as treatment failures. Subjects who discontinue early for reasons other than treatment failure will be excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT population, using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).  
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the per-protocol population as definitive and the mIT T 
population as supportive. Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety population.  
Efficacy  
Primary Endpoint : The proportion of subjects considered to be cured (defined as the absence of new 
lesions and the healing of all old lesions) on Study Day 28. To establish bioequivalence, the continuity -
corrected, 90% confidence interval for the test- to-reference difference in proportions of subjects 
cured must be within the equivalence limits - 0.20 to 0.20. Results in the PP population will be 
considered definitive and those in the mITT population as supportive.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
1.1 Background to the  Disease  
Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by [CONTACT_663186], Sarcoptes scabiei 
variety hominis. The scabies mite burrows and lives in the superficial layers of the skin and the females 
lay their eggs in tiny burrows, which can be  identified as tiny raised and crooked (serpi[INVESTIGATOR_106013]) grayish -
white or skin -colored lines on the skin surface  [1]. Mites can only live for [ADDRESS_895294] common symp toms of 
a scabies infestation are a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886] -like (papular) skin rash and intense itching that often increases at night. 
The symptoms are cause by a hypersensitivity of the skin to the mite and mite fecal matter and the rash 
is most commonly seen in areas such as the wrist, elbow, armpit, and webbing between the fingers, breast 
areola, and cutaneous  area of external genitalia,  waist, belt - line, and buttocks. Generally, the head, face, 
neck, palms, and soles of feet are unaffected areas in older children and adults  [2]. 
Scabies is found worldwide, affecting people of all races and social classes. It spreads rapi[INVESTIGATOR_663161], such as extended care facilities and nursing homes, as it is most commonly transmitted through direct sk in-to-skin contact [CONTACT_663187]. The common 
symptoms often arise within [ADDRESS_895295] cases, bet ween 10 
and 15 mites are present on an affected individual, though severe cases, known as crusted (Norwegian) 
scabies, could involve more than hundreds of mites and generally occurs in individuals  with weak immune 
systems such as the elderly, disabled, or debilitated.  
Diagnosis of a scabies infestation is made based on the appearance and distribution of the papular skin rash and identification of burrows. It is also common to confirm diagnosis with examination of a skin  
scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_130017] a microscope to identi fy the mite, mite eggs, or mite fecal matter (scybala). Treatment for 
scabies includes the use of scabicides, such as permethrin cream,  lindane, ivermectin, and crotamiton 
lotion, which act as insect -selective neurotoxins that result in paralysis and eventual death of the itch 
mites. The standard of care is to treat not only the infected individual, but also sexual partners and other 
household members who have had prolonged skin- to-skin contact [CONTACT_663188] (including 
bedmates) at the same time to prevent re -infestation.  
Scabicides should be applied to the entire body from the neck down to the feet and toes  (the area of 
application may be extended to the scalp and face  if these areas are affected, which was observed in 
infants and immunocompromised individuals ). The scabicide should be applied to clean skin and left on 
for the recommended time of application before washing it off. Elimite™  (permethrin) 5% Cream is 
recommended as a single application , which is usually sufficient to eradicate typi[INVESTIGATOR_663162], whether a

1.2 Rationale of the Study  
Systemic absorption of permethrin cream is limited to 0.5% during the first 48 hours following dermal 
application  [3]. In these settings,  a conventional pharmacokinetic human study to demonstrate that 
Mayne Permethrin cream (5%  w/w) is bioequivalent to the Reference Listed Drug [RLD] Elimite™  is not 
appropriate.  
Mayne Pharma, Inc. proposes to initiate a clinical endpoint bioequivalence (BE) study for a Permethrin 
Cream, 5% formulation for the treatment of active scabies  in comparison to Elimite™ Permethr in cream 
(5% w/w) . 
• Test Product: Permethrin Cream, 5% manufactured for Mayne Pharma, Inc. by [CONTACT_663189]., [ADDRESS_895298], Salisbury South SA 5016 Australia  
• Reference Product:  Elimite™ marketed by [CONTACT_663181], Inc. (“Prestium”), the branded 
subsidiary of Renaissance Pharma.  
As per Center of Disease Control (CDC) Suggested General Guidelines  on Scabies treatment, infested 
person, as well as household members and sexual contacts, particularly those who have had prolonged direct skin -to-skin contact [CONTACT_663190] [4] . All 
persons should be treated at the same time to prevent re- infestation. In consideration of  this 
recommendation, the household members of the enrolled sub ject will be examined and treated at the 
same time as the enrolled subject with an FDA- approved  generic Permethrin Cream, 5%. The treatment 
received by [CONTACT_941] h ousehold members of the enrolled subject will be referred to as “Standard of Care” 
throughout the s tudy .

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Study Objectives 
2.1.1 Primary Objective  
To demonstrate bioequivalence between Permethrin Cream, 5% (Mayne Pharma, Inc.) and Elimite™ in 
patients with active scabies.  
2.1.2 Secondary Objective  
To demonstrate comparative safety of Permethrin Cream, 5% (Mayne Pharma, Inc.) vs Elimite™ and 
tolerability of Permethrin Cream, 5%.  
2.2 Study Endpoints  
2.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that are identified as cured at  Study Day 28. Cure 
is defined as the absence of new lesions and the healing of all old lesions. Residual, dry, non- inflammatory  
papules are not counted as active.  
2.2.2 Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that are identified as cured at Study Day 14.  
2.3 Safety Variables  
Analysis of safety variables will be based on all adverse event (AE) capture measuring severity and 
duration utilizing MedDRA terminology  for consistency. V ital signs will also be reviewed and analyzed  at 
the Baseline  and at  visit 5 (End of Study  visit). 
2.4 Tolerability Assessments  
Analysis of tolerability will be based on scores of Stinging/Burning and Itching sensations collected during Patient Self-Assessments at visits [ADDRESS_895300] and reference treatm ent groups.

Amendment  1 Version 2.0; [ADDRESS_895301], Permethrin Cream, 5% ( Mayne Pharma , Inc.), and the Reference product, 
Elimite™ in patients with active scabies. The diagnosis of scabies is made based on the evaluation of 
burrows, inflammatory papules and excoriations and with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_663156] 
(webbed spaces of the fingers, flexor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, axillae, belt line, feet, skin surface of external genitalia, or areolae), presence of family or contacts with moderate to severe itching which 
increases during the night, and positive identification of mites, mite eggs, or mite fecal m atter (scybala) 
via microscopic evaluation of skin lesion  scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]  [1,2] .
 Treatment success in this study is based on 
previously published studies of scabies infestations and defined as the absence of new lesions and the 
healing of all old lesions due to scabies mites and eggs within the treatment area  [5-7]. The assigned 
investigational product will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (after washing) preferably in the evening on the day of the Baseline  visit (Day 1) . 
Eligibility criteria requires that all regular bedmates and family members with prolonged physical contact

Section  5.8.2. 
If signs  of active scabies  infestation are present at visit 4 (Day  14±2), the study subject will be retreated 
with a second application of the ir assigned IP . Household members of the participating study subject  will 
be asked to reapply the standard of care generic Permethrin Cream, 5% at the same visit.  
This study is comprised of two phases: screening and treatment. The  screening phase will be up to 5 days 
in duration and treatment phase will be 28±4 days in duration. Approximately 140 subjects  (or as many 
as 228 subjects) , at least [ADDRESS_895302] number. The double -blind 
randomization of subjects will be in a 1:[ADDRESS_895303]’s medical history will be recorded along with concomitant medications and, 
at this point, prohibited treatments must be assessed as they should be discontinued according to the 
timeframes outlined in section 5.[ADDRESS_895304]’s scabies infestation 
will be evaluated for papules and burrows  during the visual examination. Presence of acarids, feces , or 
ova will be assessed via microscopic exam of skin lesion scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Subjects who meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will return to the office for visit 2 within 5 days.

Subject will return at v isit 3 (Day 7±1) with the used investigational product tube and subject diaries. 
Compliance with investigational product applications will be assessed. Safety and tolerability assessments 
will be conducted.  
At visit 4 (Day 14 ±2), subjects will return for efficacy, safety and tolerability assessments . If signs of active 
scabies infection  are present at this visit, the subject will be treated with a 2nd application of their assigned 
investigational product  as defined in Section 5.6.  
Final efficacy , safety and tolerability assessments will occur at visit 5 (Day 28±4). If the subject was 
retreated,  the used tube of the investigational product will be returned at this visit. The duration of each 
subject’s participation in the study will be a maximum of 37  days.  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects considered to be cured (defined as the absence of new lesions and the healing of all old lesion s) on Study Day 28. To establish bioequivalence, the continuity -

6.2 Study Procedures and Evaluations  
6.2.1 Clinical Evaluations  
The following clinical evaluations will be conducted during the course of the study:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Demographics  
Basic demographic information, including date of birth, sex, ethnicity, and race will be recorded at the 
Screenin g visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical history   
Medical history will be collected at the Screening visit  and updated at the visit 2 . Relevant medical history 
(with particular emphasis on previous scabies infestations, related skin disorders and other medical 
conditions that may  lead to exclusion) and significant ongoing medical  conditions or diseases will be 
documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical examination  
Physical examination, including height, weight, and evaluation of organs and systems ( General 
Appearance, Heart/Cardiovascular, Lungs,  Gastrointestinal, Ears / Nose / Throat, Extremities, and Skin ) 
will be assessed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be collected at the Screening visit; on the  Baseline , and at  visit 5 (or upon subject 
discontinuation). Vital signs will include body temperature  (oral), heart rate and blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic). Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been sitting restfully 
for at least 5 minutes. Any abnormal characteristics will be evaluated by [CONTACT_663202]. Abnormal vital signs will be considered AEs if they require therapeutic medical 
intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be AEs due to the clinical judgement.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visual Examination of Lesions  
At the Screening (visit  1) and Baseline (visit 2) visits, visual examination of skin lesions will be performed 
by [CONTACT_663203]. Active lesions, defined as inflammatory papules, excoriations and burrows will be assessed and mapped to the body areas (webbed spaces of t he fingers, flexor surfaces of the wrists, 
elbows, axillae, belt line, feet, skin surface of external genitalia, areolae and other areas). Residual, dry, 
non-inflammatory papules will not be counted as active. At  visits 3, 4 and 5 the examination will be 
repeated, identifying the course of healing of old lesions and identification of new elements. The 
examination results will be captured in the e CRF and in the source documentation.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 66 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Assessments  
Beginning with the first dose/application of the i nvestigational product and through visit  5 (End of Study), 
the Investigator and study personnel will review each subject’s clinical evaluation findings and query the 
subject directly regarding AEs  (see Section 7 , Safety Data Collection, Recording and Reporting ). Subjects 
must be followed for AEs until the final required protocol visit or until all drug- related toxicities and SAEs 
have resolved (or ar e considered chronic/stable), whichever is later.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Medication Recording  
All medications (both prescription and nonprescription,  and including vitamins, herbals, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], inhaled, 
and intranasal) taken  within [ADDRESS_895343]  and through the final 
study visit  will be recorded on the appropriate e CRF (using their generic and brand name, if known) with 
the corresponding indication. At each study visit, subjects will be  asked whether they have started or 
discontinued any medication since their previous  study visit. This includes single use or PRN (as needed) 
medication use.  
6.2.2 Laboratory Evaluations  
The following laboratory evaluations will be conducted during the course of the study: 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Microscopic Examination of Skin Scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_663167] (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will perform a scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_663168], eggs, or mite fecal matter (scybala) under the light microscopy. This can be done by [CONTACT_663204] a needle or by 
[CONTACT_663205][INVESTIGATOR_663169], papular, or lesioned areas of the skin to examine 
under a microscope for mites, eggs, or mite’s fecal matter.   
New lesions identified at visits 3, 4 or 5 will be confirmed by [CONTACT_663206][INVESTIGATOR_007] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy test  
A urine  pregnancy test will be performed at Screening  and at the End of Study  (EOS) visit for females of 
childbearing potential (refer to Section 6.1.3 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Measures for 
definitions) . The Screening results must be available and must be negative before the subject takes the 
first dose/first applicatio n of Investigational Product . 
6.2.3 Patient Self -Assessment  
Subjects will perform a self -assessments of itching and stinging/burning sensations ( Appendix D. Patient 
Self-Assessment ) at visits 2, 3, [ADDRESS_895344] the grading of itching and stinging/bu rning 
sensations. The Patient Self -Assessment Worksheets will be filed alo ng with the source documentation 
and the self -assessments data  provided by [CONTACT_663207]. Information captured on the Patient S elf-Assessment will not be documented as an Adverse Event.

If the Investigator assesses the subject’s condition at any time and determines that the subject’s condition 
has worsened to the degree that it is unsafe for the subject to continue in the study, the subject may be 
discontinued from the  study as treatment failure. Visit [ADDRESS_895354] of care treatment may be advised at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Subjects discontinuing from the study sooner than the Day  28 visit will undergo the  Early  Termination  (ET) 
visit at the earliest possible date . If the Investigator decides to discontinue a subject at any time during 
the study, a standard care of treatment may be advised at the Investigator’s discretion, and an EOS/ET visit preferably prior to receiving any standard of care treatment.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_895355]’s condition will be  considered as 
worsening.

Amendment  1 Version 2.0; [ADDRESS_895356] any  AE in detail including the 
date of onset, description, severity, time course, duration and outcome, relationship of the adverse event 
to study drug, an alternate etiology for events not considered “related” or “probably related” to study 
drug, final diagn osis, if known, and any action(s) taken. For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events 
must be of similar nature and severity and each intermittent AE will be reported separately. AEs and SAEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786] , or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_303409] , monitored and followed -up until the resolution (or until the Investigator deems the event to 
be stable/chronic).

laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
investigational product.  
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre -existing 
condition or illness is considered an AE. Clinically significant abnormalities are to be followed to  resolution 
(i.e. become stable, return to normal, return to  Baseline , or become explainable).  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, and/or if the Investigato r considers them to be AEs.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to the Biorasi Safety and Pharmacovigilance 
as a serious adverse event (SAE) using SAE report form within 24 hours of occurrence or notification to the study site:  
Death of Subject  An event that results in the death of a subject.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , would have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does  not 
include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more 
severe form.

Congenital 
Anomaly/birth defect  An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that result in fetal loss.  
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/Incapacity  An event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor  medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle).  
Other Important 
Medical Event  An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospit alization, but based on medical judgment may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life- 
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], c ongenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
7.2 Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE  and SAE : 
Mild  The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
Moderate  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.  
Severe  The event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening.  
7.3 Causality of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE /SAE  to the use of 
 
Protocol Number: MAP -8184  
Amendment  1 Version 2.0; [ADDRESS_895359]:  
Definitely Related  The event occurred within a reasonable time after drug administration or drug 
concentrati on and body fluids demonstrated that the study drug was present: 
the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_663212][INVESTIGATOR_014]; the adverse event abated after discontinuing the study 
drug.  
Probably Related  The event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug or recurs on re -
challenge and another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possibly Related  The event has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug and an 
alternative etiology is equall y or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to study drug.  
Probably Not 
Related  The event has little or no temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a 
more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not Related  The event is due to an underlying  or concurrent illness or effect of another drug 
and is not related to the study drug ( e.g., has no temporal relationship to study 
drug or has a much more likely alternative etiology).  
If an Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_147530], probably not, or not related  to study drug is given, an alternate 
etiology must be provided by [CONTACT_663213].  
7.4 Adverse Event Collection Period  
Any AE/SAE prior to the Baseline  visit will be considered past medical history (PMH). The AE reporting 
period for this study begins upon receiving the first application of investigational product and ends at the 
final protocol required visit. SAE(s) that are observed or spontaneously reported during the subject’s 
participation in the trial will be captured and monitored until the Investigator deems the event to be 
chronic or not clinically significant or the subject to be stable.

8. DATA ANALYSIS  
The sections below summarize the intended statistical methods and analyses of data for the study. A  more 
detailed statistical analysis plan will be written prior to finalization of the clinical trial database. Any 
changes to the planned methods and analyses will be described and justified in the protocol and/or in the 
final clinical study report, as app ropriate.  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study, with  confidence 
intervals calculated  for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Unless stated otherwise, the term 
“descriptive statistics” refers to number  of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 
and maximum for continuous data and frequencies and proportions for categorical data. The term 
“treatment group” refers to randomized treatment assignment: active -test and active- reference. All data 
collected during the study will be included in data listings. Unless otherwise noted, the data will be sorted first by [CONTACT_15500], subject number, and then by [CONTACT_395038].  
Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing will be two -sided and will be performed using a 
significance (alpha) level of 0.05
. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, version 9.1.[ADDRESS_895366] Population/Data Sets to Be Evaluated 
The subject populations are de fined as follows:  
1. Safety Population: The safety population is any randomized individual who (a) was enrolled into the study, and (b) received at least one dose of study treatment.  
2. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population: A modified intent -to-treat subject is any 
randomized individual who (a) met inclusion/exclusion criteria, (b) was enrolled into the study, 
(c) received  at least  one dose of the assigned study treatment, and (c)  had at least one post -
baseline visit.  
3. Per Protocol (PP) Population:  A pe r-protocol subject is any randomized individual who (a) met 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, (b) was enrolled into the study, (c) received the assigned study treatment , (d) had not taken any concomitant medications prohibited by [CONTACT_663215] y major deviations that interfered with or may have interfered with the 
therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy, and (e) completed the primary endpoint evaluation within the designated visit window ( ±4 
days). 
Subjects whose condition worsens and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment of scabies during the study will be discontinued, included in both the mITT and PP population analyses as 
treatment failures. Subjects who discontinue early for reasons other than treatment failure will be 
excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT population, using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).  
 
Protocol Number: MAP -8184  
Amendment  1 Version 2.0; [ADDRESS_895367] 88%, sample size evaluations 
were conducted, via comput er simulation,  to determine the probability (power) of  the 
calculated  90%  continuity -corrected  confidence interval on the Test -to-Reference difference 
in cure  proportions to be contained in the bioequivalence interval [ -0.20, +0.20].  When the Test product  
was assumed to have the same 88% cure rate, the required number of PP subjects in each treatment 
group was determined to be 56 (112 total) for a power ≥0.80.  Allowing for up to 20% of the  subjects  to 
not qualify  for the PP population, 70 subjects in each  treatment group (140 total) would be needed.  
If it is assumed that the Test product cure rate might deviate from that of the Reference by [CONTACT_45848] 
2% (e.g. 86% instead of 88%) and  if a higher  power,  ≥0.95,  was desired, then  91 PP subjects in each 
treatm ent group  (182 total)  would be needed.  To allow for up to 20% of the subjects to not qualify  for 
the PP population, 114 subjects in each treatment group (228  total) would need to be enrolled.    
8.[ADDRESS_895368] Disposition and Demography  
Descriptive statistics will be generated by [CONTACT_663216]. The number 
and percentage of subjects in each class of categorical demographic and Baseline variables (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity, and race) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. Individual subject demographic and Baseline 
characteristic data will be listed.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_895369] will be 
established if the 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions cured between test and 
reference treatment is contained within t he equivalence limits [ -0.20, +0.20].  
In this case, the compound hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0: pT – p R < -0.20 or p T – p R > 0.20 (meaning test product is not bioequivalent to the reference);  
HA: -0.20 ≤ p T –p R ≤ 0.20 (supporting bioequivalence);  
where p T = cure rate of test treatment, p R = cure rate of reference treatment.  
Let n T = sample size of test treatment group, n R = sample size of reference treatment group and 
se = (𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇 �(1−𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇 �)𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇+ ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 �(1−𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 �)𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅) ⁄1
2. 
The 90% confidence interval will be es timated as follows, using Yates correction:

H0 is rejected if L ≥ - 0.20 and U ≤ 0.20 resulting in accepting H A and concluding bio equivalence of the two 
products.  
The primary endpoint is the evaluation at Day 28. The results in the PP population will be considered 
definitive, with those in the mITT population as supportive.  
As a secondary end point evaluation, patients’ clinical progress at  visit 4 (Day 14) will be asses sed and 
proportion of cured patients in  each of the  treatment arms will be comp ared using the procedure above.  
8.3.3 Assessment of retreatment 
Proportion of subjects requiring retreatment in each of the treatment group s will be compared 
descriptively.  
8.3.4 Assessment  of Tolerability  
Descriptive statistics using categorical methods will be used to compare tolerability measures (scores of 
Stinging/Burning and Itching sensations collected during Patient Self -Assessments) between the test and 
reference treatment groups.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_895371]. The variables for safety endpoints  are AEs and vital signs  measurements . AEs will 
be summarized based o n the frequency of AEs and their severity for all treated subjects.  All AEs will be 
coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Data will be summarized using preferred term and primary system organ c lass.  
If a subject  experiences  multiple  events that map to a single preferred term, the greatest severity and 
strongest Investigator assessment of relation to study drug will be assigned to the preferred term for the 
appropriate summaries. Should an event have a missing severity or relationship, it will be classified as 
having the highest severity and/or strongest relationship to study  drug.  
Summaries of treatment -emergent AEs will include any AEs reported beginning with the first dose of study 
drug on Day 1. The occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_663217], system organ classifications, and severity. Separate summaries of treatment -
emergent serious adverse events, treatment- emergent adverse events related to study drug, and events 
leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be generated. All adverse events reported will be listed 
for individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred terms.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary.

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, (e.g., recruitment advertisements, 
if applicable) from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC will be retained in the Investigator 
File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to the Sponsor or its designee.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment  may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the 
change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In case of such an event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and the Sponsor in writing immediately after the implem entation.  
9.3 Other Required Approvals  
In addition to IRB/IEC approval, all other required approvals (e.g. approval from local Research and 
Development Board or Scientific Committee) required by [CONTACT_663219] (s). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to notify the Sponsor and the CRO of

9.[ADDRESS_895377]’s right to protection against 
invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source dat a will only be linked to the Sponsor’s 
clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number. As permitted by [CONTACT_98651], limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, and subject 
initials ma y be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique identification number.  
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the Sponsor requires 
the Investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor , representatives from any regulatory 
authority (e.g., FDA), the Sponsor’s designated auditors, and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the 
subject’s original medical records (source data or documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory 
test result reports, ECG reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119252] a subject’s study participation, and autopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific authorization of the subject as  part of the informed consent process.

10. ADMINISTRATIVE OBLIG ATIONS  
10.1 Source Documentation Forms  
The Investigator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits/inspections, IRB/IEC review and 
regulatory inspection providing direct access to source documents, including all medical records or 
pertinent  data relevant to the audit/inspection.  Source documents will represent a record of the raw data. 
Source document templates may be provided by [CONTACT_663221]. If provided by [CONTACT_977], the source document template must be provided to the Sponsor prior to subject r ecruitment. 
The source documents will become part of the subject's permanent medical record maintained by [CONTACT_42042]. If computerized systems are used to create, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve or transmit 
source data, they must comply with the applicable regulatory regulations and/or guidances (ex. 21 CFR 
Part 11 and 312).  
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be used in this study. eCRFs are required and should be completed for each 
subject participating in the study. e CRFs will contain data captured from subject source documents  and 
results of laboratory tests. In most cases, the source documents are contained in the subject’s chart at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s office. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those 
chart s. Data must be transcribed from the source documents (e.g. physical exam report, associated 
medical records, date and version of informed consent form) onto the e CRF by [CONTACT_663222].  
Any corrections to entries made in the source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if 
necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the 
accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data 
entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms.  
Investigator will sign e CRFs  electronically after completion of data entry, to attest that the data contained 
on the CRFs is complete and accurate.  Completed e CRFs are the sole p roperty of the Sponsor and should 
not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor 
or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor.  
10.[ADDRESS_895379] Retention  
To enable evalua tions and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, 
e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed Informed Consent Forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, 
source documents, detailed records of drug disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  
The records will be retained by [CONTACT_663223]  (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  
 
Protocol Number: MAP -8184  
Amendment  1 Version 2.0; [ADDRESS_895380] 2016    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 66 
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required 
period (e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor will be prospectively notified. The study records must 
be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another Investigator, another institution, 
or to the Sponsor. The Inv estigator must obtain Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any 
records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
10.3 Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA)  
10.3.[ADDRESS_895381] periodic monitoring visits to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are being followed. The monitors will review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The Investigator/institution will all ow 
the Sponsor’s monitors or designees and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source 
documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may also be subject to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_396586], and/or review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, and/or to  inspection by 
[CONTACT_663224](s) and their relevant personnel are available during the  monitoring 
visits and possible audits or in spections, and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_895382] to study subjects. The site should document all protocol deviations  (PDs)  in the subject’s source 
documents. In the event  of a significant deviation, the site will notify the Sponsor or its designee (and IRB 
or IEC, as  required). Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misc onduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessments. Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria will not be permitted unless written 
approval by [CONTACT_663225], Inc. has been obtained. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require deviation from protocol- specified procedures, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_663226].

10.4 Trial Discontinuation/Investigative Site Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of 
subjects, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  
After suc h a decision, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_27936] a time period specified 
by [CONTACT_391807].  
10.4.1  Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
The following criteria may result in either temporary suspension or early termination of the study:  
 New information regarding the safety or efficacy of the investigational product  that indicates a 
change in the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the risk/benefit is no longer 
acceptable for subjects participating in the study.  
 Significant violation of GCP that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study objectives 
or compromises subject safety.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial  for other valid administrative reasons.  
10.4.2  Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites  
A study site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the Investigator) is found to be in significant violation of GCP, protocol, contractual agreement, or is unable to ensure adequate performance of the study.  
10.4.3  Procedures for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or Investigational 
Site(s)  
In the event that the Sponsor elects to terminate or suspend the study  or the participation of an 
investigational site, a study -specific procedure for early termination or suspension will be provided by [CONTACT_429]; the procedure will be followed by [CONTACT_663227] s uspension.

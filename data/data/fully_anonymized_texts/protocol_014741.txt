Uveit is is a heterogenous group of intraocular inflammat ion disorders with both exogenous 
(infection, trauma) and endogenous (autoimmune disorders, idiopathic) etio logies.  The most 
widely used classification of u veitis is based on the anatomical lo cation of the inflammat ion
within the eye .  Anteri or uvei tis is the m ost common ty pe and can invo lve the cornea, iris, and/or 
ciliary  body.  Interm ediate uveit is affects the middle portion of the eye, such as the ciliary body , 
anteri or vitreous and peripheral ret ina.  Posteri or uveit is can invo lve the vitreous, choroid, retina, 
and/or optic nerve.  Panuveit is, also referred to as diffuse, involves the anteri orand posterior 
segments.
Uveit is is responsible for approximate ly 10% of the visual handicap in Western countries 
(Nussenblatt, 1990) .  The prevalence of posterior uveit is and its associated ocular morbidit y is 
not wel l characteri zed.  However, one study  of an Israeli popul ation and another of a Netherlands 
popul ation approximated that 15 to 22% of uveit is affect the posterior segment (Rothova et al., 
1996; Weiner et al., 1991), while the study  of Veterans Affairs pat ients estimated 10% with 
posteri or uvei tis (Suhle r et al ., 2008) .  The study  of the Netherlands populat ion also found that in 
patients wi th posteri or uvei tis, 46% experienced visual loss of <20/40 or greater and 28% 
experienced macular edema (Rothova et al ., 1996) .  In chronic uveit is, cumulat ive structural 
damage and l oss of  visio n result fro m recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_163006]. T- cell infiltrat ion is 
primarily responsible for the inflammat ion (Barton et al ., 1995) .  T-cells release cytokines 
including various interleukins (IL- 2, IL -4, and IL -10) and interferon gamma (Barton et al ., 
1995) .  Maj or histocom patibilit y complex mo lecules (MHC Class I and II) and adhesio n 
molecules are upregulated by  [CONTACT_163022] (Charteris et al., 1992; George et al., 1997; 
Whitcup et al., 1992a) .  In experimental uveit is models, adhesi on molecules have been found on 
ocular resident cells before leukocy tes reach the inside of the ey e (Whitcup et al ., 1993; Whitcup 
et al., 1992b) .  Thus, adhesio n mole cules enable leukocy tes to mi grate to the si te of 
inflammat ion, contribut ing to the inflammatory cascade that occurs with active uveit is.
Corti costeroi ds are the m ainstay  of treatm ent for active, non -infectious uveit is.  Corticosteroids 
are administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], by [CONTACT_163023], via intrav itrealinjecti on and implant, or 
systemically .  Topi [INVESTIGATOR_163007]. In 
general, periocular corticosteroid inject ions are appropriate for intermediate uveit is. Ret isert™ is 
a fluocino lone acetonide intr avitreal implant which releases drug slowly  over a peri od of  months.  
This product was approved by  [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in [ADDRESS_189223] 
extracti on and a si gnificant percentage require treatment to reduce IOP (Callanan et al., 2008).  
Even though this newer treatment approa ch is now available, many patients with chronic, 
posteri or uvei tis are more difficult to manage and require systemic corticosteroids due to 
recurring inflammat ion.  Co -morbidities fro m systemic corticosteroid use are well known, such 
as Cushingo id syndrome, di abetes, osteoporotic bones, and metabolic disturbances (Anglade et 
al., 2007) .  Systemic immunosuppressive agents, alt hough they  requi re close m onitoring, are 
therefore somet imes utilized for their steroid -sparing capabilit ies.  Immunosuppressive agents 
can be categorized into three (3) main class es: T -cell inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), 
antimetabo lites (azathioprine, m ethotrexate, mycopheno late mofetil, l eflunomide), and alkylat ing 
2.0% DE -109 Injectable So lution Protocol  32-009
Versi on 30JUN2014 16 CONFIDENTIALagents (cy clophosphamide, chl orambucil).  More recently, bio logic agents have been explored 
for use in uveit is, including tum or necrosis factor -α inhibitors (infliximab, etanercept, and 
adalimumab), ant i-lymphocy te agents (ri tuximab and alemtuzumab), and an interleukin-2 
receptor blocker (daclizumab).
Current ly corticosteroids are the only approved drug class in the [LOCATION_002] for non -infect ious 
uveit is. Systemic cy closporine which blocks T- cell activat ion and inhibit s the producti on of  
cytokines has been approved in [LOCATION_013]  and a few other countri es for treatment -refractory  
uveit is but is not approved in the U nited States.  Although a variet y of treatm ent opti ons are 
available, the co -morbidities associ ated wi th corti costeroids and the inconvenience of close 
monitoring required wit h systemic immunosuppressive and bio logic agents warrant more 
treatm ent opti ons.
Sirolimus for ocul ar administrati on is being tested with a proprietary  formulation, DE -[ADDRESS_189224] ious, posterior uveit is.  This proprietary  formulation was originally 
developed by [CONTACT_163024], Inc. and in June 2010, Santen, Inc. acqu ired the worl dwide ri ghts to 
the form ulation.  The formulat ion provi des drug exposure to the retina/choroid for up to 
approximately  2 months, and is amenable to delivery  by [CONTACT_163025].  
The active pharmaceut ical ingredient in the formulation is si rolimus. Si rolimus, also known as 
rapamycin, was isolated in the 1970’s fro m Streptomyces hygroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_163008] m 
Easter Island (Napoli et al., 2001) .  Siro limus is the active pharmaceut ical ingredient in 2 
products approved by [CONTACT_1622], specifically  Rapamune®, an immunosuppressive agent used in 
renal transplant patients, and the CYPHER®sirolimus -eluting Coronary Stent approved for 
improving coronary  luminal  diameter in pat ients wit h symptomatic ischemic disease.
The m echanism  of action of siro limus in inmmunoregulat ion has been described extensiv ely in 
the literature (Kahan, 2001; Napoli et al., 2001; Sehgal, 1998; Sehgal, 2003) .  Sirolimus blocks 
T-lymphocy te activat ion and smooth muscle and endothelial cell pro liferat ion that occurs in 
response to ant igenic and cytokine (IL -2, IL -4 and IL -15) stimulat ion emplo ying eit her 
Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent pathways (Rapam une, 2009; Sehgal, 1995; Sehgal, 1998) .  
Sirolimus arrests cell cycle progression by [CONTACT_163026] 2 intracellular proteins, 
specifically the immunophilin FK binding protein 12 (FKBP -12) and the m ammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR), a mult ifunctional serine -threonine kinase (Napoli  et al ., 2001) .  In cells, 
sirolimus binds to FKBP -12, and the result ing siro limus: FKBP -12 com plex then binds to and 
inhibits mTOR.  The inhibit ion of mTOR blocks IL -2 mediated si gnal transducti on pathways that 
prevent cell cycle progression fro m G1 to S phase in T cells, endothelial cells, osteosarcoma 
cells, myogenic cell lines and smooth muscle cells (Kwon et al., 2005; Sehgal, 1998) .  In 
addition, si rolimus inhibits the production of ant ibodies (Sehgal, 1995; Sehgal, 1998) .  Sirolimus 
has also been shown to down -regul ate the expression o f many genes related to inflammat ion 
such as interleukin -8, endothelial -monocy te activating polypept ide II, granulocy te chem otacti c 
protein 2, cy clooxygenase 1 and 2, and inducible nitric oxide synt has(Adamis, 2002; Attur et al., 
2000; Joussen et al., 2004; Nuhrenberg et al., 2005) .
Similar to cy closporine, si rolimus blocks T -cell activat ion and inhibits the production of 
inflammatory  cytokines.  Moreover, tacrolimus, another immunomodulatory  agent cl osely 
related to siro limus, has shown effect iveness in uveit is refractory  to cy closporine (Kilmart in et 
al., 1998; Sl oper et al ., 1999) .  Since siro limus provides an inhibitory effect on inflammation, it 
may be beneficial in the treatment of active, non -infect ious uveit is.
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189225] study (Nguyen et 
al., 2013) .  This was an init ial Phase I study  eval uating intravi treal and subconjunct ival 
administration of siro limus and the resul ts of the study  supported the continued development of 
DE-109.
The SAKURA development program  is a mult inational, mult icenter, randomized, doubl e-
masked protocol ( Santen Protocol  32-007) assessing the safety  and efficacy  of three doses of 
DE-109 (44 µg, 440 µg and 880 µg) administered every [ADDRESS_189226] ically significant differences for the 
primary  and key  secondary  endpoints when co mpared to the 44 µg dose. Efficacy results for the 
880 µ g dose regimen were not as significant compared to the 44 µg dose. Addit ionally , there was 
a tend ency towards increased reporting of AEs associated with intraocular inflammat ion 
following intravitreal administration with the 880 µg dose. In the overall analysis, the 440 µ g 
dose demonstrated a more favorable Benefit -Risk profile than the 880 µg dose.   The SAKURA 
development program is on -going and continues to enroll.
This study  (Santen, Protocol 32 -009) is being init iated to allow subjects continued acc ess to
DE-109 ( 440 µg )following partici pation in the SAKURA program and to obtain addit ional

The l ong-term efficacy  ofDE-109 ( 440 µg )may be explored by [CONTACT_103701].
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189264] a causal  relationship wi th study  drug. An AE therefore can 
be an unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigat ional) product, whether or not 
related to the medici nal (invest igational) product.
In clinical studi es, an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including baseline or 
wash -out peri od, may  be recorded as an AE even if no study  drug has been administered.
Any significant change in a subject’s condit ion from baseline, regardless of causalit y, is to be 
considered an AE, unless the change is determined to be a continuat ion of a pre- exist ing 
condi tion that i s docum ented in the subject’s medical history . However, a clinically significant 
worsening in severit y, intensity, or f requency  of a pre -exist ing condi tion may  indicate an AE.
Lack of efficacy o f the study  drug for the condit ion being investigated is not considered an AE
unless a clinically significant change is assessed by [CONTACT_24342] .  In addition, any elect ive 
surgi cal procedure scheduled or planned prior to study  entry  isnot considered an AEand the 
underlying diagnosis for which surgery is to be performed should be captured in the medical 
history  as a pre -exist ing condit ion.
For thi s protocol , an AE i s any on-study untoward medical occurrence (e.g. sign, symptom, 
disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that occurs in a study  subject, regardl ess of the suspected 
cause and regardless of timing of DE -109 (440 µg) administration. An on -study  AE can occur 
anytime after the date of informed consent through the last study  visit. An AE will be considered 
as treatment -emergent if the AE occurred on or after the date of the first DE -109 (440 µg) 
treatm ent up to the last study  visit.  Treatm ent-emergent AEs are a subset of on -study  AEs.  Both 
on-study  and treatm ent-emergent AEs will be reported.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Adverse Events
Invest igators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact .Subjects should be as ked 
using a general, non -direct questi on if there has been any  change in their general heal thor well -
being . Direct questioning and examinat ion should th en be performed as appropriate.
Severit y of the AE should be assessed according to the following crite ria:
Mild: Aware or unaware of event, but easily tolerated
Moderate: Disco mfort enough to cause interference with usual activi ties
Severe: Incapacitat ing; unable to work or perform usual act ivity.
Regardless of severit y, som e AEs may also meet regulatory  serious cri teria.  Refer to definit ions 
and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) in Secti on 12.1.2 .
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189265] make the determinat ion of relationship to the 
study  drug for each AE ( related or not related) .  The Invest igator should decide whether, in his or 
her m edical  judgment, there is a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE/SAE 
based on facts, evidence, science -based rational es, and clinical judgmen t.  When assessing 
causalit y, the Investi gator m ay consider the following information when determining the 
relationship to the study  drug for each AE: mechanism of act ion, bio logic pl ausibilit y, 
confounding risk factors (i.e. ,medical history , concomitant medications), tem poral  relati onship, 
dechallenge/rechallenge, and lack of alternative explanat ion.
The AEmaybe recorded as Related to study drug if there is a plausible temporal 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study  drug, and the 
AE cannot be readily explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, inter -current illness, or 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE fo llows a known pattern of response to the study  
drug; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuat ion of the study drug or dose 
reducti on and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge .
Reporting the AEas Not Related to study  drug may be considered if, for example, there 
is good evidence that the AE has an etio logy other than the study  drug (e.g., pre -exist ing 
medical condi tion, underlying disease, inter -current illness, or conco mitant m edicat ion); 
and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study  drug
(e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_189266] dose of study  drug ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adver se Events 
AEs, whether spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_163030], will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF. Each recorded AE 
will be described by [CONTACT_13114] s durati on (i.e.,start and end dates), severit y, regul atory  seriousness 
criteria if applicable, suspected relat ionship to the study  drug, and acti ons taken.
AEs that occur after any  subject has provi ded wri tten informed consent up to Month [ADDRESS_189267] igator should 
perform  reasonable fo llow-up efforts as necessary (e.g. telephone contact, post -study  office visit) 
to determine the outcome o f the event.  To improve the qualit y and precisio n of acquired AE 
data, Investigators should observe the fo llowing guidelines:
Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording .  Do not use 
colloquialisms and/or abbreviat ions.
If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than co mponent sig ns and 
symptoms (e.g., record congest ive heart failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis) .  
However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease 
shoul d be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart fai lure and severe headache 
are observed at the same t ime and are clinically unrelated, each event should be recorded as 
an individual AE).
AEs occurring secondary  to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be ident ified by [CONTACT_163031].  A primary  AE, if c learly  identifiable, generally represents the most accurate clinical 
term.  If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be 
described in the narrative descript ion of the case .
2.0% DE -109 Injectable So lution Protocol  32-009
Versi on 30JUN2014 37 CONFIDENTIALFor example:
The subject developed orthos tatic hypotensi on and subsequent ly fainted and fell to 
the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.
The primary  AE in this example is orthostatic hypotension.
For intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache) and events that occur wit h each 
instillation (e.g., eyes burn for 5 minutes after every dose), the event start date should be 
recorded as the date the subject first started to experience the event .  The end date should 
reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped. For exa mple, if a subject ha dan 
intermittent headache from 14 MAY 2014 until 21 MAY 2014 and each individual headache 
lasts 3 hours a day , then the date of resol ution is 21 MAY 2014 (not 14 MAY 2014 ).
For intermittent events, record the maximum severit y of the i ndividual events. For example, 
if a subject complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the severit y of each 
headache ranges fro m mild to moderate, then the severit y woul d be m oderate.
If an event occurs with each inst illation (e.g., ey es burn mild to m oderate for 5 minutes after 
every dose), record the maximum severit y of the individual incident. In the example a bove, 
the severit y is moderate.
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
SAEs are defined as any  findings that suggest a significant hazard, con traindica tion, side effect, 
or precaution. Any adverse event is considered a serious adverse event if it results in any o f the 
following outcom es:
Death
Life threatening:
A life-threatening event is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as i t occurred; i t does not refer to an event that hy potheti cally  might have 
caused death if it were more severe.
In-subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_163014]/or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
A persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
A congenital anomaly/b irth defect
Sight threatening event:
A sight -threatening event is any  event that pl aces the subject at immediate risk of 
perm anent ly losing visio n in eit her eye as a direct result of the event (See Section 12.1.3 ).
Other medically significant events:
Other medically significant events are events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may jeopardi ze the 
subject and may  require m edical  or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the outcom es

Deat h-Death is an outcome of an event .  The event that resul ted in the death should be 
recorded and reported as a SAE.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163016] -The illness leading to the 
surgi cal or di agnosti c procedure shoul d be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself.  The procedure should be captured in the Medi cal/Surgical History  eCRF and 
be ment ionedas part of the action taken in response to the illness.
When new significant informat ion (including the outcome of the event) is obta ined, the 
Invest igator should enter the informat ion directly into the eCRF within [ADDRESS_189269] .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expedited Reporting of Seri ous Adverse Events
Santen (or designee) will provide the Invest igator with a r eporti ng cover letter and an 
anonymized MedWatch 3500A for expedited reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB) or Independent Ethics Co mmittee ( IEC). The Invest igator i s responsible for 
receiving and reviewing expedited safet y reports, submitting expedited safet y reports to the IRB 
or IEC, and maintaining copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] o f expedited safet y reports in the study records.

Age, sex, race, ethnicit y, and baseline assessments will be summarized descript ively .
14.6. Safety Analysis
The safet y assessments will include the incidence of AEs and SAEs and treatment with rescue 
therapy .  Changes in BCVA , IOP, indi rect ophthalm oscopy  variables and VHwill also be used to 
evaluate the long-term safety of DE-109. Safet y data from  both ey es will  be included.
Each AE will be classified into a system organ classificat ion (SOC) and coded to a preferred 
term using the most updated versi on of  MedDRA (MedDRA 16.0, 2013) .Subjects with any 
AE(s) will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_9315].  They  will also be tabulated by  [CONTACT_2946], 
preferred term, and maximum severit y.  In these AE tables, a subje ct who experi enced mul tiple 
AEs within a SOC or preferred term will be counted only once at the maximum severit yfor that 
SOC or preferred term; in addit ion, ocular AEs will  be presented fi rst to be separated from  non-
ocular AEs.  Study -medication-related and inject ion-procedure -related AEs will be summarized 
similarly .In addit ion, AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discont inuat ion and death, if any ,will be 
listed. ESIs, if any, will also be listed by [CONTACT_163033].
Ocular safet y outcome m easures will be summarized using descrip tive stati stics.  Specifically f or

9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly 
vulnerable and need special protection. These include those who cmmot give or refuse 
consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue 
influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norn1s and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable 
international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or 
regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self-deternunation, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
infonnation of research subjects. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must confonn to generally accepted 
scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other 
relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal 
experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may 
harm the environment. 
14. The design and perforn1ance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the 
ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this 
Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include infonnation regarding 
funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest, 
incentives for subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are 
harn1ed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should 
describe arrangements for post-study access by [CONTACT_163045]. 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, connnent, guidance and 
approval to a research ethics connnittee before the study begins. This connnittee must 
be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must 
take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the 
research is to be perforn1ed as well as applicable international noons and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. The connnittee must have the right to monitor 
ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring inforn1ation to the connnittee, 
especially infonnation about any serious adverse events. No change to the protocol may 
be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. 
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_163046]. Research on patients or healthy 
2

Versi on 30JUN2014 60 CONFIDENTIALDoH/Oct2008 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropria tely qualified physician 
or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research 
subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professional and never 
the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is 
only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this 
population or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or 
conununity stands to benefit from the results of the research. 
18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by [CONTACT_163047] s 
involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other 
individuals or commtmiti es affected by [CONTACT_163048]. 
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before 
recruitment of the first subject. 
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be 
satisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are 
found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive 
and beneficial results. 
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
22. Participation by [CONTACT_163049]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or cormnunity 
leaders, no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees. 
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiali ty of their personal infom1ation and to minimize the impact of the study on 
their physical, mental and social integrity. 
24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must be 
adequately infonned of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential 
risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the 
study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special 
attention should be given to the specific infonnati on needs of individual potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information . After ensuring that 
the potential subject has understood the infom1ation , the physician or another 
appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's freely-given 
infonned consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, 
the non-written consent must be fom1ally documented and witnessed.

Versi on 30JUN2014 61 CONFIDENTIALDoH/Oct2008 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must 
normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be 
situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research 
or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may 
be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics conunittee. 
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician 
should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship 
with the physician or may consent tmder duress. In such situations the infonned consent 
should be sought by [CONTACT_163050]. 
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be 
included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is 
intended to promote the health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], 
the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research 
entails only tninimal risk and minimal burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition 
to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent 
should be respected. 
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent, for example, tmconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental 
condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the 
research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek infom1ed consent 
from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if 
the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent 
provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders 
them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the 
study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized 
representative. 
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available 
the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness 
and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical 
reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or 
otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and 
conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in 
accordance with the principles of tlus Declaration should not be accepted for 
publication.

C. ADDITIO NAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE 
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that 
the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084] , diagnostic or therapeutic value and if 
the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the patients who setve as research subjects. 
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intetvention must be tested 
against those of the best cunent proven intetvention , except in the following 
circumstances: 
• The use of placebo, or no u·eatment , is acceptable in studies where no cunent 
proven intetvention exists: or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessmy to detennine the efficacy or safety of an intetvention and the 
patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of 
serious or ineversible hann. ExtTeme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this 
option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be 
infonned about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for 
example, access to intetventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other 
appropriate care or benefits. 
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to pmticipate in a study or the patient's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient-physician relationsh ip. 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven intetventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective , the physician , after seeking expe11 advice, with informed consent from the 
patient or a legally authorized representa tive, may use an unproven intetvemion if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating 
suffering . Where possible, this intetvention should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be 
recorded and, where appropriate , made publicly available.

Refract ion and visual acuit y measurements will be performed for all subjects by [CONTACT_163051] n 
examiners only . Refract ion shoul d be conducted prior to visual acuit y testing to obtain best -
corrected visio n as described below. Best -corrected visual acuit y is measured at all trial visit s 
using standard charts, light ing, and procedures. Best correction is determined by [CONTACT_163052] f or ref raction described below.

A distance o f [ADDRESS_189294]’s eyes and the visual acuit y charts. Wi th 
the box light off, not more than 15 foot -candles of light (161.4 Lux) should fall on the center of 
the char t. To m easure the amount of light, the room is set up for visual acuit y testing, but wi th 
the box light off. The light meter is placed at the fourth line fro m the top of the chart, with its 
back against the chart and the reading is taken. If more than one lane is available for testing 
visual acuit y, the visual acuit y of individual subjects should be measured in the same lane at each 
visit, if possible. If different lanes are used to test visual acuit y, they  must each m eet the sam e 
standards.
Retro illuminat ed ETDRS charts are used in this trial. The illuminator box will be either wall -
mounted or m ounted on the stand. The light box should be mounted at a height such that top of 
third row l etter is 49±[ADDRESS_189295]. Each tube is partly covered a 14- inch fenestrated sleeve, which is centered on the tube 
and open in the back. This serves as a “baffle” to produce even illuminat ion over the testing 
chart. Because of the illuminat ion of the fluorescent tube diminishes by [ADDRESS_189296] 
100 hours and by  [CONTACT_20904] 5 percent during the next 2000 hours, new tubes should be kept on for 
4 day s (96 hours) continuously, and should be replaced once a y ear.
A sticker shoul d be placed on the back of the light box, indicating the date on which the present 
tubes were installed. A spare set of burned in bulbs should be available on sight.
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Beginning Approximate Refraction
At the baseline visit, the subject’s begin ning refracti on is determined by [CONTACT_163053]:
a.If the subject’s visual acuit y is 20/[ADDRESS_189297]’s visual acuit y is 20/[ADDRESS_189298]’s visual acuit y is less than 20/[ADDRESS_189299] ions are performed with either plus or minus cylinder power. Whichever cylinder ty pe is 
used at baseline (minus or plus) must be used for all subsequen t visits. Best correcti on resul ts 
shoul d be recorded on the sponsor -provided worksheet which will be included in the source 
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189300]’s visual acuit y at [ADDRESS_189301] ion charts (Chart R or Chart 3) is worse than 20/160. If visual acuity is 
worse than 20/[ADDRESS_189302] ion.
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Subjective Refraction
Subject ive refract ion allows one to determine the best correction for a subject to perform the 
visual acuit y tests.  The “push plus” approach i s used. Add minus diopter spherical corrections 
only when the subject is able to read at least one more letter on a line or a l etter on a sm aller 
line.
[IP_ADDRESS].5.1. Procedure
1.Measu re and record the di stance visi on of the ey e being tested using Chart R while 
occluding the fellow eye. The fellow eye should be light ly patched with an eye pad or 
tissue and tape. Subjects should be reminded to blink and encouraged to use eccentric 
fixation, or thei r side visi on, when necessary.
2.All refract ion and visio n testing must be done at 4 meters or 1 meter. Distance for 4 
meters i s 13 feet and 1.5 inches or 157.5 inches. The one meter distance is 39 and 3/[ADDRESS_189303] to the chart if testing is done at 1 meter . The 
distance is m easured from  the outer canthus to the center of the second letter (left ey e) or 
fourth l etter (ri ght ey e) of the thi rd line of the chart. For [ADDRESS_189304]’s face so that the lens cells are parallel to 
the anterior plane of the orbi ts and centered in front of the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]. Adjust the lens cells for 
the proper di stance fro m the cornea. Be sure the trial frame is co mfortabl e on the 
subject’s face.
5.Occlude the l eft eye by [CONTACT_163054].
a.Place the spherical lens correction in the compartment closest to the ey e.
b.The cylindrical lens correction, if present, is placed in the co mpartment in front of 
the spherical correction.  Adjust the axis.
6.Spherical Correction : To determine the highest plus o r least minus sphere, refract the 
right ey e. The following refraction steps are recommended for visual acuities of 
2.0% DE -109 Injectable So lution Protocol  32-009
Versi on 30JUN2014 66 CONFIDENTIAL20/10 to 20/80 with the beginning approximate refraction. For visual acuities less 
than 20/80, refer to the refraction table for the appropri ate sphere and cylinder 
powers and testing distance and follow a similar procedure.   Note: Whenever visual 
acuity is improved to a higher range, refract ion shoul d be perform ed wi th the sm aller 
sphere and cylinder powers given for the better visual acuit y level.  
a.Hold a +0.[ADDRESS_189305]’s right ey e. The subject should be looking 
at the smallest legible line on the visual acuit y chart. In these exact words, ask the 
subject, “Is this better, worse, or no change?”
b.If the subject responds th at the visio n is worse or blurred , rem ove the +0.[ADDRESS_189306] responds better or no change, remove the +0.[ADDRESS_189307] ace the spherical lens in the trial frame wit h a spherical lens 
that is one -half diopter more posit ive. Continue this procedure by [CONTACT_163055] 6a 
and repeat ing this process until a +0.[ADDRESS_189308]’s right ey e. In these exact words, ask the 
subject, “Is this better, worse, or no change?” If the subject replies “worse” or “no 
change,” go to Step 6f. If they  reply  “better” go to step 6e.
e.Hold the -0.[ADDRESS_189309] one letter, may you increase the minus by 0.50 (or decrease 
the plus) and repeat Step 6d. Whenever visual acuity  is not improved, go to Step 6f.  
f.Remove the -0.50 sphere from in front of the ey e and ho ld a +0.[ADDRESS_189310], “Is this better, worse, or no 
change?” If the subject responds that the vision is better or unchanged, then return to 
Step 6c. Otherwise, go to Step 7. Spherical testing should always end with a plus 
lens.   
7. Cylinder Axis: To determine and refine the cylinder axis for PLUS cylinder, proceed as 
follows; (if minus cylinders are used, the appropr iate technique using minus cylinders 
must be emplo yed and minus cylinder must be used throughout the trial.)
a.Have the subject look at a line which is either one or two lines larger than the 
smallest line the subject is able to read.  Ask the subject to foc us on a rounded 
letter such as, “C”, “D”, or “O”.  The subject should focus on the same letter 
throughout this procedure.  
b.If a cylinder is present in the beginning approximate refract ion, then go to Step 
7c.  Otherwise, fo llow the opti on listed below to determine if cylinder may be 
needed.  
Testing for cylinder when there is none in the beginning approximate 
refraction:
Place a +0.[ADDRESS_189311] at 90°, then co mpare this 
to no cylinder; repeat this procedure for 180°, then 45°, and 135° always 
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189312] a +0.[ADDRESS_189313] the +0.25 diopter hand held cross -cylinder (for VA 20/10 –20/80) first with 
the posi tive axis 45° to the right of the preferred cylinder axis (as determined 
above), and s econd wi th the posi tive axis 45° to the left of the preferred cylinder 
axis.  Ask the subject, “Which do y ou like better, posit ion one or posit ion two?”  
Also, tell the subject that both positions may blur their visio n.  The subject must 
choose the least b lurred posit ion, either one or two.  “Neit her” is allowed only if 
both posi tions are equally blurred or equally  good.
d.If “neit her” posi tion is better and thi s was the first test of axis posit ion, move the 
axis o f the cylinder in the trial frame 15° to the right or l eft and return to Step 7c.  
Otherwi se, proceed to Step 7e.  
e.When one posit ion is preferred over another, move the cylinder to the preferred 
positive axis posit ion in the step sizes noted below and return to Step 7c.  If no 
single posit ion is bet ter than another then go to Step 8.

8.Cylinder Power: Cylinder power is refined by [CONTACT_163056]:
a.Ask the subject to look at the smallest line that can be read on the visual acuit y chart.  
b.Test the cylinder power by  [CONTACT_1299] 0.25 di opter cross -cylinder (for visio n of 20/10 –
20/80) first with the posit ive axis and second with the negat ive axis co incident with 
the cylinder axis. Ask the subject, “Which is better, posit ion one or posit ion two?” Do 
not give the subject the choice of neit her.
c.If the subject prefers the minus axis co incident with the cylinder axis, the total p ower 
of the correcting plus cylinder is reduced by  0.[ADDRESS_189314] 
indicates a change that would introduce negative cylinder power, remove a ll cylinder 
power and continue testing for positive cylinder power at an axis 90° away fro m the 
previous a xis. Otherwise, go to Step 8d.
d.If the subject prefers the plus axis coincident with the cylinder axis, increase the 
power of the cylinder by 0.25 diop ter and return to Step 8b. Otherwise, proceed to 
Step 8e.
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189315] feels that both positions are equally bad or good, and the cylinder 
power in the trial frame has changed by  [CONTACT_726] 0.50 di opter, return to Step 7c and 
re-check the axis if necess ary. Otherwise, proceed to Step 9.
Note: If the cylinder is changed by [CONTACT_726] 0.50 diopter, the spherical equivalent 
shoul d be maintained. (For each 0.50 plus CX increase, add -0.25 to the sphere, for each 
0.50 minus CX increase, add +0.25 to the sphere ).
9.Spherical Correction Refinement: Recheck, or “refine” the power of the sphere by 
[CONTACT_1583] +0.[ADDRESS_189316] ion for the right ey e.
11.Repeat the ent ire process (Steps 1 -10) for the left eye and record the refraction results on 
the VAE worksheet.
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Best Corrected Vi sual Acuity Measures
1.As a reminder, Charts 1, 2, and R (or 3) are used for testing the right ey e, left eye, and 
refraction, respect ively. Subjects should not see the charts until the test begins.
2.The lens correcti on from the subject ive refract ion shoul d be in the trial frame worn by [CONTACT_1560].  
3.All eyes must be tested at [ADDRESS_189317] letter rea d and totals each line and the who le 
column ([ADDRESS_189318]) on the data collection form. An X is put through letters

may be encouraged by  [CONTACT_163057], such as “good”, “next”, and “OK.”
9.The examiner should not stand close to the chart during testing. Attention should be 
focused on the subject and data collect ion form. If the subject has difficult y locating the 
next line to read, the examiner may go up to the chart and point briefly to the next line to 
be read, but then must move away fro m the chart.
10.When [ADDRESS_189322] to read them. Otherwise, the 
visual acuit y score is the number of letters read correctly at 1.0 meter plus the number, if 
any, read at 4 meters. If no letters are read c orrectly  at ei ther 4 m eters or 1 m eter, then the 
visual acuit y score is recorded as 0.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7. Testing for Count Finger Vision, Hand Motion Vision and Light Perception/No 
Light Perception Vision
If the subject’s visual acuit y is so poor that he/she cannot read a ny chart letters when tested at 
one m eter then the subject’s abilit y to count fingers, detect hand mot ion, or have light perception 
shoul d be evaluated.
[IP_ADDRESS].7.1. Testing for Count Fingers Vision
In testi ng for count fingers visio n, the examiner’s hand ho lding 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_189323]. The examiner’s fingers shoul d be presented in random order and repeated five t imes.  
Eccentri c fixat ion, if present, should be encouraged. If the subject correctly identifies three of the 
five presentations, then count fingers visio n is noted. If not, then the subject must be t ested for 
hand motion visio n.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7.2. Testing for Hand Motion Vision
The examiner’s hand with all fingers spread out should be extended two feet direct ly in front of 
the eye being examined. The fellow eye should be occluded wit h a patch on the subject’s face.  A
light should be shown directly on the examiner’s hand fro m behind the subject. The examiner’s 
2.0% DE -109 Injectable So lution Protocol  32-009
Versi on 30JUN2014 70 CONFIDENTIALhand should be moved in an up -and-down di rection (vert ically) or in a side -to-side direction 
(hori zontally) at a constant speed of approximately one back and for th presentation per second. 
The subject is instructed that the examiner’s hand will be presented and they will have to respond 
to the question: “What am I doing wit h my hand?” This should be repeated five times. Three out 
of five correct responses indicate that hand motion visio n is present. If the subject does not 
correctly  identify three of five presentations, then you must test for light perception.
[IP_ADDRESS].7.3. Testing for Light Perception/No Light Perception Vision
Light percepti on shoul d be tested wi th an indi rectophthalmoscope in a darkened room. The 
fellow eye should be co mpletely patched and covered by [CONTACT_423]’s hand. The indirect 
ophthalmoscope light should be in focus at [ADDRESS_189324]’s eye at least four times, 
and the subject should be asked to respond when he/she sees the light. If the examiner is 
convinced that the subject perceives the light, visio n shoul d be recorded as “light perception,” if 
not, vi sion shoul d be recorded as “no light perception.”

21.4.4. Intraocular Pressure (IOP)
IOP will be measured for each eye using applanat ion tomo metry at Day 1, Month [ADDRESS_189326]-
Baseline PRN Treatment Visits prior to eval uation of need for treatment.  If DE -109 i s 
administered, a second assessment will be made 40 (±10) minutes after inject ion.
The examiner will meas ure IOP and record results in mmHg wit h one decimal place (e.g., 24.0). 
A single measurement is made to ob tain a determinat ion of intraocular pressure. The same 
contact [CONTACT_163058] ’s standard technique, will be used throughout the
study . In addit ion, all reasonable efforts should be made to have the same examiner obtain all 
IOP m easurements for a given subject.
2.0% DE -[ADDRESS_189327] has exited the study. For checking 
calibrat ion, follow the m anufacturer’s instructions. If when checked, the variat ion is within ±2 
mmHg, the tonometer is considered adequately calibrated. However, if the variation exc eeds this 
amount, the tonom eter shoul d be sent for repair and a different, adequately  calibrated instrum ent 
shoul d be used for IOP measurement. The date of each calibrat ion, along wi th the name [CONTACT_163061] (or i nitials) of the person who performed the ca librat ion, must be docum ented. The 
tonom eter calibrat ion record will be retained as a part of the study  record.

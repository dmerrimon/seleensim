The reference therapy is a p lacebo, provided as tablets indistinguishable from amifampridine tablets. 
The placebo will be administered consistent with the dose and dose regimen of the investigational 
product ( amifampridine phosphate ). 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION : 
Safety:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_44476] -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including 
serious adverse events (SAEs) . Vital signs, physical examination, and concomitant medications will 
also be evaluated.  
Efficacy:  
• Primary:  
o To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate compared with placebo 
in individuals  with LEMS,  based on change  of the co -primary endpoints QMG Score 
and Subject Global Improvement (SGI).  
• Secondary:  
o Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) 
• Exploratory:  
o Greater than 2 0% increase  in the a verage time of [ADDRESS_621667] (3TUG)  
o Patient rating on change of most bothersome symptom for them. 
 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination  
For Change From Baseline in QMG  Scores, a between -treatment difference of - 3.[ADDRESS_621668] 80% for a 0.[ADDRESS_621669] 2, a sample size of 26 patients will provide power of 80% for a 0.[ADDRESS_621670] 80% for each of the t wo co -primary endpoints.  
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive at least 1 
dose of amifampridine or placebo). The safety analysis will be descriptive and will be presented on 
using observe d data only. 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Only 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 7 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be included in the safety analysis. The incidence of TEAEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term , relationship to treatment, and severity by 
[CONTACT_3148] .  
All other safety measures including vital signs, physical examination, and concomitant medications 
data will also be summarized . 
 
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on 2 datasets:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine or placebo) and have at least one post -treatment efficacy 
assessment.  
• Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients with 
major protocol deviations. The PP population will include all patients who:  
o Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that 
might potentially affect efficacy, and  
o Patients who took at le ast 80% of the required treatment doses and remained enrolled 
for at least [ADDRESS_621671] -randomization data will be excluded from all efficacy analyses but will be 
included in the safety analyses.  
For each efficacy variable with a corresponding assessment at Baseline, Change From Baseline 
(CFB) will be computed as the post -treatment result minus the Baseline result. The post -treatment 
result will be the result obtained on Day 4, unless the patient  discontinued treatment early, in which 
case the post -treatment result may be obtained at an earlier time point.  For statistical test, two -sided 
P values <0.[ADDRESS_621672] squares (LS) means 
will be conducted to evaluate the treatment effect .  
The raw scores  and CFB for each item of QMG will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] .  Between -treatment 
comparisons with respect to CFB for Right arm outstretched, Left arm outstretched, Right leg 
outstretched, and Left leg outstretched  will be performed using a fixed effects linear model  with 
terms for treatment  and QMG at  Baseline .  
Summary statistics for SGI score and the corresponding CFB  will be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. The 
analysis of CFB for SGI is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a 
fixed  effects linear model to the data with CFB as the response.  The model will include terms for 
treatment  and SGI at Baseline. A test comparing the LS means will be conducted to evaluate the 
treatment effect.

6 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of amifampridine phosphate is contained in the Firdapse® 
Investigator’s Brochure  supplied by [CONTACT_44486] (February, 2015). Investigators are to review the  
document before initiating this study.  
 
6.1 Disease Background  
Lambert -Eaton Myasthen ic Syndrome (LEMS) is a very rare autoimmune disease with the 
primary  symptom of proximal muscle weakness. Muscle weakness resulting from LEMS is 
caused by [CONTACT_331437] -antibodies directed against type P/Q voltage -gated calcium channels (VGCCs) 
located on the pre -synaptic member of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  (Motomura, 1997) . 
Auto -antibodies inhibit the entry of calcium into the nerve, impairing the release of 
acetylcholine from nerve terminals into the synapse, resulting in  a loss of neuromuscular 
transmission (Augustine, 1990; Lambert, 1956; Verschuuren, 2006) . 
Although the true prevalence of LEMS is uncertain, it has been estimated that this disease  
affects approximately 1 – 9 out of 100,000 of the general population (Sanders,  2003) . Available 
literature suggests that approximately 50% to 55% of patients have a paraneoplastic form of 
LEMS, mainly small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Verschuuren, 2006; Wirtz, 2002a) . In a large 
clinical study that included 50 consecutive patients with LEMS,  SCLC was present in 84% of 
patients with cancer (O'Neill, 1988) . The prevalence of LEMS in patients with SCLC is 
estimated to be  approximately 3% (Payne, 2010) . In approximately 90% of patients with the 
paraneoplastic form of LEMS, a tumor was detected within 2 years following the  diagnosis of 
LEMS  (Verschuuren, 2006; Elias, 2010). 
 
Clinically, LEMS is characterized by [CONTACT_483779], fatigability, muscle aches, and autonomic dysfunction 
(e.g. impotence, dry mouth, constipation) (Lambert, 1956; Verschuuren, 2006) . Other 
symptoms may include paresthesias, diplopia, and orthostatic hypotension (Wirtz, 2002b) . The 
charact eristic proximal muscle weakness can compromise the most basic tasks such as walking 
and climbing stairs. The symptoms of impaired neuromuscular transmission typi[INVESTIGATOR_483761] 40, with a peak incidence between 50 and 70 years (Wirtz,  2002b; O'Neill, 1988) . 
The onset of symptoms is  usually  gradual and insidious, taking place over several weeks to 
many months or even years. In rare cases, weakness of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_483762] a life-threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_483763] (O'Neill, 1988; 
Maddison, 1999) . There have also been isolated reports of patients  presenting with acute 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 18 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_483764]  (Verschuuren, 2006; Elias, 2010; 
Vedeler, 2006) . In LEMS, the gradual onset of hip girdle weakness is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_483765]. Clinical features that present later in 
LEMS include muscle  weakness that worsens with prolonged exercise, respi[INVESTIGATOR_234402], diplopia, and dry mouth (Seneviratne, 1999) . 
 
The diagnosis of LEMS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_483766]. The VGCC radioimmunoassay detects the ability of patient’s serum to induce immunoglobulin G (IgG) -calcium complex precipi[INVESTIGATOR_483767]. As  discussed above, antibodies against the P/Q -type 
VGCC are present in approximately 85% to 95% of patients with LEMS.  
 
In addition, a  characteristic electrophysiologic pattern associated with LEMS may support  the 
diagnosis of a presynaptic NMJ disorder . The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) 
amplitude in a resting muscle in patients with LEMS is usually significantly reduced . 
Following high frequency (10 -50 Hertz [Hz]) repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), there is a 
significant increment (> 100%) with a marked increase in the CMAP amplitude 
(Weinberg,  2010) . An increase in the CMAP amplitude > 100% after high frequency 
stimulation or exercise is considered diagnostic of a presynaptic NMJ disorder. In addition, the 
muscle action potentials observed in patients w ith LEMS are often unstable on 
electromyography (EMG) needle examination and the single fiber EMG typi[INVESTIGATOR_483768] (Tron telj, 1991; Chaudhry, 1991) . 
 
Management of patients with LEMS can be classified into 3 main categories, each targeting 
different aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease: 1) anti -tumor treatment 
(e.g. chemotherapy , multikinase inhibitors ) in paraneoplas tic LEMS, 2) immunologic 
treatments (e .g. intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ), plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, 
prednisone, azathioprine) to suppress anti -VGCC  antibodies ; and 3)  symptomatic treatment 
(e.g. pyridostigmine, amifampridine) acting at the NMJ  (Verschuuren, 2006) . 
 
The most common cancer accompanying LEMS is SCLC, but lymphoproliferative disorders 
such as Hodgkins Disease, carcinoid or malignant thymoma may also occur . Although there 
are no large clinical studies addressing immunotherapy, standard approaches have been 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 19 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
developed from small clinical trials, case reports, and clinical experience in the more frequent 
NMJ autoimmune disorder, myasthenia gravis (MG) . Intravenous immunoglobulin has been 
demonstrated to increase muscular strength in small clinical trials and can be a maintenance therapy if administered approximately monthly. Prednisone is typi[INVESTIGATOR_483769] 1 mg/kg/day, maintained at that dosage until there is clinical evidence of improvement, and then slowly tapered. The most frequently used steroid- sparing oral 
immunosuppressants are azathioprine or mycophenolate. Although evidence is limited, cyclosporine and plasmapheresis are sometimes used in refractory patients . As in other 
autoimmune disorders, immunologic agents are often used in combination. Although most 
experts recommend using similar immunotherapy in paraneoplastic and autoimmune LEMS, some physicians are reluctant to immunosuppress pat ients with malignancy  (Weinberg,  2010). 
 
Symptomatic treatment is integral to the management of LEMS, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_483770] . The first available symptomatic treatment was guanidine, which acts by  
[CONTACT_483780]. However, a small therapeutic window with side effects of marrow suppression and nephrotoxicity limited its use. Cholinesterase inhibitors alone (e .g. pyridostigmine) confer little benefit in LEMS 
(Wirtz,  2009) , although are sometimes used in combination with guanidine. Aminopyridines,  
such as amifampridine, are first -line symptomatic therapy for patients with LEMS  (Skeie, 
2006; S keie, 2010; Lindquist, 2011). 
 
6.2 Amifampridine  
Amifampridine (3,4- DAP) is a non- specific voltage -dependent potassium (K
+) channel blocker 
used to treat LEMS . Its blockade of K+ channels causes depolarization of the presynaptic 
membrane and slows down or inhibits the repolarization phase of an action potential. Prolongation of the action potential duration increased opening of pre -synaptic slow voltage -
dependent calcium (Ca
2+) channels, increasing  Ca2+ influx and consequent increase in synaptic 
vesicle exocy tosis (quantal content) with each depolarization event, thus releasing an increased 
level of ACh into the synaptic cleft ( Maddison, 1998a ; Maddison, 1998b) . The influx of ACh 
into the presynaptic cleft enhances neuromuscular transmission, providing improved muscle function. 
 Over the last 25 years, a considerable amount of clinical experience with amifampridine has 
been gained, which provides a strong body of evidence for its efficacy a nd safety in the 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
treatment of patients with neurologic disorders, including MG, CMS, LEMS, multiple sclerosis 
(MS), downbeat nystagmus, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  
Amifampridine has been recommended as first -line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by [CONTACT_483781] (EFNS) ( Skeie, 2006;  Skeie, 2010;  Lindquist, 
2011)  and amifampridine tablets 10 mg (as amifampridine phosphate) (Firdapse® Tablets) is 
marketed for the treatment of LEMS in the European Union (including Norway and Iceland), Israel, and Switzerland. The collective body of da ta indicates that amifampridine/ 
amifampridine phosphate is well tolerated up to and including 80 mg/day (Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure, February 2015 ). 
 
6.3 Nonclinical Studies  
An extensive nonclinical program assessed the safety and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of amifampridine, including:  
• Five safety pharmacology studies in central nervous system (rat), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (rat), 
and cardiovascular (telemeterized dogs, in vitro human Ether -à-go-go Re lated 
Gene
 (hERG) and rabbit Purkinje fiber)  
• Pharmacokinetics and mass balance in rat and dog  
• In vitro metabolism in human and animal hepatocytes  
• Human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition and induction  
• Human P -glycoprotein (Pgp) interaction  
• Single dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) studies in mouse , rat, and beagle dog 
• Repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic in rat (28- day and 13- week) and  
dog (28 -day and 9 -month)  
• Reproductive and developmental toxicity in rat and rabbit  
• Six in vitro and  in vivo genotoxicity studies  
• Carcinogenitcity study  (104 weeks) in rats  
 
Safety factors based on data from the 4 -week toxicity/TK studies in rat and dog, the 13- week 
toxicity/TK study in rats along with a PK study in fasted rats are presented in Table 2 . Peak 
plasma concentration  (Cmax) values were used in calculating the exposure- based safety factors 
as the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) effects are 
correlat ed to plasma concentration levels. C max data from the bioavailability/bioequivalence 
study in healthy volunteers were used to compare with animal C max data. Human safety factors 
calculated using mean C max from a PK study in fasted rats are 2.8 (male) and 7 .8 (female). The

The main nonclinical findings of CNS and ANS effects and histologic changes in muscle 
tissues after administration of amifampridine are in accordance with the mechanism of action. No new treatment -related findings in the nonclinical program have been observed that would 
limit the use of amifampridine at the planned clinical maximum daily oral dose of 80 mg in 
this study involving patients with LEMS . 
 
6.3.1 Carcinogenicity Study  
A study of  amifampridine phosphate  consumption equivalent to 8, 25, or 55 mg/kg/day  via 
dietary admixture in m ale and female Spra gue Dawley rats  showed no increased early 
mortality.  Sur vival was increased in male and female rats offered amifampridine phosphate  in 
diet compared to control group rats.  Survival at the end of the dosing phase was 47%, 67%, 73%, and 72% for males, and 48%, 65%, 60%, and 73% for females for dose levels of 0, 8, 25, and 55 mg/kg/day , respectively.

Benign and malignant Schwannomas were only observed in male and female rats given 
amifampridine phosphate .  In male rats, incidence of Schwannoma was comparable between 
rats given 25  and 55 mg/kg/day.  In female rats, incidence was similar to the male rats at 8 and 
25 mg/kg/day with an increased incidence at the highest dose (55 mg/kg/day).   
Endometrial carcinomas were observed with an incidence of 0, 4, 13 and 9 for females offered 0, 8, 25 and 55 mg/kg/day amifampridine phosphate .  A vast majority (22/26 tumors) of these 
tumors were observed after Study Week [ADDRESS_621688] article -treated rats.  The late appearance of these suggests the tumors arise from 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193] (non -genotoxic) mechanism, and as the endometrium is r esponsive to estrogenic 
activity, dose -related changes in pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]/endocrine axis is the most likely epi[INVESTIGATOR_483771]. 
The dose levels of 25 and 55 mg/kg/day a mifampridine phosphate  in males, and the dose levels 
of 8, 25, and 55 mg/kg/day in females were associated with a higher incidence of benign and 
malignant Schwannomas.  Consequently, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
considered 8 mg/kg/day in males and <8 mg/kg/day in females.   
6.4 Previous Clinical Studies  
Amifampridine has been used for over 25 years in patients with multiple neurologic disorders 
including MG, CMS, LEMS, MS, ALS, congenital forms of nystagmus, and adult idiopathic 
nystagmus (AIN). There are a limited number of published controlled trials with  
amifampridine in these disorders. A review of the literature documents that amifampridine is a safe and effective treatment in multiple neurologic disorders and is recommended by [CONTACT_483782] -line symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS ( Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010;  
Lindquist, 2011) . 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_621689] in human Phase 1 study ( DAPSEL Study, 2006) with amifampridine phosphate was 
conducted to investigate the bioavailability/bioequivalence and tolerability of amifampridine administered as a phosphate salt or free base. In the first part of the study, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_483772] 5 healthy male  volunteers who received a single 10- mg dose of 
amifampridine phosphate to determine tolerability. In the second part of the study, bioequivalence testing was conducted in 27 healthy male volunteers. Each patient was 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 23 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
randomized to receive either a single dose (2 × 10 mg tablets) of amifampridine as 
amifampridine phosphate or amifampridine base and received alternate treatment following a 
minimum of 72 -hour washout period. 
 
This study demonstrated bioequivalence for  area under the plasma concentration -time c urve 
from time 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), with the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the base/salt ratio 
of 93.1% to 113.3% falling within the predefined limits of 90% to 125% for bioequivalence. 
The mean elimination half -life ( t1/2) of amifampridine was 1.8 hours for the phosphate and 
1.6 hours for the free base form. Amifampridine C max was 64.8 ng/mL for the phosphate and 
57.0 ng/mL for the free base form. Potentially improved absorption of the phosphate salt explained the slightly higher C
max observed for am ifampridine phosphate compared with the 
free base. All adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, transitory and fully reversible. The nature and frequency of side -effects did not differ between formulations (phosphate salt 
or base). The most common AE (25 of 40 AEs) was paresthesia, which was mainly minor peri -
oral paresthesia. Since paresthesia is well recognized as an AE occurring in patients treated with amifampridine, all were considered as possibly related to investigational product (IP) by [CONTACT_8647]. The only other AE occurring in >1 patient and judged possibly related to 
amifampridine was abdominal pain (4 events). Simple flu (5 events) and feeling of discomfort (2 events) were also reported for > 1 patient in the study, however were consider ed not related 
to amifampridine treatment.  
 
The only SAEs reported in the study were minor, isolated, and reversible increases in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which occurred in a single 
patient after administration o f 20 mg amifampridine base. Aside from this 1  patient, no other 
laboratory abnormalities were observed. No electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were 
observed. No deaths occurred in the DAPSEL study .  
 
A Phase 1 study (LMS -001) in healthy volunteers evalua ted whether food consumption 
significantly affected the bioavailability of amifampridine phosphate tablets. This was an open -
label, randomized, single -dose, 2- treatment, [ADDRESS_621690]. The 2 single 20 mg doses of 
amifampridine phosphate were administered 6 days apart. Data indicate that taking amifampridine with food reduces exposures determined by C
max (maximum serum levels) by 
 [CONTACT_483783]- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 24 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
approximately 40% and AUC by [CONTACT_3450] 20%. In addition, the time to maximum serum 
concentrations (T max) was increased 2 -fold from approximately 38 minutes (fasted) to 78 
minutes (fed). The drug was well  tolerated with no serious adverse events and only [ADDRESS_621691] common adverse 
events occurring in ≥  10% of patients were: oral paresthesia (20 patients; 43%), peripheral 
paresthesias (1 2; 26%), dizziness (5; 11%), headache (5; 11%), and oral hypoesthesia (5; 11%). 
Abdominal pain, nausea, peripheral paresthesias, dizziness, and headache were more 
commonly reported by [CONTACT_483784]; therefore, administration with food is recommended based on the current study.  
 
In both Study LMS -001 and DAPSEL , PK parameters were highly variable with 10- fold ranges 
observed in values of C max, AUC, and t ½ across patients. In humans, amifampri dine is 
exclusively metabolized to a single major metabolite, 3 -N-acetyl amifampridine, via N -acetyl 
transferases (NAT) (Catalyst internal in vitro  and in vivo studies; data available upon request). 
There are [ADDRESS_621692] been well characterized in the Caucasian and Asian populations, but somewhat less well in African populations ( Sabbagh, 2006) . Slow acetylators are estimated to 
comprise 50% to 59% of the Caucasian population, with the remainder being rapid acetylators (fast + intermediate). Fast acetylators are over represented in Asian population  (92% of 
Japanese and 80% of Chinese) while they may be under represented in African populations (25%) (Cascorbi, 1995) . Slow acetylators will accumulate drug to higher levels (i.e. higher 
C
max) and clear drug more slowly  (i.e. longer t 1/2), both of which may increase the risk of drug 
related toxicity (Fukino,  2008;  Jetter, 2009) . It is hypothesized that the high variability in 
amifampridine phosphate PK  may be due to NAT polymorphisms with slow and fast acetylator 
phenotypes. In a study (FIR -001) that evaluated the effect of acetylator status in 26  healthy 
subjects (half with fast and half with slow acetylator phenotypes), polymorphisms in the NAT system  created [ADDRESS_621693] s. 
 
6.4.2 Efficacy of Amifampridine in LEMS  
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study ( LMS -002) evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine tablets 10 mg, as amifampridine phosphate (30- 80 mg

Amendment 2 Version 2

total daily dose) versus placebo in patient s with LEMS.  The 38 patients treated with 
amifampridine phosphate had statistically significant improvement in both primary efficacy 
measures relative to patients treated with placebo. The change in QMG scores from baseline (Day 1, Part  2) to Day 14 (Part 3) reached statistical significance (p=0.0452), with the least 
square (LS) mean for QMG score increasing by 2.[ADDRESS_621694] global 
impression (SGI), patients who were receiving amifampridine on Day  1 reported, on average, 
that they were “pleased” (SGI score of 5.9 ±  1.2) with the test medication while they were 
receiving it. After being switched to placebo tablets, their opi[INVESTIGATOR_44442], on ave rage, 2.7 
±2.3 points. The LS mean was - 2.6 for the placebo group and - 0.8 for the amifampridine group, 
a difference of 1.8 ±0.6 (p=0.0028), corresponding to a patient assessment, of “mixed” for the placebo tablets. This substantial change in patients’ ass essments, to a worsening of their 
condition while receiving placebo, was considered clinically significant.  
 
In addition to Study LMS -002, 5 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies and 
1 double -blind study with an active comparator (reported in abstract form only) in 71 patients 
with LEMS are reported in the clinical literature. In all 6  studies, amifampridine (in base form) 
was shown to be more effective for the symptomatic treatment of  LEMS compared with 
placebo or active comparator across a number of independent measures of neurological 
function. Supportive data from multiple published uncontrolled investigations and case reports demonstrate the long -term benefits of treatment with amifampridine in patients with LEMS, 
and show that removal of patients from drug has led to recurrence of underlying symptoms. Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (February, 2015)  for furthe r details on these 
studies. 
 
6.4.3 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate  
Safety data collected from 1,45 5 patients or healthy volunteers in controlled study LMS -002 
(LEMS), controlled and uncontrolled published studies of LEMS or other neurologic 
conditions, a 3- year safety surveillance study (ATU), and PK studies demonstrate 
amifampridine is well tolerated up to and including 80  mg/day (Firdapse Investigator 
Brochure, February 2015 ). The most common adverse events observed from the clinical safety 
data were perioral and peripheral paresthesias and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_44443]).  These events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_180237], and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from tr eatment. In the 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 26 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
pharmacogenomic study in healthy subjects (classified as either slow acetylators or fast 
acetylators), slow acetylators experienced >80% more drug -related AEs compared with fast 
acetylators ( FIR-001). 
 
Clinically significant or serious adverse events were infrequent in all studies for all indications. 
A total of 12 deaths were reported in the 1,455  patients or healthy subjects. Six of 12 deaths 
were associated with accompanying malignancy (1 of 6 with pulmonary embolus as terminal event) , 1 due to tracheobronchitis, and 2 due to myocardial infarction (MI). Attribution to 
amifampridine for 2 of 3 deaths from the ATU study was specified as unrelated; causality for the third death was not reported. No attribution was specified in the academi c series, but the 
author singled out the fatal MI as the only serious incident during amifampridine therapy, implying that the 2  deaths due to malignancy, the 1 due to malignancy and pulmonary embolus 
and the 1 due to tracheobronchitis were not related in his opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The author further states that no pathological findings related to amifampridine were found in the patient who died of tracheobronchitis. For 1 of the fatal MIs, the author speculates that a “sudden increase of physical activity” with amifampr idine may have been a contributant (Lundh, 1984; Lundh, 
1993) ; no causality was reported for the other fatal MI (Bertorini, 2011) . Three deaths occurred 
in children with CMS, including [ADDRESS_621695] -channel CMS (Beeson, 2005) . Although no causal 
relationship was established with amifampridine, the authors advise its use cautiously in children and in fast -channel patients.  The other CMS death was not thought to be related to 
amifampridine (Palace, 1991) . Overall 7 of 12 deaths were not considered related to 
amifampridine; neither cause nor causality is known for 4 deaths; and amifampridine  may have 
contributed indirectly to [ADDRESS_621696] frequent clinically significant or serious event was seizure. A total of 11  (0.76%) 
patients out of 1,455 patients or healthy subjects experienced seizures or convulsions after 
treatm ent with amifampridine. Electroencephalogram findings, reported for 4  of the 11 
patients, did not show epi[INVESTIGATOR_41716]. Four  of 11 seizures occurred in patients with 
LEMS ( 4/209; 1.91%), 4  occurred in patients with MS (4/774; 0.5%), 1 occurred in a patient 
with CMS (1/88; 1.14%) (Harper, 2000)  and 2 seizures were reported in a literature- based 
study where both MG and LEMS patients were enrolled, but the paper did not state the indication (Sanders, 1993; Sanders, 2000; Flet, 2010; McEvoy, 1989;  Boerma, 1995;  Beve r, 
1996) .  
Amifampridine was implicated in 5  of these cases of seizure. Three patients experienced 
seizures on a daily dose of ≥90 mg/day (n=3; LEMS or MG). Contributing factors for seizures 
were a daily dose of  ≥90 mg/day, concurrent treatment with theophylline, brain metastases, 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 27 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
and a case of drug overdose (360 mg/day for 7 days).  In cases where follow -up was reported, 
most seizures did not recur with amif ampridine dose reduction or treatment withdrawal. In the 
one accidental overdose case, seizures were controlled with intravenous clonazepam and the 
patient made a full recovery (Boerma, 1995) . Note that a seizure rate of 4% can be expected in 
the natural course of patients with MS (Engelsen, 1997;  Moreau, 1998; Kinnunen, 1987).  
Among the 774 MS patients treated with ami fampridine included in the safety assessment of 
this report, 4 (0.5%) experienced seizures. 
 
Other clinically significant or SAEs reported in more than 1 adult patient were palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] 
(8/1,454; 0.56%), abnormal liver enzymes (6/1,454; 0.41%), QTc prolong ation (2/1,454; 
0.14%), and premature ventricular contraction/increased ventricular extrasystoles (2/1,454; 
0.14%). Each of the following serious or clinically significant events was reported in a single patient: chorea, paresthesias, paroxysmal supraventr icular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, drug -
induced hepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, increased lipase and amylase, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_483773], and urinary tract infection with confusion. 
 
6.4.4 Overall Risks and Benefits  
Data on amifampridine treatment in patients or healthy volunteers support the favorable safety 
profile of amifampridine (both base and phosphate formulations) at doses up to 80 mg per day. 
Current data demonstrate that amifampridine phosphate salt has an acceptable tolerability profile w ith a positive risk -benefit in patients treated with amifampridine. Refer to the Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure (February, 2015)  for further discussion on benefit/risk of amifampridine.  
 
6.4.5 Study Rationale  
As discussed previously , a considerable amount of cl inical experience is available with 
amifampridine (3,4- diaminopyridine; 3,4- DAP) in patients with LEMS and other neurologic 
disorders and, in December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval by [CONTACT_483785].  
LMS -002 also provided Class 1 evidence that amifampridine phosphate provides statistically 
and clinically significant improvement in LEMS patients.  LMS -003 represents a second  
efficacy study.

7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
7.1 Primary Objectives  
 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
 
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate compared t o placebo in 
subjects with LEMS, based upon improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and 
quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score; and  
 
• To confirm the safety and tolerability of amifampridine phosphate  by [CONTACT_483786] . 
 
8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
 
This randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients diagnosed with LEMS. 
Patients will have been receiving unb linded drug treatment  in the expanded access program 
(EAP -001), after which blinded treatment effect will be assessed for continuation or cessation 
of drug. The study is planned to include approximately [ADDRESS_621697] up to 7 days.   
 
Those patients successfully satisfy ing all screening criteria will be randomized to a treatment 
group. Amifampridine phosphate (at the patient’s optimal dose) or placebo will be dispensed 
by [CONTACT_7232], according to the randomization schedule, to begin with the next dose 
after all Day [ADDRESS_621698] been out of the expanded accesss program 
for less than 30 days, as LMS -003 participants, rescreening to return to expanded access 
program will not  be required, per the protocol , and patients may immediately resume their 
participation in the expanded access program (EAP -001).

8.2.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible to participate in 
the study:  
 
1. Clinically significant long QTc interval on ECG in previous 12 months . 
2. Seizure disorder.  
3. Active brain metastases.  
4. Unable to ambulate  
5. Pregnant or lactating females . 
6. Any other condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], might interfere with the 
patient ’s participation in the study or confound the assessment of the patient. 
7.  Patients who cannot discontinue immunomodulatory treatment (e.g. mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclosporine) within [ADDRESS_621705] withdraw from the study or from 
treatment with IP any patient who requests to be withdrawn.  A patient’s participation in the 
study or treatment with IP may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator 
and in accordance with his or her clinical judgment. In the event that the patient’s LEMS 
symptoms worsen to a clinically significant level, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the patient 
may be placed on open -label amifampridine phosphate, and Early Discontinua tion assessments 
should be performed as described for Day 4 (Table 3 ). 
 
Catalyst must be notified of all patient withdrawals from the study or from treatment with IP as soon as possible. Catalyst also reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue partic ipation by [CONTACT_483787].
 
 
Reasons for which the I nvestigator or Catalyst may withdraw a patient from the study treatment 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Patient experiences a serious or intolerable AE;  
• Patient requires medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760]; and 
• Patient becomes pregnant.  
 
Reasons for which the I nvestigator or Catalyst may withdraw a patient from the study include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Patient does not adhere to study requirements specified in the protocol;  
• Patient was erroneously admitted into the study or does not meet inclusion 
criteria;  and 
• Patient is lost to follow -up. 
 
If a patient fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine 
the reason. If the patient cannot be reached by [CONTACT_756], a certified letter should be sent to the patient requesting co ntact with the I nvestigator. This information should be recorded in the 
study records.
 
 LMS- [ADDRESS_621706] explain to each patient, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the patient’s protected health information obtained during 
the study may be shared with Catalyst, regulatory agenci es, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health 
information, per country -specific regulations, from each patient. If permission to use protected 
health infor mation is withdrawn, it is the I nvestigator’s re sponsibility to obtain a written

 Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
 
8.7.4 Triple Timed Up and Go  (3TUG) – greater than 20% increase in average time, 
off medica tion 
The Timed Up and Go (TUG) is a functional mobi lity test that requires a subject to stand up 
from a straight -backed armchair, walk [ADDRESS_621727] is an 
increase in time of more than 20% , this has been incorporated into the endpoint. 
Instruction s for the 3TUG are contained in Appendix [ADDRESS_621728] medical occurrence (e.g. sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a patient administered the IP or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attributi on. This includes:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study.  
• Complic ations that occur as a result of non- drug protocol -imposed 
interventions.  
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relati onship 
between the IP and the AE.  
 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of 
terms relating to a diagnosis.  
 
The study period during which all serious and non-serious AEs will be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and  through the last visit on Study Day 4, or at the time of early 
 LMS- [ADDRESS_621729] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented 
on the appropr iate CRF page(s) and in the patient’s medical record . 
 
The I nvestigator responsible for the care of the patient or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to IP, and seriousness (refer to Section 9.2 for SAE definition). 
Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness ( not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations .  
 
The I nvestigator will determine the severity of each AE using the following Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE  v4) grades defined in Table 5  (the event 
will be recorded on the source documents and AE CRF). Events that are CTCAE grades [ADDRESS_621730] a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE as stated below.

The Investigator will suggest the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the source 
documents and AE CRF, using the relations hip categories defined in Table 6. 
The Investigator should review the AE Log for the patient, from the EAP -001 expanded access 
program. Any ongoing/open/unresolved AEs will be transcribed to the LMS -003 study AE 
Log. At the end of patient’s participation in the LMS -003 study, the AE Log should be provided 
to the expanded access program site, so that the expanded access site can update their AE Log 
with any changes.

9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1  or 
more of the f ollowing criteria : 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate 
risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires or prolongs in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity

• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is, an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a patient exposed to IP prior to conception or during  pregnancy  
• Is an important medical event or reaction.  
For this study, a generalized tonic -clonic convulsion/seizure is to be considered an SAE.  
Any SAE, whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_44517] (fax, email) the study -specific SA E Report Form to 
Catalyst. The I nvestigator should not wait to collect information that fully documents the SAE 
before notifying Catalyst . As additional information becomes available, including but not 
limited to the outcome of the SAE and any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, it must be reported within [ADDRESS_621731] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented 
in the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record.  
 
For some SAEs, Catalyst may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, autopsy report).  
At the la st scheduled visit, the I nvestigator should instruct each patient to report any subsequent 
SAEs that the patient’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
 
The I nvestigator should notify Catalyst of any death or SAE occur ring at any time after a 
patient has discontinued, or terminated study participation, if felt to be related to prior study 
treatment. Catalyst should also be notified if the I nvestigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer, or of a congenital anomaly, in a subsequently conceived offspring of a patient that participated in this study.  
 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirement s. Adequate 
documentation must be provided showing that the IRB was properly and promptly notified as required.  
 LMS- [ADDRESS_621732] make every effort to follow the patient through resolution of the pregnancy 
(delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the follow -up form ( Pregnancy Report

“…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the I nvestigator shall take 
appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shal l forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures 
taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF th rough the 
completion of the last study visit. Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures with 24  hours.

A sensitivity analysis of the coprimary endpoints will be conducted to evaluate the patterns of early treatment discontinuation.  For each coprimary endpoint, a randomization test will be conducted to determine if the results from the primary analysis are supported.  The randomization test is an alternative to a full permutation, and will evaluate the fixed  effects 
model specified above using permutations of the treatment group assignments.  If early discontinuations are not associated with treatment, then it is expected that the p -value resulting 
from the randomization test will yield the same statistical interpretation as the p -value resulting 
from the primary analysis.    
 The proportion of patients with at least 20% increase in average time  for 3TUG  will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_483794] u sing Fisher’s Exact Test . The assessment of the

13.[ADDRESS_621748], who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change. The only exception is when an Invesigator considers t hat a patient’s safety is 
compromised without immediate action.  In these circumstances, immediate approval of the 
IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the Investigator should inform Catalyst within [ADDRESS_621749], 
procedures, and treatment that are part of this study (as included in the site budget).  In addition, 
after IRB/IEC/REB approval, Catal yst will pay the cost of travel, lodging  and meals  for study  
duration. Catalyst will not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatment for medical problems of any sort, whether or not related to the study patient’s disease that are not part of this  study.  
Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], test, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
 
The I nvestigator should contact [CONTACT_483795] a study patient has 
been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any patient who 
experiences a study -related inju ry should be instructed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to seek medical 
treatment at the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The patient should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for study -related injuries. The treating physician should bill the patient’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. To the extent a patient has reasonably followed the Investigator’s instructions and attempted to comply with study procedur es, Catalyst will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries 
caused by [CONTACT_44531], if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_187697]. In some jurisdictions, Catalyst is obligated by 
[CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior recourse to third party payer billing. If this 
is the case, Catalyst will comply with the law.  
 
15 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The CRO data management vendor, or designees , will perform all data management activities, 
including the writing of a data management plan outlining the systems and procedures to be 
used. 
 Study data will be captured on CRFs and will be verified to the source data, which necessitates 
access to all o riginal recordings, laboratory reports, and patient records. In addition, all source 
data should be attributable (signed and dated). The I nvestigator must therefore agree to allow 
direct access to all source data. Patients must also allow access to their m edical records, and 
patients will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement whe n giving informed 
 LMS- [ADDRESS_621750] review and sign the completed CRF casebook to verify its 
accuracy.  
 
16 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Qualified individuals approved and/or designated by [CONTACT_483796]. The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original medical records, of the study patients, and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator and staff 
are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_483797].  
 
Members of Catalyst’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of a 
clinical site at any time before, during, or after  completion of the study. The I nvestigator will 
be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspec tion, the I nvestigator should notify Cataly st immediately. The Investigator will 
ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  
 
[ADDRESS_621751] of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the s tudy files. The Investigator/institution must take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (e.g. patient charts) as well as any 
original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
 
All study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the las t approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_621752] elapsed since the formal

discontinuation of clini cal development of the IP. The I nvestigator/institution should retain 
patient identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_621753] with retention should  
Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of patient files for the full [ADDRESS_621754] to inform the I nvestigator /institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
[ADDRESS_621755] recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore 
encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and at seminars or conferences. The details of the processes of producing and reviewing report s, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this study will be described in any Clinical Trial 
Agreement .

Appendix 4   Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test  
Equipment : Stopwatch, Standard Chair with a rmrests  and seat height approximately 44 cm (17 
inches) and arm rest height approximately 65 cm (26 inches) , Mea sured distance of of 3 meters 
(9 feet 10 inches ).  
 
Patient Instructions  given by [CONTACT_191957] : 
 
“Sit in the chair with your back resting on the back of the chair and hands on the armrest s.  At 
the end of the test mat in front of you is a  green  light.  When you see the green light turn on , 
I want you to get up from the chair.  You should use the arms of the chair  to assist in standing 
up or sitting down from the chair.  Walk forward as quickly as you feel comfortable until you 
reach the orange area on the floor marking the end of the course.  You need to be in the orange 
area with both feet, turn around, walk back to the chair, turn around and sit down completely 
in the chair , touching your back to the back of the chair.  Immediately repeat the course I have 
just explained to you two more times.  Therefore, you will complete the course a total of three 
times without resting between each time that you do the course.”  
 “I will record the time it takes you to complete the course three times, with the ending time 
occurring when you sit down in the chair for the third time.  You may not use the wall for 
support. Please try to complete the course three times without resting b etween each time, if 
possible.”  
 
“We will begin in a moment.  Please focus on the light at the end of the cours e and listen for 
the beep.  Begin immediately upon hearing the beep and seeing the light.  Thank you.”  
 
Evaluator instructions:  
 The timing, gait, and progress in this test will be recorded automatically by [CONTACT_483799], both electronically by [CONTACT_483800].  Ensure that the subject’s back is touching the back of the chair at the beginning and end of each cycle of the course.  Ensure that the subject’s wear their regular footwear for the test and that they wear the same footwear each time the test is conducted.  Refer to past records to ensure the subject’s footwear 
has not changed between days.  The subject may use a walking assistive device (cane or walker) if that this their usual and normal practice for walking.  If a wal king assistive device 
 LMS- [ADDRESS_621761]’s may not be assisted by [CONTACT_483801].  If the subject’s 
become fatigued while walking, they may stop and rest, but should not sit down.  Any comments or question directed to the subject during the test should be for safety reasons only and be non- directive.  For example , “Are you ok? ”.  Remember that the entire test is recorded 
by [CONTACT_98991].

A sensitivity analysis of the coprimary endpoints will be conducted to evaluate the patterns 
of early treatment discontinuation.  For each coprimary endpoint , a randomization test 
will be conducted to determine if the results from the primary analysis are supported.  The randomization test is an alternative to a full permutation, and will evaluate the fixed effects model specified above using permutations of t he treatment group assignments.  If 
early discontinuations are not associated with treatment, then it is expected that the p -
value resulting from the randomization test will yield the same statistical interpretation as the p -value resulting from the primar y analysis.

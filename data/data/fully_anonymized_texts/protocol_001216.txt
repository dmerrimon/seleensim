  Title of Study: Modulation of autophagy: A clinical study of vorinostat plus 
hydroxychloroquine versus Regorafenib in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) patients.  
  
Investigators:  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16554], MD  
Statistician: Joel Michalek, PhD  
  
Study Center(s):  UT Health Cancer Center  
  
Concept and Rationale:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of 
cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] (1).  Recently, Regorafenib (RGF), an oral multi -kinase 
inhibitor with predominant angiogenic or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
inhibition, was approved  for patients with mCRC who have progressed on standard 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including anti -VEGF agent bevacizumab (2).  Compared to placebo, the phase  
III CORRECT study showed RGF improved median overall survival (mOS) from 5.0 to 
6.4 months (mo) and median progre ssion -free survival (mPFS) from 1.7 to 1.9 mo, 
regardless of K -Ras mutational status (3).  Given the modest improvements in survival 
and clinical studies showing lack of efficacy with continued VEGF inhibition following 
progression of anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as bevacizumab, novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16555] -line setting (4).  Investigators at our institution have 
shown that autophagy inhibition using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) enhanced the 
apoptotic activity of the histone deace tylase (HDAC) inhibitor, vorinostat (VOR), via 
ubiquitinated protein accumulation in pre -clinical CRC models (5). Based on this 
preclinical data, we completed an NIH -funded phase I clinical study evaluating the safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of the  combination VOR and HCQ and found that patients 
with mCRC obtain prolonged clinical benefit with the combination therapy with VOR and 
HCQ (6). This study led to a Phase II single -arm study of VOR 400 mg PO (orally) daily 
plus HCQ [ADDRESS_15833] received 
6+ cycles (preliminary mPFS of >3 months), further supporting its activity in mCRC.    
  
Further evaluation of biomark ers of autophagy, such as cathepsin D, and biomarkers of 
VOR, CDKN1A, that correlate with improved efficacy will help identify patients who 
benefit from autophagy inhibition (6).  The expression of high -mobility group box 1 
(HMGB1) increases with autophagy  in CRC, and HMGB1 acts upon binding to RAGE 
(“receptor for advanced glucated end products”) (7, 8).    
  
In addition, HDAC has been well -recognized as potential targets for the treatment of 
numerous aging -related disorders (9) such as cancer (10). Therefo re, we plan to evaluate 
the potential role of biomarkers of aging with the combination of HCQ plus VOR.  
  
These findings support a phase II study VOR/HCQ versus standard therapy RGF in 
patients failing standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
  
 
6  
  We hypothesize  that VOR/HCQ will have improved efficacy when compared to RGF in 
treatment -refractory mCRC patients.  This hypothesis is based on the observations that:  
1. In refractory mCRC patients, the role of continued VEGF inhibition in mCRC has 
not been established (4).   
2. Only a modest improvement in survival was reported with the use of RGF, an oral 
multi -kinase inhibitor with predominantly angiogenic inhibition, for mCRC 
patients who have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (3).   
3. Autophagy inhibition enhances vorinostat -induced ap optosis via ubiquitinated 
protein accumulation in CRC models pre -clinically (5).  
4. Clinical activity based on treatment -refractory mCRC patients enrolled in phase I 
(6) and the ongoing single arm Phase II study of VOR with HCQ therapy suggests 
a median PFS of > 3 months.  
  
Our overall objective is to answer these questions: will VOR/HCQ be more efficacious  
than RGF, will VOR/HCQ be safe, and can biomarkers be identified that will predict  
clinical efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF in refractory mCRC patients ?  
  
Primary Objective(s):     
• To determine the clinical efficacy with progression -free survival (PFS -1) of the 
combination of VOR plus HCQ when compared to RGF in treatment -refractory 
mCRC.  
  
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To determine the overall survival in refractory mCRC patients receiving VOR 
plus HCQ when compared to RGF.  
• To determine the progression -free survival (PFS -2) of the crossover treatment, 
which is optional.  
• To evaluate the tumor response rate in refractory  mCRC patients receiving VOR 
plus HCQ when compared to RGF.  
• To further define the safety of the combination of VOR/HCQ when compared to 
RGF in treatment -refractory mCRC.    
• To identify biomarkers of autophagy and anti -angiogenic inhibition that are 
associ ated with clinical efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF, respectively, in mCRC.  
  
Primary Endpoint(s):   
• PFS-1:  measured from the start of the first treatment the patient is randomized to until 
the date the criteria for progression are met or the date the pati ent is taken off study 
for any reason, whichever is shorter.   
  
Secondary Endpoint(s):    
• OS: measured from the start of treatment on trial until the death of the patient.  
• mPFS -2: measured from the start of the crossover treatment (second regimen, which is 
optional) until the date the criteria for progression are met or the date the patient is 
taken off study for any reason, whichever is shorter.   
 
7  
  • Response:  measured as best response, complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR), as defined by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST 1.1) 
Committee.  
• Adverse events:  grade 1 -5 adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) v4.0 ; measured at 
baseline, each cycle, and at off study date.  
• Biomarkers of efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF:  evaluate biomarkers of autophagy and 
anti-angiogenic inhibition that are associated with clinical effi cacy of VOR/HCQ and 
RGF, respectively, in mCRC.  
  
Study Design:    
This will be a randomized phase II clinical trial of patients with histologic documentation 
of metastatic colorectal cancer, who have received local and currently approved standard 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], excluding RGF. We will give VOR [ADDRESS_15834] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
excluding RGF. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to RGF or VOR/HCQ (see schema 
below). Also,  crossover is optional  after first progression on the initial therapy, and based 
on physician discretion and in the best interest of the patient.  If crossover is not done, 
then the patient will be off study and can go on to receive other treatments.  
  
Schema:  
  
**Crossover is optional and at the discretion of the physician and in the best interest  
for the patient  
  

8  
  Number of Patients:  Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients 
treated with RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15835] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15836] 5% lost to follow -up.  Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for 
follow up, 36 subjects per g roup are necessary to obtain 80% power. With 5% lost to  
 
follow -up the sample size required per group is 38 (=36/0.95), therefore, the total required  
sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the target accrual rate is 2 -4 patients/month to 
achieve a tar get accrual at 36 months with an additional 12 -month follow -up.

Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:  Follo w-up: A repeat CT scan will be 
performed after [ADDRESS_15842] every 2 cycles, or 8 weeks, to ensure no 
progression of disease. Patients will continue VOR/ HCQ or RGF until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102], or decision of 
physician for patient’s best interest. Crossover to the other arm will be allowed, but

[ADDRESS_15845] ical Methods:   
Analytic plan for primary objective:   
• mPFS -1: Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients treated with 
RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15846] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15847] 5% lost to follow -up.  Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for

required sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the target accrual rate is 2 -4 
patients/month to achieve a targe t accrual at 36 months with an additional 12 -month 
follow -up.     
  
Interim analysis:   The O'Brien -Fleming procedure will be used to conduct an interim 
analyses for efficacy when 50% of the patients complete the study.  A statistical basis for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16558]/HCQ Arm and exceeds 2.[ZIP_CODE], corresponding to a significance level of 0.003. 
If the test statistic does not exceed 2.[ADDRESS_15848] is not decl ared at the interim analysis, a 
statistical basis for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16557] 20%.  
  
Analytic plan for secondary objectives:  
• OS: The analyses of median OS will be performed in the  intent -to-treat population.  
OS will be illustrated with Kaplan -Meier plots, the estimate of median OS with its 
95% confidence interval.    
• mPFS -2: The analyses of median PFS -2 will be performed in the crossover population 
(crossover is optional).  mPFS -2 will be illustrated with Kaplan -Meier plots, the 
estimate of median PFS -2 with its 95% confidence interval.  Treatment groups will be 
contrasted with regard to the response rate with a logistic regression model adjusted 
for age, sex, race and the baseline  tumor K -RAS status (mutated, wild type); the odds 
ratio, its 95% confidence interval, and the p -value for testing the null hypothesis that 
the log odds ratio is zero will be presented.  If the logistic model fails due to small cell 
counts then treatments will be contrasted with regard to response using Fisher’s Exact 
Test.   
• Response rates : Response rates will be measured as the proportion of patients with the 
best response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as defined by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1 Criteria  and a 95% confidence interval.  
• Adverse events : All adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_16624].    
 
13  
  • Biomarkers of efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF :  The significance of variation in 
biomarkers with treatment will be assessed with linear models with and without 
adjustment for age, sex, race and the baseline tumor K -RAS status (mutated, wild 
type).  The dependent variables will be log transformed (base 2 ) if necessary.  The 
relation between treatment efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_16625] -1, and biomarkers will be 
assessed with proportional hazards models in terms of treatment, the biomarker, the 
biomarker by [CONTACT_9866], age, sex, race, and baseline tumo r K-RAS status  
(mutated, wild type).  Significant effects will be described and illustrated, as 
appropriate, with Kaplan Meier plots by [CONTACT_16626], for example.  
  
Sample size justification : Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients 
treated with RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15849] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15850] 5% lost to follow -up.  Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for 
follow up, 36 subjects per group are necessary  to obtain 80% power. With 5% lost to 
follow -up the sample size required per group is 38 (=36/0.95), therefore, the total required  
sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the target accrual rate is 2 -4 patients/month to 
achieve a target accrual at 36 months with an additional 12 -month follow -up.  
  
Funding, Regulatory, and Feasibility Issues: The study will be funded by a CPRIT 
grant.  We previously obtained VOR through [COMPANY_006] Pharmaceuticals for both our phase [ADDRESS_15851] 
(<$50/month per patient. Thus, the VOR/HCQ combination provides a cost -effective 
study drug combination. We have a large referral volume of mCRC patients to our 
institution for consideration of clinical studies, therefore we  do not expect problems with 
enrollment since we currently enroll 3 -4 refractory mCRC patients/month onto phase I 
clinical trials.  
  
Patient Acceptability/Ethics and Consent Issues: The combination of VOR/HCQ will 
be given in the third -line setting to pa tients with refractory mCRC failing first - and 
second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; therefore, this treatment competes with RGF or best supportive 
care. Since there is a clear need to identify better treatments to improve survival in mCRC, 
this study gives patients a tr eatment that is likely superior, based on preliminary data, 
when compared to current standard of care.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16559], as discussed above.  We expect that VOR/HCQ will be well tolerated based on 
our Phase I and II prelimi nary data, with no grade 4 or 5 adverse events observed. 
However, if there is unexpected toxicity, there will be early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16560]:  
  
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16561] : The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16562].  A toxicity event for the purposes 
of safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16563] a grade 4 or 5 toxicity of any kind due to treatment with 
VOR and/or HCQ.  If at any time during the study there are 2 or more grade 5 toxiciti es 
that are attributed to VOR and/or HCQ, then the study will be terminated.  If > 50% of 
patients are having similar type of grade [ADDRESS_15852] (DSMB): All protocols conducted at UT Health  
Cancer Center is covered under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_16564] (DSMP).  The Institutional DSMP global policies provide individual trials with 
institutional policies and procedures, as well as monitoring adverse events of study  agents 
that are overseen by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB). Baseline events and 
adverse events will be captured using the Master Adverse Events Document for each 
patient. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16565] r this 
study are met. The DSMB will meet every 6 months to discuss the safety update of this 
study .  
  
2.0 Background  
2.1 Metastatic colorectal cancer:   
Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002], with 
20% of p atients presenting with distant metastatic disease at the time of presentation (1). Patients 
with distant metastases have a 5 -year survival rate of 13%, indicating the need for better 
treatments to improve survival in patients with mCRC.   
  
2.2 VEGF inhib ition in mCRC:    
The VEGF pathway is essential to angiogenesis, a process that is exploited by [CONTACT_16628] (13 -15).  Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, including colorectal 
cancer, have been shown to express VEGF (16).  Th us, this led to the initial phase II study of 
bevacizumab with a chemotherapy backbone showing encouraging improvements in survival and 
serving as groundwork for future studies (17). Agents targeting the angiogenic pathway have 
been the cornerstone of mCRC  treatment for the last [ADDRESS_15853] therapy includes 
systemic chemotherapy, in combination or in sequence, consisting of fluoropyrimidines, 
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan with monoclonal antibodies that target VEGF, bevacizumab or 
zivaflibercept (18).  The benefit of adding bevacizumab was first demonstrated in the AVF2017 
phase III study of 813 previously untreated patients randomized to irinotecan plus bolus 
fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL) with placebo or bevacizumab. The study showed improvement 
with bevacizumab in median overall survival (mOS) (15.6 to 20.3 months, P<0.001) and in 
median progression -free survival (mPFS) (6.2 to 10.6 months, P<0.001) (19).  Based on this 
study, the US FDA approved bevacizumab in [ADDRESS_15854] -line treatment for mCR C in 
combination with chemotherapy. In 2004, the N9741 study reported that IFL was an inferior 
backbone compared to fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) which led to most 
US physician adopting FOLFOX as their preferred first line regimen (2 0).   
  
The well -designed first -line NO16966 trial randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, 1401 
previously untreated mCRC patients either to capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) or 
FOLFOX4, and then to bevacizumab or placebo.  Adding bevacizumab to chemot herapy 
increased mPFS from 8.0 to 9.4 months (P=0.0023) and mOS from 19.9 to 21.3 months 
(P=0.077); despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a statistically significant improvement in PFS, a similar improvement in OS 
was not observed (21).  Subsequent studies showed similar efficacy of th e FOLFIRI and 
15  
  FOLFOX regimens in chemotherapy -naïve mCRC patients (22, 23); consequently, bevacizumab 
is often combined with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Results of these and other 
studies have been the basis for the prominent role of VEGF inhibi tion in bevacizumab -naïve 
mCRC patients (24, 25).    
  
Preclinical and clinical observations suggested a rebound or flare -up of angiogenesis when 
VEGF -targeted therapy was withheld (26, 27).  Such findings favored continuing anti -angiogenic 
therapy after i nitial clinical and/or radiological progression in the first - or second -line setting. 
After first progression on prior chemotherapy with three or more months of bevacizumab, the  
TML study was the first prospective study to show improvement in mPFS, 4.1 ve rsus 5.7 months 
(P<0.0001), and mOS, 9.8 versus 11.2 months (P=0.0062), favoring bevacizumab continuation 
when combined with chemotherapy backbone (28), although statistically significant, gains in 
mOS were modest.  Conversely, the phase III GONO trial ran domized mCRC patients treated 
first-line with bevacizumab and fluoropyrimidines (FOLFIRI, FOLFOX or FOLFOXIRI) to 
receive mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab.  mPFS improved from 5.0 to 6.7 
months with bevacizumab (P=0.0065), but mOS was 14.3 v ersus 15.9 months (P=0.11) (29).  
The improvement of 1.[ADDRESS_15855] progression, with some phase III studies showing better mPFS 
with VEGF inhibition, while no difference in mOS was observed (21, 29).  
  
2.2.1 VEGF inhibition in refractory mCRC:    
In refractory mCRC, the role of VEGF inhibition in mCRC patients has not been established 
(30). Recently, Regorafenib (RGF), an oral multi -kinase inhibitor, including  with angiogenic 
inhibition, was approved fo r mCRC patients who have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (2).  In the 
CORRECT trial, patients with mCRC were randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_15856] supportive 
care with oral RGF 160 mg or placebo by [CONTACT_16629], for 3 weeks of a 4 -week cycle (3). 
The pri mary endpoint was overall survival. Compared to placebo, RGF improved mPFS from 1.7 
to 1.9 months (P<0.000001) and mOS from 5.0 to 6.4 months (P=0.005), regardless of K -RAS 
status (3).  The most common treatment -related toxicities were fatigue (47% vs 28%, RGF vs 
placebo), hand -foot syndrome (47% vs 8%), diarrhea (34% vs 8%), anorexia (30% vs 15%), 
voice changes (29% vs 6%), hypertension (28% vs 6%), oral mucositis (27% vs 4%), 
rash/desquamation (26% vs 4%), nausea (14% vs 11%), weight loss (14% vs 2%), and fever 
(10% vs 3%).  In this study, 54% patients had grade 3 or more adverse events versus 14% with 
placebo, with the most common grade 3 fatigue (9% vs 5%) and grade 3 hand -foot syndrome 
(17% vs <1%).  In the third -line setting, even when statistical signi ficance is reached, gains in 
PFS and OS are modest, i.e., 0.2 months (6 days) improvement in mPFS and the 1.4 months (42 
days) benefit in mOS seen with RGF over placebo (3).  Given the modest improvements of RGF 
in survival, VEGF inhibition may not be bene ficial to all patients with mCRC refractory to 
VEGF inhibitors; therefore, more therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16566].

  2.3 Autophagy as a mechanism for cancer survival:   
Autophagy is a conserved protein degrad ation process that involves the vacuolar sequestration of 
long-lived cytoplasmic proteins and organelles into a structure called an autophagosome (31). 
Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, which results in the proteolytic degradation of their 
contents. In e ukaryotic cells, autophagy plays an important role in the disposal of damaged 
organelles and proteins and serves to generate alternative sources of energy for cell survival 
during cellular stress through the catabolization of protein substrates (32). The a ctivation of 
stress response genes such as p53 by [CONTACT_16630][INVESTIGATOR_16567] (33). Although prolonged autophagy can result in cancer cell death, recent 
investigations suggest that therapy -induced autophagy is a re versible response that promotes 
cancer cell survival and thus, may diminish the efficacy of some therapeutic agents  (34-36). 
Therefore, autophagy may significantly contribute to resistance to a number of anticancer 
therapeutic modalities.  
  
2.3.1 Autophag y as a mechanism of resistance to anti -cancer therapeutics.    
The induction of autophagy has been observed in malignant cells after treatments, such as 
tamoxifen, imatinib, arsenic trioxide, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and rapamycin 
(3741).  Hi stone deacetylase inhibitors, such as Vorinostat (VOR), have shown selective anti -
cancer activity in preclinical and clinical models (10).  The main effect of vorinostat, VOR, is 
inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, which causes hyperacetylat ion of all core 
histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with 
condensed chromatin structure, which results in the repression of the transcription of many genes 
including those implicated in the regulation of cell sur vival, proliferation, differentiation and 
apoptosis. Through HDAC inhibition, vorinostat can restore the expression of silenced genes by 
[CONTACT_16631], leading to the subsequent induction of differentiation 
and apoptosis (42).  VO R induces cell cycle arrest in either the G1 or G2M phases, 
downregulates cyclin Dl and D2, upregulates p53, p21 and p27 expression, and stimulates 
apoptosis.   
  
The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by [CONTACT_16632] -translational modifications including acetylation. Acetylation promotes p53 
stability and function. There is evidence that deacetylation of p53 is mediated by a histone 
deacetylase -1-containing complex, which modulates p53 -mediated cell growth arrest and 
apoptosis (43, 44).  In pre -clinical studies vorinostat also inhibited VEGF -induced expression of 
the VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2) and neuropi[INVESTIGATOR_16568] , thus blocking angiogenic signaling, 
and reducing circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF -alpha, IL1 beta, IL6 and IFN 
gamma induced liposaccharide) (45, 46).   
  
VOR was the first HDAC inhibitor to obtain FDA approval for cancer therapy.  It is  currently 
indicated for the treatment of cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (CTCL) and has demonstrated modest 
activity in patients with advanced solid tumors with ongoing clinical studies in advanced CRC 
(47).  Studies have identified key mechanisms of resistance  to HDAC inhibitors with the primary 
goals of identifying patients likely to benefit from treatment with this class of agents and 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_16569] (48 -50). Pre-clinical studies have shown that 
HDAC inhibitor -induced autophag y blunts its anticancer activity (36).   
17  
    
2.3.2 Preclinical studies of autophagy inhibition in CRC models:   
Chloroquine (CQ) is a synthetic 4 -arninoquinoline that has been used for more than 60 years in 
humans for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria  (51) and rheumatoid arthritis (52). CQ is an 
orally available and inexpensive drug that has CNS penetration and a broad therapeutic index. It 
is most predictable cumulative toxicity is retinopathy, which can be prevented by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_16570] (53, 54). CQ derivatives such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are still 
widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosis and have a greater 
therapeutic index than CQ. By [CONTACT_16633], CQ derivatives funct ion as 
weak bases and are trapped in acidic cellular compartments, including lysosomes (55). The 
deacidification of lysosomes by [CONTACT_16634]. Consequently, CQ and  its derivatives inhibit the last 
step in the autophagic degradation process. When autophagy is inhibited by [CONTACT_16635], cells dependent 
on autophagy for survival increase the generation of autophagosomes and undergo either 
apoptotic or non -apoptotic cell death.   
  
Our group’s preclinical data have shown that autophagy inhibition can reduce tumor burden 
and induce apoptosis in the colon cancer xenograft model (5).   CQ has been shown to be an 
inhibitor of autophagy by [CONTACT_16636] -induced 
apoptosis via ubiquitinated protein accumulation, which may be a potential therapy in mCRC (5).   
Preclinical investigations conducted in mouse models and human cancer cell lines indicate that 
CQ may have significant anticancer activity du e to its ability to inhibit autophagy induced by 
[CONTACT_16637], such as VOR (5, 56). Therapy -induced increase in the levels of lysosomal 
protease cathepsin D was identified as a key downstream pharmacodynamic mediator of the 
proapoptotic effects vori nostat when combined with the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ) 
(5, 56).    
  
Figure 1: Representative tumor scan images demonstrating response to VOR/HCQ in phase 
I study.    
Treatment with HCQ and VOR yielded a prolonged partial response in a patient with refractory 
RCC that has been durable for more than [ADDRESS_15857] cycles 10 and 50 (C10 and C50, respectively) are shown.  
  

18  
  2.4 Rationale for combining VOR and HCQ.   
The HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) is approved for the treatment of CTCL and is being 
investigated for the treatment of many other types of cancer. Vorinostat has pleiotropic effects 
and induces both apoptosis and autophagy. Considering that autophagy may promote cancer cell 
survival, we hypothesized that inhibiting autophagy would enhance the anticancer activity of 
VOR. Our group have reported that the autophagy inhibitor CQ dramatically augmented the 
antineoplasti c effects of VOR in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines and primary 
CML cells expressing wild -type and imatinib -resistant mutant forms of BCR -Abl, including 
T315I(56). This combination regimen demonstrated selectivity for malignant cells in in vitro 
studies and its efficacy was not diminished by [CONTACT_16638] -mediated impairment of p53 function, 
another factor that contributes to the resistance to imatinib and many other anticancer agents. 
Inhibiting autophagy with CQ promoted VOR –induced superoxide generat ion, triggered 
relocalization and marked increases in the expression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D, and 
reduced the expression of the cathepsin D substrate thioredoxin. Knockdown of cathepsin D 
diminished the efficacy of this combination, demonstra ting its role as a critical mediator of this 
therapeutic response (56).   
  
We extended our preclinical evaluation of this combination to in vitro and in vivo  models of 
colon cancer (5). Our results showed that HCQ significantly increased the pro -apoptotic  effects 
of VOR. HCQ was well tolerated and significantly reduced the tumor burden of nude mice 
bearing xenografts of the HCT8 and HT29 human colon cancer cell lines as compared with mice 
treated with vorinostat alone. Our data suggest that the autophagy i nhibitors CQ/HCQ 
significantly increase the anti -cancer activity of VOR and that this combination represents a 
promising new strategy to treat refractory cancer patients that fail conventional therapy.   
  
2.4.1 Clinical safety of autophagy inhibition in m CRC patients.   
Based on the data described above, we conducted an NCI -funded study Phase 1 Safety,  
Tolerability, and Phamacokinetics (PK) of HCQ in Combination with the VOR in Patients 
(Patients) with Advanced Solid Tumors. The primary objective of this study was to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HCQ in combination with VOR in patients with advanced 
solid tumors. Patients with ECOG PS 0 -2 and adequate organ function received by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) 
VOR 300 -400 mg daily and HCQ 400 -1000 mg daily in 21 -day cycles. Thirty -one patients were 
enrolled, with 27 evaluable for DLT due to three patients having rapid clinical deterioration 
related to underlying disease in cycle 1 (6). The recommended dose is VOR 400 mg PO daily 
plus HCQ 600 mg PO daily. Grade 3 AE were as follows: fatigue (3), anemia (1), neutropenia 
(1), thrombocytopenia (1). Fatigue and gastrointestinal AE were dose -limiting toxicities.  
Treatment -related toxicities were primarily grade 1 -2: nausea (11 patients), diarrhea (8), fatigue 
(6), anore xia (4), weight loss (4), anemia (4), and elevated creatinine (4). Grade 3 toxicities were 
fatigue (3), anemia (1), thrombocytopenia (1) and neutropenia (1). No drugrelated deaths or 
grade [ADDRESS_15858] 1.0 criteria (57).  One patient with renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) who had failed seven lines of prior therapy had a confirmed durable par tial/ 
near complete response (cohort 2, active on study with more than 50 cycles received or 3 years)   
19  
  (See Figure 1). Two patients with K -RAS mutated mCRC had prolonged stable disease (≥6 
cycles). The addition of HCQ did not significantly impact the PK pr ofile of VOR.   
  
2.5. Preliminary data   
2.5.1  Clinical efficacy of autophagy inhibition in mCRC.    
This led to a Phase II single arm study of vorinostat (VOR) plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in 
patients with advanced CRC (through UT Health Cancer Center fun ding). Based on phase I data, 
the recommended phase II dose is HCQ [ADDRESS_15859] received 6+ cycles ( preliminary median PFS > 3 months), indicating a 
potential new agent in refractory mCRC patients. Similar the phase I study, the safety profile 
demonstrated tolerance of VOR/HCQ, with dose reductions to 300 mg/400 mg mainly for G2/G3 
nausea performed follo wing 1 cycle, respectively, in about 35% of all patients (See Table 1).

  Additionally, peripheral blood specimens were col lected from patients on  Days 1, 7, and 49 of 
treatment. Tumor biopsies were also obtained from 2 patients with CRC at baseline and 
posttreatment on Day 49. Quantitative RT -PCR analyses revealed that significant increases in the 
levels of the cyclin -depende nt kinase inhibitor CDKN1A  from baseline, an established biomarker 
of VOR, could be detected in PBMCs from patients in all four treatment cohorts (See Figure 
2A). Considering this dose level is above the MTD, these findings indicate that PBMC 
specimens may  not be appropriate for monitoring of HCQ -driven correlative PD endpoints.   
  
In contrast, significant increases from baseline in both CDKN1A  and CTSD  were readily 
observed in tumor biopsy specimens obtained from 2 patients treated at the MTD of VOR plus 
HCQ (See Figure 2B). Although the number of tumors that we were able to obtain for these 
analyses is small, our preliminary results suggest that tumor specimens may be more valuable 
than PBMCs with respect to quantifying treatment -related markers associate d with autophagy 
inhibition. This possibility is further supported by [CONTACT_16639] (AV) in 
PBMCs. Notably, the number of AVs per cell in PBMC specimens collected from patients 
treated in the MTD cohort was not significantly affected by [CONTACT_16640]. A very modest, but statistically insignificant rise in the number of AVs/cell was 
noted on Day 7. However, by [CONTACT_2006] 49, this effect was gone and the mean AVs/cell was actually 
slightly below baseline levels ( See Figure 2C -D).   
  
Treatment -related increases in the expression of p21 and cathepsin D were more pronounced in 
tumor biopsies than peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  However, given small 
number of patients in this phase study, these biomarker s of treatment need to be further 
correlated with efficacy and investigated in a larger clinical trial.  These findings support a large 
phase II study evaluating VOR/HCQ in patients with refractory mCRC.

vesicles per cell for patients enrolled in the MT D cohort (cohort 3) is shown in (C).  
Representative images for one patient’s specimens collected at baseline, Day 7 and Day 49 are 
shown in (D).  
  
2.6. Correlative Studies  
2.6.1 Correlative Studies of autophagy inhibition in relation to efficacy.    
Furthermore, preliminary data at our institution has shown that the induction of biomarkers of 
autophagy cathepsin D (CTSD) and CDKN1A correlate both in PBMCs and patient’s primary 
tumor using RT -PCR and electron microscopy (EM) (Fig 2 A -D) with efficacy of VO R/HCQ(6). 
We also observed increases in SQSTM1/p62 levels in PBMCs in patients treated with 
VOR/HCQ. (6) In addition, expression of high -mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) increases with 
autophagy in CRC, and HMGB1 acts upon binding to RAGE (“receptor for advanc ed glucated 

22  
  end products”) (7, 8). Also, LDH has been associated with necrotic cell death due to autophagy, 
which should decrease with autophagy inhibition (58). Thus, we hypothesize that with 
VOR/HCQ, and thus autophagy inhibition, CTSD, CDKN1A, and SQSTM 1/p62 will increase, 
and that HMGB and RAGE levels will decrease .  The change in expression levels of these 
various cellular proteins appears to be correlated with clinical efficacy.  
  
Therefore, we suggest prospectively incorporating the identification o f such predictive 
biomarkers in this study and the assessment of such biomarkers relative to the efficacy of agents 
evaluated. Establishing a predictive biomarker associated with clinical sensitivity to autophagy 
inhibitors is necessary for the optimal dev elopment of this class of drugs for cancer therapy.  In 
addition, delineation of patients who would benefit from autophagy inhibition should reduce 
unnecessary costs and toxicities.    
  
In addition, HDAC has been well -recognized as potential targets for t he treatment of numerous 
aging -related disorders (9) such as cancer (10). Therefore, we plan to evaluate the potential role 
of biomarkers of aging with the combination of HCQ plus VOR.  
  
2.6.[ADDRESS_15860] trial demonstrated that plasma VEGF -A and tumor 
neuropi[INVESTIGATOR_16568] -1 are strong biomarkers for predicting clinical outcome in  patients with advanced 
gastric cancer treated with Bev (59).  For mCRC patients receiving Bev, low levels of baseline 
angiopoetin -2, a key regulator of vascular remodeling in conjunction with VEGF, has been 
associated with better response rates, PFS and O S (60, 61). Additionally, in pre -clinical studies 
VOR also inhibited VEGF -induced expression of the VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2) and 
neuropi[INVESTIGATOR_16568], thus blocking angiogenic signaling, and reducing circulating levels of inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF -alpha, IL 1 beta, IL6 and IFN gamma induced liposaccharide) (45, 46).    
  
Therefore, we will prospectively incorporate the identification of such predictive biomarkers in 
this study and the assessment of such biomarkers relative to the efficacy of agents evaluated.  
Establishing a predictive biomarker associated with clinical sensitivity to autophagy inhibitors is 
necessary for the optimal development of this class of drugs for cancer therapy.  Also, 
delineation of patients who would benefit from VEGF inhibition and alternative non -VEGF 
targeting agents should reduce unnecessary costs and toxicities.    
  
 2.6.3  Correlative studies of HDAC inhibitors in relation to aging.   
Alterations in protein misfolding, aggregation, and degradation are widely implicated in an 
increasing number of aging -related diseases, providing for novel therapeutic opportunities 
targeting protein homeostasis (proteostasis). The proteostasis network is essential at the cellular 
and organismal level for development and lifespan (62).  Components  of this system include the 
ubiquitin -proteasome and the autophagic -lysosomal systems that allow for degradation and 
clearance, along with HDAC that regulate epi[INVESTIGATOR_16571] (63).  Inhibitors of 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) exhibit neuroprote ctive and neuroregenerative properties in animal 
23  
  models of various brain diseases (64). In preclinical models, HDAC inhibitors promote 
functional recovery of aging axons (65).   Also, administration of the short fatty acid 
4phenylbutyrate, an HDAC inhibito r, to a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease restored learning 
behavior as a result of  elevated levels of H4 acetylation and increased synthesis of proteins 
involved in synaptic function (9).  Further, elevated acetylation of histones (66) were obtained in 
mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease treated with the pan -HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) 
(67).  Therefore, the effects of HDAC inhibitors on aging need to be further investigated in 
humans.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarkers of aging.     
Chronologic aging has been associated with an increase in senescent cell populations throughout 
the body (68).  Most senescent cells appear to express p16Ink4a, a cyclin -dependent kinase 
inhibitor and tumor suppressor, and are known to increase with aging in pre -clinical and clinical 
models, including cancer patients (69 -71).  The causal relationship between cellular senescence 
and aging is not understood, but it is thought that pro -inflammatory factors produced by 
[CONTACT_16642] (IL -1, IL -6, IL -8, TNFalph a, MCP1, MMP3), known as the senescenceassociated 
secretory phenotype (SASP) mediate the aging phenotype (72). Therefore, the above findings 
support the evaluation of the effects of proteostasis modulation with HDAC inhibitors on 
aging in humans.  We hypot hesize  that HDAC inhibitors will decrease biomarkers of aging, and 
therefore, slow aging when compared to normal controls.

5.0 Study Design:  
This will be a phase II randomized clinical tria l of patients with histologic documentation of 
metastatic colorectal cancer, who have received local and currently approved standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
excluding RGF. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to RGF or VOR/HCQ (see schema below) and 
stratified by [CONTACT_16643] s (wild -type or mutated). We will give VOR 400 mg PO daily and HCQ 
600 mg PO daily in 4 -week cycles. Patients will require imaging up to 6 weeks prior to 
enrollment and will be assessed for measureable evidence of mCRC.   Crossover to the other arm 
will be  allowed, but OPTIONAL, and will be determined by [CONTACT_16644]’s best interest.  
  
5.1 Sample size:   
Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients treated with RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15865] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15866] 5% lost to follow -up.  
Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for follow up, 36 subjects per g roup are 
necessary to obtain 80% power. With 5% lost to follow -up the sample size required per group is 
38 (=36/0.95), therefore, the total required sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the target 
accrual rate is 2 -4 patients/month to achieve a target  accrual at 36 months with an additional 
12month follow -up.

and exceeds 2.[ZIP_CODE], corresponding to a significance level of 0.003. If the test statistic does not 
exceed 2.[ADDRESS_15871] statistic indicates benefit 
and exceeds 1.[ZIP_CODE], corresponding to a signifi cance level of 0.047.  
  
5.3.2 VOR and HCQ Administration  
The starting dose will be VOR 400 mg PO daily and HCQ 600 mg PO daily, as determined by 
[CONTACT_16646] I study in advanced cancer and as given in the expansion cohort of mCRC patients.  
    
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16647]. 
The dose reductions will be 300 mg (level -I), 200 mg (level -2).   
  
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16648]. 
The dose reductions will be 400 mg (level -I), 200 mg (level -2).   
  
If toxicity is thought to be due to VOR and HCQ, then dose reductions can be done for each drug 
as above.

The starting dose will be RGF 160 mg PO daily, for 3 weeks, of a 4 -week cycle, as determined 
by [CONTACT_16649] (3). All patients will be given a handout on how to take  
Regorafenib (Appendix 12.3).   
    
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16650]. 
The dose reductions will be 120 mg (level -I), 80 mg (level -2).

5.3.4 Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Diarrhea Management: Treat diarrhea promptly with appropriate supportive care, including 
loperamide. Instruct patients to begin taking loperamide at the first signs of: 1) poorly formed or 
loose stool, 2) occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in one day, or 3) unusuall y high 
volume of stool. Loperamide should be taken in the following manner: [ADDRESS_15872] onset of 
diarrhea, then 2 mg after each unformed stool. Daily dose should not exceed 16 mg/day. -1  400 mg  400 mg  
-2  300 mg  200 mg  
29  
  Loperamide should not be taken prophylactically. Advise patients to drink plenty of clear fluids 
to help prevent dehydration caused by [CONTACT_16651]. Avoid loperamide if there is the presence  of 
blood or mucus in the stool or if diarrhea is accompanied by [CONTACT_411]. If grade 3 or 4 diarrhea 
develops, discontinue further treatment with vorinostat.  
  
Anti -emetic Prophylaxis: During dosing, promethazine (25 mg PO) or metoclopramide (10 mg 
PO) every [ADDRESS_15873] be used. For patients who experience nausea and vomiting 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_16573], dexamethasone (4 mg PO) every 12 hours and grani setron (1 
mg PO) QD, or equivalent 5HT3 antagonist, may be administered. All patients should have 
antiemetic medications available once discharged from the clinic. Oral anti -emetic medications 
should be prescribed and administered as needed, and adjusted d uring the cycle at the discretion 
of the treating investigator. The prophylactic use of a [ADDRESS_15874] be recorded. 
Control of nausea and vomiting may require institution of multiple anti -emetic medications 
including phenothiazines or 5 -HT3 antagonists.  
  
Hydration Management: Adequate hydration is important in t he event of dysgeusia. Advise 
patients that popsicles and Gatorade may be useful in this event.   
  
Corticosteroids: If the patient receives steroids an effort will be made to keep the patient on this 
steroid dose until the next scan is obtained. Corticost eroid dose can be tapered as clinically 
indicated if the patient appears to be responding to therapy as judged by [CONTACT_16652].  
  
Anti -convulsants: Because HCQ has known effects on P450 enzymes, patients requiring 
anticonvulsants may be treated with any o f the non -enzyme inducing anti -convulsants, which 
include: felbamate, valproate acid, gabapentin, lamotrigine, tiagibine, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], zonisamide, or 
levetiracetarn. Patients requiring the use of enzyme -inducing anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_7377]  
(phenytoin, carbam azepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) are not eligible for entry 
into the study. If these agents are required during the study, patients will discontinue study 
treatment.  
  
Growth factors: Patients are allowed to continue hematological growt h factors such as Aranesp 
if initiated before the protocol. G -CSF or GM -CSF will not be allowed as prevention in cycle 1, 
but could be used as needed for treatment of grade 4 or complicated neutropenia on cycle 1 or 
beyond. If prophylaxis is considered nec essary by [CONTACT_16653] 1, this is 
allowed.   
  
Given the possibility of metabolic interaction through the P450 2D6 enzyme the concomitant 
administration of HCQ with digoxin, B blockers, cyclosporine and cimetidine should be closel y 
monitored.  
  
5.4 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
30  
  Toxicity Criteria - This study will utilize the CTCAE version 4.0 for toxicity and Adverse Event  
Reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.g ov). All appropriate treatment areas will have access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0.  
  
5.4.[ADDRESS_15875] be 
delayed until toxicity is resolved (≤ Grade 2 or ≤ Baseline). If toxicity is not resolved in ≤2 
weeks, patient will b e taken off treatment except if the patient experiences clinical benefit.   
  
5.4.2 Dose Reduction for VOR and/or HCQ (see Table 2)  
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16647]. 
The dose reductions will be 300 mg (level -I), 200 mg (level -2).   
  
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16648]. 
The dose reductions will be 400 mg (level -I), 200 mg (level -2).   
  
If toxicity is thought to be due to VOR and HCQ, then dose reductions can be done for each drug 
as above.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] HCQ Dose Modification  
 
reinstitution of treatment can o ccur but at a reduced dose as described in Table 2.  
  
If the AE recurs at the reduced dose, treatment will be held until the AE has resolved to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_15876] to visual field deficits patients should be cautioned to report any visual 
symptoms, particularly difficulty seeing entire words or faces, intolerance to glare, decreased 
night vi sion, or loss of peripheral vision. These symptoms of peripheral retinal toxicity should 
prompt drug discontinuation and ophthalmologic evaluation.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] VOR Dose Modification  
Known VOR hematological or non -hematological toxicities will not be attributed to HCQ and 
will only be attributed to VOR and may result in VOR dose modifications. Toxicities having an 
attribution to VOR of possible, probable or definite will result in the following VOR dose 
modifications:  
  
VOR administration will be delayed, reduced or discontinued based on weekly assessment of 
according to hematological and non -hematological toxicity criteria, as specified below.  

31  
    
If the administration of VOR has to be  interrupted, the treatment with HCQ will proceed 
normally and no catch -up days of VOR. The total number of days of VOR administration and 
total dose of VOR will be recorded in the CRF.  
  
5.4.3 Dose Modification for RGF (Table 3)  
The starting dose will be RGF 160 mg PO daily, for 3 weeks, of a 4 -week cycle, as determined 
by [CONTACT_16649] (3).  
    
Dose can be decreased due to toxicity if deemed by [CONTACT_16650]. 
The dose reduc tions will be 120 mg (level -I), 80 mg (level -2).   
  
Due to known hepatic toxicity, we will monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) 
before initiation of RGF and monitor at least every two weeks during the first [ADDRESS_15877] or baseline. Temporarily hold and then reduce or  
permanently discontinue RGF depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as 
manifested by [CONTACT_16654]. See below for specific 
recommendations:  
  
Interrupt Regorafenib for the following :  
• NCI CTC AE Grade 2 hand -foot skin reaction (HFSR) [palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(PPE)] that is recurrent or does not improve within 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574]; interrupt 
therapy for a minimum of 7 days for Grade 3 HFSR  
• Symptomatic Grade 2 hypertension  
• Any NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction  
  
Reduce the dose of Regorafenib to 120 mg :  
• For the first occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR of any duration  
• After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction  
• For Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine amin otransferase (ALT) elevation; only 
resume if the potential benefit outweighs the risk of hepatotoxicity  
  
Reduce the dose of Regorafenib to 80 mg :  
• For re -occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR at the 120 mg dose  
• After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction a t the 120 mg dose (except hepatotoxicity)  
  
Discontinue Regorafenib permanently for the following :  
• Failure to tolerate 80 mg dose  
• Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than [ADDRESS_15878]  
• Re-occurrence of AST or ALT more than [ADDRESS_15879] despi[INVESTIGATOR_5312] 120 mg  
32  
  • For any Grade 4 adverse reaction; only resume if the potential benefit o utweighs the risks  
  
5.5 Use of Hematologic Growth Factors

Classification: Antineoplastic  
  
CAS Registry Number: 149647 -78-9  
  
Molecular Formula:  C 14H20N2O 3  M.W.: 264.32  
  
34  
  Approximate Solubility: Water ≤ 5 mg/mL   
  
Description: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor  
  
Mode of Action:   
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that regulate chromatin remodeling and 
gene transcription via the dynamic process of acetylation and deacetylation of core histones.    
  
Vorinostat, a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity, binds directly to the catalytic pocket of HDAC 
enzymes. It causes Gl or G2 phase cell -cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation in cultured 
transformed cells.  
  
How Supplied: Vorinostat is supplied b y [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. and distributed by [CONTACT_16656], 
DCTD, NCI. Vorinostat is supplied as a white, opaque gelatin, size 3 capsule, containing 100 mg 
of vorinostat. The inactive ingredients contained in each capsule are microcrystalline cellulose, 
sodium crosca rmellose, and magnesium stearate.   
  
Vorinostat 100 mg capsules are supplied in bottles containing 120 capsules.  
Storage: Store vorinostat capsules at room temperature, 15 to 30 ºC (59 to 86  ºF). Do not store 
above 30 ºC. Avoid exposure to excessive moisture.  
  
Stability: Shelf life stability studies of the intact bottles are on -going.  
  
Route of Administration: Orally   
  
Method of Administration:  Unless otherwise stated in the protocol, vor inostat capsules must be 
administered whole with 8 oz. of water. Administer doses of vorinostat with food, if possible.   
  
Potential Drug 1nteractions:  The major pathways of vorinostat metabolism involve 
glucuronidation and p -oxidation. As vorinostat is n ot eliminated via CYP450 pathways, no 
drugdrug interactions are expected with known CYP450 inhibitors or inducers. Although 
vorinostat was not a potent reversible.  
  
CYP450 inhibitor, studies performed to monitor gene expression changes indicated some 
potential for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activity suppression. However, these changes were observed 
at concentrations higher than the pharmacologically relevant concentration of 2 mcM (C max).  
  
Prothrombin time and INR prolongations have been reported in patients tak ing vorinostat 
concomitantly with coumarin derivative anticoagulants. Monitor these patients more frequently 
for alterations in their coagulation parameters.  
  
35  
  Special Handling: Vorinostat is an anticancer drug. Clean powder spi[INVESTIGATOR_16579]. Wash spi[INVESTIGATOR_16580] 3 times 
with ethyl alcohol, followed by [CONTACT_16657].      
  
Patient Care Implications: Because vorinostat's dose limiting toxicities are anorexia, 
dehydration, diarrhea, and fatigue, patients should maintain adequate fluid and food intake. 
Encourage patients to seek a nutritional consult.  
  
Women of child bearing potential / men capable of fathering a child:  
All women of childbearing potential MUST have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_15881] not be enrolled in the s tudy.   
  
Vorinostat can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate 
and well -controlled studies of vorinostat in pregnant women. Results of animal studies indicate 
that vorinostat crosses the placenta and is found in feta l plasma. Doses up to 50 and 150 
mg/kg/day were tested in rats and rabbits, respectively ( -0.5 times the human exposure based on 
AUC 0 -24). Treatment -related developmental effects including decreased mean live fetal 
weights, incomplete ossifications of the  skull, thoracic vertebra, sternum, metacarpals and 
skeletal variations (cervical ribs, supernumerary ribs, vertebral count and sacral arch variations) 
in rats and rabbits at the highest doses of vorinostat tested. The no observed effect level (NOEL) 
for these effects was 15 and 50 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human exposure based on AUC) in 
rats and rabbits. If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard t o the fetus.  
  
During the course of the trial, all patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_16658] a child. In addition, 
a missed or late menstrual period shou ld be reported to the treating physician. If a female patient 
or the treating physician suspects that the female patient may be pregnant prior to administration 
of study drugs, the study drugs must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are 
available. If pregnancy is confirmed the patient must not receive study medications and must be 
withdrawn from the study. Throughout the entire pregnancy, additional contact [CONTACT_16659], and in some cases with the healthcare provider, to id entify spontaneous 
abortions and elective terminations, as well as any medical reasons for elective termination. In 
addition, the study investigator should include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be 
followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_15882] 
36  
  abstraction, or a combination of these methods. All serious adverse event reports relating to the 
pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion, elective ab ortion and congenital anomalies, should 
be forwarded to the FDA & [COMPANY_006] & Co. Inc. (See Safety reporting section).  
  
It is not known whether vorinostat is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted 
in human milk and because of the potential f or serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from 
Vorinostat, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, 
taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

37  
    
Approximate Solubility: insoluble in water, slightly soluble in acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, 
and ethyl acetate and sparingly soluble in acetone.  
  
Description: kinase inhibitor  
  
Mode of Action:   
Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane -bound and intracellular kinases 
involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor 
angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. In  in vitro biochemical or 
cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M -[ADDRESS_15883] been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, Regorafenib 
demonstrated anti -angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition of tumor growth as 
well as anti -metastatic activity in several mouse  xenograft models including some for human 
colorectal carcinoma  
  
In colorectal cancer, Regorafenib is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine -, oxaliplatin - 
and irinotecan -based chemotherapy, an anti -VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an 
antiEGFR therapy.  
  
How Supplied: Regorafenib is supplied by [CONTACT_16660].  
  
Regorafenib is a 40 mg, light pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], oval shaped, film -coated tablet, de bossed with ‘BAYER’ on 
one side and ‘40’ on the other side.  Each tablet contains 40 mg of Regorafenib in the anhydrous 
state, which corresponds to 41.49 mg of Regorafenib monohydrate, and the following inactive 
ingredients: cellulose microcrystalline, cro scarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, povidone, 
and colloidal silicon dioxide. The film -coating contains the following inactive ingredients: ferric 
oxide red, ferric oxide yellow, lecithin (soy), polyethylene glycol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, 
and tit anium dioxide.  
  
Regorafenib tablets are supplied in packages containing three bottles, with each bottle containing 
28 tablets, for a total of 84 tablets per package (NDC [ZIP_CODE] -171-03).  
  
Storage: Store Regorafenib at 25°C (77°F); excursions are permitt ed from 15 to 30°C  
(59 to 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].   
  
Store tablets in the original bottle and do not remove the desiccant. Keep the bottle tightly closed 
after first opening.  
  
Discard any unused tablets 28 days after opening the bottle. Dispose of unused tablets in 
accordance with local requirements.  
38  
    
Stability: Discard any unused tablets 28 days after opening the bottle. Dispose of unused tablets 
in accordance with local requ irements.  
  
Route of Administration: Orally   
  
Method of Administration:  Take Regorafenib at the same time each day. Swallow tablet whole 
with a low -fat breakfast that contains less than 30% fat. Examples of a low -fat breakfast include 
[ADDRESS_15884] with 1 tablespoon of low -fat margarine and 1 tablespoon of jelly, and 8 
ounces of skim milk (319 calories and 8.2 g fat); or [ADDRESS_15885] with jam, apple juice, and 1 cup of coffee or tea (520 calories and 2  g fat). Do not 
take two doses of Regorafenib on the same day to make up for a missed dose from the previous 
day.   
  
Potential Drug 1nteractions:    
• Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers.  
• Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibi tors.   
  
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Regorafenib:   
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 mg dose of 
Regorafenib decreased the mean exposure of Regorafenib, increased the mean exposure of the 
active metabolite M -5, and resulted in no change in the mean exposure of the active metabolite 
M-2. Avoid concomitant use of Regorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, 
phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort).  
   
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inh ibitors on Regorafenib:   
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160 mg dose of 
Regorafenib increased the mean exposure of Regorafenib and decreased the mean exposure of 
the active metabolites M -2 and M -5. Avoid concomi tant use of Regorafenib with strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
nefazadone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole).  
  
Special Handling: Safely throw away (discard) any unused Re gorafenib tablets after 28 days of 
opening the bottle  
     
Patient Care Implications:   
Regorafenib may cause severe or life -threatening liver damage. Inform patients that they will

  • Regorafenib can cause or exacerbate exi sting hypertension. Advise patients they will 
need to undergo blood pressure monitoring and to contact [CONTACT_16663], lightheadedness, or neurologic  symptoms.  
• Regorafenib increased the risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction. Advise patients to 
seek immediate emergency help if they experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or feel 
dizzy or like passing out.  
• Contact a healthcare provider immedi ately if they experience severe pains in their 
abdomen, persistent swelling of the abdomen, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, severe 
diarrhea (frequent or loose bowel movements), or dehydration.  
• Regorafenib may complicate wound healing. Advise patient s to inform their health care 
provider if they plan to undergo a surgical procedure or had recent surgery.  
• Inform patients that Regorafenib can cause fetal harm. Advise women of reproductive 
potential and men of the need for effective contraception during  Regorafenib treatment 
and for up to [ADDRESS_15886] her health care provider if pregnancy is suspected or 
confirmed during or within 2 months of completing treatment w ith Regorafenib.  
• Advise nursing mothers that it is not known whether Regorafenib is present in breast milk 
and discuss whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Regorafenib.  
• Inform patients to take any missed dose on the same day, as soon as they remember, and 
that they must not take two doses on the same day to make up for a dose missed on the 
previous day.

Known Potential Toxicities of Regorafenib:  
Hepatoto xicity: Severe drug induced liver injury with fatal outcome occurred in 0.3% of 1200 
Stivarga -treated patients across all clinical trials. Liver biopsy results, when available, showed 
hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocyte infiltration. In Study 1, fatal hepa tic failure occurred in 
1.6% of patients in the Regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm; all the 
patients with hepatic failure had metastatic disease in the liver. In Study 2, fatal hepatic failure 
occurred in 0.8% of patients in the Reg orafenib arm. Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST and 
bilirubin) before initiation of Stivarga and monitor at least every two weeks during the first [ADDRESS_15887] or baseline.  Temporarily hold and then reduce or 
permanently discontinue Stivarga depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as 
manifested by [CONTACT_16654].

Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, Regorafenib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies with 
Regorafenib in pregnant women. Regorafenib was embryo lethal and teratogenic in ra ts and 
rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased 
incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations. If this drug is used 
during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking th is drug, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus

endpoint :   
• PFS-1:  measured from the start of the first treatment the patient is randomized to until 
the date the criteria for progression are met or the date the patient is taken off study for 
any reason, whichever is shorter.  
  
Secondary endpoints :   
• OS: measured from t he start of treatment on trial until the death of the patient.  
41  
  • mPFS -2: measured from the start of the crossover treatment (OPTIONAL, second 
regimen) until the date the criteria for progression are met or the date the patient is taken 
off study for any rea son, whichever is shorter.   
• Response:  measured as best response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 
as defined by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST 1.1) Committee.  
• Adverse events:  grade 1 -5 adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) v4.0 ; measured at 
baseline, each cycle, and at off study date.  
• Biomarkers of efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF:  We will obtain blood samples for plasma 
and PBMCs before start o f treatment, prior to cycle 2, and off study treatment.  
  
5.8 Biomarker Analysis.   
Five blood samples will be collected during the timepoints listed above:  
• Baseline (within 14 days of starting Cycle 1)  
• Pre-Cycle 2  
• Off Study Treatment  
  
Blood samples will be collected in three tubes:   
• Two - 10-ml EDTA tubes for plasma   
• Three - 8 mL Vacutainer CPT tube for PBMCs  
  
The blood samples will be processed, and stored at Pharmacokinetic Sampling Department 
(PSD), Institute of Drug Development,  at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.  
  
Preparation of Plasma samples:  
1) Collect 20 mL of whole venous blood into 2 - 10 mL EDTA tubes  
2) Centrifuge tubes at 2000 g for 15 minutes, at 4 C, to separate the cells from the Plasma.  
3) Prepare the labels for t he cryovials. The label for each tube should be written in black 
water fast ink.  
4) Carefully transfer the top layer of the plasma from the EDTA tubes being careful not to 
disturb the Buffy Coat (white layer just below the plasma). Transfer up to 2 mL alloqu ots 
of plasma from the blood collection tubes into each of the 6 – 3.6 ml skirted bottom 
externally threaded cryovials.  
5) Transfer the white thick layer above the red blood cell pellet from the blood collection 
tube into 2 – 2 ml cryovials.  
6) Affix each labe l lengthwise to its corresponding tube and secure each label with a strip of 
clear plastic tape wrapped completely around the tube to ensure the label remains affixed 
to the tube during the freezing storage.  
7) Immediately place the labeled tubes of plasma a nd buffy coat in an upright position in a 
20°C freezer.    
8) Within 12 hours, transfer samples to -70°C freezer for long -term storage.   
  
Preparation of PBMC samples:  
42  
  • Draw 8 mL of whole venous blood directly into each 8 mL Vacutainer CPT tubes and 
gently invert each tube 8 times.  
• After inverting the tubes, centrifuge both tubes at room temperature at 1500 -1 800 g 
(2800 rpm) for 20 minutes. NOTE: Centrifuge must be capa ble of generating at least 
1500 RCF at the tube bottom.  
• Draw off the clear plasma layer and discard, leaving behind cloudy PBMC layer lying 
just above the gel barrier.  
• Transfer the PBMC layer into one 14 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes.  
• Add 10 mL of P BS-DEPC (at room temperature) to each tube and invert 3 to 4 times.  
• Centrifuge at room temperature at 300 g ( -1200 rpm) for 5 minutes.  
• Pour off and discard supernatant, leaving PBMC pellet behind.  
• Cap tube and store at -20°C.    
• Within 12 hours, transfer samples to -70°C freezer for long -term storage.   
  
Tumor biopsy   
At baseline, archival tissue from diagnosis will be documented, but if not available, we need 
documentation of mCRC. The archival tissue may be used for PD analysi s. In such instances, 
TEN -FIFTEEN 15 micron (also called thick sections) paraffin -embedded tissue sections 
(unstained) and at least 1 H&E stained slide from the tumor biopsy.  
  
Optional tumor biopsy may be done for accessible tumors at Cycle 2. If a patie nt cross -overs to 
the other therapy arm following progression, another optional biopsy may be performed at 
second cycle of crossover treatment. This allows for analysis of tumor cytotoxic effects of 
therapy.  
  
Procedure for collection of Cycle 2 tumor bio psy:  
  
2 cores will be obtained and sent to PK lab for analysis.   
  
All planned PD analysis pertaining to the tumor biopsies obtained from patients with colorectal 
cancer, at baseline and again at 2 cycle (treatment arm or crossover arm) will be under 
supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966].

6.[ADDRESS_15894]  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for response every 8 weeks.  
  
Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_16664] T umors (RECIST) Committee. Changes 
in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the 
RECIST criteria (73). Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below. The term "evalua ble" in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
  
See Appendix 13.[ADDRESS_15895] criteria  
  
7.0 Data Collection  
Data will be entered into Case Report Forms (CRF), which are currently in paper  form.   
  
For each patient on study, the following will be documented:  
  
• Lab values : CBC, CMP, CEA, PTT/INR (when collected)  
• PFS-1:  measured from the start of the first treatment the patient is randomized to until the 
date the criteria for progression are met or the date the patient is taken off study for any 
reason, whichever is shorter).    
• OS: measured from the start of treatment on trial until the death of the patient (date of death)  
• PFS-2: measured from the start of the crossover treatment (Optional, second regimen) until 
the date the criteria for progression are met or the date the patient is taken off study for any 
reason, whichever is shorter.   
• Response:  measured as best response at any g iven time: complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR), as defined by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST 1.1) 
Committee (73). (See Appendix 13.1 for definitions of response).    
• Adverse events:  the number and grade 1 -5 of all adverse events will be documented 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI -CTCAE) v4.0 ; measured at baseline, each cycle, and at off study date.  
  
8.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and Safety Monitorin g Oversight   
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is required for all individual protocols conducted at UT 
Health Cancer Center. All protocols conducted at UT Health Cancer Center are covered under 
the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_16585] a Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).    
  
The UT Health Cancer Center Institutional DSMP global policies provide individual trials with:   
48  
  • institutional policies and procedures for institutional data safety and monitoring,   
• an institutional guide to follow,  
• monitoring of protocol accrual by [CONTACT_16665],  
• review of study forms and orders by [CONTACT_16666],  
• tools for monitoring safety events,  
• independent monitoring and source data verification by [CONTACT_16667]/Auditor  
• monitoring of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_16668],  
• determining level of risk (Priority of Audit Level Score – PALS) ,   
• oversight by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB),  and  
• verification of protocol adherence via annual audit for all Investigator Initiated Studies 
by [CONTACT_16669].   
  
Monitoring Progress and Safety   
Due to the risks associated with participation in this protocol, the UT Health Cancer Center 
DSMB (DSMB#2)  in conjunction with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16586], adverse event trends and treatment effects on this study.  The UT Health Cancer 
Center DSMB (DSMB#2) acts as an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for IIS 
conducted at UT Health Cancer Center.  The UT Health Cancer Center DSMB (DSMB#2)  will 
monitor data throughout the duration of a study to determine if continuation of the study is 
appropriate scientifically and ethically.  An additional layer of review is provided by [CONTACT_16670] (DSMC) who will review DSMB 
reports every 6 months.    
  
Baseline events an d adverse events will be captured using the UT Health Cancer Center Master 
Adverse Events Document for each patient using CTCAE V4.0  for the grading and attribution of 
adverse events. Usage of the UT Health Cancer Center Master Adverse Events Document cent rally 
documents:   
• the event and grades the seriousness of the event,   
• if the event was a change from baseline,    
• the determination of the relationship between the event and study intervention,   
• if the event was part of the normal disease process, and   
• what actions were taken as a result of the event.   
  
Safety Definitions:   
  For this study, the following safety definitions will be applicable:  
  
Adverse Event Definition: An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable 
medical occurren ce in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal 
physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research  For this study, all adverse events will be documented starting with 
the first dose of the study drug  and ending [ADDRESS_15896] dose of study drug is received.   
49  
    
Serious Adverse Event Definition: is any adverse event that:   
1. results in death;  
2. is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred);  
3. results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686];  
4. results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
5. results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition   
  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others Definition: Unanticipated problem 
involving risk to subjects or others includes any incident, experience or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria:  
A. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the char acteristics of the subject 
population being studied (note: the unfounded classification of a serious adverse event as 
“anticipated” constitutes serious non -compliance);  
B. definitely related or probably related to participation in the research; and  
C. suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized  
  
Reporting Requirements   
For this study, the Master Adverse Events Documents coll ected on patients for this protocol will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_16587] a serious safety problem has emerged 
that result in a change or early termination of a protocol such as:  
• dose modification,  
• suspending enrollment due to safety or efficacy, or  
• termination of the study due to a significant change in risks or benefits.    
  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16588] #2 with above findings every 6 months for discussion and review 
during their meetings.  
  
The endpoint for dose reduction is based on observed adverse events.  To identify the clinical 
and hematologic adverse events, this study will use NCI -CTCAE v4.0.  At each visit, including  
 
definitely related to VOR/HCQ will result in the dose being held  until the AE has resolved to ≤ 
grade 1 or baseline. If the AE resolves, reinstitution of treatment can occur, but at a reduced 
dose. Dose reductions will be made as per Table below .  
  

50  
  For patients randomized to the VOR/HCQ arm, a baseline ophthalmologic exam will be done in 
all patients over the age of [ADDRESS_15897] recommends discontinuation of HCQ due to eye toxicity, then the patient 
will be taken off study for toxicity.

to the DSMB #2 and all members of the research  team.  Furthermore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16593], the UT Health San Antonio IRB, the UT Health Cancer 
Center DSMC, and the FDA via a FDA Form 3500Aa written IND safety report of any adverse 
events that are either serious and/or unexpected.  Suspension and early termination of a trial must 
also be reported immediately to the Director of Quality Assurance who will promptly notify the 
sponsor and the UT Health San Antonio IRB.   
  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16594] u sing the Investigator Initiated Study DSMB Report 
Form every 6 months, to the DSMB #2.  The DSMB#2 will review the information provided by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_16595], unless an 
emergent issue has been identified. The Investigator Initiated Study DSMB Report Form 
includes information on ad verse events, current dose levels, number of patients enrolled, 
significant toxicities per the protocol, patient status (morbidity and mortality) dose adjustments 
with observed response, and any interim findings.  Any trend consisting of three or more of t he 
same event will be reported to the UT Health Cancer Center DSMB for independent review 
outside of the reporting cycle, which begins three months following protocol start up. The 
DSMB#2 will also provide its findings to the UT Health Cancer Center Regula tory Affairs 
Division so that it may be provided to the UT Health San Antonio IRB with the protocol’s 
annual progress report. Conflict of interest is avoided by [CONTACT_16671]#2, UT Health Cancer Center DSMB, and  by [CONTACT_16672][INVESTIGATOR_16596].

Assuring Compliance with Protocol and Data Accuracy   
As with all studies conducted at UT Health Cancer Center, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16603], data accuracy/integrity and responding to recommendations that 
emanate from monitoring activities.   Source verification of data will be performed once a year 
as we have sufficient experience and safety evidence with this drug. Protocol compliance, data 
accuracy and reporting of events is further ensured by [CONTACT_16674], whose audit report is shared with the PI, the research team, and will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_16675].   
  
UT Health Cancer Center DSMB Membership   
The UT Health Cancer Center has two DSMB’s with a primary set of members specific to the 
histology of the study consisting of UT Health San Antonio faculty and staff.  This Protocol will 
utilize DSMB#[ADDRESS_15903] (financial, int ellectual, professional, or 
regulatory in nature), the UT Health Cancer Center DSMB specific to this study will not treat 
patients on this protocol.  Usage of the DSMB specific to the histology has been created to 
ensure that experts in that histology are represented on the DSMB assembled for this protocol, 
but may be expanded, at the PI’s discretion, to include other members, which may include:  
• experts in the fields of medicine and science that are applicable to the study (if not 
currently represented on the DSMB),   
• statistical experts,   
• lay representatives,   
• multidisciplinary representation, from relevant specialties including experts such as 
bioethicists, biostatisticians and basic scientists, and  
• others who can offer an unbiased assessment of the st udy progress.   
  
Additional or alternate membership of in the DSMB is selected by [CONTACT_16676], in 
conjunction with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16604].    
  
UT Health Cancer Center DSMB Charter and Responsibilities   
The UT Health Cancer Center DSMB will provide in formation on the membership composition, 
including qualifications and experience to both the UT Health San Antonio IRB and UT Health 
Cancer Center PRC for review.  The UT Health Cancer Center DSMB for this study will act as 
an independent advisory board to  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16605], the UT Health San Antonio IRB and the UT Health Cancer Center DSMB.   UT Health 
Cancer Center DSMB reports will utilize the Investigator Initiated Study DSMB Report Form 
and meetings will occur as scheduled to review any updates from the prior meeting.    
  
54  
  Once the protocol is activated, if not already established elsewhere in the protocol the UT Health 
Cancer Center DSMB will establish and provide:   
• procedures for maintaining confidentia lity;   
• statistical procedures including monitoring guidelines, which will be used to monitor the 
identified primary, secondary, and safety outcome variables;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such 
as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the study;   
• plans for changing frequency of interim analysis as well as procedures for recommending 
protocol changes;  
• recommendation of termination due to unfavorable benefit -to-risk or inability to answer 
study questions;   
• recommendation of continuation of ongoing studies;   
• recommend modification of sample sizes based on ongoing assessment of event rates; 
and  
• review of final results and publications.

10.0 Statistical Section  
Analytic plan for primary objective:   
mPFS -1: Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients treated with RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15905] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15906] 5% lost to 
followup.  Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for follow up, 36 subjects per g roup 
are necessary to obtain 80% power. With 5% lost to follow -up the sample size required per group 
is 38 (=36/0.95), therefore, the total required sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the target 
accrual rate is 3 -4 patients/month to achieve a target  accrual at [ADDRESS_15907] to PFS -1 with a proportional hazards model with 
adjustment for age, sex, race, and the baseline tumor K -RAS status (mutated, wild type); the 
adjuste d hazard ratio, its 95% confidence interval, and the p -value for testing the null hypothesis 
that the log hazard ratio is zero will be presented.  Survival curves will be illustrated with 
Kaplan -Meier plots.  Interactions between treatment and baseline cov ariates will be explored.    
  
If a patient does not complete Cycle 1 and is off study, then this patient will not be  evaluable 
for efficacy but will be evaluable for toxicity.   
   
Interim analysis:   The O'Brien -Fleming procedure will be used to conduct an interim analyses for 
efficacy when 50% of the patients complete the study.  A statistical basis for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16607]/HCQ Arm and 
exceeds 2.[ZIP_CODE], corresponding to a significance level of 0.003. If the test statistic does not 
exceed 2.[ADDRESS_15908] is not 
declared at the interim analysis, a statistical basis for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16608] y will be 
attained if the conditional power is less than or equal to 20%.  
  
57  
  Analytic plan for secondary objectives:  
• OS: The analyses of median OS will be performed in the intent -to-treat population.  OS will 
be illustrated with Kaplan -Meier plots, the es timate of median OS with its 95% confidence 
interval.  Treatment groups will be contrasted with regard to the response rate with a logistic 
regression model adjusted for age, sex, race and the baseline tumor K -RAS status (mutated, 
wild type); the odds rati o, its 95% confidence interval, and the p -value for testing the null 
hypothesis that the log odds ratio is zero will be presented.  If the logistic model fails due to 
small cell counts then treatments will be contrasted with regard to response using Fisher ’s 
Exact Test.    
• mPFS -2: The analyses of median PFS -2 will be performed in the crossover population. 
Crossover to the other arm will be allowed, but OPTIONAL, and will be determined by [CONTACT_16645]’s best interest.   mPFS -2 will be illustrated with 
KaplanMeier plots, the estimate of median PFS -2 with its 95% confidence interval.  
Treatment groups will be contrasted with regard to the response rate with a logistic regression 
model adjusted for age, sex, race and the baseline tumor K-RAS status (mutated, wild type); 
the odds ratio, its 95% confidence interval, and the p -value for testing the null hypothesis that 
the  
log odds ratio is zero will be presented.  If the logistic model fails due to small cell counts 
then treatments will b e contrasted with regard to response using Fisher’s Exact Test.    
• Response rates : Response rates will be measured as the proportion of patients with the best 
response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
Criteria and a 95% confidence interval. (See Appendix 13.[ADDRESS_15909] 1.1 criteria)  
• Adverse events : All adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_16624].  All adverse events will 
be listed by [CONTACT_1570], level of seriousness (serious, not serious).  Treatments wil l be 
contrasted with regard to each adverse event with Fisher’s Exact Test.    
• Biomarkers of efficacy of VOR/HCQ and RGF :  Biomarkers will be graphically displayed to 
demonstrate patterns across time and group and to identify the need for transformations a nd 
potential outliers.  The significance of variation in biomarkers with treatment will be assessed 
with linear models with and without adjustment for age, sex, race and the baseline tumor 
KRAS status (mutated, wild type).  The dependent variables will be log transformed (base 2) 
if necessary.  The relation between treatment efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_16625] -1, and biomarkers 
will be assessed with proportional hazards models in terms of treatment, the biomarker, the 
biomarker by [CONTACT_9866], age, sex, race, and baseline tumor K -RAS status 
(mutated, wild type).  Significant effects will be described and illustrated, as appropriate, 
with Kaplan Meier plots by [CONTACT_16678], for 
example.   
  
Sample size justificat ion: Historically, the mPFS for previously treated mCRC patients treated 
with RGF is 1.[ADDRESS_15910] VOR/HCQ will improve mPFS to 3.[ADDRESS_15911] 5% 
lost to follow -up.  Assuming a 36 -month accrual period with 1 year for follow up, 36 subjects per 
group are necessary to obtain 80% power. With 5% lost to follow -up the sample size required per 
group is 38 (=36/0.95), therefore, the total required sample size is 76 subjects .  As a result, the 
target accrual rate is 3 -4 patients/month to achieve a t arget accrual at 36 months with an 
additional 12 -month follow -up.

12.[ADDRESS_15916]  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  
  
Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee. Changes 
in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor le sions are used in the 
RECIST criteria (73). Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below. The term "evaluable" in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accur acy.  
  
Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI, x -ray) or as > [ADDRESS_15917] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
  
Non-measurable disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm with 
conventional techniques or < [ADDRESS_15918] scan), are considered nonmeasurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic 
lesions are all non -measurable.  
  
Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions sh ould be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
66  
  calcula ted and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by [CONTACT_14218].  
  
Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and shou ld also be 
recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum 
numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as nonmeasurable lesions.   
  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
  
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely  as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.   
  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not to be considered 
evaluable for response, unless documented progr ession prior to study enrollment.   
  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_16688] a treatment.  
  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommend ed.  
   
Conventional CT and MRI: These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_15919], abdomen, and pelvis. Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.   
  
Ultrasound (US): When the primary endpoint of the study is PFS evaluation, US should not be 
used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of 
superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. US might also be 
useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_15077].  
  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these t echniques for objective tumor evaluation has 
not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated 
equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, 
the utilization o f such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
67  
  purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
  
Cytology, Histology: These tech niques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). The cytological 
confirmation of t he neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment 
when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of th e 
treatment) and progressive disease.   
  
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions , taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment 
started or the appearance of one or mor e new lesions.  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started.  
  
Evaluation of non -target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR ): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level    
• Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesions(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.

13.0 Protocol Amendment Summary  
  
69  
  Protocol Amendment 2.0 Dated 04/06/15 (Additions to a section are in  bold , deleted have a 
line through)   
  
Section 5.2 Randomization - The patient should start the treatment within 14 10 days of 
randomization.    
  
Upon r andomization, regorafenib prescription will be sent to specialty pharmacy.  If the 
patient receives the medication in <14 days, then the patient can start at home. The start 
date will be C1D1.  If the patient receives >14 days, then the patient will need a  C1D1 
clinical visit and labs: CBC, CMP, CEA and biomarkers.  
  
Section 6.0 Schedule of Events, footnote ^ - For Cycle 1, for patients who are assigned to  
VOR/HCQ arm, if baseline labs were done <14 days from C1D1, then can omit CBC, CMP, 
CEA and LDH. Upon randomization, regorafenib prescription will be sent to specialty 
pharmacy.  If the patient receives the medication in <14 days, then the patient can start 
at home. This start date will be C1D1.  If the patient receives ≥14 days, then the patient  
will need a C1D1 clinical visit and labs: CBC, CMP, CEA, LDH.  
  
Reason for Change:  Regorafenib, a standard of care drug, comes from a specialty pharmacy and 
can take some time for patient to receive medication.  
  
Protocol Amendment 3.0 Dated 03/01/16  (Additions to a section are in  bold , deleted have a 
line through)   
  
Formatting, spelling and administrative changes were made throughout protocol.  
  
Added Investigator Agreement signature [CONTACT_3264].  
  
Deleted abbreviations not needed for this protocol.  
  
Updated Table of Contents.  
  
Exclusion Criteria:  
5.  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or untreated  diabetic retinopathy 
(stable retinopathy is allowed) .  
  
Reason for Change:  Clarifies patients with diabetic retinopathy are exclud ed.  
  
Exclusion Criteria:  
12.  QTc > 500 ms at baseline (average of 3 determinations at 10 minute intervals) .  
  
Reason for Change: Only a single EKG is done.  
  
5.3.1 Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:   
70  
  Follow -up: A repeat CT scan will be performed after [ADDRESS_15922] 1.1 criteria (See Appendix 13.1 for definitions of response) (73).  
Serum tumor marker CEA and CT scans will be repeated at least every 2 cycles, o r 8 weeks, to 
ensure no progression of disease. Patients will continue on VOR/HCQ or RGF until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102], or decision of physician 
for patient’s best interest. Crossover to the other ar m will be allowed, but OPTIONAL, and will be 
determined by [CONTACT_16689]’s best interest. If patient is not given crossover 
treatment, then the patient will be off study and will be allowed to receive subsequent treatments.  
Each p atient will be followed for [ADDRESS_15923] patient for 12 months, at which 
time, the study will be completed for data analysis.  
  
Rational for Change: Serum tumor marker CEA will not be done.  
  
5.8 Biomarker Analysis.   
  
Three  Five blood samples will be collected during the timepoints listed above:  
• Baseline (within 14 days of starting Cycle 1)  
• Pre-Cycle 2  
• Off Study Treatment  
  
Blood samples will be collected in five tubes:   
• Two - 10-ml EDTA tubes for plasma   
• One Three  - 8 mL V acutainer CPT tubes for PBMCs  
  
Rational for Change: Clarification on number of tubes for biomarker analysis.  
  
Tumor biopsy   
At baseline, archival tissue from diagnosis will be documented, but if not available, we need 
documentation of mCRC. The archiv al tissue may be used for PD analysis. In such instances, 
TENFIFTEEN 15 micron (also called thick sections) paraffin -embedded tissue sections 
(unstained) and at least 1 H&E stained slide from the tumor biopsy.  
  
Optional tumor biopsy may be done for accessible tumors at Cycle 2. If a patient cross -overs to the 
other therapy arm following progression, another optional biopsy may be performed at second 
cycle of crossover treatment. This allows for analysis of tumor cytotoxic effects of therapy.  
  
Procedure for collection of Cycle 2 tumor biopsy:  
2 cores will be obtained and sent to PK lab for analysis.   
  
All planned PD analysis pertaining to the tumor biopsies obtained from patients with colorectal 
cancer, at bas eline and again at 2 cycle (treatment arm or crossover arm) will be under supervision 
of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966].  
  
71  
  Rational for Change: This section clarifies the timing, processing and handling of tumor 
biopsies and the timing of the tumor biopsy for the cr ossover arm.  This biopsy is optional.

the patient is 70 years or older; it is repeated if any visual disturbances occurred while a patient  
was on study.   If the patient is randomized to VOR/HCQ arm, and the patient is  70 year or 
older or has baseline ophthalmologic pathology (i.e., diabetic retinopathy), then a 
comprehensive eye exam will be done at baseline. If the patient continues to receive HCQ 
on study at [ADDRESS_15927] baseline or follow - up eye exams, unless 
there is crossover to the VOR/HCQ arm. If patient moves onto VOR/HCQ crossover arm, 
eye exam is as stated  above (patient is 70 year or older or has baseline ophthalmologic).   
∞  At baseline, archival tissue from diagnosis, but if not available, we need documentation of 
mCRC. Pre -cycle 2 tumor biopsy is optional.  Follow instructions in section 5.8.

Rational for Change:  C larify the window of when patien t should be consented again if there is 
a delay to start C1D1.  Further clarifies management of patients receiving VOR/HCQ in regards 
to monitoring for eye toxicity that may be a side effect of HCQ.  Clarifies management of 
patients with known eye disease,  like diabetic retinopathy, as well as follow -up exam.  Clarifies 
the timing of the tumor biopsy for the crossover arm. This biopsy is optional.  Clarification on 
number of tubes for biomarker analysis.  Clarification on eye exam requirements.  Clarificati on 
to coincide with study calendar.    
Monitoring Progress and Safety   
Due to the risks associated with participation in this protocol, the UT Health Cancer Center 
DSMB (DSMB#2)  in conjunction with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16586], adverse event trends and treatment effects on this study.  The UT Health Cancer 
Center DSMB (DSMB#2) acts as an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for I IS 
conducted at UT Health Cancer Center.  The UT Health Cancer Center DSMB (DSMB#2)  will 
monitor data throughout the duration of a study to determine if continuation of the study is 
appropriate scientifically and ethically.  An additional layer of review i s provided by [CONTACT_16670] (DSMC) who will review DSMB 
reports every [ADDRESS_15930] year, and thereafter  every 6 months.  
Rational for Change:  Clarification on timing of the DSMB review.

thereafter  every 6 months, for discussion and review during their meetings.  
  
Rational for Change:  Clarification on timing of the DSMB review.  
For patients randomized to the V OR/HCQ arm, a baseline ophthalmologic exam will be done in 
all patients over the age of [ADDRESS_15932] recommends 
discontinuation of HCQ due to eye toxicit y, then the patient will be taken off study for 
toxicity.  
Rational for Change:  Clarifies safety measures to monitor for rare toxicity by [CONTACT_16690].

DSMB #2.  The DSMB#[ADDRESS_15934] year, and thereafter every 6 months as 
reports are scheduled , unless an emergent issue has been identified. The Investigator Initiated 
Study DSMC Report Form includes information on adverse events, curre nt dose levels, number 
of patients enrolled, significant toxicities per the protocol, patient status (morbidity and 
mortality) dose adjustments with observed response, and any interim findings.  Any trend 
consisting of three or more of the same event will be reported to the UT Health Cancer Center 
DSMC DSMB for independent review outside of the reporting cycle, which begins three months 
following protocol start up. The DSMB#2 will also provide its findings to the UT Health Cancer 
Center’s Regulatory Affairs Division so that it may be provided to the UT Health  San Antonio 
IRB with the protocol’s annual progress report. Conflict of interest is avoided by [CONTACT_16691]#2, UT Health Cancer Center DSMC  DSMB , and 
by [CONTACT_16692][INVESTIGATOR_16618].

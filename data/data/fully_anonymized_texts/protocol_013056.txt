ABSTRACT  
 
AINV18P1 is a p ilot study evaluating safety and feasibility of palbociclib in combination with an 
established re- induction platform for children, adolescents and young a dults with relapsed/refractory ALL 
and lymphoblastic lymphoma.  Targeting cell cycle progression has been an effective therapeutic strategy 
in a spectrum of malignancies.  Prior studies have shown that deregulation of the physiological cell cycle machinery is essential for both the induction and progression of ALL. Additionally, molecular targeting 
of the interaction of D type cyclins with cell cycle dependent kinases (CDK4 and 6) efficiently suppressed 
ALL growth and disease progression in vivo  and this eff ect was augmented by [CONTACT_521438].    Palbociclib is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of CDK 4 and CDK6.  CDK6 is highly 
homologous to CDK4 and can perform the same function by [CONTACT_521439] (Rb), thus potentially creating a redundant mechanism to promote cell cycle progression.   Inhibition of 
both enzymes is therefore necessary to ensure the greatest possible antitumor activity . Palbociclib  inhibits 
DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_521440] m the G1 to S phase  of the cell cycle.  Treatment  of tumor 
cells with palbociclib inhibits Rb phosphorylation and induces growth arrest . Accordingly, a reduction in 
Rb phosphor ylation  serves as a biomarker of CDK4/6 inhibition by [CONTACT_463753].  
 
Eligible patients will receive a single cycle of re- induction therapy.  Palbociclib will be administered 
once daily for 21 days in c ombination with a n established  4-drug re -induction platform .  After 
completion of the  feasibility portion of the study an expanded cohort will be enrolled at the MTD and/or 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of palbociclib  to further assess the safety and feasibility of this 
regimen and to preliminarily explore the biological and clinical activity within the confines of a phase 1 
study.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Disrupted cell cycle regulation is a hallmark of cancer and targeting the cell cycle 
machinery has been an approach taken to treat a broad spectrum of malignancies.  The cell cycle is divid ed into G1 (pre -DNA synthesis), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (pre -division) 
and M (cell division) phases and the transition through these phases is regulated by [CONTACT_521441] -dependent kinases (CDKs).  Upon mitogenic stimulation, cyclins

Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 9 
 
engage CDKs, leading  to their activation. D -type cyclins are input -sensing proteins that 
directly receive mitogenic signals. Cyclin D molecules, like all canonical cyclins, feature 
a cyclin box motif that contains important residues for directly engaging CDKs, and it is through this interaction that catalytic activity is conferred to the CDK.  
 
D-type cyclins associate with either CDK4 or CDK6, which share extensive homology.  
CDK4 is the key regulator of the G1- S transition. In complex with Cyclin D, CDK4 
phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and drives cell cycle progression, a process inhibited by p16INK4A (CDKN2A).
[ADDRESS_676260] been developed for the treatment of cancers that show activation of 
the cyclin D –CDK4/6 –INK4 –Rb pathway.  Palbociclib (formerly PD -0332991) is an 
orally active small molecule produced by [CONTACT_521442]4 and CDK6 leading to cell cycle arrest and this agent is currently used to treat wide range of cancers in adults.   
 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survival now approaches 90% for children using 
conventional cytotoxic agents, but at a cost of cumulative toxicities and late effects. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_521394] B - and T lymphoblastic leukemia 
(B-ALL and T- ALL) in recent years, the outcome of patients with primary resistant or 
relapsed disease remains very poor,  particularly for children with second or greater 
relapses, refractory disease or T -cell disease. 
2  Remission re -induction rates for this 
population are less than 40% and very few children survive long term. 3,[ADDRESS_676261] also demonstrated 
that targeting of the CDK4/[ADDRESS_676262] previously shown that Ccnd2 (Cyclin D2) 
and Ccnd3 (Cyclin D3) are expressed during lymphocyte differentiation and 
that they play different roles in this process. 
5 To prove the functional 
connection between Ccnd3 overexpression and T -ALL growth, its expression 
has been silenced in a large number of human T -ALL cell lines , the majority of 
which carry NOTCH1  mutations. Ccnd3 silencing impacted tumor cell growth 
due to significant inhibition of cell cycle progression (S phase entry). Further, in 
a transplantation model of NOTCH- driven T ALL deletion of Ccnd3 ( Ccnd3-/-) 
failed to induce leukemia whereas Ccnd3 expressing progenitors led to 
induction of disease that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521395] 
10-post transplantation. Normal peripheral T -cells la cking Ccnd3 could be 
detected but these cells showed no signs of transformation. These studies were 
the first to identify an essential role for Ccnd3 function in T -ALL. 5

Targeting Ccnd3:CDK4/6 complexes using a small molecule inhibitor. To 
determine whether pharmacological inhibition of cyclin D3:CDK4/6 complexes could prove beneficial for the targeting of T -ALL, Aifantis and colleagues 
treated 15 human and mouse T -ALL cel l lines (Fig. 1A), as well as primary T -
ALL cells (not shown) with PD -0332991, an orally active small molecule that 
potently and specifically inhibits CDK4 and CDK6. 
6 They demonstrated that 
PD-0332991 is active at low concentrations (0.5µM) and has the ability to very 
efficiently suppress S -phase entry, leading to proliferation defects. All lines, 
including those in which T -ALL was driven by [CONTACT_521443]1  and TAL1  
oncogenes, were sensitive to PD -0332991 treatment. Further biochemical 
studies were consistent with the cell cycle effects demonstrating sp ecific loss of 
phosphorylated Rb (pRb) and hyper -phosphorylation and accumulation of the 
CDK inhibitor p27 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, mixing of PD -0332991 treated and 
untreated T -ALL cells in vitro  proved the cytostatic effects of the treatment. 
Gene expressi on analysis of T -ALL lines treated with the inhibitor further 
supported the specific targeting of the S phase entry machinery in these cells (Fig. 1C). In addition to these in vitro  studies, Aifantis and colleagues also 
treated T -ALL animal models with PD -0332991. There was a dramatic response 
to the drug treatment (Fig. 1D -G) in vivo  as demonstrated initially by [CONTACT_521444]. Drug treatment led to a significant 
drop in blood counts, splenomegaly, tissue infiltration and overall disease 
regression. Surprisingly, PD -0332991 treatment appeared to induce apoptosis of 
leukemic cells (Figure 1G), explaining the rapid response to the treatment. These were exciting and promising findings and suggested strongly that anti -
CDK4/[ADDRESS_676263] to target T -ALL.

 CDK4/6 pharmacologic inhibition in B and T -lineage ALL and in 
combination with chemotherapy. To determine the effects of CDK4/6 pharmacologic inhibition more broadly in ALL, we expanded studies to include B-lineage ALL and also investigated CD K4/6 inhibition in combination with 
chemotherapy.  B leukemic cell lines (Reh, RS4, UOCB1, Nalm -6) were each 
treated with 1 µM PD -0332991 for 24 hours.  Cell cycle changes were 
determined by [CONTACT_521445] (BrdU). Cells were labeled with propi[INVESTIGATOR_521396] -BrdU antibody, then evaluated by 
[CONTACT_74064]- activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACScan flow cytometer 
(BD Scientific).  Treatment with PD -[ADDRESS_676264] with the percentage of cells in S  phase decreased by [CONTACT_726] 80% in all 
B-ALL cell lines evaluated (Fig.2
).

Cell lines also consistently showed a decrease in pRb and an increase in p27 following 
treatment with PD -0332991 ( Fig.3 ). As an extension of these studies in cell lines , a 
panel of primary T -ALL and B -ALL x enografts have been established. Sources of T -
ALL cells for these xenografts were identified from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Cell Bank and all human cells have been sequenced.  Disease regression has been observed following treatment for 5 days wi th PD -0332991 in both B - and T -
lineage ALL xenografts (
Fig. 4 ). Combinations of chemotherapy with palbociclib have 
also been delivered in T and B -ALL xenografts.  To determine the impact of drug 
sequence, xenografts were treated on two different schedules:  palbociclib days 1 -5

 Animal Toxicology  
Palbociclib has been evaluated in toxicology and safety pharmacology studies of 
up to 39 weeks in duration (see Investigator Brochure  for detailed information ). 
The primary palbociclib toxicities in preclinical studies were to the bone marrow, 
lymphoid tissues, and testes. These toxicities occurred in both rats and dogs and 
are consistent with cell cycle inhibition produced by [CONTACT_33641]. Bone marrow pancytopenia r esulted in decreases in various hematology parameters; however, 
the changes were reversible following cessation of dosing. Reversible 
myelosuppression is anticipated in  clinical studies and may be dose -limiting. 
Palbo ciclib demonstrated a potential for aneugenicity in the in vitro and in vivo 
micronucleus assays. In addition, palbociclib was determined non-phototoxic.    
 
 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
In nonclinical species (rat, dog, and monkey), palbociclib exhibits low to 
moderate plasma clearance, large volume of distribution, and moderate oral 
bioavailability ranging from 23%  to 56%. Plasma protein binding of palbociclib 
is moderate in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma. Radioequivalents were 
widely distributed to most rat tissues and fluids  following an oral dose of 
[14C]palbociclib, with radioactivity levels consistently greater than  those 
observed in blood. In vitro, palbociclib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP)3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) 2A1 enzymes. The major primary 
metabolic  pathways for [14C]palbociclib in rats and humans involved sulfonation 
and oxidation. In rats  and dogs, [14C]palbociclib was mainly eliminated via the 
feces; the high fecal elim ination  occurred via biliary excretion in rats. Palbociclib 
and its oxidative metabolite, PF -05089326, demonstrated little or no inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or  CYP2D6 enzyme 
activities and thus, showed low potential for CYP -media ted pharmacokinetic 
drug interactions. However, palbociclib and PF -[ADDRESS_676266] the potential for pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions with c ompounds for which CYP3A -mediated metabolism constitutes 
the primary mechanism of clearance.  Palbociclib did not cause induction of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 mRNA  expression and/or enzyme 
activity in vitro in human hepatocytes; thus, the potential for palbociclib to 
induce these enzymes is considered to be low at clinically relevant  
concentrations. The potential for palbociclib to inhibit uridine diphosphate  
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, 
UGT1A9, and  UGT2B7) was asses sed and the likelihood of drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) at clinically  relevant concentrations is considered low. Overall, 
based on the in vitro results, palbociclib  showed a low potential to inhibit P -
glycoprotein (P -gp) (systemically), breast cancer resista nce protein (BCRP) 
(systemically), organic anion transporting polypeptide  (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, 
bile salt export pump (BSEP), organic anion transporter (OAT)1,  OAT3, and 
organic cation transporter (OCT)[ADDRESS_676267] at the proposed 
clinical dose.  Additional details are included in the Investigator Brochure.

approval of palbociclib was based on the phase 2 PALOMA- 1/TRIO -18 study, where 165 
patients were randomized to palbociclib plus letrozole vs. letrozole alone.8 Median 
progression- free survival (PFS) was 10.2 months for the letrozole group and 20.2 months 
for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (p=0.0004). These results were confirmed in a double- blind randomized phase [ADDRESS_676270] cancer. 
9 The median PFS was 24.8 
months in the palbociclib- letrozole group vs. 14.5 months in the placebo- letrozole group 
(p<0.001).  Therapy was well tolerated and the most common tre atment -related adverse 
events in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia and fatigue.  In 
February 2016, the FDA granted an expanded indication for palbociclib for women with ER-positive, HER2- negative metastatic breast cancer that progress ed after prior 
endocrine therapy after the PALOMA -3 randomized phase 3 trial demonstrated that

 Pediatric Studies  
 
 Prior Experience in Children  
There has been one pediatric study of palbociclib (PBTC 042; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  to 
date. The phase 1 single agent trial of palbociclib in children with Rb-positive 
relapsed, progressive or refractory central nervous system (CNS) tumors 
conducted by [CONTACT_521448] 2014 . 12 
Patients aged 4 -21 years are eligible and the starting dose level for this trial was 
50 mg/m2/day of palbociclib for 21 days consecutively in 28 day cycles for up to 
2 years.  Among 14 evaluable patients, grade 4 neutropenia in 2 of 4 patients treated at 95 mg/m
2/day (dose level 3)  was the only observed dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) .  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 75 
mg/m2/day and the trial is currently enrolling an expansion cohort at this dose.  
Enrollment will also be expanded to include a cohort of more heavily pre -treated 
patients, who have received more than 4 prior regimens at a starting dose of 50 
mg/m2/day.

(LL). LL patients are included because the patient population is rare and these patients 
are most commonly treated with ALL regimens.  Based on the current pediatric phase 1 
trial investigating palbociclib in children with CNS tumors ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the 
proposed starting dose for this study will be 50 mg/m2/day for 21 days. Although the 
MTD was defined as 75  mg/m2/day, this was in non- heavily pretreated patients and a 
cohort of more heavily pre -treated patients is currently enrolling at a dose of 50 
mg/m2/day, which is approximately 70% of the recommended dose in adults.  Since the 
most common DLT for palbociclib to date has been myelosuppression and palbociclib 
will be given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, this trial will start at the lower 
50 mg/m2/day dose level.  A pediatric formulation is available. 
 
Block [ADDRESS_676272] shown more 
significant reduction in leukemic burden when palbociclib was given with chemotherapy concomitantly vs. sequentially ( Fig. 5
) and this is in agreement with preclinical studies in 
solid tumors in adults (personal communication, [COMPANY_007]).  
 
The rolling six trial design will be used for dose determination in this study.17 Per this 
design, if 2 or more of a cohort of up to 6 patients experience dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) at the initial dose level, then the MTD has been exceeded and a single dose de-escalation will be conducted. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose 
confirmation  will be the first cycle of therapy. We plan to study no more than 2 dose 
levels. After completion of the  feasibility portion of the study an expanded cohort will be 
enrolled at the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of palbociclib  to further 
assess the safety and feasibility of this regimen and to preliminarily explore the biological and clinical activity within the confines of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Patients with relapsed B and T -
ALL/LL will be eligible and study treatment will consist of a single cycle of palbociclib 
in combination with chemotherapy.

Special precautions : 
1. Pegaspargase is contraindicated with a history of severe pancreatitis with any prior 
asparaginase therapy. Caution should be used if serious thrombosis or hemorrhagic events have occurred with any prior asparaginase therapy. 
2. Pegaspargase may affect coagulation factors and predispose to bleeding and/or thrombosis. 
Caution should be used when administering any concurrent anticoagulant the rapy. 
3. Suggested monitoring during and after administration: Because pegaspargase is long acting, 
hypersensitivity reactions may not appear for hours after drug administration. Monitor vital 
signs, for signs of fever, chills, or acute allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Have 
medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions readily available at each administration (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], IV corticosteroids, antihistamines). Consider prescribing an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_294366]
® for home 
use.

1 is not well tolerated, further de -escalation will not occur. The study will be 
closed to accrual.  
 See Appendix V- A and Appendix V-B
 for palbociclib capsule and liquid 
formulation dosing.  
 
 Intra-Patient Escalation  
Intra-patient dose escalation is not a llowed.  
 
 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any suspected or 
confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be reported imme diately (within 24 hours) to the 
Study Chair.  
 
 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or 
definitely attributable to  palbociclib .  The DLT observation period for the purposes of 
dose- confirmation  will be the first cycle of therapy.  
 Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological toxicities are defined differently.

 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity  attributable  to palbociclib  
 Any Grade 3 or greater  non- hematological toxicity possibly, 
probably  or definitely  attributable to  palbocicli b  with the specific 
exclusion  of: 
• Grade 3 nausea, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, weight loss , 
vomiting or diarrhea  that returns to ≤ Grade 2 or baseline 
within 3 days with supportive care   
• Grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevation , including 
ALT/AST/GGT,  that returns to Grade ≤  2 within 42 days of 
the start of therapy . Note:  For the purposes of this study the 
ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L . Adverse event grades 
will be based on increases above the upper limit of normal, 
regardless of the subject’s baseline. See Appendix XI  for 
toxicity grading table  
• Grade [ADDRESS_676296]  bilirubin elevation that is asymptomatic and 
returns to ≤ Grade 1 within 42 days of the start of therapy 
• Grade 3 total bilirubin elevation that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 within 42 days of the start of therapy  
• Grade 3 or 4 fever, febrile neutropenia or infections  with or 
without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]   
• Grade 3 or 4 hypotension explained by [CONTACT_401689]  
• Grade 3 or 4 isolated electrolyte abnormalities that resolve, 
with or without intervention, to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days . 
Electrolyte supplementation is encouraged.  
• Grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome that resolves to ≤  Grade 2 
within 3 days  
• Grad e 3 mucositis that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days  
• Grade 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]  
• Grade 3 bone and/or pai n in extremity  
• If a patient requires more than  4 doses of palbociclib to be 
held due to toxicity this is a DLT.  
  
 Any Grade 2 non- hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days 
and is considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by [CONTACT_521452]. 
 
 Note : Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study 
drug will not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
DLT will be defined as failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/mm3 and 
platelets > 20,000/mm3 by [ADDRESS_676297] treatment day, not due to 
malignant infiltration.  
 
 Note :  Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia will not be considered a dose -
limiting toxicity.

factor.  
 
 
 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  Attributable to Palbociclib  
 
 If a patient experiences non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in 
Section 5. 4.1, palbociclib  will be held  until the toxicity is ≤  Grade 1 or as 
otherwise indicated below  (see Section 6. 2 for dose modifications for other 
backbone chemotherapy agents). When the toxicity resolves to meet eligibility  
parameters or baseline within [ADDRESS_676299] be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
 Dose Modifications for Speci fic Toxicities  Defined Per Drug  
 
Notify the Study Chair at the time of removing a patient from protocol therapy for  
toxicity. The drugs are listed in alphabetical order.  
  
 Asparaginase [Pegaspargase (PEG -Asparaginase) or Erwinia]  
 
  Allergy  
Systemic Allergic Reactions/Anaphylaxis :  
For severe allergic reaction, discontinue pegaspargase and 
substitute Asparaginase Erwinia  (Erwinia). Erwinia therapy 
should begin within 72 hours of the pegaspargase reaction or as soon as possible. Erwinia dosing: 25,000 international units 
(IU)/m
2 IM/IV  M-W- F for six doses substituted for each dose of 
pegaspargase.  If Erwinia is given IV it should be given as a 1- 2 
hour infusion.  
 
For mild -moderate reversible reaction:  
1. If the infusion was completed, consider sending an 
asparaginase activity level.   Note that a n asparaginase level of at 
least 0.1 IU/ml [ADDRESS_676300] different 
thresholds for switching  to Asparaginase Erwinia ; after 
evaluating these, the following guidelines are recommended for 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ [ADDRESS_676301] since 
antihistamine use may mask the appearance of systemic allergy and fail to alert the provider of the presence of asparaginase neutralizing antibodies. The use of a sparaginase activity assays, 
as described above, are now commercially available and may 
help determine if neutralizing antibodies are present , thus the use 
of premedications is left to the discretion of the provider .   
If there is a question of silent inactivation, check levels as described above between 1 hour and 7 days after the dose. Subs equent doses of asparaginase should be changed to 
asparaginase Erwinia  based on the activity levels described 
above. Whether the dose after which levels were checked should be substituted with asparaginase Erwinia  will depend on when 
the results are receiv ed, the patient’s clinical status, and what 
other therapy is being administered, and is ultimately left to the discretion of the treating physician. Of note, asparaginase Erwinia  is recommended only for pegaspargase hypersensitivity 
reactions and/or in the  presence of silent antibody. It is not 
recommended as a substitute for pancreatitis, transaminitis , 
hyperbilirubinemia, coagulation abnormalities, or other 
non-hypersensitivity toxicities associated with pegaspargase.  
 
 Coagulopathy/bleeding: 
If symptomatic, hold asparaginase until symptoms resolve, then resume with the next scheduled dose. Consider factor 
replacement (FFP, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], factor VIIa). Do not withhold 
dose for abnormal laboratory findings without clinic al 
symptoms.  
 
  Hyperbilirubinemia :  
Asparaginase may need to be withheld in patients with an 
elevated direct bilirubin, since asparaginase has been associated with hepatic toxicity. No specific dose adjustment guidelines are provided in the manufacturer’s labeling. Below are proposed dose adjustment guidelines from published literature

 Ketoacidosis :  
Hold asparaginase until blood glucose can be regulated with 
insulin.  
 
  Pancreatitis:  
Discontinue asparaginase in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 
pancreatitis. In the case of asymptomatic Grade 2 pancreatitis (enzyme elevation or radiologic findings only), asparaginase 
should be held until amylase/lipase levels return to normal , 
and/or other signs subside,  and then resumed.  
 
 Thrombosis (including CNS and non- CNS events) : Withhold 
asparaginase until acute symptoms resolve and treat with 
appropriate antithrombotic therapy and consider repletion of AT -
III, as indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms, consider resuming 
asparaginase while continuing low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) or antithrombotic therapy. Consider measurement and repletion of AT -III during subsequent courses of asparaginase if 
unable to achieve therapeutic Anti -Xa levels. For significant 
thrombosis ( not catheter -related ) consider evaluation for inherited 
predisposition to thrombosis.  
 
 Doxorubicin (Anthracyclines)  
Consider Dexrazoxane prior to each dose for patients with:  
• Anticipated cumulative anthracycline dose > 250 mg/m2 of 
DOXOrubicin equivalent .  
 
Anthracycline Dose Conversion:

  Dose modification for cardiac toxicity:  
If left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) < 50% (as determined by  
[CONTACT_521453]), or if EF inevaluable  shortening 
fraction (SF) < 24%, hold the anthracycline or anthracenedione and repeat the echocardiogram in one week.  If EF remains < 50% (or if EF inevaluable, SF < 24%) , discontinue the 
anthracycline or anthracenedion e and deliver alternate therapy  as 
per the protocol or provider decision.  Resuming cardiotoxic therapy depends on the cause of the cardiac dysfunction and the results of further cardiac evaluation.

  Systemic toxicity : 
The dosage for IT methotrexate will not be reduced for systemic 
toxicity (myelosuppression, mucositis, etc.). Instead, leucovorin 
may be used at a dose of 5 mg/m2/dose IV/PO every 6 hours x 2 
doses, beginning 24 hours after the IT therapy has been delivered. This may reduce the risk of worsening already existent myelosuppression (ANC < 500/µL ) or mucositis. Do not 
administer leucovorin solely to prevent myelosuppression.  
 
 Dose modifications following an epi[INVESTIGATOR_431859]: 
Neurotoxicity has extremely protean manifestations, ranging from transient events, seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_521405], to severe necrotizing encephalopathies.
19-[ADDRESS_676303] be recognized that there are little data to support these approaches or any others.  
 
Many acute events, seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_431860], are temporally related to the administration of intrathecal 
therapy, commonly 9 to 11 days after the IT administration.

Complete clinical evaluation including imaging of the brain is 
strongly recommended.   
 
For patients who return to their baseline pre-event  neurological  
status, clinicians may  
1. Hold the next  planned  dose of IT therapy, or  
2. Substitute IT cytarabine or IT 
cytarabine/hydrocortisone for 1 dose of IT methotrexate , or 
3. Proceed with IT methotrexate and include leucovorin 
rescue at a dose of 5 mg/m
2 IV/PO q [ADDRESS_676304] therapy should be considered  for subsequent intrathecal therapy.  
 
For patients who do not return to baseline pre -event neurological 
status or for those with recurrent events, or evidence of progressive encephalopathy, a dditional evaluation s may be  
warranted and the treating physician may consider a more 
prolonged or definitive change in therapy upon discussion with 
the Study Chair .

flow may be a contraindication to intra thecal and/or 
intraventricular therapy.  
 
 Viral, bacterial, or fungal meningitis :  
Omit until resolved.  
 
  Steroids (Prednisone, Prednisolone or Methylprednisolone) 
 
 Hypertension:  
Dose should not be reduced. Sodium restriction and anti -
hypertensives should be employed in an effort to control 
hypertension.  
 
 Hyperglycemia :  
Dose should not be reduced for hyperglycemia.  
 
 Pancreatitis :  
Every effort should be made not to hold any re -induction steroids. 
Do not modify dose for asymptomatic elevations of amylase and/or lipase. In extreme circumstances, consider discontinuation of steroids, except for stress doses, in the presence of Grade 3 or 
4 pancreatitis.  
 
 Osteonecrosis (ON):  
Do not modify corticosteroid therapy for osteonecrosis (also 
referred to as avascular necrosis) during re -induction.    
 
 Varicella:  
Steroids should be held during active infection except during re -
induction. Do not  hold during incubation period following 
exposure in patients with laboratory evidence of immunity or 
patients who received appropriate post -exposure prophylaxis . 
 
 Inability to use oral doses : 
For dexamethasone, substitute the IV preparation mg for mg. For  
prednisone, substitute IV methylprednisolone at 80% of the oral prednisone dose. Note that if substituting oral prednisolone for 
prednisone, the doses are the same; prednisone is converted in the liver to prednisolone.  
 
 Severe infection:  
Do not hold or discontinue steroids during re -induction without 
serious consideration, as this is a critical period in the treatment of ALL. Later in therapy, one may consider holding steroid until patient achieves cardiovascular stability, except for “stress 
doses.”

 Vincristine  
PLEASE USE “ BALIS ” SCALE FOR GRADING NEUROPATHY (See text box 
below)  
 
 Severe Neuropathic P ain (Grade 3 or greater):  
Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 50% previous 
calculated  dose ( maximum dose: 1 mg ), and then escalate to 
full dose as tolerated. NOTE: neuropathic pain can be severe and difficult to treat. However, because vinCRIStine is an important compone nt of curative therapy and the majority of neuropathies 
are ultimately reversible, vinCRIStine therapy may be given at full dose at investigator discretion. Severe peripheral neuropathies, with or without a positive family history might 
suggest the need for a molecular diagnostic evaluation to rule out 
Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT), Type 1A or Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Drugs such as gabapentin may be of value.  
 
 Vocal Cord Paralysis :  
Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 50% previous calculated  dose (maximum dose: 1 mg) , and then escalate to full 
dose as tolerated. See above for comment on CMT.  
 
 Foot Drop, Paresis :  
(Grade 3 or greater): Consider  holding or decreasing dose. These 
toxicities are largely reversible but over months to years. Accordingly, holding doses of vinCRIS tine and/or lowering the 
dose may not result in rapid resolution of symptoms and may 
compromise cure. See above for comment on CMT. Physical 
therapy may be beneficial to maintain range of motion as well as 
to provide ankle -foot orthotics ( AFOs ) and other forms of 
support. Drugs such as gabapentin may be of value.  
 
 Jaw Pain:  
Treat with analgesics; do not modify vin CRIS tine dose . 
 
 Hyperbilirubinemia23,24:  
 
Direct Bilirubin * VinCRIStine Dose Adjustment  
< 3.0 mg/dL  None ( maximum dose: 2 mg ) 
3.1- 5.0 mg/dL  50% of calculated  dose ( maximum dose: 1 mg ) 
5.1-6.0 mg/dL  25% of calculated  dose ( maximum dose: 0.5 mg ) 
> 6.0 mg/dL  Withhold dose and administer next scheduled dose if toxicity has 
resolved. Do not make up missed doses  
                           *Refer to Appendix XI  for guidelines  
 
 Constipation or ileus (≥ Grade 3) or typhlitis : 
Hold dose(s); institute aggressive regimen to treat constipation if present. When symptoms a bate resume at 50% of calculated dose 
(maximum dose: 1 mg) and escalate to full dose as tolerated.

7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT  THERAPY  
 
 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Additional cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, 
or may NOT be administered to patients receiving protocol therapy . If these treatments 
are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
 Investigational Agents  
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
 Supportive Care 
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary. See COG Supportive Care Guideline at Modified (“Balis”) Pediatric Scale of Peripheral Neuropathies  
 
Peripheral Motor Neuropathy: 
• Grade 1 : Subjective weakness, but no deficits detected on neurological exam, other than abnormal 
deep tendon reflexes.  
 
• Grade 2 : Weakness that alters fine motor skills (buttoning shirt, coloring, writing or drawing, using 
eating utensils) or gait without abrogating ability to perform these tasks.  
 
• Grade 3 : Unable to perform fine motor tasks (buttoning shirt, coloring, writing or drawing, using 
eating utensils) or unable to ambulate without assistance.  
 
• Grade 4 : Paralysis.  
 
Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy : 
• Grade 1 : Paresthesias, pain, or numbness that do not require treatment or interfere with extremity 
function. 
 
• Grade 2 : Paresthesias, pain, or numbness that are controlled by [CONTACT_105]- narcotic medications (without 
causing loss of function), or alteration of fine motor skills (buttoning shirt, writing or drawing, using eating utensils) or gait, without abrogating ability to perform these tasks.  
 
• Grade 3: Paresthesias or pain that are controlled by [CONTACT_74811], or interfere with extremity function 
(gait, fine motor skills as outlined above), or quality of life (loss of sleep, ability to perform normal activities severely impaired).  
 
• Grade 4 : Complete loss of sensation, or pain that is not controlled by [CONTACT_74811].

https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -supportive- care- guidelines .  See below 
for recommendations on management of specific toxicities associated with palbociclib.  
 
All patients should receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) at a dose of TMP 2.5 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose 160 mg/dose) by [CONTACT_521454] 2 or 3 sequential 
days per week. Patients allergic to o r experiencing excessive myelosuppression with 
TMP/SMX can receive prophylaxis per institutional guidelines with alternative agents.  
 
 Infection Control  
Patients with relapsed ALL have a significant risk of morbidity and mortality 
with intensive salvage the rapy. Patients in first relapse have a 4 -5% induction 
mortality rate, the majority associated with infection. They have also been found to have a 45% rate of Grade 3 and 4 infection during re -induction on recent COG 
ALL trials
13 (and personal communication T. Horton, E. Raetz, and M. O’Brien), 
and other  relapsed ALL re- induction trials.25-27 Therefore patients with multiply 
relapsed ALL require a very conservative approach to infection prevention and treatment as outlined below.  
 
 Due to the substantial risk of infection in patients with  relapsed 
ALL receiving intensive induction therapy, it is strongly recommended that they remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521406]: 1) there is evidence of ANC recovery defined as ≥  
200/microliter and increasing, and 2) they are afebrile an d 
clinically stable.  
 
 It is strongly recommended that patients receive broad spectrum 
gram positive and negative antibiotic prophylaxis at initiation of 
re-induction therapy and until they have met the criteria for 
discharge outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . The specific choice of 
prophylactic antibiotics should be guided by [CONTACT_521455], although levofloxacin is recommended.28,29 
 
 Prophylactic anti -fungal therapy with IV caspofungin, micafungin 
or amphotericin is also highly recommended.30 The patient should 
remain on prophylactic anti -fungal therapy until their ANC has 
fallen and recovered to 200/microliter and rising and the patient is afebrile and clinically stable.   
 
 Empi[INVESTIGATOR_521407] -fungal therapy 
should be initiated immediate ly for patients with an ANC < 
500/microliters (or < 1000 /microliters and falling) and an oral 
temperature > 38 °C twice in 12 hours or ≥ 38.5°C once or as 
clinically indicated. Broad -spectrum antibiotics and anti -fungals, 
once started, should be continued until there is evidence of ANC recovery defined as ≥  200/microliter.  Also, please see 
the COG Fever  and Neutropenia Guidelines at: 
https://childrenso
ncologygroup.org/index.php/cog-supportive- care-guidelines    
  
 If clinical symptoms or radiographic evidence of enterocolitis or 
typhilitis develop, broad spectrum antibiotics which provide

coverage for gram negatives, and anaerobes and fungal infections 
is highly recommended.  
 
 When possible during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521408] (HEPA) or clean -air rooms 
with constant positive pressure.31 
 
 Acute Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Patients with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are at high risk of tumor lysis 
should be assessed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521409], tumor 
lysis syndrome, and coagulopathy. Suggested initial studies, obtained prior to 
initiating antileukemia therapy, may include a complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, fibrinogen, D -dimer, and 
serum electrolytes, including creatinine, BUN, uric acid, phosphorus, and calcium. 
Continued monitoring of these studies should be carried out at suitable intervals 
until abnormalities have resolved or the risk has abated.  
The risk for serious acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is usually restricted to the first 72  hours after initiation of therapy; however, it may spontaneously occur 
prior to treatment. To manage the metabolic derangements caused by 
[CONTACT_203312], hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, the 
following steps should be initiated:  
• Begin allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg/m²/day or 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 
800 mg/day) in 2 - 3 divided doses and continue until peripheral blasts and 
extramedullary disease are reduced. In some patients, such as those with 
oliguria or severe renal dysfunction, or in those with marked hyperuricemia, it 
may be also be appropriate to use rasburicase. Note that rasburicase is 
contraindicated in patients with glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency.  
• Hydrate at 2,400- 3,000 mL/m²/day to maintain urine output > 100 
mL/m²/hour until peripheral blasts a nd extramedullary disease are reduced. 
Potassium should not be added to the hydration fluids.  
 
Urine alkalinization is NOT necessary for TLS prophylaxis. There is paucity of evidence demonstrating benefit of urine alkalinization and it can potentially lead 
to calcium phosphate precipi[INVESTIGATOR_389050]/or metabolic acidosis.  
 
 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support white cell number or function can only be administered culture proven bacteremia or invasive fungal infection. The Study Chair should  be 
notified before growth factors are initiated.  
 
 Concomitant Medications  
 
 Cytochrome P450 and antileukemic drugs  
Since concurrent use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) with anti -leukemic therapy has recently been 
associated with inferior EFS, every effort should be made to avoid these agents, as well as rifampin, which also induces many drug metabolizing enzymes.

and may be suitable alternative anticonvulsants. Azole antifungals (listed in the 
table below) and the macrolide group of antibiotics (listed in the table below) 
may have potent inhibitory effects on drug- metabolizing e nzymes. Patients 
receiving some anti -leukemic drugs (e.g., vincristine, anthracyclines, etoposide) 
may experience excess toxicity when these agents are given concomitantly; 
alternate antifungal and antibacterial therapy should be used where possible  (see 
table below).

references.  
 
 CYP3A4 Interactions and palbociclib  
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the metabol ism of palbociclib. Palbociclib is a 
strong substrate of CYP3A4 isozyme.  
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not limited to atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, may increase palbociclib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see 
Appendix 
III for list of  agents) .  
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide, felbamate, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentin, and St. John’s wort, may decrease 
palbociclib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see Appendix III
 for 
list of agents) .

Strong inducers and/or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited from [ADDRESS_676306] of agents.  
The use of moderate inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided as well for the duration of the study, if reasonable alternatives exist.  
Palbociclib is a weak time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 in humans. The use 
of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic range should be avoided for the duration of the study if reasonable alternatives exist ( Appendix III
).

8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED  
 
 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation  
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 
days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess 
eligibility (see Section 4.0 ) must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  
Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therapy starts within  seven (7) days of obtaining 
labs to assess eligibility.  If a post- enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, 
or laboratory values are older than [ADDRESS_676307] 
be re- checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and 
serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not 
receive protocol therap y and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging studies , 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy,  must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of 
protocol therapy (repeat the tumor imaging if necessary).

 Pharmacology (required)  
 
 Description of Studies and Assay  
Palbociclib PK studies will be determined by a validated LC -MS/MS method.  
 
 Sampling Schedule (See Appendix VIII) 
Plasma samples will be obtained at the following time points:  
• Day 1 of Cycle 1:  pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 4, [ADDRESS_676317] -dose of 
palbociclib .  
• Day 11 of Cycle 1: pre -dose, and at 1, [ADDRESS_676318] -dose 
of palboc iclib. 
 
 Sample Collection and Handling Instructions  
Blood samples ( 3-4 mL) to provide a minimum of 1.0 mL  of plasma  for PK 
analysis of palbociclib will be collected in tubes containing dipotassium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K 2EDTA) . Record the exact time that the 
sample is drawn along with the exact time that the drug is administered . 
  
 Sample Processin g 
Upon collection of the blood PK samples, keep the samples on wet ice at all times prior to processing to plasma.  
• The blood samples have to be processed to plasma and placed in a 
freezer at - 20ºC within 1 hour of collection.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 42 
 
• To process the blood samples to plasma, centrifuge the blood samples in 
a refrigerated centrifuge at approximately 4 ºC at about 1700 x g for 
approximately 10 minutes.  
• Using a clean separate pi[INVESTIGATOR_521415], transfer the plasma 
samples into pre -labeled 4 or 5 mL polypropylene cryovials and store in 
the freezer at approximately - 20ºC until shipment. If a - 20ºC freezer is 
not available at the site the samples may be stored at - 80ºC. Palbociclib 
is stable at - 20ºC and - 80ºC for 439 days in frozen K2EDTA plasma.  
• Ship the frozen samples on dry ice to the contract bioanalytical laboratory.  
 
 Sample Labeling  
Each tube must be labeled with th e patient’s study registration number, the study 
I.D., and the date and time the sample was drawn.  Data should be recorded on 
the Pharmacokinetic Study Form  (Appendix VIII ), which must accompany the 
sample(s).  
 
 Sample S hippi[INVESTIGATOR_335]  
A phone call or fax communication should precede all sample shipments. A 
phone or fax communication must precede all HIV positive or other known infectious sample shipments.  
 
Detailed sample inventory information ( Appendix VIII
) must accompany the 
samples. Lack of paperwork or illegible information will delay sample login and 
analysis. Samples that are unclearly or incompletely labeled may also lead to 
delayed analysis.  
 
Samples sho uld be batched and shipped via overnight courier at the end of each 
cycle on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays. Sample s should be shipped to the 
following address:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 Correlative Biology Studies (Optional) 
 
 Description of Studies  
Correlative biology studies in bone marrow and peripheral blood will be performed in consenting patients to determine the biological activity of CDK4/6 
inhibition. RNA sequencing and Western blotting will be used to determine gene 
and protein expression.  Cell cycle analyses will be performed to determine the 
percentage of S phase cells prior to  and after palbociclib exposure.  
 
 Sampling Schedule (See Appendix II) 
One bone marrow or blood sample (10- 15mL) for each time point will be 
collected to assess for the studies outlined below.  Peripheral blood also can be

 Cytarabine        (07/13/15) 
(Cytosine arabinoside, Ara -C, Cytosar®) NSC #[ZIP_CODE]  
 
 Source and Pharmacology:  
Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA  polymerase. A limited, 
but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also 
been reported. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing 
DNA synthesis (S -phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression 
of cells from the G1 phase to the S -phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_458373] 
(Ara-CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Ara -CTP is inactivated by 
a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic uracil 
derivative (Ara- U). It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminase levels 
may be an important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine. It has an initial distributive phase t
½ of about 10 minutes, with a 
secondary elimination phase t ½ of about 1 to 3  hours. Peak levels after 
intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of cytarabine occur about 20 to 60 minutes after injection and are lower than IV administration. Intrathecally 
administered doses are metabolized and eliminated more slo wly with a t
½ of 
about 2 hours.

 Methotrexate         (05/07/19) 
(MTX, amethopterin, Trexall® , Xatmep ®) NSC #000740  
 
 Source and Pharmacology:  
A folate analogue which reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme 
that reduces folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation limits the availability of one carbon fragments necessary for the 
synthesis of purines and the conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the 
synthesis of DNA and cell reproduction. The polyglutamated metabolites of MTX 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ [ADDRESS_676324] of MTX on DNA repair and/or strand breaks.  
MTX cytotoxicity is highly dependent on the absolute drug concentration and the 
duration of drug exposure.  MTX is actively transported across cell membranes. At 
serum methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1  µmol/mL, passive diffusion 
becomes a major means of intracellular transport of MTX. The drug is widely 
distributed throughout the body with the highest con centration in the kidney, liver, 
spleen, gallbladder and skin. Plasma concentrations following high dose IV MTX 
decline in a biphasic manner with an initial half -life of 1.5 -3.5 hours, and a 
terminal half life of 8 -15 hours. About 50% is bound to protein. After oral 
administration, approximately 60% of a 30  mg/m2 dose is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521419], with peak blood levels at 1 hour. At doses >  30 mg/m² absorption 
decreases significantly. Even at low doses absorption may be very erratic, varying betwe en 23% and 95%. The elimination of MTX from the CSF after an intrathecal 
dose is characterized by a biphasic curve with half -lives of 4.5 and 14 hours. After 
intrathecal administration of 12  mg/m², the lumbar concentration of MTX is 
~100 times higher than in plasma. (Ventricular concentration is ~ 10% of lumbar 
concentration). MTX is excreted primarily by [CONTACT_521459]. Renal clearance usually equals or 
exceeds creatinine clearance. Smal l amounts are excreted in the feces. There is 
significant entero -hepatic circulation of MTX. The distribution of MTX into third-
space fluid collections, such as pleural effusions and ascitic fluid, can substantially alter MTX pharmacokinetics. The slow rel ease of accumulated MTX from these 
third spaces over time prolongs the terminal half -life of the drug, leading to 
potentially increased clinical toxicity.

 Intrathecal Triples       (05/08/12) 
(Methotrexate/Hydrocortisone/Cytarabine, IT -3) 
 
 Source and Pharmacology:  
The intrathecal route of administration of a drug produces more consistent CSF  
drug concentrations at relatively smaller doses because of the volume difference 
between the CSF and blood compartments (140 mL vs. 3500 mL in an adult). (The Patient Age

Drug half -lives are longer as well because clearance is related to flow rather than 
metabolism or protein binding. Intrathecal methotrexate has a biphasic elimination 
curve from the CSF with a t ½ of 4.5 and 14  hours respectively. Following IT 
injection of cytarabine the elimination of the drug from the CSF is biphasic with a 
t½ of 1 and 3.4 hours respectively which is 8- fold longer than the clearance from 
plasma. The elimination of hydrocortisone is simil arly prolonged.

 Doxorubicin        (05/09/11) 
(Adriamycin®) NSC #123127   
 
 Source and Pharmacology: 
An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius . The 
cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits 
nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA -cleavable complexes appears 
to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. Doxorubicin 
cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of cellular functions. Enzymatic 
electron reduction of doxorubicin by a variety of oxidases, reductases, and dehydrogenases generate highly reactive species inclu ding the hydroxyl free 
radical (OH•). Free radical formation has been implicated in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by [CONTACT_56930] (II) and Fe (III) reduction at the cellular level. Cells treated with doxorubicin have been shown to manifest the characteristic morphologic changes associated with apoptosis or programmed cell death. 
Doxorubicin- induced apoptosis may be an integral component of the cellular 
mechanism of action relating to therapeutic effects, toxicities, or both.  
 
Doxorubicin serum decay pattern is multiphasic. The initial distributive t ½ is 
approximately 5 minutes suggesting rapid tissue uptake of doxorubicin. The terminal t
½ of 20 to 48 hours reflects a slow elimination from tissues. Steady-
state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 30 L/kg and are indicative of extensive 
drug uptake into tissues. Plasma clearance is in the range of 8 to 20  mL/min/kg 
and is predominately by [CONTACT_366024]. The P450 
cytochromes which appear to be involved with doxorubicin metabolism are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 
days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine 
during the same time period. Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, (younger children)

 Source and Pharmacology:  
Prednisone and prednisolone are a synthetic compounds  closely r elated to 
hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoids produce widespread and diverse physiologic effects on carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water balance, functions of the cardiovascular system, kidney, skeletal muscle, and the nervous sys tems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of thymus -dependent 
lymphocytes (T -lymphocytes), monocytes, and eosinophils. Glucocorticoids 
selectively bind to the cortisol receptors on human lymphoid cells which are found in larger numbers on le ukemic lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding 
of immunoglobulin to cell surface receptors and inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby [CONTACT_16538] T -lymphocyte blastogenesis and 
reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The s pecific cellular 
mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition 
of glucose transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Peak blood levels occur within 2 hours of oral intake. Prednis one 
is approximately 75% protein bound with a plasma t
½ of 3.2 to 4 hours. (Biologic 
half-life is 12 - 36 hours.)

Frequency and Timing:  Fetal and teratogenic toxicities: Corticosteroids cross the placenta ( prednisone has the 
poorest transport ). In animal studies, large doses of cortisol administered early in pregnancy 
produced cleft palate,  stillborn fetuses, and decreased fetal size. Chronic maternal ingestion 
during the first trimester has shown a 1% incidence of cleft palate in humans. Prednisone  is 
excreted into breast milk in humans; however,  several studies suggest that amounts excreted 
in breast milk are negligible with prednisone  doses ≤  20 mg/day.

2.3 hours, and 85  hours respectively; however, the range of the terminal half -life 
in humans is from 19 to 155  hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in 
humans and animals; about 80% of an  injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears 
in the feces and 10% to 20% can be found in the urine. The p450 cytochrome 
involved with vincristine metabolism is CYP3A4. Within 15 to 30  minutes after

 Source and Pharmacology:  
Pegaspargase is a modified version of the enzyme L -asparaginase. L -asparaginase 
is modified by [CONTACT_521460] 
(PEG), molecular weight of 5000, to the enzyme, forming the active ingredient PEG -L-asparaginase. The L -asparaginase (L -asparagine amidohydrolase, type 
EC-2, EC  [IP_ADDRESS]) used in the manufacture of Pegaspargase is derived from 
Escherichia coli  which is purchased in bulk from [COMPANY_006], Sharp and Dohme. L -
asparagine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized b y the transamination of L -
aspartic acid by a reaction catalyzed by [CONTACT_98804] L- asparagine synthetase. The 
ability to synthesize asparagine is notably lacking in malignancies of lymphoid origin. Asparaginase depletes L -asparagine from leukemic cells (especially 
lymphoblasts) by [CONTACT_521461] L -asparagine to aspartic acid and 
ammonia. In predominately L -asparaginase naive adult patients with leukemia and 
lymphoma, initial plasma levels of L -asparaginase following intravenous 
administration of pegaspargase were determined. Apparent volume of distribution 
was equal to estimated plasma volume. L -asparaginase was measurable for at least 
15 days following the initial treatment with Pegaspargase. The approximate t
½ in 
adult patients is 5.73  days. The  enzyme could not be detected in the urine. The half -
life is independent of the dose administered, disease status, renal or hepatic 
function, age, or gender.  In a study of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with ALL 
who received either a single intramuscular injection of pegaspargase (2500 IU/m2), 
E. coli L- asparaginase ([ZIP_CODE] IU/m2), or Erwinia ([ZIP_CODE] IU/m2), the plasma half -

 (05/07/19) 
(Erwinia Chrysanthemi, Erwinase®, Erwinazetm, Crisantaspase) NSC #106977  
 
 Source and Pharmacology:  
L-asparagine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized by [CONTACT_521463] 
L-aspartic acid by a reaction catalyzed by [CONTACT_98804] L -asparagine synthetase. 
Neoplastic cells associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid 
leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma are asparagine -dependent but lack 
asparagine synthetase activity. The administration of L -asparaginase produces an 
anti-neoplastic effect by [CONTACT_521464]. 
As a result, these cells lack the ability to produce the asparagine necessary for 
protein metabolism and survival. Deamination of glutamine may also play a role in the  antineoplastic activity of asparaginase.  
 
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinaze ) is asparaginase derived from 
cultures of Erwinia chrysanthemi. L -asparaginase is a tetrameric enzyme; each of 
the four identical subunits has a molecular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_676332] from E.coli L -
asparaginase and may allow continued asparaginase therapy when a 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs to Escherichia coli -derived asparaginase. The 
package labeling states that there is insufficient information to characterize the 
incidence of antibodies to asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi. Several factors are 
involved in immunogenicity assay results and the assessment of antibodies,

Frequency and Timing: Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of L -asparaginase have been noted in animals. Adequate, 
well-controlled studies of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  have NOT been conducted. It is not 
known whether asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  will cause fetal harm or affect the ability to 
reproduce. It is not known if asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  is excreted into breast milk. The 
use of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  should be avoided in pregnant or lactating patients.  
(L) Toxicity may also occur later .

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
The minimum number of evaluable patients required for is 4. The projected maximum 
number of evaluable patients required for the dose confirmation is 15. This allows for 6 patients at each of 2 dose levels and 20% inevaluability. Therefore, this part is expected 
to be completed within 8 -15 months assuming that 1- 2 patients per month are enrolled 
into the study. An absolute maximum of 30 patients is possible in the unlikely event that 
each of 2 dose levels is expanded to 12 patients because of DLTs of different classes and 
20% inevaluability.  If this scenario occurred, the study would be expected to be 
completed within 15- 30 months.  
 Up to six evaluable patients with relapsed B - or T-ALL/LL will be enrolled at the 
RP2D/MTD for further pharmacokinetic and efficacy assessment . This part of the study 
would be expected to be accrue over 6-[ADDRESS_676343] one dose of the study drug(s) or who 
experiences a dose- limiting toxicity is considered evaluable for Adverse 
Events. In addition, for the dose -confirmation  portion during Cycle 1, patients 
must receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and  
must have the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be 
considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity. Patien ts who do not have DLT 
and are not considered evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.  
 
 Maximum Tolerated Dose  
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one -third of 
patients experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), AND all  of the following conditions are met, expansion 
of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose - and/or drug- related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acce ptable 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 67 
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, the dose confirmation  can proceed.  
 
• The DLTs observed in the expansion pharmacokinetic (PK) /efficacy  phase 
(Part B) will be counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the 
MTD during the dose confirmation  portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort 
of patients at the MTD (during the dose confirmation  plus the PK expansion) 
experience DLT then the MTD will be exceeded.  
 
 Dose Confirmation and Determina tion of MTD  
 
The rolling six phase [ADDRESS_676344] of this study. 17 Two to 
six patients can be co ncurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the 
number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have 
experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability  data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a 
cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the 
cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is 
available for all thr ee when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose 
is escalated and the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is 
not yet available for one or more of the first three participants  and no DLT has been 
observed , or if one DLT has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same 
dose level. Lastly, if two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de -
escalated. This process is repeated for participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is 
filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next 
available participant if escalation or de- escalation rules have not  been fulfilled at the time 
the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.  
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the current dose level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de- escalated dose level, or whether the 
study is suspended to accrual:

* If six patients already entered at next lower dose level, the MTD has been defined.  
**If final dose level has been reached, the recommended dose has been reached.  
 
If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then 
the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped (see Section 11.2.2  for 
exception to rule).  
 In additi on to determination of the RP2D/ MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities 
will be reported.  
 
 Inclusion of Children, Women and Minorities  
 
The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity.  Review of accrual to past COG studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NIH -
identified ethnicities to such studies.  Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a 
representative population, but in a Phase [ADDRESS_676345] be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations 
on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on 
the other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are 
noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those differences more fully.  
 
 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies and Response Analysis  
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of palbociclib will be 
performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summ ary statistics, 
including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution 
permit).   
 While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of palbociclib , patients will 
have disease evaluations performed as indicated  in Section 8.1 .  Disease response will be 
assessed according to leukemia/lymphoma specific  criteria ( Section 12.0) and will be 
reported  descriptively. 
 All these analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature.  
 
 Study Design

Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 69 
 
This study is designed using a rolling six model to confirm the recommended phase 2 
dose or maximally tolerated dose of Palbociclib in patients with relapsed B - or T-
ALL/LL.  Once the RP2D/MTD is established a non-statistical feasibility expansion 
cohort of  up to 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled. If the proportion of patients who 
experience a DLT in cycle 1 is >33% at any time, then the study will suspend enrollment pending DVL leadership discussion.  
 
 Method of Analysis   
 
Response will be determined as defined in Section 12.0 . A report on the efficacy 
assessment will be posted on the completed disease stratum as part of a semi -annual 
study committee meeting book report.  
 
Toxicities for patients will be described separately  for the expansion cohort .  
 
 
 12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.[ADDRESS_676346] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.   A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
 Response Criteria for Patients with Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
 
 Bone marrow status  
M1 < 5% blasts in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_521422] 200 cells counted.  
M2 5 - 25% lymphoblasts in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_521422] 200 cells 
counted. M3 > 25% lymphoblasts i n a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_521422] 200 cells 
counted. 
 
 Leukemia Relapse 
• Isolated Bone Marrow Relapse: Patients with an M2 or M3 marrow at any 
point after achieving initial remission without involvement of any 
extramedullary site. Morphologic relapse should be confirmed using flow 
cytometry, FISH and/or cytogenetics or molecular techniques.  
• CNS Relapse : Positive cytomorphology and WBC ≥ 5/μL OR clinical signs 
of CNS leukemia such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, or 
hypothalamic syndrome that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] i nvestigator, more 
likely due to recurrent CNS leukemia than to alternative causes (e.g., viral 
infection or chemotherapy toxicity). If any CSF evaluation shows positive 
cytomorphology and WBC < 5/µL, a second CSF evaluation is recommended within 2 - 4 week s. While identification of a leukemic clone in 
CSF by [CONTACT_4133] (TdT, CD19, CD10, etc.) or FISH for diagnost ic 
karyotypic abnormality may be useful, definitive evidence of CNS

involvement (i.e. WBC ≥  5/µL OR clinical signs of CNS leukemia) is 
required  for the diagnosis of a CNS relapse.  
• Testicular Relapse: Confirmation by [CONTACT_521468]. 
• Combined Relapse : M2 or M3 marrow  at any point after achieving 
remission with concomitan t CNS and/or testicular relapse.  
 
 Complete Response (CR)  
Complete response (CR) is defined as an M1 marrow (< 5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with peripheral count 
recovery, defined as absolute neutrophil count (AN C) ≥ 500/µL and platelet 
count ≥ to 50,000/µL without transfusion for 7 days.  
Resolution of extramedullary disease (non- CNS, non -testicular) is defined as 
improvement of any nodal or organ disease with lesion resolution to < 1cm or 
FDG -PET SUV improved to Deauville 3 or less  (< hepatic or mediastinal uptake) 
if initially FDG -avid.  Skin lesions must be clinically resolved.  
 
 Complete Response with Incomplete Count Recovery (CRi)  
Complete response with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRi) is defined as an M1 marrow (< 5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating blasts or 
extramedullary disease and with an ANC < 500/µL and/or platelet count < 
50,000/µL.  
 Partial Response (PR)  
Complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of M2 marr ow 
status if M3 originally, without new sites of extramedullary disease, and with recovery of absolute neutrophil count (ANC ≥ 500/µL). Complete response in the 
marrow without resolution of extramedullary sites is a PR.  
 
 Stable Disease (SD)  
Patient does not satisfy the criteria for PD, or has recovery of ANC ≥ 500/µL and 
fails to qualify for CR, CRi, or PR.  
 
 Progressive Disease (PD)  
An increase of at least 25% in the absolute number of bone marrow leukemic cells, development of new sites of extramedullary disease, or other laboratory or clinical evidence of PD, with or without recovery of ANC or platelets.  
 
 MRD Negative  
Patients will be considered MRD negative if their bone marrow has less than 
0.01% blasts by [CONTACT_521469]. MRD should be performed by a 
COG approved laboratory.

 Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement of leukemia or lymphoma at relapse  
 
CNS 1 : In cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin preparation, 
regardless of the number of WBCs.  
 
CNS 2 : In CSF, presence < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts, or ≥ 5/μL WBCs 
but negative by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm:  
CNS 2a:  < 10/μL red blood cells (RBCs); < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive 
for blasts;  
CNS 2b:  ≥ 10/μL RBCs; < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; and  
CNS 2c:  ≥ 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but negative by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm (see below);  
 CNS 3 : In CSF, presence of ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts and/or 
clinical signs of CNS leukemia  or lymphom a: 
CNS 3a:  < 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;  
CNS 3b:  ≥ 10/μL RBCs, ≥ 5/μL WBCs and positive by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm (see below);  
CNS 3c:  Clinical signs of CNS leukemia  or lymphoma  (such as facial nerve 
palsy, brain/eye  involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).  
 
Method of evaluating initial traumatic lumbar punctures (LPs)  
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is traumatic and contains ≥ 5 WBC /μL and blasts, the following Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm 
should be used to distinguish between CNS2 and CNS3 disease:  
 
CSF WBC > 2X Blood WBC  
CSF RBC  Blood RBC  
 
A patient with CSF WBC ≥ 5/μL blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC ratio is 2X greater than 
the blood WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis.  
 
Example:  CSF WBC = 60/μL; CSF RBC = 1,500/μL; blood WBC = [ZIP_CODE]/μL; 
blood RBC = 3.0 X 106/μL: 
 
60   = 0.04 > 2X  46,000   = 0.[ADDRESS_676347] either measurable or 
evaluable disease.

 Evaluable for objective response:  
Only those patients who have mea surable disease present at baseline and have 
received at least one dose of protocol therapy will be considered evaluable for 
response. These patients will have their response classified according to the 
definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit  objective disease 
progression prior to the end of Course 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
  Measurable disease:  
A measurable node must have an LDi (longest diameter) greater 
than 1.[ADDRESS_676348] be recorded 
in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
  Non-measured disease:  
All other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and assessable 
disease) should be followed as nonmeasured disease (e.g., 
cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites).    
 
  Target lesions:  
For patients staged with CT, up to six of the largest target nodes, nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are 
measurable in two diameters (longest diameter [LDi] and 
shortest diameter) should be identified from different body regions representative of the patient’s overall disease burden and 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if involved.  
 
 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 2 weeks  prior to the beginning of 
the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_521470](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
 Clinical lesions:  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 
≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). 
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.

The major response designations will be established by [CONTACT_521471] (BM) if involved at diagnosis. With growing concerns about the risks of cumulative ionizing 
radiation exposure to children from CT, MRI could be 
considered as an alternative to CT for evaluating non-pulmonary disease sites. e.g., assessment of abdominal/pelvic disease. As 
with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of 
the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was 
used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on 
the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the response guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters 
for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type 
of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol 
should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Pulse 
sequences should include at a minimum, axial and coronal fat -
saturated FRFSE -T2, coronal T1 and axial and coronal post -
gadolinium fat -saturated T1 weighted imaging. Body scans 
should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
 
 PET- CT:  
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT 
quality. How ever, if the site can document that the CT performed 
as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for International Pediatric Non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Response Criteria  measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data, which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely  or serially performed.   
 
 Ultrasound: 
 Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should 
not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound 
examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and 
measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. I f there is concern 
about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT 
in selected instances.

Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 74 
 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.  
 FDG -PET:  
For patients with a positive PET scan at diagnosis, PET ca n be 
used to follow response in addition to a CT scan using the 
International Pediatric Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma Response 
Criteria .34 
 
 Response Criteria 
 
 Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all disease. CT or MRI should be free of residual 
mass or evidence of new disease. FDG -PET should be negative.  
 
CR unconfirmed (Cru) :  Residual mass is negative by [CONTACT_6789] -PET; no new lesions by [CONTACT_521472]; no  new and/or progressive disease elsewhere  
 
Partial Response (PR) : 50% decrease in SPD (the sum of the products of the largest diameter 
and the perpendicular diameter for a tumor mass) on CT or MRI; FDG -
PET may be positive (Deauville score or 4 or 5 with reduced lesional 
uptake compared with baseline); no new and/or PD; morphologic 
evidence of disease may be present in BM if present at diagnosis; 
however, there should be 50% reduction in percentage of lymphoma cells 
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : For thos e with > 25% increase in SPD on CT or MRI, Deauville score 
4 or 5 on FDG -PET with increase in lesional uptake from baseline, or 
development of new morphologic evidence of disease in BM  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
 Evaluation of Non- measured Lesions (CT -based response, PET/CT based 
response not applicable)36 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Absent non- measured lesions.  
 
Partial response (PR) : Absent/normal, regressed, lesions, but no increase.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : No increase consistent with progression  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : New or clear progression of preexisting non- measured lesions.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 75 
 
 Evaluation of organ enlargement36 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Regress to normal  
 
Partial response (PR) : Spleen must have regressed by >  50% in length beyond normal  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  No increase consistent with progression  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : In the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length must increase by 50% 
of the extent of its prior increase beyond baseline. If no prior 
splenomegaly, must increase by [CONTACT_2669] 2 cm from baseline.  
 
New or recurrent splenomegaly  
 
 Duration of Response  
 
 Dura tion of overall response:  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as re ference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively documented.  
 
 Duration of stable disease:  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met.  
 Progression- Free Survival  
PFS is defined  as the duration of time from start of treatment to 
time of progression or death, whichever  occurs first.  
 
 Response Review  
Response will be as per institutional evaluations.  
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are r eported in a routine manner at scheduled 
times during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms  for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for  optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections 
provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered 
serious; 3) the grade (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332821].  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AINV18P1  
     
Version Date:    01/23/ 20                                                              Page 76 
 
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner 
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.[ADDRESS_676350] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website (
http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3:  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of 
specific adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.   
 
NOTE : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_676351] dose of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions  in the 
table  below. Attribution categories are as follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
 
Step 4 :  Complete the MedWatch  Form FDA 3500A  SAE Report found on the protocol 
homepage and load into RAVE per the CRF guidelines. CTEP AERS will  NOT  be used 
for reporting of Serious Adverse Events

Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within [ADDRESS_676352] Administration of the 
Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.

6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported via  MedWatch Form 
FDA 3500A  within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_99204] (or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be reported regardless of attribution and designation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as protocol -
specific expedited  adverse event  reporting exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, 
or birth de fects must be reported via MedWatch  Form FDA 3500A  in RAVE  if the event occurs 
following treatment with an agent under a COG  IND.  
 
 Reporting of Adverse Events for commercial  agents – AINV18P1 abbreviated 
pathway 
 
The following are expedited reporting requirements for adverse events experienced by 
[CONTACT_521473]. 
 
Commercial reporting requirements  are provided in Table B.

Version Date:    01/23/ [ADDRESS_676355] dose of treatment with a 
commercial agent that can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not due to 
cancer recurrence must be reported via  MedW atch reporting . 
 
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_99204] (or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be rep orted regardless of attribution and 
designation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as protocol -
specific expedited  adverse event  reporting exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or si gnificant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, 
or birth defects must be reported via MedWatch Form FDA 3500A  if the event occurs following 
treatment with an agent under a  COG IND.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient I D provided during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to SAE  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 Trials 
Utilizing an Agent under a Non- CTEP IND:  
 
• Any death that occurs more than [ADDRESS_676356] dose of treatment with an investigational agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due 
to progres sive disease must be reported via  MedWatch Form FDA 3500A  in RAVE  for an agent 
under a CTEP or non -CTEP IND agent  per the timelines outlined in the table above.  
 
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents that may 
be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in an expedited manner  via 
MedWatch Form FDA 3500A in RAVE. Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome of 
the pregnancy is known  at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. If the baby [CONTACT_521474] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second expedited report is requir ed. Any pregnancy loss 
must also be reported expeditiously.  
 
• Myelosuppression, (Grade 1 through Grade 4 adverse events as defined in the table below),  does 
not require expedited reporting , unless it is associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .

all emailed documents . 
 
 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report  
forms and do not alter the guidelines for  SAE Expedited reporting. 
 
 If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
 If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.  
 
 The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 
 The resolution date  of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the 
AE decreased from its highes t grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
 An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported each course it recurs .  
 
 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_521423] ( Section 13.2 ) should be 
reported at the end the cycle using the forms provided in the CRF  packet (See 
Section 14.1 ). 
 
 COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for 
industry sponsored trials).  
 
 Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for 
oversight of the patient.

14.0 RECORDS, REPORTING, AND DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 
 Categories of Research Records  
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories  
 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Roadmaps, Pathology Reports, Surgical Reports. 
These forms are uploaded into RAVE . 
 
2. Reference Labs, Biopathology Reviews, and I maging Center data:  These data 
accompany submissions to these centers, which forward their data e lectronically to the 
COG Statistics & Data Center.  
 
3. Computerized Information Electronically Submitted:  All other data will be entered in 
RAVE  with the aid of schedules and worksheets (essentially paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_521424]) provided in the  case report form  (CRF) packet.  
 See separate CRF  Packet, which includes submission schedule.  
 
 
 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and safety is ensured by [CONTACT_521476] a Protocol Safety 
Committee.  
 
 Protocol Safety Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology 
Group policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of the Protocol Safety Committee ( PSC) is to protect the interests of 
patients and the scientific integrity of the study. The PSC consists is constituted 
of members who will serve as advisors to the study sponsors and to ass ist in 
achieving the successful completion of this clinical trial and to participate in the evaluation of the safety and trial results. The PSC members will be 
investigators participating in Study AINV18P1 who will work with the study 
committee and study s ponsors to ensure the protection of the welfare of 
subjects participating in this clinical trial and to enhance the integrity of the 
conduct of the clinical trial.  The PSC members should have experience in the 
conduct of clinical trials and have knowledge of good clinical practice (GCP) 
guidelines and a general understanding of regulatory requirements for drug development. The PSC members should be capable of conducting discussion, 
integrating differing points of view, and moving toward consensus on 
recommendations to be provided to the study sponsors  
 
The PSC will m eet on an as needed basis, at least every 6 months, to review the 
safety data for the determination of dose -limiting toxicities (DLT), feasibility 
decisions, analyses of the interim results, eval uate risk benefit throughout the 
conduct of the study and other issues relevant to the overall study conduct  
Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the PSC , study chairs will be 
responsible for working with the study statistician to prepare study reports for review by [CONTACT_521477]. The PSC will provide recommendations to the COG 
Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the Group Chair for the study,  or to 
continue the study unchanged. Study Progress  reports for institutional review 
boards will be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the

APPENDIX II: A SSESSING  THE B IOLOGICAL  ACTIVITY OF PALBOCICLIB: 
CORRELATIVE BIOLOGY STUDY SUMMARY 
 Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples will be collected at three time points : 
 
• Pre-study (marrow) 
• Day 4  (peripheral blood) -
 Peripheral blood samples should be collected PRIOR to administration of 
Day [ADDRESS_676362] count is >  1000/mm3  
• Day 32 + 2 days  (marrow, if a patient has persistent disease)  
  The pre-study and Day [ADDRESS_676363] 
count is >1000/ μL: 10 mL per samples (<10 kg) or 15 mL (≥10 kg).   
 To substitute peripheral blood, patients must have an initial absolute blast count of at least 1000 lymphoblasts/μL . To calculate the absol ute blast percentage, multiply the total WBC by [CONTACT_941] % peripheral 
blasts:  
 (WBC)(% blast)(1000) = absolute blast count/μL  
 
As an example, if the patient has a WBC of 10 and 50% blasts, the absolute blast count is:  
(10)(.5)(1000) = 5000/μL  
 Lymphoblasts will be isolated from bone marrow or blood within 4 hours of collection using Ficoll -Paque 
Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Brown Deer, WI) at participating centers to avoid potential artifacts 
associated with prolonged sample storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   Blasts will then be frozen and batch shipped on 
dry ice to the Carroll/ Aifantis lab s for DNA and protein purification.   Participating sites will be required 
to purify the blast population from bone marrow by [CONTACT_521479] -Paque 
Plus and freeze samples prior to batch shipment of the samples to our laboratory for analysis (see protocol for Ficoll purification below in section 2.0).  
 
 PBMC Isolation by [CONTACT_521480] 4 hours of collection at local centers using the protocol described 
below.  
Required materials:  
- 5 – 15 mL fresh  marrow or blood sample  
- Ficoll- Hypaque solution  
- PBS 
- 50 mL falcon tubes  
- 1.8 mL Cryotubes  
- DMSO  
- Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)  
- 1 mL individually wrapped sterile transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_521426] : 
 All steps are carried out using a sterile technique, at room temperature – unless noted otherwise.

1) Fresh marrow or blood samples should be stored at 4°C prior to isolation.  
2) Prepare all required materials and label falcon tubes.  
3) Fill a tube with a volume of  Ficoll -Hypaque that is equal to the volume of the marrow or blood 
sample  (Ficoll:Marrow or Blood ratio is 1:1).  
4) In a second tube, m ix marrow or blood sample with an equal volume of  PBS (1:1)  
5) Slowly overlay diluted marrow or blood sample  from Step 4  onto Ficoll -Hypaque from Step 3,  
avoiding the mixing of marrow or blood with Ficoll:  
• Suggestion: tilt the falcon tube with Ficoll at a 45° angle and add the diluted sample to 
the side of the tube using 10 mL serological pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]. You should see a clear interface.  
6) Centrifuge 30 minutes at 400xg with BRAKE OFF.  
7) Gently aspi[INVESTIGATOR_521427]. The layer below is the PBMC layer  (buffy 
coat) . Remove it using a 1 mL individually wrapped sterile transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_521428] t ransfer to a new 
50 mL tube  leaving behind the clear Ficoll layer and bottom red blood layer . 
8) Bring volume to 45 mL with PBS and mix cells by [CONTACT_315645].  
9) Centrifuge 20 minutes at 200xg with the BRAKE ON.  
10) Without disturbing the pellet, remove an d discard the supernatant.  
11) Bring volume to 10 mL with PBS and mix cells to obtain a uniform suspension.  
• Note: Pelleted cells will start dying if not resuspended immediately.  
12) Count the cells and determine their viability. Keep the samples on ice during the count.  
13) Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 400xg with the BRAKE ON . 
14) Without disturbing the pellet, remove and discard the supernatant.  
15) Resuspend cell pellet at 10 million cells per mL in 95% FBS/5%  DMSO. Aliquot 10 million cells 
(1 mL) per cryo -tube and slow freeze at -80° C.   
 Cryopreserved marrow samples will be shipped on dry ice:

Experimental Design:  
Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (5 mL) will be collected at the time points summarized in 
Table 1.  The pre -study and Day [ADDRESS_676367] count is >1000/mm3: 10 mL per samples (<10 kg) or 15 mL ( ≥10 k g).   
 
Lymphoblasts will be isolated from bone marrow within 4 hours of collection using Ficoll -Paque Plus 
(Amersham Biosciences, Brown Deer, WI) at participating COG Phase 1 centers to avoid potential 
artifacts associated with prolonged sample storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Blasts will then be frozen and batch 
shipped on dry ice to the Carroll/ Aifantis lab s for DNA and protein purification.   One third of the cells 
will be used for DNA sequencing and two thirds of cells per sample will be used for protein expression.  Freshly harvested blasts will be collected and fixed prior to shipment for the proposed cell  cycle analyses  
(see Appendix II for details regarding samples processing) .

1) Western Blotting (immunoblotting).  Expression of RB1, phospho- RB1, Cyclin D3, CDK4, 
CDK6 and p27Kip1 will be performed using Western Blotting (immunoblotting).T -ALL and B -
ALL blas t cells will be resuspended in lysis buffer (20mM Tris, pH8; 150mM NaCl; 0.1% SDS; 
0.5% Na -Deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors ([COMPANY_002], Basel, Switzerland) and sonicated 
for 30 sec at 4 watts, incubated on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 
4ºC. The resulting supernatant will be collected and protein concentration will be determined 
using the DC Protein assay (Bio- Rad). 25 µg of protein will be fractionated by 15% SDS -PAGE 
and transferred to Immobilon- P membrane (Millipore , Billerica, MA). Immunoblotting will be 
performed with the following primary antibodies and dilutions: anti -RB1 (BD Pharmingen, cat 
#554162), anti -Cyclin D3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc -6283) , anti -p27KIP1/CDKN1B (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, sc -393305) , anti-CDK4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc -[ZIP_CODE]) and anti -
CDK6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc -7961) and anti -actin, 1:4000 (Abcam, #8227), as a loading 
control. HRP -conjugated anti -rabbit IgG, 1:10,000 and anti - mouse IgG, 1:10,000 (NA934V, 
NA931V, GE Healthcare,) will be used as the secondary antibody. Reactive proteins will be visualized using ECL Plus (Amersham Life Sciences).  
 
2) Targeted DNA sequencing to identify somatic mutations. ALL samples will be sequenced using a custom mutational gene panel that includes the most frequently mutated genes in B -ALL 
and T -ALL.
37,38 These include RB1 , PAX5, IKZF1, CRLF2, CREBBP , NOTCH1 , FBXW7 , NRAS , 
KRAS , IL7Ra , JAK1 , JAK2,  JAK3 , TET2 , RUNX1 , EP300 , IKZF1 -3, EZH2 , EED , SUZ12 , 
GATA3 , RUNX1  and PHF6 . Samples will pre - prepped as previously described, DNA libraries 
will be generated and sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform that enables us to sequence 
reliably small numbers of cells. This technology is available at NYU Langone Medical Center.  
 
3) Dual -Colour FISH for detection of CDKN2A  deletions. CDKN2A  deletions will be detected 
using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis as it is currently done in solid tumors. Dual -color FISH will be performed using a commercially  available Spectrum Orange- labelled 
locus specific p16 (9p21) probe and Spectrum Green- labelled chromosome 9 centromeric probe 
[Vysis LSI p16 (9p21) SpectrumOrange/CEP9 SpectrumGreen Probe; Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, Illinois, [LOCATION_003]] as previously des cribed.
[ADDRESS_676368] saline citrate for 5  min, sections will be digested with 
pepsin (37 500 U in 0.1  N HCl) (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, [LOCATION_003]) at 37°C for 10 –25 min. Slides 
will be co -denature d with the probes, allowed to hybridize and washed according to the 
manufacturer's protocol. Slides will be analyzed, blinded from the clinical data, using a Zeiss 
microscope (Axioplan 2, Jena, [LOCATION_013]) equipped with the appropriate filters. A minimum of [ADDRESS_676369] (uniform DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_521430]) interphase nuclei 
of consecutive cells in at least two different areas of the section will be scored.  
 
4) Cell Cycle Analysis . We will use standard flow cytometry protocols to comb ine surface staining 
for T -ALL markers (CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8) and intracellular staining for the cell cycle (and 
apoptosis) markers Ki67 and DAPI. For intracellular Ki67 and DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_521431] T -ALL cells, 
following staining of surface antigens, bone marrow/peripheral T -ALL cells will be fixed with 
4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin prior to addition of anti -Ki67  (BD 
Biosciences) and 2 µg/mL DAPI.  A similar procedure will be followed for B -ALL.  
 
As an early measure of response to single agent palbociclib, the absolute peripheral blast count will be 
measured at baseline and after [ADDRESS_676370] count protein expression, pairwise 
comparisons will be made usi ng Fisher’s exact test and paired t -test or an equivalent nonparametric tests 
as appropriate.  Baseline expression of cell cycle proteins and the presence of somatic mutations and 
CDKN2A  deletions will be correlated with treatment response. These analyses will be descriptive and 
exploratory in nature.

Patients  receiving doses > 75 mg/day may take either the capsule or liquid formulation. (See 
Appendix V -A for dosing nomogram for palbociclib capsule formulation).  
 
Patients receiving < 75 mg/day of palbociclib  must receive the liquid formulation.   
 
Patients  receiving the liquid formulation  who experience dose- limiting toxicity should have their 
dose reduced by 30%, so that patients receive 70% of the original prescribed  dose.  
 
The concentration of palbociclib liquid formulation is 25 mg/mL.  
 
Calculated doses  < 18.75 mg should be prepared in oral syringes ≤ [ADDRESS_676371] 0.1 mL (2.5 mg). Calculated doses > 18.[ADDRESS_676372] 0.2 mL (5 mg). It is recommended that oral dosing syringes should be only filled up to 75% of the maximum volume.  
 To calculate dosing volumes for each patient based on BSA, the following formula should be used:  
 
Dosing Volume (mL) = Prescribed Dose (mg/m2) x BSA (m2) 
              25 (mg/mL)  
 Round dosing volumes according to the above rules.  
Examples : 
• Patient BSA 0.33 m
2, Dose Level 1 (50 mg/m2)  Calculated Dose = 16.5 mg PO daily  
         Calculated Volume (mL) = (50 mg/m2 x 0.33 m2) / (25 mg/mL) = 0.66 mL   
Final Dosing Volume (mL) =  0.7 mL (rounded to nearest 0.1 mL for doses ≤ 18.75 mg)  
Final Dose to be administered = 0.7 mL x 25 mg/mL = 17.5 mg  
 
• Patient BSA 1.66 m2, Dose Level - 1 (35  mg/m2)  Calculated Dose = 58.1 mg PO daily  
              Calculated Volume (mL) = (35  mg/m2 x 1.66  m2) / (25 mg/mL) =2.324 mL  
Final Dosing Volume (mL) = 2.4  mL (rounded to  the nearest 0.2 mL for dose > 18.75 
mg) 
Final Dose to be administered = 2.4 mL x 25 mg/mL = 60 mg

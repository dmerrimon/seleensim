Study Design:  
The current proposal is for a randomized, placebo- controlled, crossover trial to test the effects of 
blocking nocturnal blue light exposure on sleep, sleep habits, and melatonin secretion in 
individuals with insomnia. This will be a combined ambulatory and laboratory investigation. The 
intervention will consist of wearing  BB lenses  which block 97% of blue light (Uvex amber lenses,  
Bandit wraparound glasses,  Honeywell Safety, Smithfield, RI) or non -BB placebo lenses (Uvex 
clear lenses, Bandit wraparound glasses , Honeywell Safety, Smithfield, RI) for the 2 h pr eceding 
bedtime each night  for 1 wk (Fig. 2 ). Intervention phases will be separated by a 4- wk washout 
period, to reduce carry -
over effects and study 
premenopausal 
women at the same menstrual cycle phase.  
This will be followed by  
[CONTACT_205773]. Each 1-wk 
intervention phase will conclude with an in-
patient laboratory visit to characterize the effects of the intervention on sleep and circadian 
physiology ( Fig. 3 ). During the ambulatory portion, participants will be free- living and will expose 
themselves to their habitual light levels and choose their sleep timing. During the laboratory 
portion, an 8- h sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_205769]’s habitual sleep times duri ng 
the week preceding entry. For standardization, and to demonstrate the beneficial effects of the 
BB lenses for preserving nocturnal melatonin secretion, participants will be uniformly exposed to 
an LED light source for 2 h preceding bedtime during the laboratory portion (Fig. 3).  
Potential participants who reply to posted advertisements will be told about the study. They 
will then be scheduled to meet with research staff to sign consent forms and determine eligibility. 
Inclusion criteria will include age  18-65 y, and a report of insomnia for ≥ [ADDRESS_245411] moderate 
severity (apnea- hypopnea index ≥15 events/h), a STOP -BANG score > [ADDRESS_245412] sleep/circadian rhythms. Participants will be 
excluded if they are smokers or taking beta- blockers (26), since these decrease melatonin 
release, or if they consume excessive caffeine (>500 mg/d). Hypnotics/sedatives for sleep can have been used,  but participants will refrain from use for 2 wk preceding the start and throughout    1 wk AW; SSQ    1 wk AW; SSQ

the study. Participants with children <[ADDRESS_245413]-sleep questionnaire ( PSQ ). The PSQ entails quantitative estimates of SOL, total sleep time 
(TST), time awake during sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and number of awakenings, as well as ratings on a 7-
point scale of overall evaluation of sleep (1: extremely bad, 7: extremely good), soundness of 
sleep (1: extremely light, 7: extremely sound), current feeling of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (1: not sleepy at all, 
7: extremely sleepy), and current feeling of refreshed (1: not refreshed at all, 7: extremely 
refreshed) (42). This will allow us to confirm compliance with intervention and to collect data on 
ambul atory sleep quality and habits across the trial. During each intervention, participants will 
wear a wrist -mounted Actigraph GT3X+ to monitor TST, SOL, and sleep efficiency ( SE).  At the 
beginning of the intervention, participants will complete a brief computer -based adaptive 
neuropsychological battery (NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery; www.nihtoolbox.org ) to assess their 
functioning in the domains of executive function, attention, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], language, processing speed, and working memory. This assessment will last about [ADDRESS_245414] with participants and setup the study.  
Upon completing the 1- wk intervention, participants will be admitted to the Inpatient Unit at 
the Clinical Resea rch Resource ( CRR) of CUMC at ~18:00 for the lab testing period (Fig. 3). Upon 
admission, an in-dwelling forearm catheter will be inserted to allow continuous blood sampling 
which will not interrupt the sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Blood (3 ml/sample) will be collected continuously (1x/ h) 
from 1 9:00-09:00 under “constant posture conditions ”. Participants will remain in dim lights (<30 
lux) and in a semi -recumbent position during wakefulness. The sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_205770] a fully recumbent position. In  lieu of meals, small isocaloric servings of BOOST Plus 
Complete Nutritional Drink (Nestle)  will be served each hour during wake epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Participants 
will be asked to stretch their legs each hour while in the bed during the lab portion, without getting 
out of bed.  
Within the first 2 hours of arrival in the lab, participants will complete the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_205771]- 65 (PI[CONTACT_58468]65 ), which quantifies insomnia symptom severity. They will also repeat the 
same brief (~30 min) neuropsychological battery (NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery) administered at 
the intervention.  Each hour spent awake in the laboratory, participants will complete a 15- item 
visual analogue scale ( VAS) to assess their levels of alertness, hunger, and appetite. CUMC 
research staff will interact with participants and conduct the study/collect data.  
Beginning 2 hours before the sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], participants will be exposed to bright light  (500 
lux) and will wear either BB or placebo lenses.  The sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_205772]. They will have an 8- hour sleep 
opportunity in the lab. This will include a polysomnographic sleep recording. Upon awakening, participants will remain in bed in semi -recumbent position for the next [ADDRESS_245415] Plus. At 
9:00, blood sampling will end and the catheter will be removed. Participants will be discharged at 
10:00. Blood samples will be analyzed for plasma content of melatonin (RIA, ALPCO, Salem, NH). After discharge, participants will begin a 4 -week washout period. At the conclusion of this, 
they will cross over to the alternate lenses condition. The will be given the alternate lense type (BB or clear) and also the actigraph for the 7- day ambulatory tracking period. They will resume 
using the lenses 2- h before bedtime for [ADDRESS_245416] completed all experimental procedures.  
Statistical Procedures:   
Two-way within subjects ANOVA for repeated measures (factors: condition x time) will be used 
to analyze continuous melatonin, VAS, and neuropsychological values obtained during the 
laboratory visits. Simple main effects tests will be  used to analyze significant interactions. Paired-
samples t -tests will be used to analyze single- value sleep parameters (subjective, actigraphic, 
and PSG) , as well as sleep related questionnaires (PI[CONTACT_58468]65 and PSQ). Data will be tested for 
normality, and non- parametric equivalent tests will be used if data are deemed not normally 
distributed. Significance will be p<0.05

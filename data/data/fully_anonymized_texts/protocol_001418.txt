Study Protocol  
 
An Open Label Trial of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_749290] D rinking  
 
Overall Concept :  The current proposal represents an innovative pharmacological approach to the 
treatment of binge drinking that derives from preclinical findings from the laboratory of [CONTACT_188288], one of 
the proposal’s consultants.   [CONTACT_188289] found that a melanocorti n agonist, melanoton II, potently  suppresses 
binge drinking  (Navarro et al, 2015) in a mouse model of binge drinking. Because the antidepressant 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188243] (Greenway et al, 2009) [CONTACT_188289]'s lab 
also studied the effect of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188244] -drinking in their model and showed that bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188245] -drinking at doses that were lower than those that suppress appetite (unpublished 
data).   Because bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33535] a clinically available an d FDA approved medication [CONTACT_188289] initiated a 
discussion with our group to consider a clinical trial of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188246].   Navarro et al (2015) found 
evidence that using a melanocortin agonist with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_749291].    In addition to a direct effect on binge drinking, [CONTACT_188289]’s 
lab has proposed that modulating the melanocortin  system and counteracting binge drinking may have value in 
preventing  progression of alcohol use from binge drinking to dependent level drinking (Thiele, 2012; Navarro et 
al, 2015) —potentially, a very important finding for clinical care.  
General Background : Binge drinking is a major public health problem in the United State s.  The 
Center for Disease Control (CDC) places alcohol as the number three cause of preventable deaths following 
nicotine use and overweight (Mokdad et al, 2004).  Binge drinking, generally defined as the consumption of five 
or more standard drinks for a man or four or more drinks for a woman  in about a two hour period  (see Courtney 
and Polich 2009),  is a major component of excessive alcohol use and a serious problem for the [LOCATION_002].   
The C DC (2012) report indicated that 17.1% of the adult U.S. popul ation reported one binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_188251] 30 days in 2010-- men (23.2%) vs . women (11.4%)  with peak ages 18 -24 years (28.2%) , 25-34 
years (27.9%) , and 35-44 years (19.2%).  Men reported an average of 5 binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] /month with a  
mean of 9.0 drinks/epi[INVESTIGATOR_288344] w omen 3.2 binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] /month  at 5.9 drinks/epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Binge 
drinking leads to multiple problems , e.g. accidental injury (Gmel et al, 2006 ), aggressive and violent  behavior 
(Shepard et al, 2006) , and high blood pressure  (Fan et al, 2008) . Additionally, there is increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_188253] (Hingson et al, 2006) .  Overall, binge 
drinking contributes to more than half of all deaths attributed to alcohol and to three quarters of the economic 
cost of excessive alcohol use—binge drinking is a serious public health problem and one that may exceed traditionally defined alcohol dependence in its overall cost to society . 
Binge drinking is a complex construct as it is both a stand- alone phenomenon and also a component of 
alcohol use disorders.  We are focusing on the behavior to allow greater fidelity to the preclinical data where 
the key behavior was consumption of an intoxicating amount of alcohol in a two hour period , a non -dependent 
model  (Navarro et al, 2015) .  The majority of binge drinkers do not have physical dependence (see Woerle et 
al, 2007), and we are particularly  interested in this “developmental” phase towards overt physical dependence 
as the preclinical literature suggests this phase may be a key time for clinical intervention (Thiele  2012).   
Treatment of Binge Drinking with or without Co- Occurring Alcohol Use Disorders  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_188254], efforts to improve 
recognition and treatment of binge drinking have received less attention than efforts directed towards DSM -IV 
defined alcohol dependence though this is beginning to change ( Siqueira and Smith , 2015).    A recent 
assessment of screening and brief intervention for patients with risky drinking (where many binge drinkers are 
categorized) and related alcohol -use problems in the primary care settin g revealed that a variety of brief 
intervention techniques, e.g. brief advice, motivational  interviews , can reduce heavy drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (12% 
more individuals with no heavy drinking, 95% CI 7- 16%) (Jonas et al, 2012).  Unfortunately,  the improvements 
were modest and health impacts were unclear highlighting the need for additional approaches such as 
pharmacotherapy . As noted by [CONTACT_188281] (2015) “… they [non-dependent drinkers] are an underserved patient 
population associated with significant and growing health care costs .” The availability of medication options for 
binge drinking would increase medical clinicians’ interest in identifying and treating this significant  problem.  
Pharmacotherapy approaches to treat  binge drinking :  Few clinical trials for binge drinking per se have been 
completed. O’Malley et al (2015) studied 128 young adult college students with heavy drinking (≥ 4 heavy 
drinking days in 4 weeks ; ~60% DSM -IV alcohol dependent  but without physical dependence ) and compar ed 
25 mg daily + [ADDRESS_1024681] on %heavy drinking or %abstinence but naltrexone led to a reduction in 
drinks/drinking day.  They noted,  “…the risk -benefit ratio favors offering young adult drinkers naltrexone to 
reduce the amount of alcohol they drink.”  Three trials have been conducted for older heavy drinkers or 
problem drinkers , mean age late 40’s , using the opi[INVESTIGATOR_749292] (Kranzler  et al 2003, 2009) or 
nalmefene (Karhuvaara et al, 2007).  These trials sought individuals who were problem drinkers or heavy 
drinkers rather than physically dependent on alcohol , though 84- 95% met criteria for DSM -IV alcohol 
dependence.  These trials excluded individuals with evidence of more severe alcohol dependence, i.e.  >[ADDRESS_1024682] the novel preclinical finding that activating 
melanocortin systems in brain with/without  opi[INVESTIGATOR_188256].  Identification of a 
potential efficacy  signal would be significant as it would not only demonstrate that  activation of  melanocortin  
systems with/without opi[INVESTIGATOR_188257] a biomedical component of binge drinking which could positively affect medical 
clinicians ’ attitudes  and potentially increase identification and treatment efforts . 
Innovation  
The present application is innovative in two major areas:  1) it represents the first clinical test of the exciting 
precli nical finding that activating melanoco rtin systems  potently counteracts binge drinking  and 2)  it represents 
one of the first clinical trials to investigate the eff icacy of pharmacotherapy for binge drinking .  These 
innovations have the potential to affect clinical practice for the binge drinking patient.   
Innovation 1.  First proof of concept trial to translate to humans the preclinical finding that activation of 
melanocortin systems with/without µ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_749293] (2015) recently demonstrated that activating melanocortin 
systems with/without opi[INVESTIGATOR_188260] a 
powerful effect to reduce binge drinking in a mouse model.  The rationale 
to test th ese systems  derived from evidence that activation at the 
melanocortin receptor blunts ethanol intake in animals  and that 
melanocortin peptide s and the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] β -endorphin share a 
common protein precursor and functional relationships (See Navarro et al, 
2015).   
In their study , Navarro et al (2015) used melan otan II (MT-II) to activate 
the melanocortin receptor  and naltrexone for opi[INVESTIGATOR_188261].  MT-II 
reduced bring drinking with MT-II being more potent and overall more 
effective than naltrexone (72% decrease in ethanol consumption vs 47% 
decrease ), Figure 1.   Furthermore, MT-II increased the effectiveness of 
naltrexone in a synergistic manner.  A key aspec t of this study was that  it 
investigated effects on binge- drinking rather than dependent level 
drinking, as the authors note “ …our results specifically speak to the 
possibility that these targets could be useful for curbing  excessive binge 
drinking, an approach that may be useful for preventing the transition to 
dependence.”   
Advantageously, for human trials, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (Wellbutrin ®), an FDA approved antidepressant and anti -nicotine 
agent, activates the melanocortin system through proopi[INVESTIGATOR_188262] (Greenway et al, 2010; Hasegawa et al, 2005).   Thus , we now have access to a 
pharmacological approach , bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] + naltrexone,  approved in humans to test the hypothesis that activation 
of melanocortin systems while blocking the opi[INVESTIGATOR_749294]- drinking-- a true 
translational trial .  
Innovation 2 : One of the first clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for binge drinking.   
As noted earlier, there has been very limited effort towards identifying pharmacological agents that help with binge drinking, particularly in younger populations .  The O’Malley et al (2015) trial may be the first placebo-
controlled trial in young (18- 25 years), heavy drinkers and it did find evidence that naltrexone reduced 
drinks/drinking day. Given that the prevalence of binge drinking peaks in the 18- [ADDRESS_1024683] profound impli cations for clinical management,  see Thiele  (2012).   
Research Approach : For this  feasibility/tolerability trial,  it is important to use doses of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_749295] s.  For  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188265] a 300 mg/d 
dose of the extended release formulation.  The 300 mg dose of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_749296].  The extended release 300 mg formulation has a lower estimated risk 
of seizures (0.1%) compared to the 0.4% rate for the immediate release formulation.  The 0.1% risk of seizures 
Figure 1:  Effects of MT -II compared to 
naltrexone on binge drinking in mice  
(Navarro et al, 2015).  
is compara ble to the risk reported with other antidepressants such as sertraline and fluoxetine (FDA labels) 
and with acamprosate (FDA label), which is approved for alcohol dependence.  Furthermore, we will be 
studying a binge drinking population without evidence of  physical dependence, a history of seizures, or a 
reported history of cocaine use so seizure risk is minimized which has been raised as a concern based on 
animal studies ( Silverstone et al, 2008 ).  For naltrexone, we will use the standard dose of 50 mg/d used for 
alcohol use disorders. .  
Participants:  [ADDRESS_1024684] serve to UNC students and staff,  and local newspaper /radio advertisements.  Key Inclusion 
criteria :  1) A minimum of 5/3 (men/women) or more binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_188267] (mean population values, CDC (2012)).  A binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_188268] 5/4 (men/women) standard drinks (~12 gms ethanol) in about a two-hour period.  Requiring multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_188269] a consistent pattern of binge -
drinking as shorter time frames may give misleading information (see Courtney and Polich, 2009). Subjects 
may meet DSM -V criteria for mild or moderate alcohol use disorder; 2) BMI ≥18.5 (normal weight or above); 3) 
express a desire to achieve abstinence or to reduce alcohol consumption.  Exclusion criteria:   1) Presence of 
physical dependence on al cohol as assessed by [CONTACT_188283] a Severe Alcohol Use Disorder (>5 SCID DSM -V symptoms); 2) a history  of 
bulimia or a seizure disorder ; 3) clinically significant medical disease that might interfere with the evaluation of 
the study medication or present a safety concern (e.g., renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, unstable hypertension, diabetes mellitus); 4) clinically significant psychiatric illn ess including any psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, 
anorexia/bulimia, severe depression, or suicidal ideation; 5) other substance abuse or dependence disorder 
other than nicotine or occasional cannabis  use ; 6) Concurrent use of anticonvulsants, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s, varenicline , 
MAOIs, any anti -alcohol medication  or any psychotropic medication with the exception of stable doses of 
antidepressants for one month; prior history of adverse reaction to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188270]; 7) AST or ALT > 
3.[ADDRESS_1024685] or bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_1024686]; 8) positive urine toxicology screen with the exception of cannabis.  
Individuals with positive cannabis screens will be excluded only if they have a history of a cannabis use 
disorder ; 9) pregnancy or breastfeeding.  
Trial Design :  The design is an open -label trial.  We will use standard clinical doses of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]- XL 
300 mg/d (lower seizure risk) and naltrexone 50 mg/d dispensed by  [CONTACT_749298]. 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_188272] 150 mg/d on Days 1- 4 and increased to 300  mg/d for Days 5 -84. Naltrexone 
will be initiated at 25 mg/d from Days 7 -9 and then go to 50 mg/d for Days 10- 84. We  will see subjects at 
screening and then at Weeks 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12. Subjects will be breathalyzed and receive Medical  
Management (MM) c ounseling to encourage compliance and progress towards drinking goals. MM is a 
medically oriented  brief (10 -15') therapy provided by [CONTACT_80348] (MDs or nursing staff, only MDs in this 
trial). Our medical staff have been trained in MM and have been using it in other trials over the past five years. 
We will use the Time Line Follow -Back  approach to assess alcohol consumption history modified to include 
time taken to consume alcohol and define a binge. We will also measure craving for alcohol using the Penn 
Alcohol Craving Scale.. We will assess tolerability by [CONTACT_749299].  
Our key outcomes of interest include tolerability and acceptability, drinking behavior including frequency 
and intensity of  binge drinking,  and craving for alcohol.  
Recruitment, Telephone Screen, and Full Eligibility Screening :  Subjects will initially be prescreened by 
[CONTACT_749300]. A breathalyzer test will be administered 
(must be 0.00 gms/dl to give informed consent) , height , weight and BMI  recorded and a medical history and 
examination  completed . Over -the-counter and prescription medication use will be recorded  and nicotine use 
documented  (Heatherton et al, 1991). CBC with differential ; serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose; and urinalysis and urine toxicology  Women will 
be given a urine pregnancy test (U β-HCG) at screening and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Trained interviewers wi ll 
conduct the psychiatric screening interview using the M.I.N.I. (Sheehan et al., 1998 ).  The SCID Substance 
Use Disorders Module to establish DSM -V criteria for alcohol use disorders (First et al, 2016)  will be 
administered by [CONTACT_40420]. Garbutt or [CONTACT_749301] . The study coordinator will conduct the pretreatment 90- day 
Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview  to identify amount of alcohol consumed and timeframe of consumption  
(Sobell et al, 1988  and personal communication ).  A binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_188273] a minimum of 5/4 
(men/wom en) standard drinks consumed over about a two hour period, i.e. consuming a bottle of wine over 
five hours would not be coded as a binge drinking day .  The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS)  (Flannery et 
al, 1999) and the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) (Diclimente and Hughes, 1990) will 
be completed and t reatment goal —abstinence vs . reduction — recorded .   
 
Initial Treatment Visit  (within 21 days screening) :  Eligible individuals will not be required to  abstain from 
drinking alcohol  prior to randomization.  The study coordinator will administer a breathalyzer test (BAC must be 
≤0.04 gms/d)  and complete assessments as outlined in Table 1, Participants will be given a calendar style 
diary to track pi[INVESTIGATOR_82959], drinking  quantity/timing,  intoxication  and any side effects .  Finally, participants will 
receive Medical Management from a trained clinician.  
Subsequent Treatment Visits:  See Table [ADDRESS_1024687] of 
review of vital signs, concomitant medication use, and general inquiries into side effects. The physician may 
recommend that medication be held for a period  of time to deal with an adverse event, e.g. n ausea .

Medical Management Intervention :  The psychosocial support for the study will be Medical Management 
(MM) (Pettinati et al, 2005). Dr s. Kampov , Jordan , Pedersen  and Garbutt will conduct MM .  Drs. Kampov and 
Garbutt have been trained in MM by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. William Dundon and again by [CONTACT_18854]. Gail Kaemf of the University of 
Pennsylvania  where [CONTACT_188291] was trained as well . [CONTACT_117467] has been trained in MM by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Garbutt.   MM 
sessions average 10 -15 minutes and focus on three main areas: (1) feedback on consequences of drinking; (2) 
encou raging compliance with medication /addressing compliance problems and  (3) encouraging progress 
towards drinking goal — reduction or abstinence are acceptable. 10% of sessions will be audiotaped  and 
reviewed to enhance fidelity.   
Medication Compliance Monitoring :  Participants will record their pi[INVESTIGATOR_188274] -style diaries 
that will be provided and collected at each visit.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749297]’ 
diary records.  
 
Statistical Plan and Data Analysis: The primary  outcomes of interest are rates of adverse events, 
reported tolerability and retention.  Frequency and intensity of binge drinking and craving for alcohol will also 
be recorded.  Because this is an open -label feasibility trial,  no statistical analyses are proposed but rather an 
overall assessment of tolerability and feasibility will be obtained.  Data will be entered into an Excel databas e 
and reviewed for accuracy.

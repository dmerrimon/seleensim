 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  A brief statement of the purpose of the research 
project.  This section should include the hypotheses and speci fic aims being tested in the 
research. Note: If you are applying for QA/QI/PE determination, you should not use terms like 
“hypothesis” or “research;” Instead, use the terms “aims” or “goals” and “evaluation.” (Approx. 1 
paragraph)    
  
Specific Aim 1:
 To evaluate the ability of 2  doses of oral sodium bicarbonate (1950mg 
each)  to alkalize urine over 24 hours  in adults with type 1 diabetes  and 
without chronic kidney disease.  
 
Hypothesis 1 : Sodium bicarbonate over 24 hours can increase urine pH by 0.5- 1.0 in 
adults with type 1 diabetes  and without chronic kidney disease.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of urinary alkalinization on urine uric acid 
concentration, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142102] 1 diabetes  and without chronic kidney d isease.  
 
Hypothesis 2: Increasing urine pH with oral sodium bicarbonate in adults with type 1 
diabetes  and without chronic kidney disease will solubilize urine uric acid 
thereby [CONTACT_142122], decreasing urine acid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142103] 3: To evaluate the relationship between urine uric acid concentration,

Hypoth esis 3.1: Urine uric acid concentration, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142105] (e.g. NGAL, MMP9)  in adults with 
type 1 diabetes and without chronic kidney disease.  
 
Hypothesis 3.2:  Urine uric acid concentratio n, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142106] (CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_142107] C) in adults with type 1 diabetes and without chronic kidney

In summary, this will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_142108] t o: 1) determine whether 2 doses of oral 
sodium bicarbonate (1950 mg per dose) over 24 hours can alkalinize urine in adults with type 1 
diabetes and without chronic kidney disease; 2) determine the effect of urinary alkalinization on 
urine uric acid; and 3)  examine the relationships between urine uric acid and glomerular function 
and markers of tubular injury.

 The importance of this proposal relates to the major research and clinical need to 
understand the relationship between urine uric acid and diabetic t ubular nephropathy in type 1 
diabetes.  
 
II. Background and Significance : Explain the background of this project so that we will 
understand why it is important to perform this research project. (Approx. 1 page)   
 
 Diabetic nephropathy is characterized not only by [CONTACT_142123]. The tubular changes associated with diabetic nephropathy, include 
basement membrane thickening, tubular hypertrophy, epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal transition, glycogen 
accumulation and interstitial inflammation (1). Although glomerular changes  has received 
significantly more attention from researchers and clinicians than tubulointerstitial changes in 
diabetes, tubular injury is known to associate better with renal function than glomerular injury ( 2). In 
fact, tubular proteinuria may precede microalbuminuria with type 1 diabetes ( 3), suggesting that 
tubular damage may be induced earlier than glomerular injury in the course of diabetic nephropathy.  
 Serum uric acid (SUA) is lower in adolescents and a dults with type 1 diabetes  compared 
to non- diabetic peers (4, 5). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_142109] 1 diabetes  (6), with a large clinical  trial underway examining the ability of 
allopurinol to prevent early renal loss (7). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
lower levels of SUA in type 1 diabetes including glucosuria induced uricosur ia leading to s pi[INVESTIGATOR_142110] (UUA)  and lowering of SUA (8
), and the notion that intracellular uric acid (IUA) and/ 
or UUA rather than SUA may be responsible for the development of complications. Animal studies 
have demonstrated that blocking uric acid production protects the kidney from tubulointerstitial 
injury, which suggests a causal role for uric acid in the development of diabetic tubular injury (9, 
10). Relative dehydration, secondary to glucosuria, exercise or inadequate liquid intake, may lead 
to concentrated and acidic urine, which may cause UUA to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142111] 1 
diabetes (11-14). The UUA precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142112] ( 11-14). Moreover, it was recently 
shown that UUA promoted apoptosis in human proximal tubular cells by [CONTACT_142124] 4 ( 15). 
 Oral alkali replacements are readily available, safe and include the following formulations 
sodium bicarbonate, BiCitra (sodium citrate and citric acid), PolyCitra (citric acid, sodium citrate, and potassium citrate), polycitra- K (potassium citrate and cit ric acid). In contrast to sodium 
bicarbonate, citrate is converted to bicarbonate in the liver and thus this conversion is affected by 
[CONTACT_142125]. Usual adult doses for urinary alkalinization are 325 to 2000 mg orally 1 to 4 times a 
day. One gram provid es 12 mEq (mmoL) each of sodium and bicarbonate, and is titrated to a goal 
of urine pH of 8.0. In a prospective open- label trial 4 g of sodium bicarbonate was administered 
orally 3 times daily to 9 healthy volunteers for 24 hours, and after 10 hours all participants had a urine pH ≥ 7 and after 20 hours all participants had urine pH ≥ 8. No adverse effects or abnormal 
blood results were documented during the 24- hour follow -up (16). Urinary alkalinization should 
solubilize UUA thereby [CONTACT_142126][INVESTIGATOR_142113]. It is unknown whether alkalinization of urine reduces UUA 
precipit ation and c rystallization in type 1 diabetes .  
 With diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of end- stage renal disease in the 
Western world. Novel therapeutic targets could help halt the progression of kidney disease in 
people with type 1 diabetes, thereby [CONTACT_142127], and lessen the public health 
burden. While the currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_142114], urine uric acid crystallization is associated with tubular injury, and is thought to prec ede 
the onset of glomerular disease in type 1 diabetes. Earlier interventions could decrease the rate of 
renal function loss and prolong the time to development of end stage renal disease. UUA is a 
particularly attractive therapeutic target due to the potential to reduce tubular injury with sodium 
bicarbonate. Furthermore, the ongoing Prevent Early Renal Loss (PERL) study with $[ADDRESS_161472] of urine alkalinization with oral sodium bicarbonate on UUA precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142102] 1 diabetes.

 III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
Unpublished data in adolescent with type 1 diabetes  demonstrated a positive 
relationship between urine pH and urine uric acid (r=0.48, p<0.0001, n=99, Figure 1 ), 
suggesting increased solubilit y of urine uric acid with more alkaline urine.

aged 18 -60 years with type 1 diabetes. Assuming 80% of subjects approached will be 
eligible to participate and 60% of eligible subjects will consent to participate, this provides at least [ADDRESS_161474] size of 20% in change 
in urine uric acid.  
- Participants must be able to be fasting prior to  study visit #2 and #[ADDRESS_161475] be able to give informed consent.

C. Study Design and Research Methods    
 
Participants  will be recruited from Diabetes Clinic at Barbara Davis Center. Informed consent 
will be obtained following standard COMIRB approved methods by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or members of 
the research team.  
 
Sodium Bicarbonate Dose  
- 3900mg (2x doses 1950 mg) of Sodium Bicarbonate over 24 hours was decided on 
based on the following:  
o Usual adult daily doses for Sodium Bicarbonate are 1,200-8,000mg with 1 
gram providing 12 mEq (mmoL)  each of sodium and bicarbonate.  
o For urinary alkalinization (with a goal urine pH of 8.0) doses tend to be greater  
and up to 12 ,000 mg daily ( 16).  
o We do not aim to alkalinize the urine of our participants (urine pH > 8.0) but rather normalize the relatively acidic  urine found in participants with type 1 
diabetes, by [CONTACT_142131] 0.5 –  1.0.  
o Extrapolating from published urinary alkalinization data ( 16) and dis cussing 
with [CONTACT_142139] we decided on approximately 4, 000mg divided BID 
over 24 hours. Sodium Bicarbonate comes in 650mg tablet dosing  which led to 
1,950mg BID  (3,900mg) . 
 
Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from Adult Diabetes Clinic at  Barbara Davis Center by [CONTACT_648]. We 
will discuss study details including the pre- study diet and fasting instructions. Interested 
participants  will be mailed:  
o Fasting instructions (for visit #1 and visit #2) – Patients will be asked to fast 
after midnight and will be asked to omit caffeine and smoking prior to the visit 
and 
 Fasting and insulin dosing instructions will be provided for the 
participants to reduce risk of hypoglycemia (these instructions are similar to what is provided once patients with type 1 di abetes come in 
for fasting labs)  
Protocol 15-0541 Page 5 
CF-146, Effective  11/03/15  
  Participants will fast for only 8 hours  
 Participants on insulin pump will be informed to not give themselves a 
bolus in the morning since they are fasting  
 Participants on taking insulin by [CONTACT_142132] a bolus in the morning since they are fasting  
o Diet instructions (for visit #1 and visit #1) –  Patients will be asked to maintain a 
moderate protein (1.5g/kg of weight), and high sodium diet (3,450 mg of sodium per day) for one week prior t o the study visit #1, and between study 
visit #1 and #2.  
o Copy of patient information and consent form to review  
 
Study Visit #1  
 
Visit #[ADDRESS_161477] COMIRB approved methods by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or members of the research team.  
 At this visit, participants will present fasting from midnight, height, weight and blood pressure 
will be measured. Urine will be collected and blood will be obtained via venipuncture by [CONTACT_142133]- trained PRA. The baseline blood will be drawn for serum uric acid, serum 
glucose, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C. Urine will be collected for urin e pH, urine 
ketones, urine glucose, urine creatinine and urine uric acid. The urine will also be examined for 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142117]. The participant will take 1950mg of sodium 
bicarbonate (3 x 650mg tablets) with water. We es timate that the study visit will take [ADDRESS_161478] dose (1950mg of sodium 
bicarbonate [3 x 650mg tablets]) .  
 
The participants will need to remain on the moderate protein and high sodium diet until 
completion of study visit #2. We will have provide protein bars, or participants may bring their own high protein snack.  
 
Study Visit  #2:
  
 Visit #2  will take plac e at Adult CTRC  or Barbara Davis Center . Participants will present fasting 
from midnight. Urine will be collected and blood will be obtained via venipuncture by [CONTACT_142134]- trained PRA. B lood will be drawn for serum uric acid, serum glucose, serum 
creatinine and serum cystatin C. Urine will be collected for urine pH, urine ketones, urine 
glucose, urine creatinine  and urine uric acid. The urine will also be examined for precipi[INVESTIGATOR_142118].

 D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools: 
 
Labs methods:  Serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, serum uric acid and serum glucose will 
be determined using standard methods in the CTRC core lab and Rick Johnson’s lab. Urine uric acid, uri ne glucose, urine creatinine and urine pH will be measured at Rick 
Johnson’s lab. Urine ketones will be checked at BDC.  
 Sample banking:
 Residual blood and urine volume will be stored for future research, in 
particular to use when new and promising urinar y and serum biomarkers become 
available.  
 
Sodium bicarbonate:  Three tablets of 650mg of sodium bicarbonate (1950mg) will be given 
twice a day to all participants. [CONTACT_142140].D. will arrange and dispense 
medications. Prescriptions will be written for the dose to be taken by [CONTACT_142135].  
 Other forms: 
Standard medical history will be obtained (see accompanying forms in 
submission packet).  
 Estimation of GFR: 
Various equations have been developed to estimate GFR based on 
either serum cr eatinine or cystatin C plus other variables. We will employ the state of the 
art CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_142119] C to calculate estimated GFR in our 
participants.

max(serum cystatin C/0.8, 1)-0.711 x 0.995age [ x 0.969 if female ] [ x 1.08 if black]  
  
Compliance:  
 To improve compliance, the first dose of sodium bicarbonate (1950 mg) will be 
administered at the visit #2 at CTRC . Moreover, participants will be asked to set an alarm 
on their phone for the second and final dose (1950mg) at home.   
Plan to minimize risk:  
 
1. Fasting and hypoglycemia:  
Fasting will be limited to 8 hours, and detailed fasting and insulin instructions will be given to particip ants.  
 
2. Venipuncture to draw blood for lab tests:  
Venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_142136]. Gloves will be worn and the ar ea of skin cleaned to prevent risk of 
infection.  
  
3. Sodium bicarbonate administration:  
The study participant will be monitored for a minimum of an hour after the administration of 
the first sodium bicarbonate dose to check for any reaction. The study partic ipant will be 
told to call with any issues or concerns at home. Participants taking medications known to 
interact with sodium bicarbonate will be excluded from participating.

 E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
  
In any clinical study unforeseen h uman factors provide challenges. The current 
study is based upon a previous study with sodium bicarbonate administration in adults with 
no reported adverse effects. Furthermore, we aim to use lower doses of sodium 
bicarbonate in this study. We have also performed careful power analyses to allow 
meaningful analyses.

test will be employed to evaluate whether the change in urine uric acid pre-  and post 
NaHCO3 administration is statistically significant . We will also adjust for covariates with 
ANCOVA or linear regression models [ANCOVA vs. linear regression models will be 
decided based on the variation of urine uric acid at baseline in our participants] .  
We will also calculate fractionated excretion of uric acid (FeUA  = [(UUA * SCr / 
SUA * UCr)*100]), and regress FeUA, SUA and UUA on eGFR calculated by [CONTACT_9289] -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_142120] C. Furthermore, we w ill also regress blood glucose and urine 
glucose on FeUA, SUA and UUA.  
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
 
Diabetic nephropathy remains the leading cause of end -stage renal disease and 
dialysis in the US. While diabetic glomerulopathy has received significant attention from 
researchers and clinicians, determinants of tubulointerstitial injury in diabetes are less w ell 
examined.  Compared to glomerular injury, tubular injury is known to associate better with 
renal function in diabetes ( 2). In fact, tubular proteinuria may precede microalbuminuria 
with type 1 diabetes ( 3), suggesting that tubular damage may be induced earlier than 
glomerular injury in the course of diabetic nephropathy. Animal studies have demonstrated that blocking uric acid production protects the kidney from tubul ointerstitial injury, which 
suggests a causal role for uric acid in the development of diabetic tubular injury ( 9, 10). 
Acidification of urine is associated with urine uric acid crystallization which may lead to 
tubular injury ( 11, 12). For that reason, urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is a 
safe and potentially effective therapy to increase solubility of urine uric acid and prevent 
crystallization and associated tubular injury. Urine alkalinization could potentially prevent 
or halt progression of diabetic nephropathy in type [ADDRESS_161480]  SD of

Adminis tered Once Weekly in Children with GHD  
INDICATION  Growth failure in children due to GHD  
OBJECTIVES  Primary:  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of weekly TransCon hGH in 
children with GHD  from 6 months to 17 years old , inclusive  
Secondary : 
 To assess annualized height velocity (HV) in children with GHD  at 
26 weeks  of weekly TransCon hGH treatment  
 To assess the proportion of subjects with IGF -[ADDRESS_1135997] deviation 
score (SDS) in the normal range of 0.0 to +2.0  at 26 weeks of weekly  
Tran sCon hGH treatment  
 To evaluate the change in height standard deviation scores ( ∆HSDS)  
in children with GHD  at 26 weeks  of weekly TransCon hGH 
treatment  
 To determine the incidence of antibodies against TransCon hGH 
(anti-hGH and anti -PEG ) in children with GHD  over 26 weeks of 
weekly  TransCon hGH treatment  
 To assess the expected maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of 
Trans Con hGH in children with GHD ≥ 6 months to < 3 years old  
 To assess the preference for weekly TransCon hGH or commercially 
available daily hGH treatment  
 To assess the treatment satisfaction of weekly TransCon hGH over 
time

TransCon hGH Dose:  
TransCon  hGH will be  dosed at 0.24 mg hGH/kg /week.  This dose was 
selected due to variable compliance with daily dosing regimens and to be 
consistent with  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 heiGHt Trial that has been ongoing 
since November 2016.  The initial volume  of TransCon hGH 
administered will be calculated using the  weight measurement obtained 
at Visit 1 and the TransCon hGH bracketed weight chart.  
Dose Adjustment Parameters:  
The following parameters may be used by [CONTACT_819917]-approval.  
At Visit  2, the TransCon hGH dose may be adjusted  by [CONTACT_819918] . 
Additionally, t he goal for IGF -1 should be between 0 and +  2.0 SDS 
(unless a different target is identified in consultation  with the Medical 
Monitor ).  Thus, if the IGF -1 SDS measured at Visit 2 (or the Cmax Visit, 
as applicable)  is < 0 SDS, and following confirmation  of IGF -1 level  as 
< [ADDRESS_1136005] -dose (±1 day) , 
the dose may be increased by [CONTACT_3450] 20% to the next higher

TransCon  hGH is a sustained -release inactive prodrug consisting of a 
parent drug, unmodified 22 kDa hGH equivalent to endogenous GH, 
transiently bound to a carrier, methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), via a 
proprietary low -molecular -weight TransCon linker.  The inert  mPEG acts 
as a carrier, extending hGH circulation time in the body through a 
shielding effect that minimizes GH receptor binding and renal excretion, 
thereby [CONTACT_819919].  Over a one -week 
period, TransCon hGH releases fully -active unmodified hGH via 
auto-hydrolysis of the TransCon linker in a controlled manner based on 
physiologic power of hydrogen (pH) and temperature.  As such, the 
TransCon technology is designed to maintain the same mode of action as

METHODS  Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
Baseline and demographic data will be summarized to characterize the 
study population.  Special subgroups of interest, such as prior exposure 
to growth hormone and age categories will be determined, and 
corresponding subgroup analysis for safety and efficacy will be 
performed as appropriate.  Prior and concomitant medication , as well as 
exposure to study drug,  will be summarized.  
Data from clinical assessments will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  Numerical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477], median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, while categorical variables 
will be summarized  by [CONTACT_373589].  
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  A sample size of [ADDRESS_1136020] 95% probability to 
observe  AEs with a 2% or more incidence rate .  It also enables the 
combined safety database of the clinical program ( a sample size of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_1136021] 6 months ) to 
have at least 95% probability to observe AEs with a  1% or more  
incidence rate.

Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136039] of endocrine secretion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304], which targets tissues to promote 
g
rowth in children and control metabolism in children and adults.  It is secreted by [CONTACT_819921][INVESTIGATOR_304].  The secretion of hGH is pulsatile 
in nature; the majority of  secretory pulses (up to 70% of daily secretion) occur with the first 
e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_460794]-wave sleep.  During childhood hGH levels are relatively stable until puberty, 
when the h GH pulse amplitude is elevated with no change in the frequency of pulses; afterwards 
hGH pulse levels gradually decline through adulthood.  hGH production and secretion are 
re
gulated by [CONTACT_200801]; growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin are the 
most significant stimulators, while somatostatin is the strongest inhibitor. 
The hGH gene cluster is located on human chromosome 17q22-24, encoding a 191 amino-acid 
prote
in of 22 kDa and a less abundant 20 kDa hGH molecule (as well as related proteins).  hGH 
sti
mulates the hepatic production and release of IGF-[ADDRESS_1136040], but not all, activities of h GH.  IGF-1 is also produced by [CONTACT_121911] 
c
artilage in response to hGH, where it acts locally as a paracrine ‐autocrine growth factor.  hGH 
a
lso has direct effects in the growth plate (eg, stimulation of chondrogenesis, in concert with 
I
GF-1 action) and in adipocytes (eg, lipolysis, in opposition to IGF-1 mediated lipogenesis).  
I
GF-[ADDRESS_1136041] important and obvious function of hGH is growth promotion of children.  Through its 
I
GF-1 mediated effects (as well as less obvious direct effects ), it stimulates cartilage and bone 
growth by [CONTACT_460844].  In addition, hGH has important metabolic functions: it exerts potent anti-insulin 
effects resulting in decreased glucose utilization (and resultant increased plasma glucose levels) 
and increased lipolysis (in contrast to the opposing actions of IGF-1 to lower plasma glucose and 
incr
ease lipogenesis); these functions underlie its continued secretion into adulthood.  New 
research continues to reveal other potential roles of hGH, including regulation of cardiac and 
im
mune function, mental agility and aging. 
GHD is the result of impaired production or secretion of h GH, which can appear at any time 
point in life and is due to various known and unknown factors.  The etiology of childhood GHD 
is most commonly of hypothalamic origin with impaired GHRH secretion, the most common 
diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD.  GHD is a well-recognized clinical entity in adults as 
we
ll.  It causes abnormalities in body composition, lipid metabolism, and physical and 
psychosocial function, all of which improve with hGH replacement therapy.

Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136042] GHD 
patient was succe
ssfully treated.  Contamination with infectious agents (Creutzfeld-Jakob prions) 
led to discontinuation of its use in 1985 ( Kemp 2014).  A recombinant human growth hormone 
(
somatropin) was then produced by [CONTACT_819922]  
(E coli ) and later produced in other cell lines; it first became commercially available in 1985.  
The
 product is identical to natural hGH with [ADDRESS_1136043] received hGH for growth impairment.  In addition, hGH has been 
successfully used to treat growth impairment associated with a number of conditions such as 
Turner syndrome, Prader- Willi syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, short stature homeobox 
(SHOX) deficiency, Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature, and children born small for 
gestational age
 (SGA).  The safety and efficacy profile of daily hGH preparations in pediatric 
and adult populations is well established and deemed satisfactory. 
At the present time, however, there are no commercially available sustained-release or long-
acting h
GH preparations.  Currently hGH is available only as daily injection formulations, thus 
c
ausing 
a significant burden and interruption of normal daily life to children and their parents, as 
we
ll as compliance issues.  Decreased compliance with daily hGH therapy is known to result in 
sub-optimal height outcomes ( Cutfield 2011).  If a weekly long-acting hGH product were to have 
sim
ilar efficacy, safety, and tolerability while maintaining hGH exposure in the optimal 
therapeutic 
range as existing daily therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], preference and satisfaction for the weekly regimen 
would likely exist, with improved compliance to follow. 
To address this unmet need, the Sponsor developed TransCon hGH, part of the company’s 
proprietary pi[INVESTIGATOR_819904] (ie, transiently attaching proteins or 
small molecules to a car
rier) to create an inactive prodrug.  The prodrug is stable during storage, 
but, after subcutaneous injection, the prodrug enters the bloodstream where the active ingredient 
(
hGH) underg
oes sustained release under physiological temperature and pH in a controlled and 
predictable manner.  This ensures an extended in vivo half-life and more constant drug 
concentration levels than observed when using traditional conjugation methods (eg, permanent 
PEGylation).  TransC
onjugation technology is designed to provide several key benefits to 
pharmaceutic
al product development: 
1) Efficacy/safety profiles similar to daily hGH therapy 
2) Extended in vivo half-
life of hGH while maintaining exposure in the optimal therapeutic 
range 
TransCon hGH is a weekly administered hGH prodrug that liberates unmodified hGH as the 
active pha
rmaceutical ingredient through controlled auto-hydrolysis resulting in sustained release 
of hGH.  TransCon hGH
 consists of hGH that is transiently conjugated to mPEG via a 
(TransCon) linker (Fi
gure 1) .

hGH = human growth hormone; mPEG = methoxypolyethylene glycol, c = 250 
The linker that forms the bridge between the protein and mPEG moieties is stable at pH 5.0.  
However, after introduction into a physiological pH and temperature (ie, after injection of 
TransCon hGH), 
autohydrolysis of the linker occurs in a controlled manner that follows 
first-order kine
tics, whereby [CONTACT_373592], fully-active hGH is released.  As the released hGH is 
completely unmodified, it has the same mode of action and tissue distribution as endogenous 
hGH.  This is important for optimal efficacy, as a portion of hGH activity is mediated by [CONTACT_819923], including the growth plate and adipocytes.  The release of hGH also 
liberates N1, -N1, - N3-trimethyl-1,3-propane-diamine, a small molecular weight compound 
associated with the linker.  The
 remainder of the inactive mPEG-linker component of TransCon 
hGH is cleared from the body through known natural mechanisms for other high molecular 
weight molecules.
 
The exposure-toxicity relationship of PEG in animals and humans has been well investigated and 
metabolism/excretion of PEG is well understood, indicating that the PEG associated with a 
biological molec
ule represents an acceptable benefit-risk ratio to humans ( Webster 2007).

TransCon hGH CT- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136045] 2017  The Sponsor initiated the TransCon hGH development program with TransCon PEG80 hGH 
(ACP-001), in which the carrier was 80 kDa mPEG, and for which 4 clinical trials were 
c
onducted: 2 phase 1 trials in healthy adults, 1 phase 2 trial in adult GHD, a nd 1 6-month 
phase 2 trial in pediatric GHD .  Ac ceptable  safety, pharmacokinetics (PK ), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) were shown in these trials.  Importantly, safety, tolerability, and 
e
fficacy comparable to Genotropin were shown in the phase 2 pediatric GHD trial, as well as 
c
omparable exposure (C max and area under the curve ( AUC ) ) when compared to the same weekly 
dose of daily hGH. 
Upon completion of the TransCon hGH (ACP-001) p hase [ADDRESS_1136046].  The linker component and hGH remained the same between TransCon hGH (ACP-001) 
and TransCon hGH (ACP-011); the only change was the reduction in mPEG carrier size.  This 
c
hange resulted in TransCon hGH (ACP-011), a drug product that is functionally equivalent in 
both PK and PD to its predecessor, but with lower viscosity and higher product concentration 
that e
nables smaller injection volumes and the use of a small-gauge needle.  Additionally, the 
PEG exposure was reduced by ≥ 50%. 
 Relevant Findings from Nonclinical Studies  
Nonclinical PK and PD models have supported the suitability of TransCon hGH (ACP-011) for 
once-weekly treatment of patients. 
Ove
rall, the toxicity studies with TransCon PEG40 hGH did not identify any unexpected 
findings or significant concerns, following either weekly repeat dosing in cynomolgus monkey 
for up to  [ADDRESS_1136047]-natal development in rat.  TransCon hGH (ACP-011) and derived 
hydrolysis products were not genotoxic when assessed in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests, 
and no adverse effects were observed in stand-alone safety pharmacology studies in the rat. 
Following weekly repeat dosing for up to [ADDRESS_1136048] article-related microscopic findings, interpreted as 
exaggerated pharmacology, were limited to the mammary glands in both male and female 
animals.  The findings included small amounts of exudate, ductal dilation, vacuolation, 
mononucle
ar cell infiltrate, and minimal lobular hyperplasia in females only, and only at the 
4.8 mg hGH/kg dose level.  Hyperplasia is a recognized finding at high growth hormone doses in 
monke
ys, presumably reflecting cross-reactivity with the prolactin receptor. 
Additionally, the nonclinical safety pharmacology program for TransCon hGH (ACP-011) did 
not i
dentify adverse effects on the function of the central nervous, pulmonary, or cardiovascular 
systems.  No effects on the cardiovascular system were observed in the adult or juvenile

hGH
/kg/week (highest dose tested).  In all studies, multiple time points were selected to ensure 
adequate coverage of the T max of the parent prodrug and the autohydrolysis products.  
F
urthermore, an in vitro hERG assay was performed as part of the TransCon hGH (ACP-001) 
nonclinical safety program and was deemed relevant by [CONTACT_819924] (ACP-011).  In this study (Study 790652), the application of 
partly hydrolyzed TransCon hGH (ACP-001) containing released hGH (nominal concentration of 
72 μ
g/mL), remainder mPEG80-linker (nominal concentration of 289 μg/mL), and TMPD 
(nominal concentration of 235 ng/mL) did not produce a statistically significant effect on the 
hERG ion channel tail current. 
Comprehensive QSAR assessments evaluating the potential carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and 
cardiotoxicity of TMPD have been performed.  Based on these evaluations, mainly employing 
FDA data sets of modules built by [CONTACT_819925] 2010, it 
was concluded that structural elements of TMPD do not show evidence of carcinogenicity, 
genotoxicity or cardiotoxicity (MultiCASE 2011). 
DEREK did not identify any alerts linked to mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, hERG 
channel inhibition, or any of the DEREK rapid prototype clinical related endpoints such as 
bradycardia, hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity.  Leadscope investigations were marginally 
positive in the E coli mutagenicity model but negative in the mouse lymphoma model.  TMPD 
was not predicted to be carcinogenic in rodent models (CTS 2011). 
Additionally, TransCon hGH has been studied in two Phase 1 trials in adults 
(ACP 001 PK/PD-001, and ACP 001 CT-003), a Phase 2 trial in adults with GHD 
(ACP
 001 CT -002), and a 26-week Phase 2 trial in treatment-naïve children with GHD 
(A
CP 001 CT-004).  Electrocardiograms in each of these trials did not demonstrate any 
drug
-relate cardiotoxicity. 
The nonclinical data are provided in further detail in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 Clinical Experience  
A first p hase 1 clinical trial of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) in healthy male volunteers has been 
conducted as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial versus placebo and daily hGH 
(Omnitrope) investigating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD response in [ADDRESS_1136050] drug were detected when compared to placebo and the 
active comparator (Omnitrope).  The test product was well tolerated at up to 0.24 mg hGH/kg 
when injected once subcutaneously to [ADDRESS_1136051]- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136052] 2017  A second phase 1 single-dose trial investigated the safety and tolerability of TransCon hGH 
(ACP-001) a
t 2 different dose-levels, 0.30 mg hGH/kg and 0.36 mg hGH/kg, respectively, in 
24 male and female healthy subjects.  ACP-001 was well tolerated with no safety concerns.  
Detailed information is given in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
A phase 2 clinical trial in adult subjects with GHD was a randomized, open-label, 
active-c
ontrolled trial of 3 dose levels of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg

daily doses) over 4 weeks.  A total of 37 subjects were randomized.  The PK results showed that 
dose-linearity was observed for AUC and C max of hGH in 29 subjects.  TransCon hGH 
(A
CP-001) slowly released hGH in a sustained, controlled manner and thereby [CONTACT_819926], making it suitable for once-a-week dosing.  The PD  results showed 
that ACP

n-label, active-controlled, parallel-group trial of 3 doses of TransCon hGH 
(ACP-001; 0.14, 0.21 and 0.30 mg hGH

0.21 mg hGH/kg/week and 14 subjects in the 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week TransCon hGH cohorts and 
13 subjects in the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week Genotropin cohort).  Mean annualized HV among the 
3 dose levels administered weekly ranged from 11.9 cm for the 0.14 mg/kg/week dose to 
12.9 cm for the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose to 13.9 cm for the 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week dose, 
which were all comparable to 11.6 cm for the active comparator, daily injections of Genotropin 
at a 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose ( Figure 2) .

No reports of drug-related serious or unexpected AEs were observed.  AE s were generally mild 
and observed at the same level and nature compared between the 3 TransCon hGH cohorts and 
the Genotropin cohort.  Injection site reactions were generally mild and transient and were 
observed at a rate that was similar to the daily hGH control arm.  There were no observations of 
injection site nodule formation or lipoatrophy.  Low immunogenicity (a single subject with a low 
ti
ter) was consistent with published data for daily hGH .  This subject, treated with the lowest 
dose of TransCon hGH (0.14 mg hGH/kg/week), demonstrated an annualized HV of 19.0

TransCon hGH (ACP-011) was found to be bioequivalent to TransCon hGH (ACP-001) in a 
phase 1 single center, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, a nd

pa
rameters of ACP-011 and ACP-001 at the 0.24 mg hGH/kg dose level. 
The ratios of the means for C max and AUC for both released hGH and IGF-1 fell within the 
bioequiva

 Summary of P otential Risks and Benefits 
TransCon hGH (ACP-011) is a new hGH prodrug product with a proposed once-weekly dosing 
regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience and suboptimal compliance of daily hGH 
injections and is anticipated to have a comparable safe ty and efficacy profile to currently 
a
pproved daily hGH products, while maintaining exposure (C max and AUC) in the optimal 
ther
apeutic range and biodistribution established by [CONTACT_819928].  Obviating the need for 
daily inje
ctions should increase compliance and therefore long-term efficacy, which would be of 
great bene
fit to pediatric patients with GHD ( European Union 2008).

interest.  Unless infor
med consent is withdrawn, any subject who discontinues treatment should 
be encoura
ged to remain in the trial and attend all subsequent clinic visits.  See  Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_1136080]’s participation in the trial ( eg, withdrawal of 
informed consent), the investigator should schedule an Early Termination Visit to collect data,

 follow-up data (if applicable), and to collect blood for laboratory evaluations.  
This visit should contain a
ll assessments from Visit 3 (Week 26), and should be documented in 
the eCRF
 together with the reason(s) for trial discontinuation.  In the case of treatment 
discontinuation for ca
uses other than withdrawal of informed consent, subjects should be urged 
to remain in the trial and a
ttend all subsequent trial visits.  An Early Termination Visit is not 
required for subjec
ts who remain in the trial after discontinuing study drug.  However, if the 
subject is not willing to attend all subsequent trial visits, this should be considered a withdrawal 
from the trial and an Early Termination Visit should be scheduled. 
Every effort should be made to observe subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_1136081]/parent/legal guardian via phone to arrange the 
appropriate follow-up assessment(s) for such subjects. 
 Subject Repl acement Criteria  
Subjects who terminate early are not expected to be replaced. 
9. T REATMENTS 
 Investigational Product  
TransCon hGH will be provided as a lyophilized powder in single-use glass vials.  The following 
materials for study dru
g reconstitution and administration will be provided to the investigational 
sites and distributed by [CONTACT_283590]/parent/legal guardian/caregiver: 
 P refilled syringes with 1 mL sWFI 
 Syringes for administration 
 Needles for reconstitution and administration  
TransCon hGH will
 be dispensed to subjects/parents/legal guardians in sufficient amounts to 
provide the subject with e
nough study drug until the next dispensing visit.

 Labeling  
All study drug will be labeled according to GMP and local requirements.  Subjects/parents/legal 
guardians will be provided with dosing and storage instructions.  Study drug labels will comply 
with regulatory requirements of each country and will be printed in the local language. 
 Treatment  Administered  
TransCon hGH will be provided as a lyophilized powder in single-use glass vials to be 
reconstituted with 1 mL sWFI.  Two concentrations will be available, the less concentrated for 
lighter weig
ht subjects, the more concentrated for higher weight subjects: 
 12.1 mg hGH/vial (11.0 mg hGH/mL when reconstituted) 
 24.2 mg  hGH/vial (22.0 mg hGH/mL when reconstituted) 
Table 1  shows the weight ranges and corresponding drug concentration and volume to be 
administered to all subjects, regardless of weight, with an average dose of 0.24 ± 0.02 mg 
hGH/kg/week.  If the concentration suggested in the preferred dosing column is unavailable, 
alternati
ve dosing should be followed.  It is imperative that investigators do not  calculate a 
weight-based dose but rather follow the chart and administer the exact volume (based on weight) 
of the given concentration as indicated. 
TransCon hGH will be injected SC into the left and right buttock, left and right thigh, and left 
and right abdomen b
y the subject/parent/legal guardian/caregiver except at Visit [ADDRESS_1136083] dose.  To minimize local side effects, it is recommended to rotate 
the 6 injection sites in a subsequent manner (eg, right thigh, right abdomen, right buttock, left 
thi
gh, left abdomen, le
ft buttock).

The reason for administering the exact volume as per Table 1 (rather than calculating the exact 
dose) is as follows.  At the conclusion of this 26-week trial, if eligible, subjects may choose to 
enter the extension trial, CT-301EXT, during which TransCon hGH will initially be administered 
by [CONTACT_819931].  When the auto-injector, a unique device developed specifically for the 
administration of TransCon hGH, becomes available, subjects will be switched from the 
administration of TransCon hGH by [CONTACT_819932]-injector. 
With the auto-injector, TransCon hGH will be provided in single-use dual chamber cartridges 
(DCCs).  Multiple DCC presentations will be available containing 20% incremental increases in 
dose to support increasing weight ranges.  Thus, each DCC will contain a specific quantity of 
TransCon hGH to support a specific weight range consistent with Table 1.  The intention within 
thi
s trial is to mimic dose increments that will eventually be administered via the auto-injector in 
the CT-301EXT (extension) Trial. 
Additionally, dosing based on volumes for weight ranges with 20% bracketing assures that all 
subjects will rec
eive an average of 0.24 mg/kg/week over the course of the trial.

 Selection of Trial Doses  
TransCon hGH is an inactive prodrug.  The phase 2 pediatric GHD trial with TransCon hGH 
demonstrated tha
t a dose of 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week provided similar hGH exposure, efficacy 
(annualized HV),  and safety/tolerability compared to the equivalent weekly dose of Genotropin, 
with PD demonstrating normalization of IGF-1 SDS.  This trial also demonstrated comparable 
tolerability
 and safety and numerically greater annual HV with a 0.30 mg/kg/week dose of 
TransCon hGH.  Treatment guidelines support initiation of hGH at a dose of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week 
(Grimberg 2016 ) .  The TransCon hGH 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week dose is currently 
be
ing studied in t
he phase 3 heiGHt Trial.  To align the starting dose across the TransCon hGH 
program, the same dos
e has been chosen for the current trial.  Given non-compliance rates on 
daily hGH dose
s versus the expected increased compliance in this trial, even subjects entering on 
0.30 mg hGH/kg/week will likely do well on the lower TransCon hGH dose.  Importantly, 
I
GF-1 levels, along with other safety parameters discussed in  Section 9.6, will be measured at

The investigator (with Medical Monitor pre-approval) or Medical Monitor (and, if needed, with 
the 
IS
C review) may stop or reduce the dose of study drug for an individual subject at any time 
during
 the trial in the presence of the following symptoms and laboratory abnormalities: 
 S
evere hGH -related AEs at any time during the trial (eg, peripheral edema, severe headache, 
intracranial hypertension or other adverse drug reaction and/or abnormal laboratory values)  
 Pregnancy  
Subjects who are sexually active must use an effective form of contraception  
 I GF-1 > +2.0 SDS measured at Visit 2 (or the C max Visit, as applicable) should be confirmed

c
onsultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Any re-establishment of the original dose (0.24 mg hGH/kg/week) due to a subsequent 
sub-optimal IGF-1 response should receive prior approval by [CONTACT_1689].  
 S ubstantially reduced IGF-1 and growth response or evidence of a hypersensitivity to 
TransCon hGH  
 Evidence of clinically significant pre-diabetes or diabetes (HbA1c > 6.2% measured at 
Visit 2 and an absolute increase of 0.5 % from Screening HbA1c) should be confirmed by a 
second measurement at an unscheduled visit.  If the repeat values are the same or higher, the 
Tr
ansCon hGH dose may be decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 20% to the next lower weight 
bracket.*  If appropriate follow-up monitoring shows progressively worsening glucose 
int

 Drug Accountability  
Trial s ite staff will be supplied with the study drug and ancillary supplies to distribute as required 
to sub
jects/parents/legal guardians.  Dedicated site staff will be responsible for study drug and 
associated procedures, as well as ancillary supplies, exercising accepted medical and 
pharmaceuti
cal practices.  Study drug and ancillary supplies must be kept in an appropriate, 
secure area at the trial site and stored according to conditions specified on the product labels.  
The trial will use an Internet-based interactive web response system (IWRS) to capture drug 
inventory and a
ccountability data, including receipt of drug inventory and supplies by [CONTACT_779], 
dist
ribution to subjects, return to the site from subjects, and return to the Sponsor (or destruction 
with the Sponsor’s approva
l).  Each study drug delivery to the site must be confirmed, including 
da
te, quantity
, and batch/pack number.  Each drug dispensed by [CONTACT_373605] a subject must include 
date and amount of dru
g dispensed.  Each drug return ed to the site by a subject must include date 
a
nd amount of unused drug returned. 
The computer sy
stem complies with all applicable regulatory requirements for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_373565] (21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP ) as do paper systems.  
The IWRS will be the only drug accountability documentation by [CONTACT_50330]. Clinical 
investigators will not be expected to maintain paper source documentation of drug inventory, 
dispensing, and acc
ountability. 
The system is designed so that changes to any record do not obscure the original information.  
The audit record will clearly indicate that a change was made and clearly provide a means to 
locate and read the prior information.  All changes to the data have an electronic audit trail in 
accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  Electronic signatures will be used in accordance with [ADDRESS_1136091]- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136092] 2017  IMPORTANT: Under no circumstances will the investigator allow study drugs to be used other 
than as direc
ted by [CONTACT_3181]. 
 Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on drug accountability and review of the subject 
diary.  Subjects/parents/legal guardians will be instructed to return all empty study drug vials at

Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136128] 2017  The original 14 -item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) 
Version 1.4 is a reliable and valid instrument to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, 
providing scores in four domains – Side Effects, Effectiveness, Convenience and Overall 
Satisfaction.  In naturalistic studies, administering the TSQM with the Side Effects domain could 
provoke the physician to assess the presence or absence of adverse events in a way that is 
clinically atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], carrying the potential to interfere with routine medical care.  As a result, an 
abbreviated 9 -item TSQM (TSQM -9), derived from the TSQM Version 1.4 but without the Side 
Effects domain was created  (Bharmal 2009) .  This  measure is being adapted fur ther for this trial  
with the removal of the  Effectiveness domain since effectiveness of hGH is not subjective and 
will
 be assessed with objective measures in this and other trials evaluating TransCon hGH.  
Thus, only Convenience  & Overall Satisfaction domains (C&OS ) of the TSQM will be used.  
Only the parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the C&OS  of the TSQM -9, thus  it has 
been identified for this trial as the C&OS  – Parent  (C&OS -P). 
At Week 6, immediately prior to the 6th dose of study drug, the C&OS will be completed within 
the Subject Diary. At a
pproximately Week 13, the C&OS will be completed at Visit 2.

everity, Causality, and Outcome Assessment 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Severity Rating 
The following guideline must be used by [CONTACT_221464]: 
Mild  – The subject is aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it easily.  The event is of 
little concern to the subject and/or of little or no clinical significance.  The event is not 
e
xpected to have any effect on the subject’s health or well-being.  The event may or may no t 
require medical intervention. 
Moderate  – The event causes the subject enough discomfort for it to cause interference with 
or c
hange some of the subject’s usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject 
and poses some risk to the subject’s health or well-being.  The event may require medical 
int
ervention. 
Severe  – The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in many or all usual 
a
ctivities.  The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the 
subject’s health or well-being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or 
close follow-up.

15. T RIAL CONDUCT 
 Site Initiation  
Prior to participation, investigational sites and investigators will be evaluated for appropriate 
qualifications and ability to execute the trial.  Each investigational site must undergo appropriate 
tra
ining on the trial protocol and ancillary trial procedures and documents through participation 
in 
a Site Initiation Visit (SIV) or Investigator Meeting (IM).  Protocol and GCP training must 
take
 place before any subjects are enrolled at a site.  SIVs and IMs will include,  but may not be 
limited to, study drug preparation and administration procedures, data collection requirements, 
a
nd subject eligibility requirements. 
 Screen Failures  
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria at any point prior to administration of first study 
drug dose are defined as Screening Failures.  The reason(s ) for  each Screening Failure will be 
recorded in the eCRF.

Procedures for maintenance of Screening and Enrollment Logs are discussed in the trial manual. 
 Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.4.[ADDRESS_1136158] numbers (or other personal identifiers). 
The trial will use an Internet-based remote data entry system to collect clinical trial data at the 
investigational sites.  The system complies with 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP.  The system 
will
 be used to enter, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit data.  The system is 
c
onfigured based on the requirements from the Sponsor.  Source documents are to be retained to 
e
nable a reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source documents include the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221408].  Data will be recorded in the trial worksheets as 
a
ppropriate to complete and/or clarify the source data. 
The design of the computerized system complies with all the applicable regulatory requirements 
for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13592] (21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP) to 
the same degree of confidence as is provided with paper systems.  Clinical investigators must 
re
tain either the original or a certified copy of all source documents sent to the Sponsor or its 
representatives, including query resolution correspondence.  The system is designed so that 
chang
es to any record do not obscure the original information.  The audit record clearly indicates 
that a change was made and clearly provides a means to locate and read the prior information.  
All changes to the data have an electronic audit trail, in accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  
Electronic signatures will be used in conformance with [ADDRESS_1136159], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. 
Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).

 Data Quality Control  
15.5.1 Monitoring Procedures 
The
 Sponsor and/or its representative may make periodic visits to the investigational site to 
assess compliance with trial procedures and regulatory requirements; to ensure that the safety, 
welfare, and privacy of subjects are being protected; and to verify the accuracy and integrity of 
the trial data.  In addition, independent Quality Assurance site audits may be conducted as 
ve
rification of the quality and compliance of trial conduct. 
The Sponsor and/or its representative will periodically review the trial data to ensure that data 
are being appropriately collected and reported.  Queries and corrections will be made as needed. 
15.5.[ADDRESS_1136163] Research Organization ( CRO )’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).  A 
c
omprehensive data management plan (DMP) will be developed including a data management 
overview, description of database contents, annotated e CRF s, user acceptance testing procedures, 
que
ry contacts, and consistency checks. 
Trial site personnel will be responsible for providing resolutions to all data queries.  The 
investi
gator will be required to document electronic data review to ensure the accuracy of the 
corrected a
nd/or clarified data.  Procedures for soliciting and documenting resolution to data 
queries are described in the trial manual. 
 Auditing  Proced ures 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a GCP Quality Assurance audit may be 
ini
tiated by [CONTACT_1034].  The investigator has to ensure that subjects/parents/legal guardians are 
aware of and consent to personal information being reviewed during the data verification process 
a
s a part of monitoring/auditing/inspection by [CONTACT_1034], properly authorized agents of the 
S
ponsor, or competent authorities.  In addition, participation and personal information is treated 
a
s strictly confidential to the extent that applicable law permits and to which it is not publicly 
availa
ble.  The purpose of audits and inspections is to evaluate compliance with the principles of 
GCP, international and local regulatory requirements, and the trial protocol.  The audit or 
inspec
tion may include, for example, a review of all source documents, drug records, original 
clinic medical notes, and some or all of the facilities used in the trial. 
The audits may be conducted by [CONTACT_13679]’s selected agent in accordance with 
Sponsor’s SOP or SOPs of the selected and properly authorized agent.  A competent authority 
may also wish to conduct an inspection during the trial or after its completion.  If an inspection is 
re
quested by a competent authority, the investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately that 
TransCon hGH CT- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page [ADDRESS_1136164] has been made.  The investigator and his/her institution will permit all monitoring, 
audits, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data. 
 Laboratory Quality Standards  
Laboratory tests or evaluations described in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with 
quality laboratory standards as described in the SOPs of the central laboratories.  Some blood 
samples may be used for laboratory test validation.  
The
 laboratories will provide a list of reference ranges for applicable analyses before trial start.  
These will be held in the investigator site file and the trial master file.  The methods employed 
for each assay should be available on request.  Any change in the laboratory procedures, 
re
ference values, etc., during the trial must promptly be communicated to the Sponsor.  The 
labor
atories may also be audited by [CONTACT_373620]. 
 Trial Termination or Completion  
The investigator should notify the IRB/HREC/IEC in writing of the completion or early 
ter
mination of the trial.  Upon trial completion or termination, applicable regulatory reporting 
re
quirements will be foll
owed.  The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trial at any time 
for
 any reason. 
 Changes to the Protocol  
Changes in any portion of this protocol must be documented in the form of an amendment from 
the Sponsor and must be approved by [CONTACT_2727]’s IRB/HREC/IEC and regulatory 
authorities, as required, before the amendment is implemented.  However, in the event of 
apparent imm
ediate hazard to a subject, a deviation from the protocol is allowed to eliminate the 
hazard.  In this case, the deviation and the reason for it must be submitted for approval as 
required by [CONTACT_13681]/HREC/IEC and regulatory authorities, 
a
long with a proposed protocol amendment if appropriate. 
Protocol amendments may only be made with prior written approval of the Sponsor and/or its 
representative and documented approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_13594]/HREC/IEC, as required.  The investigator must send a copy of the 
documente
d approval to the Sponsor and/or its representative.
